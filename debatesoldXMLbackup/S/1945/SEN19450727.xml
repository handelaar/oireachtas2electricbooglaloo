      <P>When I moved the adjournment of the debate last night, I was dealing with the speech which Dr. Moorhead delivered at the Mansion House meeting, which is part of this campaign, the beginning of the protest committee which is to conduct propaganda on behalf of the demand for the publication of the evidence given at the inquiry, or the reinstatement of the board.  The point in Dr. Moorhead's speech to which I was directing attention is that, while he admires the Constitution, he is appalled by what has happened in the Ministerial suppression of the board, he, too, knowing nothing about the laws enacted in this Parliament in virtue of which the Ministerial action was taken.  In the course of his speech he said: &ldquo;It is the kind of thing we <Col N="646" /> would cry out against if it were done, in fact, by Fascist Italy or Nazi Germany,&rdquo; and then he turned away to demand the production of the report of the inspector.  That, of course, was the watchword for the stage army on the platform of the Mansion House meeting.  They all demanded that the sham inquiry should be exposed in all its hideousness by the production of the inspector's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having heard the speech of Senator Kingsmill Moore, we can guess very well the source of the inspiration. Lord Palmerston once is reported to have said to his Ministers: &ldquo;It does not matter what we say so long as we all say the same thing&rdquo;, and the members recruited for this stage army all agreed to say the same thing: &ldquo;The sham inquiry is intended to report as preordained by the lawless Parliamentary Secretary for Health; why does he not produce the report of his inspector? Well, we can all make a guess&rdquo;&mdash;we all know well theirs is a guess, and yet these people talk about &ldquo;reckless, inconsiderate statements and action,&rdquo; all founded upon a distortion of the evidence&mdash;&ldquo;we all know well that, in the last few weeks he would have been only too delighted to produce the report if it backed up his action; if he does not produce it the public will continue, as they are doing, to draw their own conclusions.&rdquo;  In other words, the purpose of this Mansion House meeting, and the further propaganda that it is to father, is that the Minister, or his Parliamentary Secretary, refuses to publish the report, and continue to refuse to publish it, and the public is provided with the explanation that they dare not. Now when a man of such standing as the President of the Medical Council of Ireland can be persuaded to talk like that, it shows how dangerous this propaganda can become.  All, or at any rate most of us, know about the famous dancing mania that broke out in Germany in the 14th century.  The infection spread, for hysteria, remember, is an infectious disease and the Cork Street Fever Hospital functions for the cure of all infectious diseases. This infection spread through the leading cities of Germany and the delirium <Col N="647" /> and the mad antics of the people were beyond all believing.  They seized religious houses.  Some of them dashed their brains out against the walls.  That is not likely to happen in the case of these propagandists, but who knows? The Church tried to meet the obsession by exorcism but a great physician, Paracelsus, advised a cure&mdash;cold water.  The cold water of truth in this case will be the cure for the Cork Street fever, which has been generated by the hysteria of which we saw some displays in the speech of our colleague last night.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask, is that a promise that the report is going to be published and that we are going to have the truth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is a promise that the truth will be given.  I began by reading last night the statement that the minute of evidence will be published and it will be procurable. I daresay every member of the House will get it for nothing, but in any case they will not be deterred by the charge of 2/6 from procuring it.  Senator Kingsmill Moore's interjection is merely a repetition of what he knows himself to be the sophism that the report of the inspector is the principal item&mdash;I will deal with that presently &mdash;that it is the cardinal thing in the investigation. I quoted him a greater authority than he in law that that is not so.  If I may turn aside from my argument to deal with his interjection momentarily, he has assured us that there is no legal obligation on the Minister to publish it.  If there is no legal obligation on the Minister, what dereliction of duty is there on the part of the Minister in keeping it a confidential document, a document meant for his information and not for public circulation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This hysteria is exhibited in its worst form by Mr. Wood, senior counsel.  I mentioned him incidentally in connection with the Mansion House before, but it was to exemplify how successful this propaganda can be in speaking with two voices, one the respectable and gentlemanly voice and the other the voice of the hysterical, obsessed, <Col N="648" /> patient, Mr. Wood.  &ldquo;I believe that this Minister,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;has deliberately distorted the facts.  I believe that he has indulged in a sham trial. I stand or fall by the inspector's report.&rdquo;  I pointed out that Senator Kingsmill Moore exonerates the Minister from all culpability.  He looks upon him as a man deceived by a subordinate, but in the Mansion House, addressing an overflow meeting, well organised, with its platform all bound to repeat the same cry: &ldquo;Give us the report,&rdquo; there is a different voice; there is this direct accusation.  Senator Kingsmill Moore, within the recollection of the House, made his charge against the Parliamentary Secretary for Public Health.  It was the Parliamentary Secretary whom he inveighed against so vehemently.  But here is the direct accusation of the Minister &mdash;&ldquo;The Minister has deliberately distorted the facts.  I believe that he has indulged in a sham trial.  I stand or fall by the inspector's report.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would have expected that Mr. Overend would have been reported in the <i>Irish Times.</i>  The only reference to him is that he appears in a photograph depicting him speaking into a microphone, but nothing comes out in the columns of the paper, so I do not know how he performed his little part in the play and how he rang the changes on &ldquo;sham inquiry&rdquo; and &ldquo;give us the report&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have Mr. Alfred Byrne, T.D., of course, who has his part in the accusation&mdash;it reminds one of the description of the assassination of Julius Cæsar wherein the smallest of the conspirators has his dagger through the toga of Caesar.  He says: &ldquo;I think those in power want to get complete control by fair means or foul means and the other boards should take warning from what has been done to this particular board.&rdquo;  The hysteria is to be spread to other hospitals and they are to join the dancing crowds of fanatics and behave with delirium like the platform orators.</P>
    <P>We reach the very limit in the deliverances of a man who has figured before in the debates of this House, Mr. Seán Ó Faolain.  He said: &ldquo;The people have been brought to an unusual pitch of excitement as a result <Col N="649" /> of the manner in which the board have been treated.&rdquo;  Apparently, he thinks that the culmination of the excitement has not been reached and in that he agrees with Senator Kingsmill Moore, who is going to write another pamphlet and renew the indictment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, Senator Magennis has just specifically made a charge that Senator Kingsmill Moore wrote a pamphlet.  I think he should withdraw that unless he can prove it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>No, sir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, sir, on a point of fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>My words were: &ldquo;Senator Kingsmill Moore is going to write another pamphlet.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that can only be capable of one interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I quoted repeatedly from the pamphlet yesterday called <i>Justice</i>, and Senator Kingsmill Moore, I take it, was following up that pamphlet.  I never suggested that he had written that pamphlet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's mishearing of me yesterday made him think I had said &ldquo;his&rdquo; pamphlet and he rose up to correct me.  I see Senator Sweetman bears me out on that.  However, if Senator Sweetman can improve on my statement, I will accept it and say that Senator Kingsmill Moore threatens or promises to write a pamphlet, in addition to the pamphlet from which I have quoted already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. It is being printed now, but I have not got the proofs yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>This tit-bit has been held back unnecessarily from the House:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;What the Minister was doing, in fact, was expropriating a hospital <Col N="650" /> just as effectively as if he had sent a squad of soldiers down to Guinness's Brewery and took it over.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Only a writer of short stories and romances could have exercised his imagination so freely and, I might add, so frantically.  The man who said that has no sense of responsibility and no sense of facts.  These words &ldquo;expropriating a hospital&rdquo; are an echo of passages in the pamphlet <i>Justice</i> and we have heard Senator Kingsmill Moore directly on it.  These seven who got, under the Act of 1936, a special college of electors provided for them, have still the idea that the Cork Street Fever Hospital is their property rightfully and that, in some way, it has been confiscated.  It is clear that they have still that idea.  I propose to show, from the evidence quoted in the White Paper, that that is the source of a great deal of the friction and the discord which has occurred ever since the new board began to function in 1937.</P>
    <P>Why was the hospital taken over? Because, as that pamphlet truthfully records, the demands on it had grown so great that the buildings, amongst other things, proved unequal to deal with the task with which they were founded to deal.  Their funds had run short, too, as was explained by the Senator, through the action of the Sweepstakes.  They, fortunately, cannot accuse our Government of having stared the Sweepstakes and legalised betting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, betting was legalised by our Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, then, my memory of old days has faded out.  I remember in the Dáil inveighing against the attempt to legalise betting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>But it was our Government did it.  I was against it, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I was reciting the history previous to the introduction of the Cork Street Fever Hospital Act.  The charity had, notwithstanding its gallant effort, proved insufficient for the needs.  The city and <Col N="651" /> county of Dublin utilising it had been making contributions and they are making contributions ever since the widening of control.  They pay for their service.  I see that the estimate for 1945-46 for the contribution is something like £45,000.  I am not quite sure of the exact figure, but it is over £40,000.  They speak of &ldquo;transferring all their possessions.&rdquo;  Senator Kingsmill Moore has described the buildings as like the state of an aged body for which the informing spirit is too great.  The fact is that it was necessary&mdash;desirable, at any rate&mdash;to have fever cases and infectious cases not spread over a number of hospitals, but with centralised treatment.  Therefore, the action of the Government in 1936 was not an act of confiscation.  There was no predatory purpose whatever in the Act and that ought to be clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of fact, I do not think I ever said or even suggested that that was so.  If I did, I certainly did not mean to do so.  I did not say it was an act of confiscation or a predatory act.  It was a voluntary act agreed to by the old trustees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Kingsmill Moore must share the odium of his associates in the stage army.  I quoted from this speech of Seán Ó Faoláin.  He says it is equivalent to sending a squad of soldiers to Guinness's Brewery and expropriating the brewery.  If Senator Kingsmill Moore wishes to disown Mr. Ó Faoláin, one of his orators in the Mansion House campaign, then I am truly gratified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that it was a dishonest decision to abolish the board whose property the hospital was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question-begging epithet.  Senator Kingsmill Moore cannot expect the thinking public, the public with a sense of moderation and justice, to take his <i>ipse dixit</i> as against that of the Minister, who has read the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="652" />
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I rather think they will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator hopes they will.  That is exactly what I am accusing him of, of being the High Priest of this propaganda, of being the chief agent in spreading the hysteria. Of course, he hopes to discredit the Government.  So do they all.  I do not know why that should excite amusement in Senator Sweetman, but apparently it does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, some of them happened to be supporters of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>There are all sorts and conditions on the board but there was no supporter of the Government on the Mansion House platform. There were foolish men who went there to support the Government, and they were promptly squelched.  The chairman of that meeting is the Chief Whip of the Fine Gael Party in the Dáil.  That is the only &ldquo;supporter&rdquo; of the Government that I could detect, and he supported it by his opposition.  These expectations of the Senator, that the public will be excited by the declamation of a frenzied clique, instead of relying upon the evidence, are rather, I think, too much of egotism.  &ldquo;Athanasius against the world&rdquo; is the only parallel I know of to Senator Kingsmill Moore and Mr. Alfred Byrne against the evidence.  I do not know what is in the report, neither does the Senator, and neither does any of them, but they are quite confident about what it will reveal.  It is the old story of the Spanish Chest, the fraud perpetrated some years ago about uncountable wealth being stored in it and people fooled into making contributions to buy it, and when the chest was, by order of the court, opened, it was found to be empty.  All said was to blacken the procedure of a dictatorial Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notice the consilience here again between the Senator's henchmen who spoke at the Mansion House meeting and this brochure.  This is a clever <Col N="653" /> device; it has been used, I must say, very cleverly.  Dr. Moorhead said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the Dáil the Taoiseach had stated that he was not a dictator.</P>
    <P>A Voice: Moryah!</P>
    <P>Dr. Moorhead: I think that what Mr. de Valera said is true.  He is very fair and very just and not reckless; but I think that a good many of his subordinates are very different.  Amongst other things I hope this meeting will do to-night is to put a check to the dictatorial Government that has swept over the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amateur in politics, by the way, regards all the Emergency Orders under the Emergency Powers Act as dictatorial and a cause of discredit to Ministers.  This is a favourite dodge. Sometimes Mr. de Valera is painted as a white plaster saint&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a dodge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator would let me finish the sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>He is painted as a white plaster saint.  Oh, if we could only free him from his villainous associates, the Ministers.  They practise all sorts of villainies without his knowledge.  Let us bring it to his knowledge and all will be redeemed. What about the Constitution about which Dr. Moorhead declared himself so proud: &ldquo;I am as a citizen proud of our Constitution.&rdquo;  What about the doctrine of collective responsibility? What a Minister does the Taoiseach does when what a Minister does is impeached or impugned.  They know that very well.  It is a dodge.  Unfortunately Senator Sweetman is not listening to my explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do my best to convey it to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a dodge to make it appear that there is an incompetent Government in office, that the Taoiseach who is head of the Executive Council does not know what is going on, and that Ministers are irregularly <Col N="654" /> acting under the aegis of the Taoiseach emboldened by the conspicuous innocence of their chief.  That will not pass muster.  These people say they are proud of the Constitution, but they are ignorant of a principal item in it.  Senator Kingsmill Moore and Mr. Wood are brothers at the Bar, being senior counsel, and we would expect them to know a little bit more of law than the ordinary man in the street.</P>
      <P>Senator Kingsmill Moore demanded production of the report.  Notice his comment: &ldquo;You may take it from me&rdquo;.  We are not taking it from him.  At least, I am not taking it from him.  I am taking it from the House of Lords, which, next to the Privy Council, is the highest authority with regard to statutes, legal arrangements and all that sort of thing.  We took over all that legal system.  What is the law with regard to Ministers and Inquiries?  With the permission of the House I shall read it, because Senator Kingsmill Moore only read the obligation to behave decently and justly.  I think when he was so eloquent upon the selecting of evidence while suppressing the remainder, that when he did profess to quote from these judgments in the House of Lords, he should have given the parts upon which this atrocious Secretary of Health relies. This is from a great Attorney-General who is reputed to be one of the greatest lawyers that England ever had, the present Lord Chancellor, who was then Sir John Simon, Attorney-General.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The holding of local inquiries by the Local Government Board is directed by many statutes and it has always been the practice of the Board to treat the reports of their inspectors on such inquiries as confidential documents for their own use&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet, the Mansion House audience was told that the Government could not shelter behind its being a confidential document, that it was an <i>ad hoc</i> invention of this Parliamentary Secretary, one of the many things that he invented to cover his own offence of unjustly suspending the board.  There it is declared by Sir John Simon as the <Col N="655" /> law regulating the relation between an inspector conducting an inquiry and the Minister to whom he reports. There is an old maxim, centuries old, but its authority is no wise lessened by its age, &ldquo;<i>Qui nimis probat nihil probat</i>&rdquo;, Who proves too much proves nothing.</P>
    <P>The Senator appealed to the psychology of the situation: the inspector saw the witnesses, saw the tremors of their bodies, the facial expressions, all the outward and visible signs of their mental state and so on, acted like the lie-detecting machines we have become so familiar with; that he is the most competent person to arrive at a judgment on the evidence that he procured and because of that we must have the report.</P>
    <P>Mr. Wood, if I may come back to him again, though I really think he was drunk with animosity when he spoke and was so carried away by his hatred of Fianna Fáil that he was not quite responsible for what he said, also stated, and it is made a headnote of by the acting editor of the <i>Irish Times:</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have been appalled by the Minister's cynical disregard for what seems to me to be the elementary principle on which justice is founded&mdash;an elementary principle of justice that you shall not be condemned by a tribunal by which you have not been heard.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was repeated to us in the debate last night.  There is no such principle with regard to the conduct of the statutory business of the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>Now I shall again read from the House of Lords' report which will show you the real position.  Lord Haldane said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister at the head of the board is directly responsible to Parliament like other Ministers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is not to the Mansion House, but to Parliament that he is responsible&mdash; that is not from Lord Haldane I need hardly explain.  I shall be accused later on of interpolating my own views into it.</P>
    <Col N="656" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Senator will not hesitate to do so, as it would be very interesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>But I cannot punctuate when I am speaking and the report can be misread accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a difficulty from which we all suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt.  I am sure the Senator is conscious of it.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister at the head of the board is directly responsible to Parliament like other Ministers. He is responsible not only for what he himself does but for all that is done in his Department.  The volume of work entrusted to him is very great and he cannot do the great bulk of it himself.  He is expected to obtain his materials vicariously through his officials, and he has discharged his duty if he sees that they obtain these materials for him properly.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Obtain these materials for him properly&rdquo;; that it is the function of the official whom he appoints to conduct an investigation, to inform the Minister in the discharge of the duties of his office.</P>
      <P>Now, my friend, Lord Shaw of Dunfermline, also stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To set up any rule that that decision must on demand, and as matter of right, be accompanied by a disclosure of what went before so that it may be weakened, or strengthened, or judged thereby, would be inconsistent with efficiency, with practice, and with the true theory of complete parliamentary responsibility for departmental decisions&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a counsel, of whom I am sure the Senator has heard before, once said in a Dublin court: &ldquo;My lord, if there is any case more than another case like my case then this case is that case.&rdquo; That fills the bill.  Senator Kingsmill Moore tried to make it appear that the judgment was purely a decision in regard to a single person in his letter to the <i>Irish Times</i> published on the 24th July.  But this is in the judgment <Col N="657" /> of Lord Shaw, one of those great Scottish lawyers to whom everyone, no matter what his national or political prejudices may be, looks to with profound respect:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To set up any rule that that decision must on demand, and as a matter of right, be accompanied by a disclosure of what went before, so that it may be weakened or strengthened or judged thereby, would be inconsistent, as I say, with efficiency, with practice and with the true theory of complete parliamentary responsibility for departmental action.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I will read that. The Senator will observe that it is not possible to read two things at the same time.  It is like Horace's principle that when two men ride the same horse one must ride behind.  &ldquo;To set up any rule that that decision must on demand.&rdquo;  Now the Senator demanded it.  While he admitted that there was no legal duty to publish it, that is to say that it is a confidential document for the information of the Minister, and speaks, of course, I need hardly add, truthfully, he &ldquo;demands&rdquo; the publication of the report.  What is a demand?  A demand is not a request. It is a thousand miles away.  A demand, as he knows, especially in its legal understanding, is peremptory: he claims that it must be divulged. Now, here is what Lord Shaw says on that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I incline to hold that the disadvantage in very many cases would exceed the advantage of such disclosures&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the passage which the Senator, in his letter to the <i>Irish Times,</i> says &ldquo;by implication declares that it might be disclosed.&rdquo;  But I quote the Senator himself: &ldquo;Who is denying that?  It need not be disclosed.  There is no rule of law to prevent the Secretary from disclosing it.&rdquo;  Undoubtedly, by implication, as Lord Shaw says, there might be and there have been occasions <Col N="658" /> on which disclosure might be made, but he says that it would be contrary to public policy&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">

      <P>No&mdash;contrary to public policy to make it an inevitable rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>To make it an inevitable rule.  Yes, that is so.  And when a Mansion House meeting has been called and crowds of citizens come there&mdash;some out of curiosity and some to have warmth and comfortable seats and electric light for the rest of the evening&mdash;speakers take advantage of that opportunity to work off something that they have against the Government, and when they make demands somewhat along the lines advocated by the partisan advocate, then the rule must give way.</P>
      <P>The Senator says that there is nothing against the publication of the report.  I suggest that there is.  It is a confidential document. It is expressly spoken of, here in what I have read out, as a confidential document, and need not be disclosed unless the advantages to be derived from ignoring the fact that it is confidential and divulging its content should warrant it.  But what of the damage that might be done?  Will there ever again be an inspector who will make a frank report, who will write explicitly and fully the impressions he formed of various witnesses? Will it ever again be the case that a prudent inspector, careful of his own interests, which he is perfectly entitled to consider in the matter, will make a frank, candid and full report?  A hotheaded person might conceivably be in office and, regardless of the personal discomfort or various other disadvantages accruing to the inspector, might read out what the inspector had written believing that he was writing in full official confidence.  I say that what Sir John Simon has said is to be pondered.  There has been also a decision of Lord Moulton and of Lord Parmoor.  Lord Parmoor says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The only word in the statute on which a claim to see the report can be based is the word &lsquo;public&rsquo; prefixed to &lsquo;local inquiry&rsquo;.  This word is said to have been used for the first <Col N="659" /> time in the 1909 Act.  In my opinion a public local inquiry means no more than that an inquiry should be held in the locality and be open to the public.  It was well known in 1909 that the Local Government Board did not in ordinary cases publish the reports of inspectors before whom local inquiries were held.  Unless an opposite intention is declared or can be inferred, a statutory form of procedure should be construed so as to conform with prevailing practice&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is the full connotation of &ldquo;public inquiry&rdquo;.  It should be an inquiry held in the locality and open to the public, and Sir John Simon has said that the prevailing practice is to keep the confidential document confidential. There is a whole array of authorities here against publishing a report, and the only case for publishing a report is this&mdash;this is a quotation &mdash;&ldquo;We believe and we are confident that it should be published, and we stand or fall by it&rdquo;.  But because this slight body of presumptuous people undertake, by some process of divination, to say what the inspector's report contains then the &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; must disappear from the report and it must be published, to be interpreted as each one pleases&mdash;except the Secretary for Health.</P>
    <P>It was meant originally for the information of the Minister or, in this case, the Parliamentary Secretary, I repeat, and it is his statutory duty to act as his judgment will determine.  There is no statutory duty whatever on the Minister to accept all an inspector reports.  Suppose the inspector did&mdash; I do not know whether they have ever done it&mdash;in this case behave, to quote the description by the Senator, &ldquo;in a quasi-judicial character&rdquo;, how is the Minister or his Secretary bound by that?  There is a great deal of loose thinking, apart from loose speech, and a good deal of irresponsibility, on this matter.  With the exception of Dr. Moorhead, I say that there is not a single responsible speaker reported by a newspaper, not a single man with a sense of responsibility.  As the Americans say, there are people who sling ink, and in this case they <Col N="660" /> slung words without any sense of responsibility, while thousands of decent citizens are left under the impression that there must be something wrong or, to quote the old fallacy, that there can be no smoke without fire.</P>
    <P>Now, I proceed to another point in my argument.  I am sick of this: &ldquo;Let us have the report.  It was a sham inquiry.&rdquo;  That cry was repeated here again and again.  That is to say, it was a sham in this sense: not that the inspector did not do his part well&mdash;we have the testimony that he did&mdash;but that he was an innocent tool and that, unfortunately&mdash;according to this arbitrary contention&mdash;he reported the wrong way.  I think that is the case made by our friend: that he was intended by the secretary to find that A was B, and the expectation was not fulfilled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir, that is not quite my charge.  My charge is this: that the Minister had determined to abolish this board whatever the evidence was; that he appointed an inspector in whom everybody had trust in order that it might be assumed that he was following the advice of a competent man when he so did it.  I charge that he had determined to abolish this board, whatever the evidence and whatever the report of the inspector and that he did so.  That is why a man of such eminence, competence and partiality was chosen&mdash;to cover the predetermined decision of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary had made up his mind before he instituted the inquiry? Why then did he not do it before that? Could not he have done it in 1936, when the Act was being passed?  Could not he have removed every one of the board who inherited &ldquo;high traditions&rdquo;? But he did not.  We are asked to believe a great deal on the authority of the <i>ipse dixit.</i>  I have the greatest respect and regard for the Senator but I am not prepared to follow him to such lengths as he requires.  The Minister, he says, had made up his mind to abolish the board. This is Deputy Alfred Byrne again: <Col N="661" />&ldquo;The Government are resolved, by fair means or foul, to get absolute control over the hospitals.&rdquo;  There is no proof whatever that the Secretary was determined to get rid of the hospital board or that he chose an excellent inspector for that reason. See the difficulty of administration in the presence of such criticism as this. If a Minister appoints an inspector of the highest standing, a man whose credit stands high with everyone, then his appointment is intended to cover a malign purpose.  If he appoints an incompetent man or a partisan, then he appoints a tool to carry out his malign purpose.  They have it either way.  It will be impossible to carry on administration in this country if that is the sort of criticism which is to come from persons of high standing.</P>
      <P>I want to touch on a couple of other matters in the evidence quoted in the White Paper.  There are many things with which I should like to deal, but I have been kept so long dealing with this legal argument that I feel that the tedium must be insupportable to the House.  I suggest that the weakness of the majority, of the representatives of the people on the board&mdash;and I mean by the board, the board set up in 1936&mdash;was disharmony, the utter want of ability to co-operate in the discharge of a common duty.  Why?  The seven representatives of the trust who, as I say, were provided with a special college of electors by the Act of 1936, had, when they took office, along with them, as colleagues, popular representatives and what the Senator called the &ldquo;imbecility of three Government nominees&rdquo;.  There was from the first a feeling of superiority, a feeling of being confronted with interlopers in the guise of colleagues.  It was a natural feeling, I admit.  On the other hand, the popular representatives were not, perhaps, chosen for their diplomacy.  They were very frank and outspoken.  The board appears from the testimony of the Senator and the testimony quoted here to have been frequently a bear-garden. On occasions, it had to suspend its meetings.  Am I not right in that?</P>

      <P>I do not want to take any unfair advantage of the Senator.  It would appear that the Senior Wrangler in all these wrangles was the member, Mrs. McKean, and I should like to read to the House the evidence which the skilful cross-examination of Mr. Costello wrung from her.  The number of the question is 1914:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You did not offer any evidence of the difficulties of the board or the difficulties you had as a member of the board in carrying on the business here a few years before this inquiry was instituted?&mdash;That has nothing to do with this inquiry.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a sample of her peculiar attitude towards the inquiry at which she appears as a witness for the purpose of affording her assistance.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You heard Mr. O'Leary give evidence of the difficulties he had? &mdash;That he had?</P>
      <P>He told us of the difficulties he was having in connection with the bloc vote on the board and matters of that kind&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The bloc vote is what I am referring to when I say there were from the beginning parties formed.  The previous witness had, evidently, deposed to that.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;He [Mr. O'Leary] told us of the difficulties he was having in connection with the bloc vote on the board and matters of that kind?&mdash;I heard him.  I never saw any bloc voting. There was a bloc of votes on both sides.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that I have not read that distinctly and that I have not been heard&mdash;&ldquo;I never saw any bloc voting. There was a bloc of votes on both <Col N="663" /> sides.&rdquo;  She never saw any bloc but she saw a bloc of votes on both sides.  I once heard a man passing in the street say to his companion: &ldquo;The divil a one but two.&rdquo;  She saw no bloc but she saw two blocs.  She added: &ldquo;There was a bloc on more sides than one.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Do you say you never saw any signs of that?&mdash;It was on both sides.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>She is not going to give the credit to one side for having maintained a steady unity of purpose.  It was on both sides.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Would it be true to say that you yourself made a charge against a certain section of the board?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I interpret &ldquo; a certain section of the board&rdquo; as the seven élite.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Would it be true to say that you yourself made a charge against a certain section of the board that, for six years, you had to suffer vilification and abuse at the hands of certain members of the board?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Vilification and abuse at the hands&rdquo; is, of course, a slip.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Would that be true?&mdash;It would not.</P>
    <P>Did you ever write on the 13th November, 1942, a letter to Mr. O'Donovan in which you used these words?&mdash;Which words?</P>
    <P>Did you write this to him&mdash;&lsquo;We, appointed members by the Minister....&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I emphasise that.  Those were, apparently, the antagonists&mdash;the seven élite and the appointees of the Minister. That is my interpretation.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Did you write this to him: &lsquo;We, appointed members by the Minister, have had to endure almost six years' vilification and abuse at the hands of a bitter section of the board, mainly due to our efforts to curb expenditure and improve the administration of the hospital?&rsquo;&mdash; I did not think that was six years ago.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Evidently it was still a living memory; she could not believe that time had passed, so poignant was her present consciousness of it.  The next question was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="664" />&ldquo;You forgot that.  Do you accept that you wrote that?&mdash;I don't think that has anything to do with it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then Mr. Costello asked:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Do you accept that you wrote that letter?&mdash;Oh, yes.  And you forgot about it?&mdash;I did.</P>
    <P>Do you now want to change your evidence that you gave to the inspector, that you knew of no bloc voting or anything of that kind and that you had not to put up with this for six years?&mdash;I say that that has nothing to do with bloc voting.  I don't think it has anything to do with the last six years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>May I express my heartfelt sympathy with Mrs. McKean if, for some six years, she had to engage antagonists whose performance is of this order? But the revelation has come from an unwilling witness.  She wrote a letter, but she forgot she wrote the letter.  Mr. Costello, when Mr. Early, on a point of order, wanted to interpose, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am cross-examining the witness and she has admitted writing this. I am asking her about this particular sentence.  That letter was written by her.  (To witness): That letter is in your handwriting?&mdash;It is not in my handwriting.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then Mr. Costello went on to ask:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Do you agree that you wrote the sentence that I have read out to you?  You had to endure almost six years' vilification and abuse at the hands of a bitter section of the board, mainly due to our efforts to curb expenditure and improve the administration of the hospital?' &rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then she answered:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That is right.  I don't agree that it was in the last six years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The witness further said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I stand over that if I ever said it.</P>
    <P>Mr. Early: I suggest that the letter be given in full.</P>
    <P>Mr. Costello, S.C.: I am putting the one sentence of the letter for the purpose of dealing with the evidence she has given and nothing else and she admitted that she wrote that particular sentence.  (To witness): <Col N="665" /> You wrote that?&mdash;Yes.  It was not for six years.  I admit the rest of it.</P>
    <P>Roughly six years?&mdash;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, that is a picture of the enmity with which this board, as constituted under the Act of 1936, conducted its proceedings.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to another piece of evidence, of the same kind of constant friction, irremediable &mdash; no remedy could be applied to it, because the one party regarded itself as the inheritor of a proud tradition and the other antagonist regarded itself as the watchdog of the taxpayer, to secure more complete control over public expenditure and the administration of the hospital.  There is evidence here of efforts on the part of the popular party&mdash;let me call it that for convenience&mdash;to have better administration. I am now looking at page 37 of the White Paper.  The same Mr. O'Leary, already referred to, &ldquo;in his evidence set out the objects which he and his two colleagues had in mind in putting forward their proposal&rdquo;.  I do not propose to read the whole memorandum. If I may, I will summarise it.  The medical superintendent appears, from his own evidence and from this, to have been a sort of Pooh-Bah; he was not only the medical superintendent, but the whole authority.  I understand that is not uncommon in hospitals&mdash; that the general medical superintendent has, by the implication of certain duties, to look after a whole lot of things.  The proposal was that there should be a layman appointed who would take over from the overtaxed and heavily-burdened general medical superintendent a lot of things which could be more competently, and in any case more constantly, attended to by an officer specially appointed for the purpose.  On the ground, I think it was, that the board could not afford the expenditure, that was turned down.</P>
    <P>Now, these three wrote a memorandum complaining of the administration and the inefficiency of the board, not of the seven but of the board of which they were members. We have here on the minutes of the board a fortnight later an acknowledgment <Col N="666" /> of the receipt of this memorandum. Now, one of the accusations is that these three&mdash;I will summarise it again, so that the Senator need not interrupt me&mdash;were spies, agents, engaged in espionage on behalf of the Minister&mdash;he spoke of the appointment of anyone of that sort as imbecility.  I would use a very much stronger word&mdash;if a Minister desired, in appointing members of the board, that their functions should be to spy and report as spies on their colleagues, it would be a despicable thing.  I do not think any man or woman of honour would accept such an appointment if he or she had any reason to suppose that that was the nature of the appointment as understood by the Minister.</P>
    <P>But because these three considered it their duty to report to their appointer, when their efforts had been futile within the board, their action is held up to scorn and it is regarded as an irregularity.  Why, it was the first step towards invoking the authority of the Minister to set things right.  If anyone will study this evidence, he will see there were all sorts of negligences; that these were not attacks on men of rectitude, as we have been told; that they were merely indications of irregularities that could occur even under the control of men of the highest integrity without their integrity being in any way besmirched by complaining of those facts.  We have it, for instance, that the store room in which the hospital stores were kept was a glory hole.</P>

      <P>May I correct a curious mistake, which is not the view of the Senator?  It is not the place in which the hospital stores were kept.

      <P>There is the case of the dismissal of the gate-keepers. There is, of course, a dispute as to what were the exact terms of their appointment, but we will accept the account given by the chairman of the board in his evidence A man and his wife were to be joint gate-keepers, and, like that old index of the weather, when the man is in, the woman is out and when the woman was out, the man was in.  They were to be something like that; they were to share the duties of gate-keepers, but unfortunately the man was a handyman, and when he should have been discharging the duty of gate-keepers, he was fitting a fuse as an electrician, or acting as coadjutor transport officer carrying a patient from one ward to another, in this hospital for infectious diseases. He might be hurriedly called upon to drop his patient, to cease being a transport officer and to get back to the gate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It happened on one occasion that he was doing one of his multifarious handyman jobs when an ambulance arrived with a serious case.  The woman at this particular moment was incapacitated by illness and the gate remained closed.  The man had to be sent for and sought after, and the delay was complained of by the doctor whose case was affected&mdash;very properly complained of.  What sort of hospital was this?  Were they so poor in circumstances as to be obliged to have such an arrangement?  Because of this dereliction of duty on the part of the <Col N="668" /> man, that, being a man, he was unable to be in two places at once, he is visited with dismissal.  Under what circumstances?  He is threatened by the general medical superintendent and the chairman of the board &mdash; remember that I am quoting from sworn evidence given by the chairman of the board and the general medical superintendent&mdash;and was told that if this occurred again, he would be dismissed.</P>
    <P>That, as every man of commonsense will admit, meant that he was not to be dismissed on this occasion for this offence, but that if he repeated it, he would be dismissed.  The chairman of the board dismissed him without any recurrence of the offence and defended his action, when giving sworn evidence, on the ground that, when the man was charged, he was guilty of impertinence. We want the courtly manners of the 18th century to be a possession of a joint gate-keeper.  When I read that evidence, I recalled the famous French rhyme:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Cet animal est tres méchant</P>
    <P>Quand on I'attaque, il se défend.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a wicked animal; if you attack it, it will defend itself.  The gate-keeper, reproached with the enormity of his offence was not polite enough, did not come up to the standard of politeness of the chairman, and it was for that offence therefore that he and his wife were both dismissed.</P>
    <P>That shows the spirit of the management.  There are so many things of that kind, apart altogether from this constant friction between two parties on the board which show that that board had to be got rid of and the public are asked to believe that there is &ldquo;a monstrous miscarriage of justice&rdquo;&mdash;I am quoting from the pamphlet &ldquo;Justice&rdquo;&mdash;in getting rid of the board.  Why, in Heaven's name, was it not got rid of earlier?  No such board animated by such feelings as have been revealed in that inquiry could possibly be left in charge of a great medical institution, of a hospital intended to take charge of all the fever and infectious cases from the city and county.  I apologise to the House for the length and for the tedium of my speech.  The tedium is <Col N="669" /> not due to me and the length is due to the introducer of the matter.</P>

      <P>I should like to say, in the first instance, that when I received a certain document described under the title &ldquo;Justice,&rdquo; I felt, on first impulse, that I should send it to the Minister for Justice.  Some years ago, there seemed to be a tendency in this country on the part of some people to indulge in a very vile form of conduct, namely, the writing and circulating of anonymous letters.  A certain judge in the West of Ireland quite properly looked upon this conduct very severely and made public his intention to end it, and, I believe, in his particular circuit, did end it.  However, much though I should like to have known who the author, the authoress, or the authors of this anonymous letter was or were, I consigned it to my wastepaper basket.  The basket was not emptied for some days&mdash;not before the arrival of this White Paper&mdash;and I was very glad to have this document &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; and the White Paper by me at the same time.  I do not intend to go through an analysis of this document. Senator Magennis has analysed it exceedingly well, and I think has earned the gratitude of the House for the manner in which he dealt with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this matter the Minister for Local Government has very many duties imposed upon him, but in this particular case four duties stand out. One is to see to it that public moneys are properly spent, another is that he will see to it, as far as lies in his power, that there shall exist the right of all citizens to equal opportunities whether in business life or in private life.  A third of his duties is to see that the sick are <Col N="670" /> protected and a fourth to see that the poor are protected.  If the Minister failed to carry out these duties he would deserve not alone to be censured, but he would deserve to be despised.</P>
    <P>I shall not detain the House for more than a few minutes.  As far as the law is concerned I am a layman and as far as this matter is concerned I want to try to simplify the issue as it appears to a layman and to give my reactions to it.  I am sure the House was very interested in a good deal of Senator Kingsmill Moore's address yesterday.  I think that the House at times was also bewildered and I should say, taking it by and large, that ultimately we were wearied.  It would be no harm now to try to find out what were the main issues dealt with by Senator Kingsmill Moore.  It would be no harm if we tried to strip these issues of their verbosity. I shall take the second case first, the one relating to the painting contract. The position so far as I have been able to make it out is as follows.  An advertisement was issued inviting tenders for certain painting work.  In reply to that advertisement two tenders were received, one from a firm, Warren and Sons, and the other from a firm, Jones and Sons.  Warren tendered at £566 and the other firm, Jones, tendered at £944 5s. 0d.  These tenders, it seems, came before the board, were opened and were examined.  There was a member of that board, we have learned, who was a director of a firm of Dublin building contractors, the firm of Messrs. Crampton and Company.  This man, Mr. Webb, is, I understand, an authority for that firm on painting and such work.  This gentleman examined these tenders and advised the board that Messrs. Warren could not carry out the work at the price they quoted.  Now, it must remembered that Messrs. Warren had to supply a bond, like every other firm, to the effect that they would carry out their work satisfactorily and in accordance with the terms of the contract and their tender.  What happened?  This gentleman advised the board that Messrs. Warren were not a fit firm to carry out the work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is incorrect. <Col N="671" /> I am afraid it is grossly incorrect.  He said that no firm could do it so as to show a profit at that rate.</P>

      <P>Quite right. Messrs. Warren would not be able to do the work.  No scadáin dearga for the moment.  After a scrutiny of these tenders, the board decided to pick a panel of contractors and verbally to invite these contractors to tender for the work.  Senator Kingsmill Moore pointed out that all these new tenders were in and around the price mentioned by Messrs. Jones and tried to impress upon us last evening that that was evidence of the <i>bona fides</i> of the gentleman who advised against Messrs. Warren.  However, one of the new tenders was lower than that of Messrs. Jones.  Still this board decided that they would give the contract to Messrs. Jones.</P>

      <P>Excuse me, is the Senator intentionally misrepresenting the position?  One of the contractors was a few pounds lower but it was pointed out that the painting of down-pipes was omitted, that is to say, it was higher.  I wonder whether the Senator is going to make the same kind of misrepresentation which has appeared in regard to the other contract in the White Paper?  I quoted the words and I do not think it lies in the mouth of the Senator to make a misleading statement like that.</P>

      <P>In due course, Messrs. Jones were awarded this contract by the board.  The contract came before the Local Government Department and they refused to sanction the decision of the board. The board there and then, although it seems it was convinced that Messrs. Warren were an incapable firm, agreed <Col N="672" /> to the handing of this contract to Messrs. Warren.  In due course, the work was done by Messrs. Warren for the sum of £566.  In due course, the work as done by Messrs. Warren was examined not alone by the people inside but by people outside and it was admitted by all parties that they had carried out the work properly and efficiently.  I am not making any charge, but I could not help remembering during Senator Kingsmill Moore's address that it does happen among contractors that contracts or parts of contracts are sub-let, and when he mentioned in this House about these four or five new tenders being in or around the same figure&mdash; the figure quoted by Messrs. Jones&mdash;I could not help feeling that something strange was likely to happen.</P>
      <P>This Mr. Webb, an authority on painting for this firm of Crampton and Co., a member of this board, must have been aware that Messrs. Warren were technically efficient and commercially sound.  If he occupied that position in the firm of Messrs. Crampton he must have been aware, as Senator Quirke pointed out yesterday evening, that this firm of Warren and Sons had been engaged in and had completed satisfactorily many very important contracts.  Among them were the Customs House in 1943 at £1,200; the new Industry and Commerce building at the other side of Kildare Street, for Messrs. Sisk and Co., a contract to the extent of £2,700; and the Dundrum Asylum, for the Board of Works, at a sum of £1,500.  What I want to know in connection with this particular item, and what I think the ordinary business people in this city, the workers in this city and the people of Ireland will want to know in connection with this contract, is: did Mr. Webb and some members of the board know just a little bit more about Messrs. Warren than it was good for Messrs. Warren that they should know about them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second case&mdash;the first case in order of time&mdash;is this repairs contract. Here again, there were two quotations. It might be somewhat difficult for a layman just to find out how one tender happened to be somewhat lower than the other.  However, tenders were received.  One was from the firm of <Col N="673" /> Messrs. Higgins, Ushers' Quay, Dublin, and the other from a firm named Hull.  Higgins' tender was for £2,395, and Hull's tender was for £2,539; that is to say the first tender I mentioned was the lower by a few hundred pounds approximately.  The architect of this board, examining the tenders, provided two reasons why the tender of Messrs. Higgins should not be accepted.  The two reasons, as I have been able to make out, are these: first, that certain items were not included in Messrs. Higgins' tender. Senator Kingsmill Moore estimated the value of those items at between £150 and £200.  The second reason was that Messrs. Higgins had not included in their figure a sum for contingencies. This sum amounted to £200.  By adverting to those two facts&mdash;that certain minor items had not been included by Messrs. Higgins, and this question of the contingency items&mdash;it worked out that Messrs. Hull's tender was the lower by a few hundred pounds. Messrs. Hull's tender was accepted.</P>
    <P>It will be remembered&mdash;it is important, although perhaps the amount may not seem very significant&mdash;that Messrs. Hull's tender at £2,539 included £200 to cover contingencies.  All very well so far as it goes, but what happened?  Messrs. Hull came in on the job.  They got to work on the contract for which they had tendered, and without further ado they were allowed to perform many other important works and to get paid for them.  They were allowed, for instance, to estimate for additional work in connection with the subject of their contract to the amount of £812 10s. 2d.  Further extra work was done on a time and materials basis to the amount of £208 8s. 7d., and certain other work&mdash;pointing, to be precise&mdash;was done to the extent of £28 4s. 6d.  I have not finished the list, but it was mentioned yesterday that the architect could not have been aware that this work needed to be done.  The buildings were old.  It was only when a ladder was thrown up and some scaffolding erected that he was able to ascertain precisely what should have been done.  That was how that architect fulfilled his duties in regard to a public hospital.  If those <Col N="674" /> buildings had collapsed, if servants or patients or members of the public had been injured or killed, what a fine come-back it would have been on the part of the architect to say that he was not able to get up to examine those buildings and find out their condition. This firm also had paid to them the sum of £19 11s., the amount of their guarantee bond.  They were allowed the sum of £107 mentioned by Senator Kingsmill Moore, because of the increase in the cost of materials due to emergency conditions.  I wonder how many Senators took in just what Senator Kingsmill Moore had to say on that particular item?</P>
    <P>These contractors, he assures us, were entitled to a 33? per cent. increase because of the change in the prices of materials, yet these public benefactors calculated their costs and their profits to a nicety and were willing to, and did, forego how much? About 23 per cent. on what was due to them on that particular item. I could not get it out of my head, when I heard Senator Kingsmill Moore, that there was something rather fishy about the item.  Well, let me go on.  Extra work on building amounted to £46 15s. 4d., and, again, extra work on the Beneavin Home amounted to £68 9s. 6d.  I make out the total for that to be £1,290 19s. 1d., over and above the contract tendered for and awarded to Messrs. Hull.  I wonder was there anything wrong with the commercial solvency of Messrs. Higgins?  I wonder was their technical efficiency the cause, or the reason, why that firm was not given that contract?  I, and other Senators and the public, will be very interested to know just why that contract was dealt with in the manner it was, and I think we will agree that the Minister, who would be aware of that and who would have failed to act in the way he acted, would certainly be deserving of our most severe censure.</P>
    <P>Just one word more before I finish. Apart from all these sweets that fell into the lap of Messrs. Hull, there is a question I want to ask with regard to this £200 for contingencies.  When they tendered at £2,539, that figure <Col N="675" /> included a sum for contingencies, and yet, as I have shown, this firm did extra work and was paid all along the line, and eventually they got this £200 besides.  I wonder where did that £200 go?  I wonder is there a doubt in any man's mind as to whether that board discharged its duties as it should have?</P>
    <P>The thing that astonished me when I came to inquire into this was the fact that this board seemed to meet at 8.30 in the morning.  All during the emergency this board met at 8.30 in the morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">

      <P>They met for their breakfast at the institution, then they proceeded to dispose of the business of the board, and then they got away to their business as quickly as they could.  It seems to me that, in all circumstances, the board was not in a position to discharge its duty either to the Department of Local Government or to the public.  I intend leaving the matter at that.</P>
      <P>The other matters, I want to repeat, I am satisfied have been adequately dealt with by Senator Magennis, indeed, dealt with in a manner that I could hardly expect anyone to deal with them inside the time that he took.  There is the other point&mdash;the very severe strictures that have been passed on the conduct of certain members of the board.  Indeed, it was admitted by Senator Kingsmill Moore that certain members of that board were spied upon, that their movements were watched and traced.  There was conduct on the part of responsible public representatives&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What I want to refer to is the attack that was made on these members.  I know only one of the three members concerned with this joint report to the Minister in connection with the affairs of the board, and that man is Mícheál O Foghludha, a man who has enjoyed a very honoured position and a very honoured place in the business life of this city for how long I do not know. Not alone that, but a man who day in and day out, so long as I can remember, and I am sure for a much longer period than I can remember, never wavered and never swerved in his duty as a public representative, and above all in his duty as an Irishman. The Irish cause, whether as a political cause or as a cultural cause, never had any more loyal or any more honoured soldier or servant than Mícheál O Foghludha, and I despise the infamous aspersions that were cast, or attempted to be cast, by Senator Kingsmill Moore, on that gentleman.</P>
      <P>I want to say one other word. There has been a lot of talk about the report.  Again, I am perfectly satisfied with the reply that Senator Magennis has made in connection with it, but what I want to know is this: is there a report?  If there is a report, how does Senator Kingsmill Moore know it is there?</P>

It occurs to me that if there is a report, then Senator Kingsmill Moore knows the contents of that report and, if he does, how did he come by it?</P>

      <P>As an ordinary layman, I did not take very great interest in the inquiry into the affairs of the Cork Street board but when I discovered, as a result of the publication of the White Paper, certain matters of which I, as a building contractor, had some knowledge, I did take an interest in the particular part of the White Paper dealing with the tenders.  Figures are <Col N="678" /> not mentioned in the White Paper but Senator Kingsmill Moore mentioned figures.  I took them down yesterday evening from him; they are exactly as read out by Senator O Buachalla and, as they have not been contradicted, I assume that the figures I took down in connection with the maintenance and repair contract are correct.  On, these figures alone, I submit to the House there has been great injustice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the figures are correct, I submit to the House that these alone would justify the abolition of the board.  That is a rather serious statement to make and I propose to justify it.

      <P>We have it now that the only other works as set out by Senator Kingsmill Moore that are certified and vouched for in detail are the items amounting to the various sums that I read out.  We have got no reference at all, we have no mention of the architect, <Col N="681" /> no claim by the contractor, as to how that £200 contingency was expended.</P>

      <P>The only conclusion I can come to on the figure given, namely, £2,339 19s. 1d., and on the details given by Senator Kingsmill Moore, is that no indication has been given at all as to how the £200 included in the original tender for contingencies was expended.  That is a matter which demands very close investigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very reason I have gone through these <Col N="682" /> figures and examined them and asked the Senator who mentioned the figures first in the House whether they were correct.  As a public man, there is responsibility on me to have a matter like that examined, no matter who may have omitted to examine it previously.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Kingsmill Moore came here briefed very fully. It was he who mentioned these figures, and out of his own mouth he must go a little further to explain away something that demands explanation, and something which, if it happened elsewhere, would have to be examined very closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something in which there is a certain suspicion, and I am as much entitled to have that suspicion as the seven members of the board had suspicions of certain things referred to by Senator Kingsmill Moore here: for instance, the conduct of those who were described as the Minister's nominees on the board.</P>
      <P>There seems to be a very great desire on the part of those seven members, and on the part of Senator Kingsmill Moore, to differentiate between the attitude taken by the Minister and that taken by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I can say that both the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary, Dr. Ward, have personally considered every word of the evidence submitted at the inquiry, and that this attempt by interested parties to insinuate that there is disagreement is one that can be treated only with contempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, it should be made clear to the public outside that this board includes very many people who are not implicated in this campaign at all.  We must come to the conclusion, after reading the reports of the Mansion House meeting, that the desire is not so much to have a careful investigation into the affairs of the Cork Street <Col N="683" /> Hospital as to use it as a stick to beat the Government.  The language used by the speakers in the Mansion House tended in that direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been so many points raised during this debate that it would be quite impossible to deal with all of them, unless I were to make a speech of the same length as that of Senator Kingsmill Moore or Senator Magennis.  I only mention this since there has been a tendency in this debate, not confined to one side, to assume, when you do not interrupt, that you therefore accept the statements made.  That is a bad practice and does not imply anything of the kind and I ask the House not to assume, because I do not deal with every point, that I necessarily accept all the points made as accurate or am in agreement with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal with two points made, one by Senator Magennis and the other by Senator Hearne, with which I am in complete agreement.  I am in complete agreement with Senator Magennis when he deprecates attempts made to suggest that a Minister can take action for which the other members of the Government, including the Taoiseach, are not responsible. I have no use for that kind of argument; I do not believe it is true and I do not think I ever used it.  I also agree completely with Senator Hearne that the Minister is just as responsible as the Parliamentary Secretary and that the Government is ultimately responsible.  I have never believed, in spite of what may have been said, that the Minister left matters of such importance to the Parliamentary Secretary and did not know about them.  I am sure Senator Hearne is right, and whether he is right or not, we as parliamentarians know that we must assume that a Minister who had a duty attended to it and that the Minister in this case&mdash;as I firmly believe he did&mdash;read and was responsible for the documents issued in his Department.  Anyone who read the letters signed by the Minister to the Press could see that he accepts full responsibility.  I wish to make <Col N="684" /> that clear, for fear it would be taken that I was in favour of differentiating between the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister. Such an assumption would be very misleading and is not parliamentary practice&mdash;and I hope it never will be.</P>
    <P>There is one other point which it is better to concede at once, namely, if it were true that a board, even if misled by their architect, had paid £200 for contingencies which did not arise and which were not deducted from payments for additional work, the board would be deserving of absolute censure.  There is no question about that.  I do not believe that occurred in this case, as I cannot believe that, if it did, it would not appear in the White Paper or in the letter accompanying it.  Therefore, I assume that it did not occur.  At the same time, I agree with Senator Hearne that, if it were so, it would be a very serious matter, indeed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It is inconceivable to me that the doctor who held the inquiry would not have ascertained that fact, if it were so, but I agree with Senator Hearne that if that could be proved it would be utterly unjustifiable.</P>
      <P>It would be very tempting to me to follow Senator Magennis.  He is always interesting and sometimes brings forward points which make me think.  He will forgive me when I say I do not think he was as effective this time as he sometimes is.  That was due to his spending a great deal of time in criticising the action taken, not by the Minister and those with whom we are concerned in the Appropriation Bill, but by those who made speeches outside.  He did not even hear those speeches.  I was slightly amused when he assumed the accuracy of the newspaper reports as representing what a particular person said.  I have a suspicion that, even when he sees the report in the <i>Irish Times</i> of his two hours' speech, he will find that, while it may not be inaccurate, it will not be representative of what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, I was present at this particular meeting.  I was not one of the organisers, nor was I on the platform, but I was present as an ordinary member of the public. I heard the various speeches, including many points with which I agreed and quite a number with which I did not agree.  The newspaper reports were obviously very abbreviated, and should not be taken as representing everything that was said.  It would be extremely tempting to me to go through the report to show where I disagree or agree with what particular persons said but that would take up the time of the House unjustifiably, and there are other matters of more importance to be dealt with in relation to this problem.  Accordingly, I hope I will not be misunderstood if I do not follow the general line taken in the discussion.  I want to say that I deprecate what has been said on both sides of this controversy by the introduction of the name of the Society of Friends.  It seems to me that members of the Society of Friends, if they are incompetent or dishonest, are entitled to be treated in exactly the same way as anybody else.  The sort of idea that they should be treated differently is a completely false one. There has been another tendency to introduce some compliments paid to the history of the society with which I need not deal.  I think these are irrelevant.  I am not criticising what was said as I think it was well meant.  I happen to be a member of the Society of Friends and I think the references are irrelevant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>There was nothing wrong, but I simply deprecate the introduction of such remarks.  There was some sort of suggestion because for 100 years certain members of the society did charitable work, and, assisted by other people, created a hospital and had it built, that in the year 1944 a board should not be abolished or should be treated differently if it happened to be incompetent. Senator Magennis did not suggest that, but there was some idea of the kind.  I do not want to over-emphasise <Col N="686" /> it as Senators will appreciate what I mean.  I was not a member of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I introduced a reference to the charitable work of the Society of Friends.  I thought it was due to the society.  I hope I will not be misunderstood for doing so.  There was no insinuation of any kind intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>My reference was with regard to letters that appeared in the newspapers.  I appreciate what Senator Magennis said and I am sure it was sincere.  I had not the Senator in mind in the reference I made.  In this particular case I was referring to letters in the newspapers and to conversations which suggested that this was a peculiar case.  I suggest that this was a public board that had done good work, that it was abolished by the Minister, and that the question is: Did the Minister act properly in abolishing it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>That board was abolished in 1936 under the Dublin Fever Hospital Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The board I am concerned with is the one referred to in the White Paper.  That board was created in 1936.  When I speak of the board I mean the board as a whole.  Obviously when a board is mentioned I mean the whole board, the one that was abolished.  It is on that point I am agreeing, not disagreeing. I think we must treat the action of the Minister as one abolishing the whole board.  That is what I am concerned with.  I find myself in a difficulty because of all that could be said, and that I must not say because of the time that it would take. I have never been connected in any way with Cork Street Hospital.  I have tried to examine this matter from the point of view of the case made by the Minister.  I have read very carefully the White Paper and equally carefully the paper accompanying it.  I do not claim to have memorised them, and I may be mistaken, but I say deliberately that I do not believe a case has been made in these two documents for the abolition of the board created in 1936.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> Even if I had never heard the very able speech of Senator Kingsmill Moore, and if I had not known that certain statements are challenged by him, I would still say quite definitely that in my opinion there is not sufficient evidence here that would justify the action taken.  In my opinion the discontent and feeling created are not, as Senator Magennis thinks, a political scheme for the purpose of obstructing or criticising the Government.  Of course, if the Minister is criticised the Government is criticised, but to suggest that the people interested in this and who started it are actuated in that way is, I know, not true.  If it gives any satisfaction to say so I say that it is not correct.  I am perfectly satisfied that there is a very large number of people not much interested as between the political Parties, if interested at all&mdash;including a large number who have never taken part in politics and who have not any intention of doing so except in a particular issue&mdash;who are interested in this question, including a considerable number who are still prepared to be satisfied that in the case made by the Minister he took the right course.  Senators may or may not believe me, but I am giving my considered views.  It is extremely important that the public mind should be allayed.  How can it be allayed? There is what the Senator described as a demand and an idea abroad, which I share, that the best thing for the Minister to do in present circumstances would be to publish the report made to him by the inspector who held the inquiry.  I would much prefer that he would reinstate the board, and give his criticism of certain things that he thought they had done unwisely.  That would be the better solution than publishing the report.  I presume he is not going to do that.  Then I think, having regard to all the circumstances, he would be wise to publish the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Towards the close of his speech, Senator O Buachalla referred to one member of the board whom he knew personally, and spoke highly of his character and integrity. <Col N="688" /> I am sure that was quite correct.  I could do the same in regard to two or three members of the board.  But I would prefer to conduct this debate from the point of view that all the members of the board were persons of integrity who were carrying out their duties according to their lights. I see no reason why that should not apply to every member of the board, no matter what side they may have been on.  I cannot think of anything much more extreme in the way of different outlook than Senator O Buachalla and Senator Kingsmill Moore.  I personally have always believed, and still believe, that both of them are perfectly honest in expressing the views in which they believe. Why this should not apply equally to members of the board I do not know. I am not criticising Senator O Buachalla.  I am only emphasising the point that that is the proper basis on which this should be considered.</P>
      <P>Before the adjournment I was contending that, having regard to all the circumstances, the White Paper, plus the documents circulated by the Minister, did not provide sufficient cause for the abolition of the board. I was giving that as a reason, which I was starting to develop, why I believe it would be wise, provided of course the Minister is not prepared to reinstate the board, to publish the inspector's report.  Now there has been a great deal of play made, especially by Senator Magennis, with a certain judgement in the House of Lords.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I confess that I cannot help viewing that with a certain amount of amusement. But, in the document issued by the Minister, or the Parliamentary Secretary, he winds up by stating that the decision of the House of Lords in this case clearly establishes that the Minister is acting within his right in not publishing the inspector's report. That is quite correct.  The House of Lords' decision, which is a legal decision and which, therefore, still affects our law here, does make it clear that, in law, he has the right to refuse to publish the report.  But he goes on to say that the House of Lords' decision <Col N="689" /> also establishes, as stated by Lord Moulton, that it would cripple the usefulness of public inquiries and be entirely mischievous if such reports were made public.  I want to suggest that a personal opinion of one of the law lords on policy as distinct from law, given in 1915 or now, is of no value whatever to this country and cannot be of any value, and that the decision of the House of Lords does not necessarily establish everything stated by the judges.  It is true that Lord Moulton, as quoted by the Minister, stated that it was not for him to express an opinion on the desirability of an administrative Department taking any particular course and, having said it would not be desirable, proceeded to do it.  That is not an uncommon thing, but it has no validity or no effect on what is wise or not wise at the present time here.  It has no validity except in respect to the law at present, and that is that the Minister is free, as far as the law is concerned, to withhold or to publish the report.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there are reasons why this report should be published.  The first reason, which I have already given, is that these two documents do not satisfy a very large number of persons and that the White Paper does suggest something which, if not corruption, is very much bordering on it, in the statement that the board were disposed to give the work to a particular firm without due examination.  That, if it be true, is not fully proved in the documents. That is a very serious charge.  Men, accepting a public position, whether on a hospital board or any other board, must recognise that they are subject to criticism.  They have to be subject sometimes to unfair criticism which everybody in this House knows quite well.  But it is not right to suggest that their motives are wrong or that they are guilty of corruption. Without further specific reasons being given, it seems to me that that ought not to be allowed to pass without further evidence of some kind, and that the most conclusive and best way of dealing with it would be the publication of the report.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="690" /> Senator Kingsmill Moore gave details to suggest and, as he believed, to prove &mdash; and subject to other evidence which may be forthcoming, he seemed to me to prove&mdash;that there are statements in this White Paper which are not correct.  I do not think that should be left there.  I think it should be answered.  It cannot be properly answered here to-day.  I think it should be answered, and I believe it will be best answered by the publication of the report, because we would know then what a man, who had access to all the documents, and who, everybody admits, would have obtained everything he needed, believed to be the truth.</P>
    <P>Now there are other reasons that I want to put forward.  It was argued by Senator Magennis, and I think it is argued by the Minister, that in the ordinary way an inspector's report, under normal circumstances where the inquiry was ordered by the Local Government Department, is not usually published.  I think that is probably correct.  When I say &ldquo;probably&rdquo; I mean that I have heard some suggestions that there are occasional cases where it is published, and therefore I am not going to tie myself down, but I am assuming it to be correct.  I would point out to the House, however, and I think it is important, that this is not an ordinary case.  I suggest that it is equally unusual to publish a White Paper and that it is equally unusual for the Minister to write to the inspector who has been appointed by him and send him 39 pages, including suggestions of corruption.  I am not saying that it is never done, but I am saying that it is unusual, and it helps to make this case unusual.  There are, however, reasons which appeal to me to a greater extent even than those I have put forward.  In this case my only object in desiring publication of the inspector's report is because I believe it is the best way of disabusing the public mind, or the mind of a very large section of the public in Dublin, of a very considerable amount of uneasiness.  Of course there are always people who are prepared to raise any matter as a purely political weapon, but there are a large number <Col N="691" /> of people in this case who are genuinely uneasy.  I know that to be true. Senator Magennis astonished me by speaking of one Government as our Government, and of the Government of ten or twelve years ago as not being our Government, so to speak.  To my mind, the Government is our Government. We are concerned with its good name, and so long as a large number of people feel that a matter is not being dealt with properly, justly, and conscientiously, that is a bad thing, but I believe that that is the feeling of a large number of people at the present moment in regard to this question of the Cork Street Hospital, and the question is how the minds of that large section of the people can be disabused of that idea, because I am satisfied that it has not been disabused of it.</P>
    <P>I want to recall one or two of the circumstances.  This inquiry was called for because of a report made by three members for the board to the Minister.  That report contained what might be regarded as charges&mdash;they were certainly allegations.  When the inquiry was held, not only were certain members of the majority of the board represented by counsel, but counsel were present representing these three members of the board who had made charges or allegations, and witnesses were cross-examined for the purpose of proving these charges.  Now, to the mind of the ordinary public here, that was a trial.  It had the effect of a trial.  There were charges made against certain individuals, counsel were engaged on both sides, and, without going into the question of whether he was there in a semi-judicial or quasi-judicial capacity, there was a person there who was regarded by the public as judging the case.  That is not always the case, but there were charges, and those charges are repeated to a certain extent in the White Paper, and in my opinion the best way to deal with that is by publishing the report.</P>
    <P>Again, I repeat, it is a matter of whether it is good policy to publish the report, and not whether you are legally bound to publish it or not.  But when I look into many of the points raised either in the White Paper or in <Col N="692" /> this letter &mdash; all of which, we may assume, if they are not the actual reasons why the board was abolished, were considered by the Minister to be relevant to the board's abolition &mdash; I find it very easy to understand why there should be a difference of opinion. We have an allegation that the medical superintendent was allowed to make a suggestion that there should be an increase in nurses' pay, and that he was allowed by the board to quote the rates payable in England.  I cannot see, for the life of me, what is wrong in that, and I think it is the height of absurdity that that should be objected to while the Minister comes along and quotes an opinion, not merely on a point of law, but an opinion of the House of Lords in 1915.  It may be good enough for the Minister, but it is not good enough for the purpose of a comparison as to whether the nurses are paid sufficiently or not.  It is also suggested that the nurses had not asked for an increase.  I think it is wrong for a public institution to wait until its employees ask for more.  If you want to have a good and satisfied staff, the board ought not to wait until they ask for an increase in their pay, but even supposing that they were wrong in that, it is no reason for dismissing the board.</P>
    <P>In this accompanying document I find a speech made by Dr. Ward in this House quoted as relevant to the matter, and in that speech he sets out a whole lot of points in which there was a difference of opinion with the board.  They were all matters in which perfectly honest people could have a difference of opinion, but there could be no grounds whatever for abolishing the board because of that difference of opinion, and why they are brought up here is beyond me.  Let us consider a few of them.  We find that the board advocated the provision of a swimming pool for nurses, a covered ball-alley at a cost of £1,500, and 23 cottages for male employees at a cost of £650 each.  The Minister recognised the need for recreational facilities, including tennis courts, a ball-alley&mdash;uncovered&mdash;a recreation hall, a billiard room for the medical staff, and common rooms for nurses and domestics, but considered that the provision of <Col N="693" /> the other things could not be justified. Now, what, fundamentally is wrong in a public body suggesting that there should be additional accommodation, such as a swimming pool, a covered ball-alley, cottages, and so on?  I can easily imagine a board, when it comes to the question of erecting a certain type of hospital, which is expected to last for 100 or 200 years, wanting to look ahead and see to it that these things should last as long as possible, and, I can also easily see a Minister for Local Government wanting to cut these things out, although I feel that when it is expected that the hospital will last for 100 or 200 years, you ought to bear that in mind, and at any rate to make it as modern as you possibly can.</P>
    <P>We find various economies being enforced as against the wishes of the board.  The board wanted the floor space per patient in the cubicle blocks to be 144 square feet, and it was reduced to 110 square feet.  What has that got to do with the abolition of the board?  It is perfectly proper for a board to suggest that it would be better to have the larger floor space provided.  More absurd still, however, we find that the board proposed that each maidservant should have a separate room.  Is there any crime in that?  The Department of Local Government decided that that was not desirable and that the maids should be accommodated in cubicle dormitories, thus reducing the cost of their accommodation.  Now, that is a fair reason for a difference of opinion, but it is certainly not a matter to justify the abolition of the board.  I have no difficulty in seeing that, in matters of that kind, there could be legitimate differences of opinion and I can even see that heat could develop from those differences of opinion.  On an issue of that kind, there would, probably, be heat in this House.  What I cannot understand is why the existence of differences of opinion in the board, and with the Local Government Department, should have any bearing on the abolition of the board.  Senator Magennis quoted from the White Paper the evidence of a lady which seemed to operate more against his <Col N="694" /> own argument than in favour of it. Knowing the lady and knowing several members of the board, I do not think that the heat was any greater than the heat which is occasionally developed here, after which we all go out laughing. As for &ldquo;vilification and abuse&rdquo; I know several of the members and I do not think that such took place.  Nobody could really believe that there was serious vilification. If a strong difference of opinion justifies the abolition of a board, then it would be better to abolish the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Some people might want to abolish this House even if we were all in agreement.  Nobody would advocate the abolition of the Dáil because of strong differences of opinion there.  It is because of strong differences of opinion in a democratic country that a Parliament exists.  If there were no differences of opinion in the Dáil, it might be a reason for abolishing it.  On this board, certain members represented an extraordinary electorate and the others, feeling that they represented the ratepayers, thought that they should try to effect economies.  The others felt that these economies should not be made.  It is a good thing to have such a difference of opinion.  This reason, as to the existence of differences of opinion, is one of the most ridiculous reasons which has been advanced for the abolition of the board.  Charges were made against a public body and these were examined into at a public inquiry at which there was a chairman.  Lest I get into an argument with Senator Magennis, I shall not say whether that person was acting in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity.  He was expected to act impartially and to see that witnesses were properly treated.  Whether that rendered him &ldquo;judicial&rdquo; or &ldquo;quasi-judicial&rdquo;, I do not know, nor do I care.  He was there for the purpose I have mentioned and everybody who was present believes he carried out his task.  Here our only business is to criticise the action of the Minister.  And what have we got?  Just two documents, <Col N="695" /> with a few additional things brought in by one Senator.  We are not competent to judge in this matter the extent to which the inspector was competent.  Even if we had a dozen two-hour speeches, we should not be as competent to deal with the matter as the inspector was.  I am convinced that, in the interests of good government, without prejudice to whether similar action should be taken again or whether it was taken previously, the Government would be wise to publish the inspector's report in this case.</P>

      <P>It appears to me, from the report of the meeting held in the Mansion House and from the speeches made here, that one of the great causes of complaint is that the report of the inspector was not published.  I have had a certain amount of experience on public boards since 1918 and I have watched inquiries.  I think that I am safe in making the statement that never has a report of an inspector been published by the Local Government Department in respect of any inquiry held by that body.  It was stated yesterday that the report of the inspector in the case of the Cork fire was published. I have here a copy of a letter written about that matter which refers to the report but does not, apparently, enclose the report.  I think that Senator Kingsmill Moore was wrong in stating that the report was published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that they made a mistake.  What happens is: A full report is sent down to the board, as in this case, which refers to the report and certain things which come out in the report, but the report itself is never a published document.  It stands to reason that the report should not be published.  It would be very unfortunate if an expression of opinion were to come from a body such as this that the report of an inspector should be published.  No inspector would hold an inquiry under such circumstances. Think of his position.  He has power <Col N="696" /> to administer oaths but, so far as I know, he is not in any way privileged in any report he may issue.  Therefore he makes a confidential report to his Minister.  Do Senators think that he could state what he thought if he believed that the contents of the report could be bandied about at meetings at the Mansion House or brought up in the Dáil or Seanad, that every note he made of the demeanour, appearance or truthfulness of witnesses could be canvassed in public?  He dare not express any opinion because, if he did, he might be mulcted in very heavy damages.</P>

Privilege attaches to a court and to public bodies in certain circumstances, but it could not be suggested that anything written in such a report would be privileged.  Suppose an inspector said: &ldquo;I saw such a witness.  I did not believe him.&rdquo;  Even if there was a certain qualified privilege, how would he show that he had not malice in writing that?

      <P>He would not dare to do his job, if he wanted to preserve his life or liberty, by making statements of what he thought about certain people or classes of people.  Suppose there was a contradiction of evidence in certain cases.  He would have to say which side he believed and which he did not believe.  It is a difficult thing for a man to say who is telling the truth and who is not.  I do not suggest that, in this case, a particle of evidence was given that was not correct.  There was no suggestion that the entire evidence was not perfectly truthful.  But if there were a contradiction of evidence, would the inspector state that he believed some witnesses and disbelieved others if he knew that the statement would be published? He could not live in the City of Dublin, or even in Ireland, after making a report of that kind.  It would be an unfortunate thing if the Government were to decide to depart from the practice which has been in operation in the Local Government Department and say that they would in future publish the reports of inspectors.  If such a thing happened, the most the inspector could write in is: &ldquo;I have taken a full note of the evidence; here it is and make the most of it.&rdquo;  That is all the inspector could write; he could give no other opinion.  Therefore, if an inquiry is to be an inquiry, if it is to be for the benefit of the Department which the inspector represents, he must have an absolutely free hand and that report must be a sacred document, confined to the Minister and to the Minister only.  That has happened in every case; no exception has been made with regard to this Cork Street Hospital.  Therefore on that <Col N="698" /> ground they have no cause for complaint.</P>
      <P>Senator Kingsmill Moore started off by saying that the Local Government Department refused to give them particulars of the matters to be inquired into.  He seemed to base his case on that and regarded it as proving that the Minister, or the Parliamentary Secretary, had a spite against the governors of this hospital.  I can tell Senator Kingsmill Moore that there have been numerous inquiries held in this country and in no instance have particulars been given to the councils concerned of the matters to be inquired into.  I was at an inquiry into the affairs of the Galway County Council and we asked what were the matters to be inquired into and we got no information beyond an indication that there would be inquiries made with regard to affairs over a period of ten years, or some period like that.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an inquiry in Limerick which lasted for 35 days and I asked Senator Ryan, who was counsel at that inquiry, if they had asked the Minister to enumerate the matters to be inquired into.  He said they had and the reply they got was that all matters concerning the work of the corporation from a certain year to a certain year were to be inquired into. That is the only information they got. Therefore no exception has been made in this case and no different policy has been adopted with regard to the Cork Street Hospital from what has been adopted with regard to every council in Ireland.  We have had numerous inquiries all over the country. I thought that in Galway we had one of the best boards of health in Ireland, without exception.  The members of that board of health were asked to appoint an assistant county medical officer of health.  They did not refuse; they said: &ldquo;In a short time we believe the necessity will arise and we will then appoint one&rdquo;.  They were abolished for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An inquiry was held into the affairs of the Clare County Council.  It was found that a certain amount of rates <Col N="699" /> had not been collected.  By the time the Order came out abolishing the council they were one of the best councils in Ireland, yet they were abolished and we had no debate in the Dáil or in the Seanad.  A very curious thing arises from a statement made by Senator Kingsmill Moore.  He referred to the older members; he appears to represent the older members.  There is no talk about the majority of the members of the board.  I have heard of no great complaints by them.  I understand Senator Healy was a member of that board.  I do not see him here listening to the debate and I do not see his wife here to cry over him because he was abolished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, he had not to go any longer since the inquiry.  There were many matters mentioned in connection with this report.  Senator Kingsmill Moore said, when the inquiry was held, that because the inspector showed a certain belief that there was nothing in certain charges, counsel representing the board discontinued his cross-examination&mdash;I think that is what he said&mdash;and also did not produce certain witnesses that he would have produced if a different attitude had been taken up by the inspector.  Now we know that, from the time local government started in this country, the inspector's duty is to take evidence and that that evidence has to be considered by the Minister.  Therefore every particle of evidence must be given, no matter what expressions you see on the countenance of the man holding the inquiry.  We all know that at inquiries we do not bother whether he looks pleasant or indifferent.  The witness is examined and cross-examined and it is really what is written down by the shorthand-writer that is examined by the Minister.  That is the only thing the Minister has to go on.  If they now complain that the Minister, or the assistant Minister, had to come to his <Col N="700" /> conclusions because all the evidence on their side was not given, I say that is not the fault of the Minister or the assistant Minister; it is their own funeral when they did not give the evidence they ought to have given at this inquiry.</P>
      <P>Take the White Paper that we have here.  It differs practically in no way from the letter written to Mr. McLysaght when he was appointed to take charge of this hospital.  Certain matters do appear and they have not been denied.  There was, for instance, the contract for painting.  Senator Kingsmill Moore said they could have accepted that tender, whether the Minister liked it or not, and it was only as a matter of grace and courtesy that they accepted the higher tender, subject to the sanction of the Minister.  I do not think that is all.  I do not know whether the Minister has power to refuse to sanction a tender accepted by any council.  I am very doubtful about it.  I do know that a council is bound to accept the lowest tender, and if they do not accept the lowest tender they must put on the minutes their reasons for not doing so.  I also know that if they do not accept the lowest tender and there are not very good reasons given, the auditor will come along and surcharge the members who voted for the acceptance of the higher tender&mdash; surcharge them for the difference between the higher and the lower tenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is possibly the reason why the Minister's sanction is asked for&mdash;in order to protect the members against a surcharge, not through any courtesy or anything else, but simply in order to protect them.  That is what happened in this case.  They did accept the higher tender and the difference was very great.  They say: &ldquo;We were told by a member that if we accepted the lower tender the man contracting could not supply proper paint.&rdquo;  If they really believed that, they were not fit to be members of a public board, because we all know that every contract is founded on a specification, that the specification specified the nature of the paint and other materials to be supplied and that the architect has to see that those things are supplied. <Col N="701" /> If, therefore, a contractor contracts at a figure which is too low, that is his loss and not the loss of the board.</P>
    <P>Besides it is absurd to suggest that, if I am a contractor, I could not tender lower than somebody else.  Suppose I have paint in stock which I have bought at a lower rate, what is to prevent my tendering at a lower figure and making as much profit as the man who tenders at a higher figure would make, if he has to buy in the open market?  There is no point in that at all.  I think that what was really worse than accepting the higher tender was that, after they had opened the tenders, they invited certain people to tender again.  That is unheard of in my experience&mdash;and I have had a good deal of experience&mdash;of public life.</P>
    <P>It may happen that no tender at all is received, but when tenders are opened, they are opened before a board of so many people&mdash;in this case, it is not said that there was even a tenders committee&mdash;and it is almost impossible to keep them a secret among so many members unless they are sworn to secrecy, and they are not sworn to secrecy, to keep the members from talking in public houses or other places outside and letting everyone become aware of what is the lowest tender.  It is also opposed to public policy to readvertise for that reason.</P>
    <P>In the case of our council, what we do, if we do not get tenders, is to leave the work to the engineer to be carried out by direct labour, in order to avoid any abuse which might arise from the fact that tenders have been opened.  This goes to the root of the administration of public authorities. If the Minister were to allow that to happen, if he were to allow it to become a precedent, it would upset the whole contracting system of every public board in the country.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to deal with the matter of the second contract, as Senator Hearne has already dealt with it, but I want to say that what I resent is the fact that public meetings were held and that a Minister or an assistant Minister of this State&mdash;I do <Col N="702" /> not care what Party he belongs to&mdash; should be denounced as a liar or a fraud.  That is a charge which is too serious to make against any person, any member of the Dáil or Seanad, because, if a person is a liar, he is not fit to be a member of either Dáil or Seanad, or to represent any Party in the country.  No allowance is made for the making of a mistake, if there was any mistake, but this debate is brought about, although a document has been issued which states that the evidence will be published and we are asked to listen to statements to the effect that one of the assistant Ministers is a man unworthy of the confidence of the public.</P>
    <P>There are other matters revealed by the inquiry which show that this board was unbusinesslike.  I believe they were a very honest body, but they were unbusinesslike in their method of dealing with certain matters.  For example, the equipment for the new Ringsend hospital was purchased for that hospital and the corporation paid over £1,000, but the equipment was not sent to Ringsend.  It was brought to the Cork Street Hospital, and the older material sent from there to the Ringsend hospital; in other words, the new hospital had old equipment, and apparently the board and the medical superintendent did not know anything about it.  If they knew nothing about it, they were not doing their business. There was also the question of petrol&mdash; a small question&mdash;and the position by which the medical superintendent was allowed to take petrol.  He paid for it, of course, but he got much more than he would ordinarily be entitled to.</P>

I do not want any prosecution&mdash;I should be very sorry to see a prosecution&mdash;but if there is, it will not be due to anything I say, but to what appears in the White Paper with which we have been furnished.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly.  It may be that that has happened because they say they are sending it on to the Minister for Supplies, but so far as the Minister for Local Government is concerned, he did not know that at the time.  He evidently thought it was not, or he would not send it to the Minister for Supplies.  To him it appeared that this board, through inadvertence, through not knowing what was going on, allowed this to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am trying to point out is that all this shows that the members of the board were not aware of how the hospital was being conducted.  It shows they were not responsible.  They held their meetings and probably had their bickerings, and probably, because of those bickerings, missed the main points.  That was the trouble and evidently that was in the mind of the Minister or his assistant Minister <Col N="704" /> when he issued this document.  It is a very serious matter if these matters are to be brought up and charges of a very serious nature made.  These charges should not be made lightly.  I would be very sorry to make any charges against any of the members, and I would not do so, because I take it, as Senator Douglas said, they were all excellent members and did their best; but I say that they did not show themselves competent to discharge the duties as the Minister thought they ought to have been discharged.</P>
    <P>I am against the abolition of boards, if it can be avoided.  Unless there are very serious reasons for it, I do not think it should be done, and there is a good deal in what Senator Kingsmill Moore has said, that it is very difficult for the Minister who has not heard the evidence to judge its full effect; but that is the law.  Perhaps it would be advisable to change it so as to give more powers to an inspector&mdash;I would not ask for publication of his report&mdash; such as the power of judgement on particular matters which he has not got at present.  That, however, is an entirely different matter.  If a Minister acts on certain information and on certain reports, properly and judiciously, his actions should not be questioned without very serious cause.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.J. O'Reilly Mr. P.J. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had a considerable amount of experience of dealing with contracts, and, incidentally, I happen to have qualifications in quantity surveying.  I have, as a matter of fact, the highest qualifications that can be obtained&mdash;and so I took a great interest in the technical side of the various arguments.  I do not intend to deal to any great extent with the details, and in fact my purpose in addressing the Seanad is to deal with much larger issues which appear to arise from this inquiry and which are the concern of a great many people in the country at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the contracts in this case, there were two, one of which was the general maintenance contract, which is referred to on page 22, and so far as the statements in the White Paper are concerned, relative to the bills of quantities, I think it must be admitted that the case made by <Col N="705" /> Senator Kingsmill Moore is established beyond doubt.  When we come to the second case, the question of the painting contract, I would be inclined to say that there was an error of judgment by the board but before going further, before accusing the board who are presumably a body of honourable men, of being guilty of anything more serious than an error of judgment, I should like to see these people in the flesh and have a talk with them myself.  If the board feels that one of its members has a special knowledge, that that man is impartial and is not likely to be affected by the contract, if, in their desire to economise, they think that he would be capable of drawing up a specification, then I do not think that they should be accused of doing anything deliberately wrong.  Personally I think they were rather unwise because the amount of money saved by the drawing up of the specification was inconsiderable and it would have been better perhaps for the board to have employed an architect or some person outside of themselves.  I would say that there may have been an error of judgment in that matter but if boards are to be accused and abolished because of every error of judgment they may make, we shall have no boards in existence at all; all our boards would soon disappear.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with cases of contracts again and again and I know the position in which boards very often find themselves.  I can give particulars of one case that occurred quite recently. It concerns a contract for the erection of a building, and I think six or seven people tendered.  The tender of one of these people was about £500 or £600 below the amount of the next lowest tender.  The tenders varied from about £500 to £1,000 above the lowest tender.  We decided to accept the lowest tender but at the next meeting we had a letter from this man refusing to go on with the contract on the ground that he had since found out that he was so very much below the other people who tendered.  The board was in a different position in that case because the figures had been exposed.  When you advertise again, <Col N="706" /> the figures are known and the question then arises as to how contractors, aware of what is being done, are going to arrange their tenders.  The board in this case would appear to have recognised that difficulty and they asked five people to tender.  Again, I am assuming that these five persons were decent people&mdash;people who could be relied upon.  <i>Prima facie</i>, it would appear to me at any rate that the board acted as a body of honourable men, because the tenders received from these five people were above the higher of the two tenders previously received.  They could have made their tenders 5/- or 10/-, an insignificant amount, below the tender and secured the contract but the tenders were actually above those previously received.</P>
    <P>I can see that it might also be alleged that the person who tendered at £944 could have said: &ldquo;We can arrange our tenders so that we can all be above the higher of the two first received.&rdquo;  If that is the allegation&mdash; it seems that could be alleged and that may be at the back of the mind of the Minister or the inspector&mdash;it is a serious position.  It is a position that occurs very frequently in business.  I have had a good deal of experience in connection with contracts and of trying to meet the tricks of the trade, if I might so refer to them, resorted to by contractors.  We find a person going below a certain figure on certain items and putting up the figures on other items.  His total would appear to be the lowest tender until it is very carefully examined by the architect. Very frequently while his tender appears to be the lowest, it would actually prove to be considerably higher than other tenders.  Any architect who knows his business at all is aware of that danger.  You have got to keep your eyes open the whole time.  Unless you do so, there are some curious results.  As regards the painting contract there has been a reference, I think, to a sum of £200, that was a provisional item.  It was suggested this morning that that £200, while being a provisional sum, was paid in addition to the sums charged for extras.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Since that suggestion was made, I have got hold of the facts and the House would probably like to know them.  I have been in communication with the architect. He says that the whole of the contingency item was exhausted and that it was all accounted for in connection with the settling up of extras.  That should settle any difficulty in regard to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Had it been a fact that the £200 was paid in addition to the other payments, then I say the architect was responsible and should have been surcharged for that amount. That was his responsibility, not the responsibility of the board.  My personal opinion is that in one of the two cases, that is the general maintenance case, the White Paper fails to establish the Minister's case.  I think the evidence goes overwhelmingly to show that.  In the case of the other contract the most that can be said is that there would appear to have been an error of judgment and I should like to know the people who were the members of the board before coming to a final decision on that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point about the gatekeeper's dismissal, a rather peculiar contradiction occurs.  On the one hand throughout the report it is stated that the board were recommended to do certain things and they refused to do those things because, had they done them, extra expense would have been involved.  When it comes to the gatekeeper, we are told that the board in order to avoid the necessity of making another appointment decided that the wife of the caretaker would occasionally hold the fort while the husband was engaged temporarily on other work.  There is a bit of a contradiction there because on the one hand when the board does economise they are blamed in the report and when they failed to expend money in another direction they are blamed for that too, so that the position is rather peculiar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made by some Senators &mdash; it may have been Senator Magennis; I forget for the moment&mdash;to this question of dual control.  I know <Col N="708" /> that the Department with which I have been connected for a long time does not believe in dual control.  I think anyone who has the slightest experience of a mixture of administrative and technical work will see at once that there must be some one person exercising general control over both sides, otherwise there is a cause for constant friction internally.  I do say that, to the extent it is possible, such people should be relieved of drudgery and all assistance possible should be given, but in the long run one person must control both functions.  There is a reference on page 27 of the report which I think is rather remarkable.  I think it was rather small on the part of the authors of the report to put it there. Here is the doctor faced with a very serious condition of affairs; nurses are not forthcoming and he then puts up innocently the suggestion to the board regarding a means which will ensure a supply of suitable persons.  He does not force that down the throats of the board.  He simply submits it to them. Then the chairman says that this report should be circulated to the members. The medical officer is blamed for doing that.  The suggestion is that that was a wrong thing for him to do. I would venture to say that that is simply implementing something which is killing this country, something that will make it die and fade off the face of the earth.  Because officers generally know that they will not get the smallest bit of thanks for doing the slightest thing outside their duty, the very souls of those officers and the soul of the whole system are being destroyed.  Here is an officer who has exercised a bit of initiative, and he is condemned for having done so.</P>
    <P>On page 28 there is a reference to the effect that there was no recorded evidence of any direction being given to the medical superintendent to investigate and submit proposals. There again is the military discipline, the soul-destroying attitude, brought in.  I see that Senators are incredulous about that, but I know what I am talking about in connection with this matter.  Again, on pages 31 and 32, there are some very curious references to the figures of 1/7 per day for the patients and 2/6 for the other people. <Col N="709" /> Those, I think, are rather small, and have been fairly well explained by the lady in charge.  To my mind&mdash;and I know exactly what I am talking about, because I have been in the habit of making calculations and giving statistics&mdash;it is a reasonable explanation.</P>
    <P>What is the constitution of the board itself?  I find there are 20 members; seven, apparently, are appointed from the City of Dublin Corporation; three by the board of health; seven of them are what I will call the old members, those who have carried forward perhaps prejudices from historic times; and three are appointed by the Minister.  Well, the three appointed by the Minister have to contend with the 17 other people. Of those, three are appointed by the board of health, and seven by the old members, and, therefore, if we consider the constitution of the board it seems to be a reasonably satisfactory one, a constitution calculated to secure an expression of public opinion that is fairly characteristic of a good cross-section. There is one thing that I think should have been done as a result of this inquiry, and that is to amend the Act appointing this board. Personally, I think as long as those three privileged members are there, there will be no peace.  There could not be any peace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I can answer that question by reading a minute which was made by the board requesting the Minister</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to give instructions for the immediate discontinuance of the practice, which has been in operation for a considerable time, of periodic visits of certain members of the board to the Department to discuss the affairs of the hospital board. Such visits are made without the sanction of the board; no intimation is given to the board by those members that these visits are intended, and no reports are made by them to the board of what transpires at such visits.  We regard such unauthorised visits as calculated to excite mutual mistrust between the board and the Department, and have reason to believe that they have already had and must have mischievous effects in that connection, and we consider that if at any time it is deemed desirable that representations be made by the board to the Department, other than by written communications, such representations shall be made by representatives of the board, duly appointed, and not otherwise&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That is dated 22nd May, 1941.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>That merely means that certain members acted in a particular way of which that minute disapproves.  It certainly does not establish privilege.</P>

      <P>I wanted to save the time of the House by not reading the whole of this.  The minute begins:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As it is apparent, from the letters from the Department dated 7th May, 14th May, and 21st May, 1941, that the desire of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is that the relations between this board of the Cork Street Fever Hospital and his Department shall be confined to written communications between them, we request the Minister&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and then it goes on.  The point was that other members of the board wanted to visit the Department, and <Col N="711" /> were told that they may not do it. On the other hand, the Minister's representatives were received every time.</P>

Beyond that individual, whose name I only discovered accidentally a short time ago, I do not know any of the other members at all.  I started off here to say something which I think is more important than the Cork Street Fever Hospital inquiry, but, before I start on what I consider the bigger issues involved, I should just like to refer to a point regarding the privilege mentioned by Senator O'Dea.  It appears that this report of the inspector could not be regarded as privileged, and that that is a reason why it should not be published, but I presume that if, as a result of something done during this inquiry, some particular individual suffers, that individual is entitled to take proceedings, and that in order to enable him to proceed he can demand discovery of documents.  I do not know.  The legal men present can say whether the court will order the discovery of the report of the inspector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is that they would not, if the Minister <Col N="712" /> makes an affidavit that it is contrary to the interests of the State.  If he states anything less than that, the court will order it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.J. O'Reilly Mr. P.J. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I myself was engaged on a case which took ten days in the High Court, and I got discovery of documents.  The files of certain Government Departments were produced in court.  If that report were produced in court, I suppose the fact of its production there might give it a certain cover, but I do not know to what extent the individual would still be entitled to attack the author of the things in it.</P>
      <P>Before I come to the larger issues to which I have referred, I should just like to apologise to Senator Magennis for an interruption I made last night. I have the highest possible respect for the Senator.  I expressed my gratitude to him for a certain attitude which he adopted here on several occasions, and I still feel in that way towards him.  I raised the question last night as to whether Senator Magennis was entitled to quote the opinions of Dr. Moorhead and various other people.  I do not think we are concerned with the opinions of Dr. Moorhead or of anybody else.  We are concerned with an investigation of, and an ascertainment of, the facts, and as I had not read that pamphlet I felt rather handicapped, because it seemed to me that it was not the White Paper, but this particular pamphlet, that was under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were some regrettable personalities introduced even prior to this discussion yesterday afternoon.  I associate these personalities with some circulars that were issued recently in connection with the Thomas Davis centenary celebrations.  I think everyone here knows that the spirit of that man was a large one, that his idea was that this nation must integrate all its elements sooner or later if we are going to be a great nation.  Every great Irishman has felt the same.  I think, therefore, it is a pity that people like the Society of Friends who were mentioned last night, and various other personalities, were introduced at all. But since they were introduced I think <Col N="713" /> everyone present will admit that, whatever we may think about other bodies, the members of the Society of Friends have always been highly respected here.  They have been looked upon as genuine Christians.  I often think, when passing by their final resting-places and seeing that there is no difference in the gravestones at the end, that they have a high degree of Christianity.  Therefore I think it was very cruel to reflect upon such people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator say who made any reflection on them?  I did not hear the least reflection cast upon them by anybody who spoke here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.J. O'Reilly Mr. P.J. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Kingsmill Moore was rather severely castigated because he is supposed to have some connection with other documents, and for various things which he said. There is the saying: &ldquo;Much is forgiven her because she hath suffered much.&rdquo; Now I think it was obvious to all of us that the Senator has suffered a great deal in connection with this.  It was fairly obvious that he has suffered much in spirit.  We all look upon him, and admire him, as a perfectly honest man.  He may be very wrong in his opinions.  I am not going to exercise judgment on that, but I think we must all be satisfied that he was perfectly honest and straightforward in explaining this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the question of inquiries in general.  Some time ago I read a book written by two Italian professors, now associated with Harvard University, in which they gave the origin of this inquiry system.  They traced it back to the Fascist system in Italy.  They pointed out that if a body in any part of Italy did not agree with the central body of the Fascist organisation it was disbanded.  Ultimately, this system of dissolving bodies was carried over to America, so that we got it in a roundabout fashion here. The feeling of our people generally about the system is that it is destroying all idea of democracy.  The feeling in the country is that a board is already doomed even before an inquiry is held.  That is the general opinion of the people.  There is the old saying: <Col N="714" />&ldquo;Whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad.&rdquo;  We may change that slightly and say: &ldquo;Whom the Government in power wish to destroy, they first hold an inquiry.&rdquo;  That would be the modern equivalent of the old saying.</P>
    <P>We have then this inquiry system. Is it doing any good at all?  Is it making the country one bit purer?  Is it making our public men more sensitive to the nature of the very great trust that is given to them?  I cannot see it, because I imagine that, while the present Government is in power, they may have certain difficulties with certain people down the country.  They will decide then, when these difficulties accumulate, that the only way of dealing with them is to destroy them &mdash;to abolish them.  If another Government came into power, let us call it the Fine Gael Government, exactly the same thing would occur.  The Fine Gael Government would at once proceed to abolish its opponents down the country.  I believe that, as a matter of fact, this inquiry system originated here with the Fine Gael Government, or the predecessors of it. My suggestion is&mdash;Senator O'Dea came very close to it and I was afraid that he was going to anticipate me altogether because he said that the powers of the inspectors should be increased and should be of a judicial character &mdash; that there should be a further development of that argument, and that it is the courts that should hold these inquiries.  They should be regular judicial proceedings, and the Minister should have nothing whatever to do with them.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;would be to abolish this inquiry system for my own safety because it is enraging the people.  If I wanted to get a popular vote, it is the first thing I would do in order to secure a big number of votes. There is one other point that, in an assembly of this kind, we need not be afraid to speak in accordance with the sentiments expressed in the Constitution. We need not be afraid to say that this is a Catholic nation, and that this is a Catholic assembly.  We need not be afraid to stand up for Catholic philosophy, and Catholic philosophy, as I understand it, teaches that the interference of the State in certain directions should be reduced to the minimum.  Where there is a board endeavouring to exercise initiative, it should not be within the power of any State, and particularly a Catholic State, to abolish it in an undemocratic arbitrary fashion.  A board of that sort should be forgiven quite a lot unless it has been established that the only place of safety for it is within the walls of some of our prisons, but that has not been suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point that was made, that the board did not see that <Col N="716" /> tin cans were in certain places; that it did not see this, that and the other. These, I suggest, would be matters for the officials of the board, and if anyone is to be blamed for them it is, I suggest, the officials and not the members of the board.  They cannot reasonably be expected to deal with matters of detail, as to where tin cans and things like that are to be put.  They are expected to deal with big general questions of policy.  It is only when it is clearly shown that recommendations by the officials, to have certain matters done in order to enable them to carry out their duties, were not approved of, that the board should be blamed.</P>
    <P>That is all that I have to say.  I was slightly put off my track by Senator Magennis.  I want to assure him that when I interrupted him last night I really felt a bit embarrassed by not having before me the document from which he was quoting.  I felt rather handicapped by that.  I do hope that, as a result of this debate and as a finale to it, the Government will think seriously of changing this whole inquiry system, because, as I have said, it is enraging the people and destroying all sense of responsibility amongst them.  I hope that the reforms suggested by those associated with this inquiry into the Cork Street Hospital will stand out in the annals of the country, and that something of extreme importance, something that will tend to give a better direction to local government in the future, will eventuate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought, when the debate commenced, that Senator Kingsmill Moore was to be allowed latitude to discuss the circumstances in which the Board of Cork Street Hospital was abolished and that there would be a reply from the Government or from somebody competent to put the Government point of view regarding the decision to abolish the board. Instead of that, we have had a very <Col N="717" /> wide discussion of all kinds of matters and all kinds of opinions have been advanced.  I do not desire to follow along those lines, but I should like to find out, if I can, what it is we are aiming at in the discussion.  At the outset, I thought the proposal or the demand amounted to this: that the report of the inspector would be made available to the public.  I can appreciate the point made by Senator O'Dea and I am not in a position to say whether there is any particular objection to the publication of the report or not, although in this particular case it seems to me that the Minister's best defence would have been a publication of the report.  I am not arguing that that should be done because I do not know what is the Departmental practice.  If the Departmental practice is to regard these documents as private, I can well imagine that there would be written into them views and statements that would never be written in if the inspectors believed the documents would be published.  I am not competent, and we here are not competent, to decide that issue and it seems to me that we are wasting a lot of time talking about it.</P>
      <P>There might be some procedure by which we could get at the bottom of this.  If there were a proposal to set up a select committee of this House or a small committee to deal with the whole matter, it might get us somewhere and might be a sensible proposition, that is, if the House wants to be informed of the facts and of the rights and wrongs.  It seems to me the only practicable way is to set up a select committee or a small body of members, indifferently chosen from all sides of the House, to find out the facts and to report to the House at a later stage.  The point I want to make in particular is, we have heard the statements made on both sides&mdash;I should say on all sides&mdash;of this discussion, because it appears to me there are more than two sides to it.</P>

      <P>We have had the White Paper and when all this is added up, I ask myself, has the case been established <Col N="718" /> for the abolition of this board? I listened to Senator O'Dea and to a number of speakers who, I thought, might be taking the Minister's side of the discussion.  I may be doing them an injustice, I do not know, but it seemed to me that certain speakers here were favourable to the Minister's point of view.  But not one of them suggested that a case had been established for abolishing the board.  I do not want to pursue that matter further.  I was not at the Mansion House meeting and I know nothing of what happened there.  I have read very little about the matter.  I have not read the newspaper letters.  I have read the White Paper and I have listened to the speeches made here but I did not gather from them that a case has been made for the abolition of this board and I want to say, like some other speakers, that I am very much opposed to any public board being abolished unless there is a clear case that, not alone is it incompetent, but that it is acting in a mischievous manner.  Even an incompetent board is better than no board, in my opinion. If democracy means anything, it means that the people down at the bottom, the people in the parish, should have some recognised power to do their own business so far as it can be done within the radius of the parish and so on, up through the different areas and counties, until we come to the National Assembly.</P>

      <P>This board was in a peculiar position in relation to the Department inasmuch as it is not a popularly elected board.  The Dublin County Council was abolished and a commissioner was appointed to run its affairs.  Some people say he runs them well.  There is a lot of agreement on that point, I may say.  Some people think he runs them very badly.  I am not discussing that now.  In this case a number of people gave their time voluntarily to do a great social service. I am inclined to think that a Minister who had regard for the desire of a large number of people in this country to give their services voluntarily for the public good would have encouraged them and, in fact, would have been tolerant with them when they were incapable and incompetent, if they were incapable and incompetent.</P>

      <P>One ought to start by reforming oneself, I should think.  In this case, we have evidence that the board was, at least, conscientious.  I think Senator O'Dea mentioned a while ago that one of the allegations was that the board was unbusinesslike.</P>

      <P>Here was an opportunity, created by the Act of 1936, for the Minister to correct that.  He had the right to appoint a number of members to the board and, therefore, having regard to the unbusinesslike propensities of the existing members, he ought to have found five, six, or seven of the most competent business people he could secure to serve on this board and to show them the right way.  Has the Minister done that?  There is no evidence that the members appointed by the Minister were more businesslike or more competent administrators than those with whom they were working. I want to say this, with all respect to the persons concerned, because I know them very intimately and one of them I regard as a great friend of mine: I think the people who were the instruments that secured the <Col N="720" /> abolition of this board, by making reports to the Minister which led to the inquiry, showed that they had no capacity to do their job.  Instead of working within the board and using their influence and their authority to put the board on the right lines, they simply acted, if I may say so with respect, as pimps.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, yes.  Senator O'Reilly referred to the practice of holding inquiries.  I think the holding of inquiries of this character is undesirable. First and foremost, no charge appears to be formulated at all in any of these inquiries.  I am told by people who understand what happens that the Minister simply sends down an inspector to inquire into the administration and it is open to all and sundry, without previous notice to anyone, to tender evidence, whether it is relevant or not.  It must be borne in mind that the inspector is usually not a lawyer and would not know, any more than I would, whether evidence was proper evidence or not. That is most undesirable but, behind that, there is something vicious, which has not come to light at all.  An illustration of it is an incident which <Col N="721" /> occurred within the last two or three months.  I read in the daily paper for the 25th instant that an inquiry was opened on the previous day, the 24th, in Portlaoighise, concerning the administration of its functions by the Laoighis County Council.  Now the extraordinary thing is that I happened to be in Portlaoighise on the 17th May last, when a gentleman friend of mine told me: &ldquo;An inquiry has been ordered into the administration of the affairs of the Laoighis County Council and there will be some of the boys in trouble.&rdquo;&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;  I asked, &ldquo;is it public?&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The inquiry is over and this will not prejudice the result. This is a point which should be made available in judging the case before us now.  I could be informed on the 17th May that this inquiry had been ordered, but when I met six members of the Laoighis County Council next day, not one of them knew a word about it.  I then made inquiries as to where the information came from and discovered it came from a gentleman who holds a public office in the neighbouring County of Offaly.  He apparently advised some friends that he had been in Dublin and was told by some of his political friends in Dublin that the inquiry was to be ordered and he told those fellows: &ldquo;Keep your eyes and ears open, to see you do not get into trouble.&rdquo;  It is a scandalous state of affairs if inquiries of that kind are ordered and discussed with certain politicians down the country before the facts are made known to the authority whose life is being investigated.  It is desirable that Senators realise that notwithstanding the eight hours' discussion we have had here, there are <Col N="722" /> certain aspects that have not been touched on at all.  There are certain features colouring the administration of local government which seem to be very undesirable and it is, in fact, these other hidden things that are at stake now, rather than the abolition of the Cork Street Hospital Board.</P>
      <P>This debate has already gone on for eight hours and I do not imagine it can go on indefinitely.  The whole discussion will be useless if there are merely assertions on one side or the other.  It will have served no purpose unless we can decide that, having listened to the matter, we have finished with it, those concerned having vindicated their views or, alternatively, that we take a serious view of the abolition of this board in particular and wish to be informed of the facts.  In the latter case, our only way is to appoint a small committee from the members of the House to make that investigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak until I heard the remarks from the last speaker, with whom I am in very close agreement, indeed.  I am sure the records of this House over the last 20 years show numbers of occasions on which I have deplored the tendency towards centralisation of the business of Government Departments, the inclination of the Government to think they know better, and their officials can do better, than the popular representatives.  After all, there is not much essential difference between the Dáil elected by popular vote and the county council also elected on the same franchise.  The Dáil was given very wide powers and, happily, nobody has yet thought of abolishing it.  On the other hand, the local councils are curbed, tied and confined by Ministers and officials who think they know better.  We have a very good example of that in this case.  I am not saying, for the purpose of my argument, whether the board has been as businesslike as is required, but I do say that no one seems to refer, except incidentally, to the Department's method of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this matter, the Department's method must be regarded as lamentable, <Col N="723" /> the very negation of business. If an inquiry can be held into the business methods of a public board, it is only reasonable that there should be some means of inquiring, more or less directly and specifically, into the methods of business of a Government Department.  That seems to be rather a weakness in our administration.  One can bring a motion in either House or can criticise a Minister on the Estimates and can go to the length Parliament sees fit, on an <i>ex parte</i> statement, of passing a vote of no confidence and turing out the Government. Of course, that is not a suitable way to deal with a specific lack of business procedure in regard to some Department of State.</P>
    <P>In this case, the record of the Department in regard to the Cork Street Fever Hospital, if inquired into, would show that the Department's methods were far more unbusinesslike than those charged against the board. It is common knowledge that the Hospitals Commission said in 1933-34 that the provision of these extra beds was an urgent matter.  The board set up a committee, which went into the whole question of the site and submitted a report, in December, 1935, recommending a site.  In January, 1937, the board wrote, asking the Minister's views on their report of December, 1935, and the Minister replied rejecting the site, advising new methods of looking for the site and asking the board to start again.  In 1938, many months afterwards, the Minister approved of the original site recommended by the board.  To make a long story short, the recommendation of 1933 by the Hospitals Commission, to provide extra accommodation was not implemented by 1939, while the cost of the work, if it has to be carried out now, will be enormously higher.  On the facts as I have them, that is due to the dilatory methods of the Local Government Department in dealing with matters that the board brought before them.</P>
    <P>I will take another matter, the appointment of engineers for Cork Street Hospital.  In November, 1938, the board asked the Local Government Department for advice about consulting engineers.  The advice <Col N="724" /> given was followed, a firm was appointed and the Department informed. Ten weeks later the Department refused approval.  There is definitely a case where you could test whether this Government Department is qualified to sit in judgment on the businesslike conduct of other people. Ten weeks it took to refuse approval of certain names submitted.  The board again asked what the Department wanted, and following new instructions, appointed an engineer, but four months later the Department refused approval of the appointment. Six and a half months later, a year after advice was asked, the Department decided that two engineers were necessary.  Again the board concurred and within six weeks engineers were appointed.  Take the case of the disinfector. It was nearly worn out and sanction was sought to buy a new one.  Sixteen months went by before this was granted and then only because the hospital insurance company refused to continue the insurance. Coming to the X-ray department, it was hard to get X-ray apparatus during the war.  One was needed for Cork Street, and there was a chance of a secondhand one, which had hardly been used, at an advantageous price.  The board applied for sanction on the 4th July, 5th July, 20th September, 1940, and on March 5th, 1941.  The Minister's first reply came on 24th March, 1941, after eight months, and then it was a set of queries.  I only mention these points because they have not been adequately stressed.  When you make charges against a board I think the record of the people making the charges deserves to be investigated.  When I find people with a record of that kind sitting in judgment and abolishing boards the members of which have for years given loyal service to the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene only because I could not allow the comments made by Senator O'Dea to pass without putting myself on record as being totally opposed to portion of them.  Senator O'Dea for whom I had until this afternoon the greatest respect as a solicitor, and as a man of common sense, must have had I am afraid some sort of slight hiatus when dealing with the question of law, as far as privilege of publication is concerned. I have here a report published by other inspector in respect to an accident on the railway, and if anybody is going to suggest that anything the inspector said in that report could form the subject of a libel action against him, I am afraid, if they go to a judge on those lines, they are going to find out their mistake very quickly and have to pay the inspector's costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why the report was published; it was innocuous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter in the slightest from the point of view of law, and I am only dealing with it from that point of view.  If an inspector makes a statement in the course of his duties, and if that statement is subsequently published, unless there was malice or such recklessness as would amount to malice behind it, as a matter of law the inspector is completely and absolutely protected and privileged.  I am equally clear as a matter of law that there is no law which compels a Parliamentary Secretary or Minister to publish the report of the inspector. Whether a report of an inspector is published or not is a question that comes within the realm of purely public policy as apart from law.  But the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary, in the memorandum sent out from <Col N="726" /> the Department, went to great pains to show that there was no legal obligation to publish.  I do not think it was really suggested that there was any legal obligation to publish.  If it was, I think it should not have been suggested.  The fact is that there was, either rightly or wrongly, a very substantial number of people who felt that a grave injustice had been done.  When a very substantial number of people believe that a grave injustice has been done, then I suggest it is good public policy to allay that feeling, to prove as my friend on the opposite benches said that there was no injustice.  Taking it from that point of view, I suggest that as a matter of good public policy it is desirable to prove, if it is a fact, that there has been no injustice.  Whether that is proved by publishing the inspector's report, by setting up a select committee, which I suggested to Senator Duffy, or by setting up a judicial tribunal is a matter of complete indifference to me.  But I suggest that, when a very substantial body of people feel that this is a matter of public policy, it is desirable to allay that feeling.</P>
      <P>I fail to appreciate what exactly Senator O Buachalla meant by his speech, unless it is one of two things: unless it meant that the board were guilty of corruption, or unless it meant that it was all founded purely on the basis of the one contingency item of £200, which presumably can be found out.  I gathered from Senator O Buachalla, and he will correct me if I am wrong, that he was charging that board with corruption of one sort or another.  If that is so, then I think it is even more necessary that there should be a judicial inquiry or an inquiry by a select committee of the House.  If it is not so, I will be glad to hear that my interpretation of his remarks was entirely wrong and, needless to say, if he assures me that my interpretation was wrong, it will be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact remains that we heard a very great number of statements.  So far as I could hear, no statement was made by Senator Hearne which dealt with any facts, nor was there any <Col N="727" /> statement by Senator O Buachalla which dealt with any facts, except the question of this one contingency item. It always gives me very great pleasure to listen to Senator Magennis.  Perhaps no man in this House has such a vocabulary and to listen to him is always a matter of great pleasure to me.  But I would suggest that he did not deal at all with the charges made by Senator Kingsmill Moore.  It seems to me, therefore, that the situation is one in which no attempt has been made so far to justify the action taken, that a large number of people feel that they are labouring under an injustice and that, in these circumstances, as a matter of public policy, not as a matter of law, some step should be taken by the Minister or by this House &mdash;it is immaterial which&mdash;to set up a tribunal or a select committee and let that tribunal or select committee report on the facts without, if you like, bringing in the almost constitutional question of whether the report of the inspector should be published.</P>
    <P>Senator Kingsmill Moore has handed me a note stating that he has already informed the House about the contingency item.  I was not in the House at the time as I was out telephoning.  In that case the whole of Senator Hearne's argument falls to the ground, though perhaps he might term it a lawyer's smoke-screen, as he termed another interjection of mine.  But, above all, to term anything in this discussion a lawyer's smoke-screen would come rather badly from a Senator supporting the Parliamentary Secretary who quotes Sir John Simon, Lord Moulton, Lord Haldane, Lord Shaw, and Lord Parmoor.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to enter into an analysis of the White <Col N="728" /> Paper or the other literature circulated in connection with this matter. I should like to approach it from the point of view of the ordinary citizen who would not have these documents at his disposal to help him in forming an opinion, or from the point of view of any visitor who might have been here since the discussion was initiated yesterday by what I consider the excellent case made by Senator Kingsmill Moore, which impressed me very considerably. I listened with rapt attention to his exposition of his side of the question and also to the opposite view put forward by Senator Magennis, Senator O Buachalla and Senator O'Dea.  Approaching the matter as an ordinary citizen would, without having access to any of the documents quoted, I can only come to the conclusion that the only way the mind of the ordinary person would be set at rest is by the publication of the report. Though it is not incumbent on the Minister to publish it, it would not be illegal for him to publish it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a person who was for a very considerable time connected with public bodies, I am of the opinion that, if the affairs of several public bodies in this country were supervised in the manner in which the affairs of the Dublin Fever Hospital were, very few would survive abolition.  I have known a case where a tender was submitted and accepted and afterwards, because the lowest tenderer made a plea that he filled up the tender under a misapprehension or that he made a mistake in the figures, he was allowed by the committee, if the Minister would sanction it, to alter his tender with a view to bringing the amount up to what might be considered reasonable for the work to be done.  I certainly was amused with the readiness or the quickness, if I may use that word, with which certain people, in justification of the attitude of the Ministry, rushed into the quotation of the opinions of certain British law lords as to what is right or not right so far as this country is concerned. As a citizen, I should like the Government to be able to justify their conduct, as I am sure they can, without invoking the opinions of eminent <Col N="729" /> law lords on the other side of the channel.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator O Buachalla who inquired whether there was a report as a result of this inquiry.  I would imagine that, when the Minister ordered an inquiry into the manner in which the board was discharging its duties and sent an inspector to take evidence, the result of that man's labours would not be the mere submission of the evidence in the form of question and answer but the submission of a report as to the manner in which the particular body whose conduct he was investigating carried out their duties.  I hold that this whole question, if it is left as it is, may create a very bad taste in the country, and as the people interested in this matter and who feel aggrieved would be satisfied if the report were published, I hold that an unanswerable case has been made for its publication.  I imagine that that report would be a privileged document, and I cannot visualise any circumstances in which the inspector or any of those concerned would suffer as a result of its publication. It would clear the air very much if it is done, and I sincerely hope that, if the discussion here will serve no other useful purpose, it will lead, at least, to a decision on the Minister's part to make that report available to the general public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirligh, Senator Kingsmill Moore opened up this particular debate with a three hours' speech which he punctuated occasionally by emotion, well calculated, I thought, not to interfere with the rest of his speech.  Now I do not know why Senator Kingsmill Moore and those who are associated with him in this particular case have come to the conclusion that the Irish people have no brains to judge a situation for themselves.  The ordinary people are not going to be led away by Senator Kingsmill Moore's hysteria, or by hysteria worked up at Mansion House meetings, which are only allowed to be addressed by one particular side.  Senator Douglas, supporting Senator Kingsmill Moore, said that there was not sufficient evidence in the White Paper and the other documents circulated to convince him that the <Col N="730" /> board should have been abolished by the Minister, and Senator Kingsmill Moore, in reply to Senator Professor Magennis, said that the Minister was determined to abolish the board no matter what the evidence was.</P>
      <P>Now the people are going to be allowed to judge for themselves whether the Minister was right or whether the Minister was wrong.  The Minister has stated that he took his decision upon a perusal of the evidence submitted to him as evidence which had been given at the board.  That evidence is going to be published and the people can decide whether the Minister was right in his judgment in abolishing the board or not.  I do not propose to go into the rights or the wrongs of the matter at all.  I believe that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, being anxious to see that the affairs of local authorities would be conducted in a reasonable manner, would not abolish the board if there was any reasonable chance that they would be so conducted or that they had been so conducted by this particular board of the Dublin Fever Hospital.  The evidence will be published, and the people can judge whether the Minister had sufficient evidence at his disposal to enable him to arrive at his decision and whether, in their opinion, his decision was a proper one in all the circumstances. One speech that I must say I resented contained an allegation by Senator Duffy that three men of public spirit, who agreed to go on this board, as representatives of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, acted as pimps.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, he should not have said it at all.  I think that if Senator Duffy reads the letter which these three gentlemen sent to their own board as to the matters about which they had grave complaint to make, he would agree that he has no right to say that they acted in any dishonourable or underhand way, but that the action they took was dictated by their sense of responsibility to the general taxpayers of this country, to the ratepayers of County Dublin, to the welfare of the patients who have to attend that institution, and to the welfare of <Col N="731" /> the staff who have to attend the patients within that institution.  Portion of the letter which they sent to the Minister and which they sent to the board complained about the manner in which two employees of the board were dismissed, and they stated quite definitely their opinion to the rest of the members on the board, that the dismissal of these two lowly-paid members of their staff, a gate-keeper and his wife, was marked by &ldquo;a callous indifference in regard to the rights of the persons concerned, and displayed a most undesirable manner of dealing with the employees.&rdquo; I think that that is true, from the evidence that I have seen published in the White Paper.  It was true that in regard to this particular case the members of the board who voted for the dismissal of these people did act with callous indifference in regard to the rights of the two people concerned.  Senator Professor Magennis dealt pretty fully with that, and other Senators have dealt with other aspects of the case, and so I shall not go further with it, but I must say that I did resent that coming from Senator Duffy, and I think he had no right to say it.</P>
      <P>Senator Kingsmill Moore's case was based, as I stated in the beginning, on the ground that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health or his Parliamentary Secretary had made up his mind that no matter what the evidence was the board was going to be abolished.  He also made great play here yesterday, and at great length, that there was some sinister purpose behind the withholding from the public of the report of the inspector who held the investigation and who sent that evidence to the Minister.  To emphasise the sinister aspect, or the alleged sinister aspect, of this, he made the assertion that this was the first time that a report was withheld when demanded by any number of people.  He corrected that by saying that the reports were usually published and then, when challenged on that, he corrected himself further by saying that there was one report published, and that that was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

According to my recollection, he said that the report regarding the Cork Fire Brigade was circulated.  I know that he will try to run away from that now, because Senator O'Dea gave him a copy of the letter sent to the Lord Mayor of Cork in which the Minister said that he had made up his mind in the case of the Cork inquiry, as he did in the case of the Cork Street Hospital inquiry, upon the evidence collected by his investigator.</P>

      <P>On the verbatim report of the evidence tendered at the inquiry in relation to the terms of reference. That was what the Minister made up his mind upon in relation to the Cork fire inquiry and it was on similar material that he made up his mind in relation to the inquiry into the Cork Street Fever Hospital.  The minutes of evidence will be presented to the public and the public can decide whether the Minister was right or wrong in his decision to abolish the board.  If the Minister attempted to publish the reports of inspectors, I have no doubt that, in many cases, he would be gravely criticised.  He would be asked how he expected inspectors in the future to inquire into cases and give him their mind freely if he was going to publish the minutes made by <Col N="733" /> the inspectors for his information. Anybody who has acted in a ministerial capacity for a number of years will have had demands made upon him, time and again, for the giving to some person or persons, or to the public at large, of documents and reports which contain the advice of subordinate officials.  I have had to resist that demand and to point out that those reports were made to me by army officers or civil servants, as the case might be, for my information and that, when they were being written, the officer concerned had not the consideration before his mind that they would be circulated to anybody but the Minister.  I had steadfastly to resist requests for the giving of confidential documents made to me as Minister to those who had no right to receive them and I believe I was absolutely right in that.  I do not care what the law is in other countries but I think that the Minister for Local Government was quite entitled, when the case was made that he was doing something unprecedented, to point to the law and to precedents in other countries.  I am relying on my own good sense.  I know perfectly well that, if I ask a subordinate officer to report to me on a certain matter affecting personalities, he will write with greater freedom and state the facts with greater candour if he is clearly aware that he is writing a confidential report and that the Minister will not break the confidence. It is of the utmost importance, if we are to continue this system of sending officers of the Minister for Local Government down the country to hold inquiries, that these officers should feel that their duty is done when they present the Minister with the verbatim report of the evidence collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other aspect of this matter to which I take exception. Certain individuals are accustomed to complain about the power of bureaucracy.  If a civil servant had to make decisions without having to bear responsibility for them to the public, we should have a type of bureaucracy which would be very undesirable indeed.  Every Minister of State is absolutely responsible for the official words, actions and omissions of those <Col N="734" /> servants of the State who are under his instructions and it would be a bad thing for this country if a Minister could avoid responsibility for the acts of the civil servants under him.  If he is not responsible, who is?  He is the authority.  He has the right to direct civil servants.  If his directions are within the law, the servants of State under his authority are bound to carry them out.  It would be very bad, indeed, if a Minister could avoid acceptance of responsibility, for, the day he did so, his authority over the servants of State in his Department would be destroyed.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter to which I should like to call attention.  If any individual is to be tried, he should be tried by a person who has to take responsibility to the public for his verdict.  No civil servant can take such responsibility to the public.  If any attempt were made to put such a system into operation, it would be pointed out very quickly that the civil servant in question was subordinate to a Minister and that his verdict might very well be dictated by his Ministerial principal.  Our system of government is set out in the Constitution. We have the Oireachtas, the Government and the judiciary.  If a citizen or a public body is to be tried by a civil servant, if its fate is to hang upon the decision of a civil servant, then that civil servant should be taken out of the usual category and put in the same independent position as the judiciary, with the same tenure of office as is enjoyed by the judges appointed to keep the balance between the Government and the ordinary citizen.  I believe that even if there had been, before this State was set up, precedents in another country for the publication of such reports, we should have ignored those precedents and established a precedent for ourselves and, when a civil servant reports confidentially to a Minister, no matter upon what subject, the Minister should keep that confidence.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into this matter at any great length.  The House has been discussing it for long enough.  It has been said, as I mentioned in my <Col N="735" /> opening remarks, that there was not sufficient evidence given to the Minister to enable him to arrive at his decision with justice.  That question can be decided by the people within, perhaps, a couple of weeks, when they will have at their disposal a transcript of the evidence upon which the Minister made his decision.  I am satisfied from what I have seen that the board in this particular instance acted very callously and unjustly towards some of their own servants, and acted, in regard to the contracts, in a manner which showed that they should no longer be allowed to handle vast sums of public money.  The Minister was quite justified in abolishing them and putting in a commissioner for the time being to run the affairs of that institution. I am of the opinion that the people as a whole will be satisfied when they read the evidence upon which the Minister made up his mind to abolish the board.</P>

If that is so, I wish to withdraw the exoneration of the Minister which I made at an earlier stage and to state that the remarks which I have applied to the Parliamentary Secretary must also be extended to the head of the Department.

      <P>Senator Hearne&mdash;is that correct?  I have one other remark to make.  It has been suggested that because the evidence has not been published, the facts as stated with regard to the contracts have not been exploded.  You can do a lot with oral evidence.  You can believe one side or disbelieve the other side, but where the actual transactions are constituted in documents and where the documents form the transactions, they are themselves the evidence and they cannot be contradicted. When I have produced to this House documents which the White Paper said did not exist and when, moreover, I have shown the documents which actually advised the board, it is futile to talk about oral evidence and it is futile to attempt to exonerate anyone who makes slanderous statements, having those documents either in his possession or procurement, neglecting them and stating the opposite.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first and foremost, to say that the manner in which the Minister approached the discussion on the Second Stage seemed to me very satisfactory.  His attitude was very helpful.  While we might not agree with his views on certain matters, it is satisfactory to know that he expresses those views quite frankly, quite openly and courageously.  It is infinitely more satisfactory that he should do that rather than try merely to cover up his views by saying pleasant things which mean nothing. I was very pleased with the manner in which he dealt with various matters raised on the Second Reading.</P>
      <P>There were one or two things, however, that were referred to in the course of the discussion and perhaps I might be allowed to deal with them. I mentioned, for instance, the importation of timber from Sweden.  On that matter, a person concerned in the building industry talked to me during this week and mentioned that he and some others were concerned in the buying of timber from Sweden, that at the commencement of the discussions their representations were favourably received by the representatives of the Swedish Government, but that at a later stage they were told frankly that Sweden was not prepared to sell timber in Ireland, unless it was paid for in gold.  The Minister referred to that yesterday and said there was no difficulty in using sterling assets in London outside the sterling area, including Sweden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad of that statement, but I want to call his attention to the fact that a very definite statement has been made to me by people concerned, that in fact they were not in a position to use sterling in the case of Sweden, because the Swedish Government were not prepared to sell timber on the basis <Col N="738" /> of payment in sterling.  The suggestion was made that in fact an agreement has been entered into between the Swedish and the British Governments to the effect that timber for these countries would be sold only in Great Britain.  I do not know if that is true, and I do not even desire the Minister to discuss it, if he is not in a position to do so.  I merely want to bring it to his notice because it is at variance with the statement he made yesterday.</P>
    <P>In the course of the discussion on the Bill, one matter was mentioned which, I think, is not going to do us very much good in our relations with other people.  I refer now to the reference by Senator O Buachalla to the position of the New Zealand Government.  He mentioned the statement which was made originally by the present Minister for Local Government some five or six years ago, that the New Zealand Finance Minister came to London on his knees, asking for concessions from the British Government in regard to debts due to Britain.</P>

One of these is New Zealand.  A number of the Ministers of the New Zealand Government are of Irish birth or extraction.  The first Labour Prime Minister of New Zealand was a County Armagh man. The present Deputy Prime Minister is a Country Kerry man and I am drawing the attention to the fact that we ought to bear that in mind.  We might also bear in mind the fact that the late Prime Minister of Australia was a County Cork man and that there are sympathies which should be cultivated <Col N="739" /> between the heads of States and members of Governments having the backgrounds which these men have.</P>

That particular action has been regretted, deplored and repudiated by the governing body of the college and by all the various associations of students connected with the college.  Moreover, the Provost went on a special mission to the Taoiseach and apologised <Col N="740" /> for that incident, and the Taoiseach, I have no doubt, accepted his apology.  As between gentlemen, that should have been the end of the matter, and I think it regrettable that it should have been raised again, and still more regrettable that the Minister should have, by implication, accused me of being in any way sympathetic with or responsible for that very regrettable action.  I should be glad to hear that the Minister no longer accuses me of that crime and withdraws that statement.</P>

I stated that Senator Johnston himself &mdash;not the Provost of Trinity College or any other member on the staff of Trinity or any of the student bodies&mdash; was the spiritual father of the people who celebrated a victory many miles from the battlefront and after the battle was over, because Senator Johnston did exactly the same thing here in this House.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;the expression &lsquo;appropriate minimum rate&rsquo; means the minimum rate of wages fixed from time to time under Section 17 of the Principal Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 1 provides that, where the sum paid by an agricultural employer to an agricultural worker as wages in respect of a wages period is less than the sum which ought at the appropriate minimum rate to have been paid, certain things will follow.  My difficulty is that so far as I am aware that expression &ldquo;appropriate minimum rate&rdquo; is not defined either in the Principal Act or in this Bill.  It would appear that in the event of proceedings under the Principal Act to recover a particular sum of money, some difficulty might arise as to what is meant by &ldquo;appropriate minimum rate&rdquo;.  These rates vary from time to time.  They have been varied, I think, on five or six occasions during the past five years.  In order to clarify the position, I think it desirable that we should define what is meant in this Bill by the expression: &ldquo;appropriate minimum rate&rdquo;.  The definition I am proposing is that it shall be regarded as meaning the wages fixed from time to time under Section 17 of the Principal Act.</P>

We come then to Section 19 of the Principal Act which says:&mdash;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Where an Order fixing any minimum rate of wages has been made by the board under this Act and is in force, every person who, <Col N="742" /> being an agricultural employer, employs any other person who is by virtue of such employment an agricultural worker shall, in cases to which such minimum rate is applicable, pay to such other person wages at a rate not less than the appropriate minimum rate under such Order.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>To delete the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this amendment to ascertain what procedure will be followed when sub-section (2) of Section 2 of the Principal Act is repealed.  That was the sub-section which authorised the Minister to determine certain things, principally what was an agricultural worker under the Principal Act.  A question that arises frequently&mdash;it arises also under other Acts&mdash;is <Col N="743" /> whether a particular person making a claim under the Act is in fact a person to whom the Act applies.  Up to the present the Minister was the authority to decide that.  I am not asking that the Minister should be the authority, but I am drawing attention to the fact that he was the authority and that nothing is being put into the Bill to replace sub-section (2) of the Principal Act.  I gathered on the last occasion that the Minister said that the courts would decide that but a question that occurred to my mind is this: Assuming that a civil action is taken to recover £5 arrears from a farmer, that action, I take it, would be brought in the District Court and I am wondering whether the Minister is satisfied that the district justice would, in fact, determine whether the plaintiff is or is not an agricultural worker to whom the Act applies.  Under other Acts&mdash; one I mentioned on the last day was the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1920&mdash;the High Court was specifically mentioned as the tribunal to determine whether a person was or was not a person to whom the Act of 1920 applied, in other words, whether he was insurable to the purposes of unemployment insurance.  I am just wondering whether in these small cases taken in the District Court the district justice is likely to say that he is the authority and that he will have jurisdiction to determine whether a person is or is not an agricultural worker.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We dealt with this matter on Second Reading to some extent.  On that occasion, I think, I explained to the Seanad that I had come up against certain difficulties from time to time because in the Principal Act it was laid down that the Minister would decide whether the work was agricultural or not.  There are two questions that arise there, (1) the establishment of a fact; and (2) the interpretation in the light of the definitions contained in the Act. On some occasions there have been legal complications and I think the Seanad will agree that, when it comes to a question of that kind, Ministers are not supposed to be competent to decide a question of law.  A Minister may be competent to decide a question <Col N="744" /> of fact but not of law.  As a matter of fact a case of this kind came before the High, Court and the High Court decided that the Minister could not be regarded as competent to decide matters relating to a contract of service, despite the fact that the existence of such a contract is an essential element in the definition of an agricultural worker.  That raises a very great difficulty, as far as I am concerned.  Of course, the High Court judge saw the difficulty and gave his decision in that way.  I think, apart altogether from the High Court decision, Senators will see that it would be more convenient, even for the parties concerned, if the question were decided in court.  Frequently a case was brought before the District Court or the Circuit Court according to the jurisdiction with regard to the amount claimed.  Whatever court it is brought before, it frequently happens that the case has to be adjourned until the Minister gives his decision as to whether it is agricultural work or not.  That puts extra expense on the parties involved and the costs mount up.  I do not think anybody could claim that the judge should not have the decision of this question in future.  He has the law there to guide him.  A definition is given of what an agricultural worker is and he can decide then on that definition.  I think, on the whole, it would be very much better that the judge should have that function in future rather than the Minister.  The Senator raised one other question, as to whether we are leaving a void.  I think it is quite clear that if this section were removed there is no doubt that the judge will have the decision as to whether or not a person is an agricultural worker.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a proposal to change from two years to six years the period during which arrears may be recovered.  The law as it stands, I think, would enable an agricultural worker to sue for and <Col N="745" /> recover moneys due to him, on a determination made under the Principal Act, for any period up to 20 years.  That was the view given on the last occasion as to the time limit.  I do not profess to believe that that time is reasonable but I do think that a workman should not be restricted to two years in recovering arrears due to him.  In most cases the sum will not be very great.  As far as one can judge from the discussions here the last day, the tendency in many cases is to pay more than the Wages Board determination requires.  There will always be a few cases in which employers will try to get away with something less, but those cases will not be numerous, and I think it is only reasonable that, when they are detected, the employers should be required to pay the total sum legally due under the Wages Board determination. I think the Minister should agree to fix the limit not at two years but at six years.  If this were a debt of any other kind, it would not be Statute barred for six years.  A shopkeeper, for instance, who gives credit to a farmer has six years in which to make his claim, and if the claim is established a decree is given, and the consequences follow.  In my opinion, the same law should, in equity, apply in the case of a debt due to the agricultural worker.  If we agree to the insertion of a two years' limit, it is going to have repercussions elsewhere. In considering other cases where debts are involved, it will be cited as an example of what the House has embodied in legislation.  I think that, in reason, the Minister should accept the amendment, so that the amount claimed may be recovered for any period not exceeding six years.</P>

      <P>I think the period of two years is quite sufficient, because, as Senator Duffy has stated, the cases that will arise are very few in proportion to the number of agricultural workers who are getting more than the minimum wage.  I also think that the two years' limit should apply for this reason: take a case where a farmer dies.  Very little accounts are kept between the farmer and his employees. They are paid every week, <Col N="746" /> and, if the farmer dies and his son or the next-of-kin is carrying on the farm, there is no proof whatever as to whether or not the minimum wage had been paid for the six years.  If an agricultural worker comes to the court and swears that he did not get it, ignoring perhaps the perquisites he received, then the judge would have no option but to give a decree.  I believe that that would be very unjust, because there are very few agricultural workers who do not know their rights, and they are not going to let their wages go on for five or six years if they are not getting the full benefit of the law.  I think the two years' limit is sufficient, and I say that very few cases will arise.</P>

      <P>Senator Counihan stated that in many cases the farmer, or his representative in the event of death, would not be in a position to give proof of the wages paid, because of the fact that it is nearly always a cash transaction.  There is something in that, but I would remind Senator Counihan that quite a number of farmers&mdash;those who are wise, at any rate&mdash;insure their workers under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  In that case, they would be compelled by the insurance company to keep a record of the wages paid.  Because of that, I think it would be possible for farmers, in many cases at any rate, to furnish evidence as to the amount of wages paid, but I will agree that there are cases where that would not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if Senator O'Reilly has made a very strong point because, suppose you are employing six men and you get a form to fill up, all you are asked to do is to fill in the total wages paid.  That would not prove very much, I am afraid, in the way the Senator has put it.  As regards the point raised by Senator O'Donovan, I think that what the section means is quite clear.  It is that if a man goes to court to-day he can go back two years, that is, to the 27th July, 1943.  If he was employed at that date, he can go ahead and can take action within two years.  If he was employed on the 27th July, 1943, then, when this Bill becomes an Act, he can claim for the last two years that he was working with that employer.  I would like Senators to keep in mind that we are dealing here with the legal rate that an employer is supposed to pay his employee.  We are not dealing with what has been agreed between them.  If, for instance, the wage at the moment is 42/- or, as it is in most parts of the country, 40/- a week, and if an employer is paying 37/6 a week, because that is the agreement <Col N="748" /> between him and his employee, this Bill, when it becomes an Act, will not deprive that employee of getting the wages that are due to him for 20 years, if he is being paid less than the 37/6 a week that he agreed to.  I think we are not creating any undesirable precedent in that respect because we are not disturbing the existing law as far as it goes between employers and employees.  We are changing the law where there is a difference in the agreement made between an employer and an employee and the wage fixed by the Agricultural Wages Board.  We say that where there is an agreement to work for less than that wage, then the difference between what has been agreed upon and the minimum wage can only be recovered in respect of a period of two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I would like Senators to keep this in mind, that in our experience of the working of the Agricultural Wages Act there has not been very much trouble between the ordinary employer and the ordinary employee. There have been cases where certain farmers, not very many indeed, have paid a bit less than they should have paid, but as a rule these have been discovered within a few months or a year, and things have been made right. The really difficult cases arise, not in ordinary employment of that kind, but, as I pointed out on the Second Reading of the Bill, principally in two classes of cases.  The first is where there is a relative working for a relative, and the second class is where an employee is working for a country shopkeeper.  Senator Duffy pleaded here that two years, or six years, did not mean a whole lot.  I think that on a previous occasion, I quoted certain cases, and would like to quote them again.  There was the case of a widower in the County Tipperary who felt a bit lonely after his wife died.  He had no one in the house with him, and a cousin of his, who was not a very useful agricultural labourer but was a good companion, came to live with him as an agricultural labourer.  At least, that was what he said afterwards.  He was paid a certain amount, he was kept well, he got everything that the employer got, he dined at the same table <Col N="749" /> and was paid a certain amount in the way of pocket money.  But, after six years, they fell out, and then this relative made a claim for £343 12s. 2½d. The farm was a small one.  Luckily he did not succeed&mdash;and I say luckily since I do not think he deserved to succeed because the definition of an agricultural worker was against him. The decision might very easily have been in his favour, so that if he had succeeded, and had got a decree for £343 12s. 2½d., the only thing that could have happened was that the employer would have to give the employee the farm and become an employee himself.</P>
    <P>I want to put it to Senators that you have cases of that kind.  I am sure that if they throw their minds back they will be able to remember cases of the kind themselves, of some rather unfortunate man coming down in the world rather badly.  He goes to work with a cousin of his; he does not like to be regarded as an agricultural labourer, but he works on the place.  The two live together, they dine together and perhaps even drink together in the evenings.  Then they fall out and the employee takes advantage of the Agricultural Wages Act.  Therefore, unless we put some limit to this, he could ruin his employer.</P>
    <P>The second class of case that I quoted on the Second Reading of the Bill was that of the country shopkeeper. I had observed myself, long before the original Act was passed, that many men in the country are prepared to work at a lower wage for a shopkeeper than for a farmer.  But then when the two fall out, the labourer takes advantage of the Agricultural Wages Act.  I have a case of that kind here where the arrears claimed over a period of something like five and a half years amounted to £227.  These are the kind of cases that the agricultural wages committees, the Agricultural Wages Board and the Department have in mind. Both the wages committees and the Wages Board are quite satisfied that, as far as the ordinary straight case between an ordinary employer and an employee goes, a case in which there is no relationship between the two, and where the employer is not a shopkeeper, <Col N="750" /> even if the employee is getting a few shillings a week less than he should be getting, they will be able to deal with such cases within two years.  It is the cases in which relatives and shopkeepers are concerned that give trouble.</P>
    <P>Even Senator Duffy has more or less admitted in his amendment that we are not dealing here with a question of principle but rather with one of expediency, as to how many years it should be.  I think that two years is quite sufficient.  As a matter of fact, I did argue, on a previous occasion, with Senators who were taking the side of the employee, that I felt that if there was a man in their trade unions who was working for less than the wage agreed upon between their trade unions and an employer, they would not take a very kindly view of that employee's action.  I think the Agricultural Wages Board feel much the same.  They are trying to enforce this Act, and feel that they must have the employee on their side as well as the employer, and that if any employee tries to break the morale of his fellow employees in any area, or does anything to vitiate the working of the Act or the activities of the board, that is going to make the working of the Act much more difficult, and we should not have too much sympathy for him.  On the whole if we give him two years's arrears of wages, well, I think we are dealing justly between the two.</P>

      <P>The Minister is under a misapprehension in believing that I am introducing this amendment for the <Col N="751" /> purpose of assisting a workman who deliberately worked at less than the fixed rate.  I am not.  I am endeavouring to penalise his employer who tries to take advantage, not only of the workman, but of his neighbours who are paying the statutory rate.  I agree with the Minister's point of view that there ought not to be very much sympathy for the man who deliberately accepts a rate of wages which is less than the fixed rate, having it in his mind that when he leaves the employment he is going to sue for the difference between the two sums.  I am not offering any sympathy to a man of that type but I am strongly of the opinion that, in fairness to the farmers who have been paying the statutory rate and, many of them, paying more than the statutory rate, the man who gets away with less than the rate, and who thinks he is clever in doing that, should be penalised. The best way to penalise him is to ensure that the workman may recover over a substantial period the amount which remained unpaid.  That is my attitude to it and I think it should appeal to Senator Counihan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>I agree with Senator Duffy in that but the pity of it is that, by trying to deal justly with the employee and to do enough for him, we may appear at the same time to be letting the employer off too lightly.  On that point, I am told that in some case that came before the court, where there was a fairly big amount of arrears to be recovered, the court dealt leniently with the employer and inflicted a very small fine because they considered that this man had suffered enough by being obliged to pay big arrears and therefore they made the fine merely a nominal one.  In future, if the court sees that the employer has not to pay a very big sum by way of arrears they will deal more severely in the matter of the fine.  I think it would be a desirable thing that the employer should not be let off too lightly and I hope he will be dealt with in that way.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a point that may not be relevant on this <Col N="752" /> amendment but which is a very important matter at the present time.  I am sure the Minister will take cognisance of it.  I have in mind a case that occurred in Monaghan.  The custom there is &ldquo;engagement&rdquo; or &ldquo;hiring&rdquo; for a period of five or six months.  That is provided for in the Bill.  The particular case occurred on a fair day, in May.  A farmer, who is also part-owner of a public-house in this town, engaged, in his own house, a servant to work for five or 5½ months at £10, which would scarcely be half the minimum wage for the period. There was also 5/- &ldquo;in earnest&rdquo;&mdash;as it is called.  On the morning after his engagement, the worker went to work on the farm, and worked there from Thursday morning until the following Monday or Tuesday.  He left the employment because he was not satisfied with the conditions&mdash;I will not state what they were&mdash;and there was a prosecution afterwards.  The employer proceeded against him and he was fined £1 before the district justice and 7/- costs.  I raised the matter with the Agricultural Wages Board and the chairman of the Agricultural Wages Board said they could do nothing about it.  Nothing could be done in that case, but he could have stayed on in the place and could have sued and taken the balance of the wages.</P>
      <P>Provision should be made that no employer may take advantage of an employee and, when the employee is not satisfied and leaves the employment, sue him and penalise him.  A full statement was given in the Press at the time.  I think it would be well if the Minister looked into the point. It is not fully relevant in this particular case but it may require some amendment of the Bill.</P>

      <P>In paragraph (b), line 43, after the word &ldquo;worker&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;was less than 12 months in his employment and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is on a somewhat different line.  Section 5 (a) is as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where proceedings, whether criminal or civil, are commenced on or after the passing of this Act in relation to an alleged under-payment by an agricultural employer to an agricultural worker of wages in respect of a wages period&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;and so on.  I am proposing to insert after the word &ldquo;worker&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;was less than 12 months in his employment and&rdquo;.  The section would then read, &ldquo;...in relation to an alleged under-payment by an agricultural employer to an agricultural worker who was less than 12 months in his employment....&rdquo;  This is a case in which the employer is enabled, under this Bill, to go into court and offer as a defence the argument that the employee was, shall we say, subnormal. The Principal Act provides, of course, that an employer who has <Col N="754" /> a workman whom he considers subnormal can go to the Agricultural Wages Board and get a permit to take him out of the Act altogether and make an agreement with the workman to pay him whatever sum is agreed between them.</P>
    <P>In the case contemplated here the employer does not look for the permit. He employs a workman, continues to pay him at much less than the statutory rate and the workman, within two years, sues the employer for the difference between the two sums.  The employer goes into court and says, &ldquo;This man is subnormal&rdquo;&mdash;for one reason or another&mdash;mentally deficient, old, crippled, or something else&mdash;&ldquo;and consequently he is not entitled to the Agricultural Wages Board rate.&rdquo; The court may hold that that is so.  It is utterly unreasonable that that kind of defence should be made available to an employer who, beforehand, was entitled to go and get a permit if one was properly issuable in the case. This new Section 5 takes away the jurisdiction of issuing the certificate from the Wages Board, so far as it applies to cases of deficient payments brought to court.  The district justice is enabled to assume that the permit was granted.  I suggest that that would not be a good defence if the employment continued over a period of four or five years.  I am not proposing to take away that defence in the event of the employment being of short duration, say less than 12 months, but if the employer continues with his workman and never makes an attempt to get an exemption permit within the four or five years, that defence should not be open to him at the end of that period.</P>

      <P>Surely Senator Duffy would understand the kind of situation he is trying to deal with in this amendment by appreciating that it would be far more satisfactory to decide this question by the employer and employee appearing in court before a justice, rather than before the Agricultural Wages Board?  The justice, on seeing the man, would be able to make up his mind as to his physical or mental condition.  You will find a type of individual who is physically unfit or deformed but who is mentally alert and whose brain is very sharp indeed.  He would be prepared to go into employment and, perhaps, take advantage of his employer after being there for some time.</P>
      <P>There is no section in the original Act which has caused more grave dissatisfaction than this.  The employer may have a number of men and one of them may be less efficient than the others, but he is put under obligation to pay the minimum wage to the inefficient man as well as to the others. I agree that, from both employer's and employee's point of view, it is a far more satisfactory method to administer the law and that, if there is a just case, the justice will have no difficulty in making up his mind on seeing the man and the employer will have much more difficulty in persuading the court that he is entitled to an exemption in this case than he would have if he put his application to the Wages Board.  I believe that the employee has greater protection by the method suggested than he would have under the original arrangement and I think from every point of view Senator Duffy should not press this at all.</P>

I <Col N="756" /> know a good many cases where employees have not been fit for full agricultural work and in every case the consent of the inspector of the Department had to be obtained before any agricultural worker over 21 or under 70 could be employed at less than the minimum wage.  I do not know of any farmer but a foolish one who would keep on any man who would give him the opportunity of suing for the minimum wage.  I think the whole position is covered in the original Act and that it would be a lot safer to leave it as it is.</P>

      <P>Whatever views I had about this amendment at first have been strengthened by the case made against it by the last two speakers.  I thought Senators Counihan and Baxter were logical in most of their arguments, even if I disagreed with them, but they have abandoned logic to-day, in arguing against this amendment. This is a very simple case.  A farmer employs an agricultural worker whom he believes to be subnormal.  In that case, the original Act provides that he can obtain an exemption permit, which takes himself and his workman outside the scope of the Act.  Then he can pay the workman 5/- or 10/- a week if he wishes.  I am not proposing to interfere with that, nor is the Minister proposing to amend that section of the Act.  The Minister proposes that, in the event of an employer evading the Act, breaking the laws of this State, and continuing to do that until this workman brings him to court, he will then have at his disposal the defence that the workman is a lunatic.</P>

He has no defence, as the law now stands, to a workman's claim, if he has not got an exemption permit; but he is now offered this defence, that he can say to the court: &ldquo;This man is not a competent workman, he is subnormal, he could not earn a full week's wages.&rdquo;  Then you are back in the position where a district justice has perfect freedom to do as he likes, as there is no guidance.  The justice can say: &ldquo;Ah, he doesn't look much to me&rdquo;.  But that man may have been ten years in the employment of this farmer and may have deteriorated very considerably, for one reason or another, since he was first employed.  The justice may take the view that he is not fully competent and may say: &ldquo;Your claim cannot succeed; if the employer had applied for an exemption permit he probably would have got it and now I am giving him the exemption permit by dismissing your case.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister proposes to make that the law under Section 5 of this Bill.  I am conceding a part of the Minister's claim.  I am prepared to say that if conditions are not changed very much between the time the man entered the employment and the time he took action, let the district justice decide whether the section should run. I am making this proposition, that if a workman has been with a farmer for a considerable time, and if the farmer has defrauded him, it should not be open to the employer to go to court and say the man was subnormal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if Senator Duffy is right in saying that under the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936, the employer is entitled to get a permit.  Section 18 of the Act provides that the permit shall be issued to the worker:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If, on application, the board are satisfied that any person employed or desiring to be employed as an agricultural worker, on time work to which a minimum rate fixed under the Act is applicable is so affected by any physical injury or mental deficiency or any infirmity due to <Col N="758" /> age or to any other cause that he is incapacitated from earning that minimum rate, the board shall grant to the person a permit exempting as from the date of the application, or from any later date specified in the permit, the employment of the worker from the provisions of this Act requiring wages to be paid at not less than the minimum rate, subject to such conditions as may be specified in the permit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There appears to be nothing in the Act which enables the employer to obtain a permit.  That permit is given to the worker, and enables him to obtain work at less than the minimum rate, if incapacitated for the causes set out.  I think there is no mention of employers getting a permit.  This amending section is the first time where an employer can show that the person he has employed is incapacitated by reason of what is mentioned in the section.  Under Section 18 of the original Act it is the person employed must satisfy the board he is incapacitated, to which Senator Duffy moves an amendment that the employer must prove that the man has been less than 12 months in his employment before he can get the advantage of the section.  This section applies only in respect to a wages period.  It may mean that a man may be in the employment of a farmer for a number of years, but his incapacity may be spread over only a small portion of that period.  The section is limited to a wages period.  There may be a number of wages periods.  The district justice should be able to satisfy himself whether the agricultural employer has discharged the onus of proof put on him, so that I do not think any advantage could be given by the adoption of the amendment.  It leaves the matter where it is, and, in the end, the district justice will have to decide whether the agricultural employer has discharged the onus of proof laid on him by the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to Senator Counihan and Senator Baxter, there is no doubt that Senator Duffy has stated the law as it stands.  At present, if a person who is of unsound mind or who is unsound physically takes <Col N="759" /> action against an employer, he would be entitled as an agricultural worker to get the full wages due him, between what he was working for and the minimum wage.  An employer can safeguard himself, when taking on a person of unsound mind or who is unsound physically, by seeing that the board issues a certificate to the employee. As Senator Ryan pointed out, the employee can apply for that certificate before he is employed.  The change we are introducing is that an employer can plead in court afterwards that the person was unsound mentally or physically.  It is true that we give the employer a defence he had not before, but Senators will realise that there is a reason for that.  Unfortunately, we have people&mdash;I do not know if they have them in every other country&mdash;who do not know the law that relates even to their own business. Farmers and employers are not as familiar as they should be even with law that is to their advantage. We had many cases where farmers took on persons who were unsound mentally and physically, and who were entitled to and would have got exemptions if they had applied for them but who found, after four or five years, when action was taken against them that they had no remedy.  Senators will agree that that happens where farmers have no fear that the Agricultural Wages Act will apply to them.  They think that no law could be so unjust as to make them pay the difference between the minimum wage and the wage they had paid.  They carry on for a few years and then find that there is a big bill against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had one case of a deaf mute who worked for a farmer for five or six years at a rate below the minimum wage.  It was looked upon by the court as a case of charity, where the employer kept the man and gave him some pocket money.  When the deaf mute left that employment after some years he took an action for arrears amounting to £210 15s. 0d.  I was familiar with another case of a man who came back from hospital and went to work for an employer who was pressed by the man's friends to give him employment.  He agreed to take <Col N="760" /> him at a small wage and to give the man what his friends described as a pleasant home.  After some years the employee took an action, claiming £183 3s. 5d., and the inspector who was sent down reported that the man was 70 years of age, was rather broken down physically, somewhat deformed and obviously unable to do really heavy work.</P>
    <P>There are many cases like that, so that however logical we may like to be &mdash;I wish we could all be as logical as Senator Duffy thought we should be&mdash; I am afraid you will have employers and farmers who will neglect to take the necessary precautions in such cases.  Some of them may not be aware that there are facilities available to them before taking on employees who may be defective in any way.  Some of these employers believe that in taking on poor old men of that kind, they are not running any danger of an action being taken against them, until differences arise and action is taken. On the whole, just as in Sections 3 and 4, we are not going to do any injustice to anybody by passing this section.  I must say, from my observation anyway of the decisions in the courts, that if there is any bias in the courts, the bias is on the side of the employee.  I do not think we need be a bit afraid that district justices or Circuit Court judges will give any advantage to the employer if we pass this section.  I think they will be very careful before accepting that plea from an employer in any case brought before them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>If they had not a good defence, the Minister would make it appear that they had.  But the extraordinary thing is that the Minister for Supplies takes precautions to see that eloquent advocates do not have much <Col N="761" /> chance of going before a district justice because the Minister sends all these cases to the Military Tribunal where they are dealt with on the raw.  I think it would be very hard to persuade the tribunal that they should not fine an old woman from Connemara £150 or £500 for an offence against some Emergency Powers regulation, no matter what the consequences may be to her. The Minister, of course, is very perturbed lest somebody may succeed in a claim against a farmer who is paying less than he should pay and less than the law requires him to pay.</P>
      <P>I do not want to press the logic of the thing too far, but I should like to press that there are considerations of equity and justice in this matter.  I think that these considerations are being ignored in altering the law in such a way as to penalise the worker, because in the long run that is what is being done.  The farmer who does not know the law, or the farmer who is not able to pay or who has omitted to protect himself is being very adequately covered by this Bill.  Very little consideration is given to the need for protecting the worker.  If any working man contemplated under this section is subnormal mentally, let us say, he will have to pay the penalty. There is no consideration for him or for the need of protecting his interests before the courts.  I think the Minister is very unwise in pressing this section in its present form, and I can only conclude that this is the first step in watering down the Agricultural Wages Act, that it will be watered down further and further, that whatever advantages it has conferred on the agricultural workers in the past will be lessened until, I assume, that in a few years we will find the Act is almost entirely ineffective.  Of course I am asking the House to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>It would be very unfortunate if a Senator with the responsibilities of Senator Duffy in regard to his position in the Labour movement were to get away with the point of view he has expressed without having it corrected.  I think it needs correction.  In the first place, <Col N="762" /> it ought to be possible to produce evidence to show that the farmers for whom we are legislating here are such a lot of ruthless lawbreakers that, unless labour of a certain type is protected against these ruthless farmers, the labourers will be paid on a starvation level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important when you pass a law that it should be a sensible law and have relation to the facts of the case, and that when it is passed it can be sensibly administered.  In the first place, I think I can truthfully say that 80 per cent. of the farmers in this country were not aware of what their rights were under the original Act.  I challenge contradiction of that, because I have experience of it myself. The number of intelligent farmers who are not aware of what they are required to pay workers would astonish you.  How are they to find it out?  A notice is published in the Press.  If a farmer happens to miss the particular paper in which the notice is published, how is he to find it out? Farmers have not a central organisation equipped with a staff and with all that sort of thing, with all the data at their finger-tips, like the Labour organisation. They suffer from that disadvantage. Senator Duffy probably does not know the country as well as some of us.  But he knows enough to understand that in every district there are a few deformed people, not efficient in one way or another.  I have no doubt that the effect of the operation of this Act has been to deprive a number of these people of very good comfortable homes that they were enjoying until the passing of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could they not get an exemption and get out of the Act completely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I know they can get an exemption, if the farmers know that they can get an exemption.  But how is the farmer to know?  Probably the details of the Act were published in the daily papers.  What percentage of farmers read the daily papers? Hardly one in a townland.  They <Col N="763" /> may get a paper the day after it is published, or when it is a week old. It is not at that sort of advertisement they look when they read a daily paper.  The net result is that the farmer is really ignorant of his rights in this matter and has been penalised.</P>
      <P>The Senator talks of the equities. What equity is there in compelling a farmer to pay a man, who is really not competent to do more than half a day's work, the wages of a fully efficient worker?  That was the position if a man failed to get exemption in the past.  Sometimes a cute person, whose body could not work properly but whose brain worked well; would bring a farmer into court.  If he was a cantankerous sort of person egged on by some not-too-kindly neighbour and he brought his employer into court, simply because the employer had not obtained an exemption the employer had to pay full wages to that man who was not able to do more than half a day's work in the day.  There is no use in suggesting that that is equity. That was the law as it existed, and as it was administered up to the present, so that the proposal to amend it is a sensible one.  Heretofore, if an employer made an application and an exemption was granted, the employee would get his status defined by the Wages Board as the result of an inspector's visit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what Senator Duffy's views are about inspectors visiting places, but my attitude is definitely unfriendly. I remember one day on which I had to leave one of my fields for a third time and walk a quarter of a mile to interview a gentleman with a car who was an inspector of the Wages Board.  It was a day on which there was a good deal to be done.  He came along to find out what wages I was paying and I told him what I thought about the matter.  Imagine that man coming to determine whether or not my next-door-neighbour who was out in the field with me was an efficient worker or not when it could be determined by a district justice.  If that man took me into court, would not the district justice be as competent to decide whether or not he was able to do a full day's work as an inspector? <Col N="764" /> I know from experience that when a case is brought into court, as the Minister said, all the advantages are on the side of the employee.  If Senator Duffy thinks that the employees' rights are not as fully protected in the section as it is now, I can assure him that the experience of employers with regard to decisions has been that, in every instance, the dice were loaded in favour of the employee and that he is as completely safeguarded in that respect as he could possibly be.</P>
    <P>Surely the employer is entitled to some say in the matter.  He really is. The employer, even though he may be only a small farmer, is at least entitled to justice, and if he did not know that he could get an exemption in respect of this man, he ought to be entitled to go into court and say, pointing to that man when he comes, let us say, hobbling into court on a stick: &ldquo;What do you think of that man?  What work do you think he will be able to do for me?&rdquo; Why should Senator Duffy object to that?  I think he is taking a wrong slant on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned only with people who have been prosecuted in the court for failing to discharge their obligations.  Senator Baxter talks as if I were proposing something that would penalise farmers as a class.  I am endeavouring, purely and simply, to protect the interests of workers, who are taking proceedings in court, against an employer whom they accuse of having defrauded them of part of their wages, and so far as interfering with the discretion of the district justice is concerned, the Senator will observe, if he looks at my amendment, that I am only doing that in regard to a period in respect of which a district justice could have no knowledge.  If the contract were entered into 12 months ago, the district justice will have an opportunity, when he sees the complainant, of forming an opinion as to his health and standing as a workman at the time the contract was made.  If that contract had been made, say, ten years ago, that is quite a different matter.  I am merely asking the Minister to say that in the application <Col N="765" /> of this section the defence of physical or mental incapacity will be open to the employer provided that the contract was not more than 12 months old.</P>

      <P>There is one thing I wish to say.  I should not like the Seanad to get the impression that we are being in any way unfair to the employee.  I think that this original Act was perhaps the first that was ever brought in where you have an accomplice, as you have in this case, entirely excused. If a farmer enters into a contract for, say, 36 months, and it is discovered after a long time and he is brought into court, and the employee, who is obviously an accomplice makes a claim, there should be some provision there.</P>

If, let us say, a Dublin trader employs a dressmaker at less than the Trades Board rate, a prosecution lies against him, and a civil action can be taken against him for the recovery of the difference.  So that, actually, if there is a point about favouring the accomplice, it is following a precedent that has gone on for nearly 40 years, and I am trying to draw attention to the fact that if we insert this section, as it stands, in this legislation, we are opening the way for an amendment of the Trades Board code, which would affect a considerable number of industrial workers.</P>

    <P>I object to the principle of putting summaries of documents on the Table <Col N="769" /> of the House.  Summaries of documents lend themselves at a later stage to discussion as to whether they were, in fact, true summaries or not.  Having regard to the many things which the Minister prefers to put in by way of covenant in the lease, it would be far better that the full draft lease should be placed on the Table of the House. That may save a great deal of recrimination at a later stage and allegations that the whole facts were not disclosed.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (4), lines 14 to 23, to delete paragraph (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of this amendment is to make approval of the lease a positive act. Under the Minister's draft, the lease may be approved either by positive act or by the expiration of a particular time.  So far as the expiration of time is concerned, I ask the Minister to look at paragraph (i) of clause (b) of sub-section (4)&mdash;&ldquo;12 days after the first day on which either House of the Oireachtas sits&rdquo;.  Suppose the lease was made yesterday.  We have sat to-day but the Dáil will not sit, if the Minister can help it, until October. Does that mean that the Dáil would get no chance of making any alteractions in the lease?  If so, it would appear to me to be undesirable. <Col N="770" /> Approval should be either by positive resolution of each House, which is the strongest way and the way I have suggested in the amendment, or, at least, after the expiration of a certain time after each House has sat.  I am not absolutely clear whether that is intended or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the longer of (i) and (ii) that must be taken.  It would be either 12 days after the first day on which either House sits next, after the appropriate statement is laid before the Houses or six days on which either House of the Oireachtas sits after the statement shall have been laid before the Houses.  I think that that is giving the advantage, as it were, to the Houses.  It is the longer of the two periods that is taken.</P>

The State Lands Act gives 21 days instead of 12 and it sets out 12 days instead of the six that we have here&mdash;12 days on which either House of the Oireachtas shall have sat after the said statement shall have been laid before both Houses.

      <P>This is a matter to which we have drawn attention and we have done our duty.  I sympathise with the Minister, but I would like to point out that this is one more illustration of what has happened again and again over the past six or seven years. Bills are sent here, important Bills, after the Dáil has adjourned.  The Minister concerned&mdash;I am not referring specifically to the present case&mdash;<Col N="772" /> has a majority and assumes that there will be no amendments passed.  But what happens in effect is that important matters, or matters which may in the future turn out to be important, are raised <i>bona fide</i> and they are left, simply because nobody feels inclined to go to the expense and trouble of calling back the other House.</P>
      <P>It is as well to draw attention to the fact that this is not the first time that sort of thing has occurred, and until this House decides to make up its mind that it will not take important Bills such as this after the other House has adjourned, we will have them every year.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (1), line 33, to insert <Col N="773" /> immediately after the word &ldquo;period&rdquo; the words &ldquo;not exceeding five years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Let us be quite clear about this.  When I say the Minister might do this, there is nothing personal in it and I am not thinking of any Minister of the present Government.  I do not want the position to be that a Minister could get away with it by giving a licence for a period and in that way avoid having to lay the lease on the Table.  I do not think he could, even under the heading of the term licence.  I want the Minister's express view on record.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to say that the difference between a lease and a licence is that the Minister can give a licence which could be terminated at any time, whereas a lease can provide for a period of time.  A licence is a very convenient sort of provision which might be granted.  Suppose we had to make some move with regard to the national stud for an interim period and then we might go ahead and grant the lease.  I think no Department, the Department of Finance in particular, has been working things of this kind under the State Lands Act.  Their practice is to give a licence sometimes where it is convenient to allow things to go on, as it were, for a few months while the lease is being prepared and the terms are being decided.  I think the Senator may be assured that even if we were to follow the ordinary practice the lease will be issued as quickly as possible. The lease will be given under Section 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>What was worrying me was this: suppose the company decided that they did not want to work all of the stud themselves&mdash;the farm beyond the road, as it is commonly called&mdash;and that portion of it would be let.  If the company had a lease, they could do it, but when the lease fell in, I do not think the Minister should be in a position to let it every eleven months, without seeking authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Three or four points arise in this connection.  Some parts of the national stud are sublet at the moment. The intention, if we can do it legally &mdash;and I am not sure that we can and neither is my legal adviser&mdash;is to let the whole lot by way of lease to the company and that the company, in turn, will make a subletting to those people who are actually there.  Beyond that, we will have a provision in the lease against their being permitted to make any subletting&mdash;at least, without the consent of the Minister and perhaps we would not allow it at all.  I cannot foresee, I must say, how any subletting, apart from the two holdings already there, could be made.  I do not think there is any danger of what the Senator has in mind happening.</P>

Such joint committee may, if it thinks fit, appoint an auditor (in addition to the auditor appointed by the company in general meeting) to make such reports to it on the working of the company as may appear to him proper and for which purpose all information required by such auditor shall be made available by the company and such auditor shall be paid by the company such fee for his services as may be fixed by such joint committee with the approval of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 can be discussed <Col N="775" /> together as amendment No. 7 is merely ancillary to amendment No. 6.  This, I will admit at once, is a new principle.  At no time did I intend, and most particularly do I not intend at this hour, to go into the detail of the Vocational Organisation Commission's report and so forth.  I discussed it here on another occasion, and if the Minister will look up the debate then, he will find that what I was objecting to was not the company <i>per se</i>, but the absence of control of the company.  It does appear to me that the method I suggest in this amendment is a possible method of providing some sort of safeguard in respect of State companies.</P>
    <P>One of the things we must remember is that when we leave Civil Service rules and regulations, we are leaving rules and regulations, which, though they may be cumbersome&mdash;I quite see the Minister's point of view in that regard&mdash;have been built up to ensure in the best possible way that proper care of the expenditure of public moneys will be taken.  When we leave them, we want to be quite certain that we are substituting something equally satisfactory.  The other House has decided that the stud is to be carried on as a company and that principle was also decided here on Second Reading, and there is, therefore, no question of changing it, but it is purely a question of the method of control of the company.</P>
    <P>I do not at all say that the details of the suggestion in the amendment are the last word, or anything like it, or even anything near it, but I do think that some committee of either or both Houses, who would be in the position of vigilant shareholders without having a financial interest, would ensure that the public interests with regard to the expenditure of public funds were adequately safeguarded, and, at the same time, that safeguarding would not be carried out by the method of open discussion, by question and answer in the House, which the Minister appeared to be so anxious to avoid and in favour of the avoiding of which&mdash;to be perfectly fair to the Minister&mdash;in respect of the particular <Col N="776" /> business we envisage a very much stronger case can be made than in respect of any other State business. I ask the Minister to consider the principle in a sympathetic manner, or, if he is not prepared to do so, to indicate that he has some other suggestion on somewhat similar lines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Douglas, I think, raised this point on Second Reading and I said then that it was an interesting proposal.  I think it is an interesting proposal, but, as Minister for Agriculture, I have very little to do with these State companies, and it would be much more appropriate if the matter could be brought up in relation to some Bill for which the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce was responsible, because these Ministers deal with the great majority of these companies. I must say that I do not see how I could put up very much opposition to the proposal.  I could not possibly accept it in relation to this Bill, and all I could undertake to do at this stage is to bring the views of the Seanad before the Government, as I shall; but I think it would be better still if Senators themselves could do that.</P>

I appreciate that the Minister could not accept it in relation to this Bill, because he must be bound in relation to the practice in regard to other companies, and I am really only giving anticipatory notice that I propose to deal with it later.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2) to add a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(h) the said Articles shall provide that nominations for the service of any stallion to mares not the property of the company, shall only be allotted in accordance with such schemes or regulations as shall from time to time be approved by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will recollect that, on Second Reading, I referred him to the Report of the Commission on the Horse-breeding Industry of 1935.  He said then that he had not read it recently, but he will recollect, whether he has read it or not, that one of the recommendations in that report was that where there were more applications for nominations for approved mares than the number to be allotted, the question should be decided by ballot.  Of course it is conceded at once that before you do have a nomination, the mare must be approved but if you have owners of 100 approved mares applying for 40 nominations, I want it to be quite clear that those 40 nominations must be allotted by ballot rather than by singling out any particular person.  These nominations, if the stud is carried on as I hope it is going to be carried on and as I think the Minister intends it to be carried on, will be nominations made at less than the commercial price.  If nominations at less than the commercial price can be allotted to individuals by any system of selection, according to whether the applicants are personal friends of directors or personal friends of whatever Government or political Party may be in power at the time, it will completely undermine confidence in the company.  My aim is to secure a general scheme of regulations which the Minister will lay down and under which mares must be approved and, secondly, to secure that if there are more applications for nominations than the number available for <Col N="778" /> approved mares, that the selection will be made by ballot.  Possibly there may be some other regulations which the Minister may like to make in regard to payments.  I am not tying him on that nor am I suggesting&mdash;and I want to be very clear on this&mdash;that the regulations should be in any way detailed. It would be highly undesirable if a position did arise by virtue of which we could ask why Paddy Murphy's mare was served and Senator Sweetman's was not.  That would be a perfectly hopeless situation, but a general scheme with a ballot as its main principle would be very desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very hard to discuss the particular problems that may arise in selecting mares for any particular stallion.  My intention is to give a great deal of freedom to this company and I should not like to limit them in the way the Senator has suggested. The Minister, of course, will lay down policy.  In that policy the Minister may go so far as to say&mdash;I am sure he would go so far as to say&mdash;that small breeders should get preference, but it is very hard to define that further, beyond merely saying that they should get preference.  The company might say in carrying out that policy of giving small breeders preference: &ldquo;We will take only one more from any breeder.&rdquo;  That might be one way of giving the small breeder preference and of securing that the big man would not get any undue preference, but when you come to the question of approved mares, I do not know a lot about horse breeding, but it is possible that any competent manager if he were asked by the board to give a list, out of the number applying for the service of a particular stallion, of those he might regard as having the most suitable mares would say that the number would have to be cut down.  He might say that although 100 mares had been approved&mdash;and nobody could find any fault with him&mdash;there were 25 amongst these that were highly desirable&mdash;in other words, that if they were mated with this particular stallion they would be likely to produce first-class progeny. In a case like that I think a ballot might be a mistake.  I think if the <Col N="779" /> board were satisfied that the manager, with any technical advice he had at his disposal, was advising them in this respect, that out of 100 mares 25 should get special preference, it would be a great mistake to interfere with him.  The board would probably say: &ldquo;Let us take these 25 and then we can go on to the next 75&rdquo;.  If they had more than one stallion in the place, they might get a number of the owners to agree to accept the services of another horse and they might in that way eventually avoid a ballot.  I think we should not lay down any specific rule of this kind.  As the Bill stands, the company will have a great deal of freedom and they would be bound to carry out any general directions of policy that the Minister may give them.  I think we should not go further than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) Before the Minister for Agriculture shall give his approval to any alteration in the memorandum of association or articles of association of the company as provided by the preceding sub-section, he shall give notice of his intention so to do, before each House of the Oireachtas and if a resolution be passed by either House of the Oireachtas within 21 days after the first day thereafter on which each House has sat, prohibiting such approval, such approval shall not be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear to me from the wording of this section that the Minister could alter the articles of association&mdash;the memorandum does not matter so much&mdash;in such a way as to alter the things that had to be <Col N="782" /> included in Section 13, and if we are giving the Minister power to enable the company to change its whole terms it does appear to me that it is a power which was not envisaged in the drafting of the section, and I do not think the Minister intends it to happen. Again, the probability is that a Minister would never approve.  I am prepared to accept that the probability is that a Minister would never approve, and, although a good many of the matters I am raising on this are unlikely, I have done it quite deliberately so as to lend more force to an argument, which some time I will put up, that there is an attempt being made to rush Bills through this House, regardless of the time of the year.  I do not mean only the Senator Douglas point, but that attempts have been made to rush Bills through; that Bills do not get proper consideration either in this House or in the other, and that in consequence of that we have had, in the last few years, to deal with more amending Bills than we have ever had to deal with before, or should have had to deal with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 16, to insert at the end of the sub-section the words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and where any item of assets or portion thereof has been purchased by the company, the amount of the cost of such item or items if such assets are not already valued at cost&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think it is always desirable that, where the assets of a State company have been purchased&mdash;where a yearling has been bred, it is a different story&mdash;the purchase price should be set out, at least in the first year, as well as the price of valuation if it is different.  It is desirable that the two, the cost and the valuation price, should be set out if they are different.  That gives the person looking at the balance sheet a very much clearer idea of the true value of the asset.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>&ldquo;The company shall on demand furnish to the Minister for Agriculture such explanations as the said Minister shall think fit and proper to require in respect of any balance sheet, profit and loss account or report furnished pursuant to this section&rdquo;.</P>

If the Minister did not ask for a balance sheet, I think he would find it very difficult to withstand a vote of censure for not asking for it. When he asks for information, I want it to be mandatory that, when the balance sheet comes, it will be in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; I see the Senator's point now.  I did, I must say, read this amendment as if the Senator were giving the Minister for Agriculture power to ask for more from the company than was actually put down in sub-section (2), and I was pointing out that under sub-section (3) he can ask for practically anything.  The Senator's point is that he would like that this information should be given by the company in all cases.  I think that to ask for all these particular items in all cases would be very cumbersome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only five items in the balance sheet, and the only effect of the amendment would be that it would mean inserting, say, nine mares value £50,000, cost £43,000.  You would have items of that sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator may take it that we will get very full information about the activities of the company.

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  The report to be furnished as aforesaid shall contain&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  the name of every mare served by any sire the property of the company, the name and address of the owner of every such mare and the fee received from <Col N="785" /> each such owner for such service;</P>
    <P>(b) the name of every sire which served a mare the property of the company, the name and address of the owner of such sire and the fee paid for such service;</P>
    <P>(c) the name of each sire or mare purchased (for the purpose of breeding) by the company, the name and address of the person from whom the same was purchased, the amount paid therefor, the method of purchase and the amount of the commission, if any, paid to any person in respect of such purchase;</P>
    <P>(d) the name of each horse sold by the company, the name and address of the person to whom the same was sold, the amount received therefor, the method of sale, and the amount of the commission, if any, paid by the company or so far as the company is aware by the purchaser, to any person in respect of such person.</P>
    <P>I regard this as a very vital principle. I again ask the Minister to recollect that I am not making any personal charge.  One of the difficulties about these State Companies is that there could, very easily, be bribery or political corruption.  The Minister will agree that the surest way of stopping the possibility of anything like that happening is to ensure that, as far as possible, the transactions of the company should see the light of day.  I have worded my amendment deliberately to avoid cutting across the Minister's principle, which is that he wishes all these matters to be handed over completely to the company&mdash;matters connected with the breeding of horses, the service of sires, purchase of mares or sires, the selection of the auctioneer who is going to be responsible for purchases and sales, and so on.  In connection with all these matters, there could be the very greatest corruption.  I do not mean corruption in the actual sense of money passing, but I do mean corruption in the sense of favouritism, in the deliberate selection of people because they happen to be political favourites of whatever Government is in power <Col N="786" /> at the time, or, as Senator Baxter suggests to me, because they are members of the same golf club.  I would not go so far as to say that, but I would say personal friends of the people running the company.  If it is going to be made clear to everybody in advance that all information, in relation to the company and its activities, is going to receive the full light of day, then I suggest that will prevent any possibility of what I fear ever happening.</P>
    <P>The Minister must get a report from the company every year.  The reports that I have seen&mdash;the reports that I looked over before we had a discussion here on the Minerals Act, a discussion which centred round this question of State companies&mdash;give details which are meagre in the extreme. To be quite frank, I think that probably the Departments concerned ask for other information from these companies which, technically, is not called a report, and, therefore, has not, technically, to be tabled.  I am not suggesting that the Departments themselves do not get the appropriate information.</P>
    <P>I do think that one way in which we can be absolutely certain that we are not going to have anything undesirable in the management of this company, as I believe we will not have, is to make certain that its activities will see the full light of day, and that a report will be submitted which will cover the full history of the work done by it during the year.  The report should contain such particulars as will make it absolutely certain that nobody will ever attempt to do anything wrong.  If they do they will know that it will be exposed at once in the report at the end of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considerable sympathy with the Senator's desire to keep these companies clean and beyond reproach, but I do not see that it can be done quite in this way.  After all, the same principle applies to all those Government companies.  One can feel that there are opportunities for undesirable practices in the case of a number of the companies already existing.  What I feel is that this <Col N="787" /> matter should be approached from the point of view of having an examination of the conditions of all companies of this character.  I am satisfied that the safeguards which are there at present are inadequate.  The shareholders in these companies&mdash;Deputies are really the representatives of most of them&mdash;exercise a very remote control over the activities of these companies. One may say, of course, that the shareholders, even in the case of a commercial company, have not very much control.  One can say, however, that they have access more readily to the directors and the management than the public generally, who are the shareholders, have in the case of these companies.  I would like to have an indication from the Minister that he is in some way apprehensive about this form of Government trading, and that he will use whatever influence he has &mdash;I have no doubt whatever that his influence is very considerable&mdash;to get this matter considered by the Government, and to have an examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think any Minister, or anybody else, has any delusions about the dangers there are in the case of these companies, but, on the other hand, I think Ministers realise&mdash;I do not know whether Senators will agree or not&mdash;that there is a necessity for dealing with business <Col N="788" /> of this kind somehow or other.  So far, the best method we have struck upon is this method of setting up a company. As time goes on we may learn of some better way of doing it.  As to how far this company should be subject to public criticism and so on, that is a matter for discussion.  One of the reasons why we are setting up this company is that we did not want to have the national stud directly under a Government Department, with the manager of it subject to criticism in the Dáil and so on.  For that reason we ought not to go too far.  I think we are going too far in this amendment. That is my opinion.  I think it is asking too much from the company to submit all these details with regard to every visiting mare and stud owner, the amount charged, particulars with regard to every mare sent out from the stud, with particulars as to purchases, sales, commissions and so on.  I think we should provide, naturally, for straight dealing in all these things, but I will ask the Seanad not to agree to an amendment of this kind which is going so very far, setting out detailed information.  When we are setting up a company and putting a certain amount of trust in the company to manage its affairs properly, it is hardly fair to set out all these little details, and I think I will have to oppose an amendment of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister in mind, or has he considered, the form of report he would expect to get from this company?  Is he in a position to lay down the main headings under which a company of this kind should make its annual report?  You may provide very considerable safeguards there.  I think I am right in saying that some of these companies give you an account but no report at all; there is no meeting held, as there would be in a commercial company; there is no opportunity for the shareholders to ask questions.  I think the Minister has admitted, in fact, that he is not altogether happy about this form of finance, but in this special case would he be in a position now to set out the headings under which the board shall report, and publish&mdash;lay on the Table of the House&mdash;that report which <Col N="789" /> should be, I think, set out in very considerable detail?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to say because I do not know when this national stud may be in full working order.  It may take years before they are fully stocked or they may be lucky in getting a few good stallions in the first few years.  They may have to build up from a foundation by buying yearlings and seeing how they may turn out.  I do not know in what way they will proceed or may have to proceed in order to build up stock and on that account it is very difficult to lay down definite details with regard to the report that will be submitted.  I would like to have in the report sufficient matter for any citizen to realise what is going on because every citizen, I suppose, may be regarded as a shareholder in this case.  I must say that at any meeting of shareholders that I attended outside I did not get very much information.  I think the State companies do give at least as much information as the ordinary commercial companies.</P>

I can think of other companies and I do not remember seeing any detailed report from them, such as the fuel company and the shipping company.  They are absorbing large sums of Government money and, I may be wrong, but I do not recollect having seen from them anything comparable to the ordinary report one would get, the chairman's speech, and all that, in the case of the commercial company.

      <P>I think what the Minister in fact would do there is, he would ask the company for the information all right; if he found it was true, he would probably tell the directors that they would not be nominated the next time &mdash;or do something drastic of that kind &mdash;but I am doubtful if he would pass the information back to the Senator.</P>

      <P>That is a very honest answer but it is about the most unsatisfactory answer the Minister could have made because it means that it is not going to be possible to have <Col N="791" /> any form of public investigation into the affairs of the company, and that it is going to be a concern in respect of which, if it did happen, if it was desired to happen, there would be more possibility of political and even monetary corruption under the Bill than there would be under any of the other State Company Bills&mdash;easily more. Apart from that, anyone who takes any interest in horses appreciates that there is nothing that causes so many scare stories and scare rumours.  The only way of killing these scare stories and scare rumours is to ensure that all the information sees the light of day. Ninety-nine per cent. of the rumours will be scares but their existence will do the national stud harm, and unless you are going to make certain that they cannot exist, you are going to do harm to your own company.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Senator there.  As far as possible, we must not allow them to exist but you cannot, I am afraid, have these little details thrashed out in public.  If I ask the head of some commercial firm whether a certain man, who is in a fairly high position there, has been guilty of embezzlement, in all probability he will investigate the case and if he finds that the accusation is true he will sack the man; but he will make some excuse to me, that he is inquiring into it, and he will not give me much information about it.  I think members of the Seanad are really asking for more information than the ordinary commercial firm would ever give, even to its own shareholders.</P>

      <P>If I am a shareholder in a company and if I go to the chairman of the company, as the Minister has suggested, and say that one of the employees has been embezzling the funds, the chairman need not give me the information then or, after he has made his inquiries, he need not give it to me privately, but he must give it to me at the general meeting, if I insist. That is where the difference lies between the two positions.  If the Minister had accepted my joint committee, which was an effort to find something to stand for the public as a shareholder, then there would be no necessity <Col N="792" /> for this at all, but it is there that the real difference arises.</P>
      <P>The shareholder who hears something is wrong with his concern&mdash;and after all this concern is going to be the concern of every single person in the State, because it is State money&mdash; can get that wiped out and dealt with satisfactorily at a general meeting. We cannot.  That is the whole basis of my objection.  Having regard to the fact that I have already made my protest on an earlier section, I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>There are two points which I meant to raise on the Fourth Stage.  Will the Minister give us an indication as to whether the omission to include in this Bill a provision similar to that in the Central Bank Act is deliberate&mdash;that no director may be a member of either House of the Oireachtas&mdash;or whether it just was not thought of.  Secondly, was the omission to make the appointment of the chief officer or manager of the company subject to the approval of the Minister also deliberate?  In the Racing Board Act, the chief officer, the first time he was appointed, had to have his appointment confirmed by the Minister.  There is no similar provision in this Bill and that leads me to wonder whether the omission was due to these Bills having been drafted by two different Departments and the point not having been adverted to in this case, or whether there was some deliberate point of policy behind the omission.</P>

      <P>I intended to put down an amendment on the Committee Stage to ensure that a practical farmer would be one of the directors, but there was such a lot of talk as to who should be on the board that I preferred to leave it to the Minister to select his own board.  I am now asking the Minister to have some practical farmer in mind when he is considering the nomination of the board, especially some one with a knowledge of the cattle trade.  Tully Farm contains 870 acres, and there will be a lot of cattle, as well as horses, brood mares and foals.  Senator Sweetman said on the Second Reading that there would be a good deal of tillage to provide proper grass for the young horses. It might be said that there will be a manager there for that.</P>
      <P>The same thing could be said in regard to the management of the horses, including the selection and buying of the stallions and mares.  It might be a lot more effectively done if one of the board of directors knew about the sort of cattle to feed on this farm and how the tillage should be carried on by the management.  For that reason, I hope to have some assurance from the Minister that he will consider this suggestion when he is nominating the board of directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three points I was asked to answer.  In the case of the Central Bank Act, it is laid down that a director must not be a member of either House of the Oireachtas.  I must say I agreed with that in that particular instance, as I thought those who have so much to do with the direction of our finance had better not be connected with either House of the Oireachtas.  However, I do not personally approve of that principle in relation to other State companies.  If it is possible, as it may be, to find a much better person in either the Dáil or Seanad than we can find outside, I do not see why we should not put him on the board of a company of this kind. I may say it was not omitted with intent, as so far I have not given very much consideration as to who should be on the board.  I suppose I will have to give consideration to that soon, if the Bill goes through to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> In regard to the appointment of a practical farmer, I had that point in mind before Senator Counihan raised it.  It is possible that the manager of the farm may not be an expert on the management of cattle, though I hope he will be an expert on horse breeding and the management of horses, even if he does not take much interest in the cattle side.  On that account, I had in mind that we should provide on the board for the management of the farm apart from the stud, so I think I can assure Senator Counihan that, as far as my recommendation goes, that important point will be safeguarded. Senators will realise that it is the Minister for Finance who appoints the board, after consultation with me.  All I can say to the Minister for Finance is that I think that particular point should be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>Regarding the chief officer, I did not advert to what was in the Racing Board Act when this Bill was being drafted by the Department.  The other Bill was drafted by the Department of Finance and I think the Department of Finance would, by way of habit if by nothing else, insist that everybody be approved by the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Senator Sweetman I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), to insert immediately after the word &ldquo;applies&rdquo; in line 31, the following words and brackets: &ldquo;(and a copy of which Order shall be served by registered post on the owner of such article as soon as the Minister becomes aware of the name and address of such owner)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment seems to be a perfectly reasonable one, that <Col N="795" /> where a special Order is made applying to any particular document or painting, the owners, when their names and addresses are known, will automatically receive a copy of the Order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question as to who is the owner of a document seems to impose a very serious responsibility upon the Minister. What I am interested in in this Bill is that we should have the opportunity of making records and photographic copies of such documents or papers as may be of historical interest, or that might be available for future history.  I do not think we are interfering with the owner to any great extent, or with the possessor of documents, beyond asking that he should stand aside, so to speak, for a short period during which a copy could be made.  We are not interfering with his rights.  Anyone interested in the building up of our national archives realises that the power which is being sought is necessary.  We may not know who an owner is.  We may know that a document or painting may be in the possession of a certain person, and where an Order would be made affecting a particular document, it would be unfortunate if the possessor or owner was not aware of the fact that an Order was being made.  I can assure the House that, wherever it is possible to do so, I would certainly see that a copy of the Order was sent to an owner.  There is the difficulty of determining who is the owner.  The present practice is that the National Library approaches the matter by way of persuasion, and I see no reason to anticipate that that will be altered in the future.  They hear that a certain person has a document.  They get in touch with that person and, in all probability, if they consider it to be of sufficient value, they offer to purchase it.  In the event of the offer not being accepted, the practice heretofore was that the owner was quite free to send it out of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I already emphasised, we are not interfering with the right to sell or export, but we are asking that we should be allowed to make a copy.  The <Col N="796" /> practice has been to get in touch with the owner and, if I may use the expression, &ldquo;peacefully&rdquo;, to get him to leave the document in the Library.  If I were to accept the amendment I fear that I would be imposing a legal obligation on myself to ascertain who the owner was.  As I emphasised on the Second Reading, if we had a complete register of documents the position would be somewhat different.  We have not got that register, and what renders this Bill necessary is that the first intimation we have that a document has been exported is when we read that it has been sold on the London market.  I have consulted with my advisers about the amendment, and I am satisfied that the practice up to the present has been to try to get the owner to agree to allow a copy to be made.  Under the Bill it is true that we can compel him to do that if we consider that a document is of sufficient importance and if he wishes to export.  The Senator may take it that where we know of the existence of the owner we will make him acquainted with the fact that a special Order has been made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals only with sub-section (2) where a special Order is made about a particular document.  It seems reasonable if an owner is known that he should be informed.  I take it that the Minister now informs me that, if known, the owner will be informed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point is that the Order might have reference to a particular class of document. It has not happened, but it may happen that we might have to define the type of document &mdash;say a document in the handwriting of Charles Stewart Parnell&mdash; in some such way rather than with reference to who has it at a particular time.  Perhaps that question may not arise, but Senators will appreciate that we may not know the owner.  If we do know the owner, I can give the assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would not interfere with that position.  If the owner is not known notice could <Col N="797" /> not be sent.  In view of what the Minister has said I express grave doubts if he can do what is set out in the sub-section. I doubt very much if the Minister has taken the power he wants. I have no objection to his having it.  If this Bill is going to be followed by a more detailed Bill, and if the Minister wants power I can see the reason why he should have it, but I suggest that he should examine this sub-section when bringing in the new Bill, so that he should have more specific power than that outlined.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, I should like to have some indication from the Minister as to how the Bill is going to work.  Applying it to a practical case, if, as an executor, I want to send certain contents of houses left to relatives across the water, have executors in such a case to approach the Minister to get permission to export articles which might include a document or letters over 100 years old, and which would almost certainly include paintings?  As the House knows there is no age limit in the case of paintings, and the effort of a school girl might be called a painting.  Is the whole movement of these goods to be held up until the Minister or the officials had an opportunity of examining them, to see if any of them should be detained so that photographic copies should be made?  Is the Minister going to obtain knowledge in some way?  If there is an article which is of historical interest, I am puzzled to know how in practice the Bill is going to be administered.  In order to make it effective, it looks as if every consignment for export is to be held up until a licence is obtained, or until the Minister is satisfied that there is no contraband amongst the articles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, there is another point.  I think it is our duty to co-operate with the Minister when we see obvious loopholes in a Bill.  Surely the wishes of the Government would not be met by a general description of painting.  Are there not etchings or drawings of very great value worthy of record?  They do not appear to be covered by the Bill at all.  Is a drawing a painting? <Col N="798" /> I do not think that could be held.  I do not think any court of law would so hold.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

      <P>I think the point made by Senator Sir John Keane is that this wants more consideration before a permanent measure is drafted.  We cannot go any further with this Bill as it stands.  Most things cannot be exported at present.  I think it would probably be illegal under the Bill to export paintings brought home from a kindergarten school by children.  I think it is true that they are prohibited under the Paper Exportation Order at present anyway.  In a permanent measure after the emergency it would be desirable to have it better defined.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to make clear to Senator Sir John Keane, or anybody who may be specially interested in this matter, that we have tried to meet the objections that have been made.  I should first say that we have taken &ldquo;drawing&rdquo; out of the place where it originally was in Section 2 (1) (b) and put it up in the definition section under the title &ldquo;document,&rdquo; which means that we are only interested in a drawing 100 years old.  Any kind of engraving or picture done by mechanical process would not, I am advised, have very much interest for the national collection.  Any etching or engraving which is not unique and of which copies are fairly freely available would not have very much interest.  It is the unique drawing, or the unique painting, or other artistic work which might be described as a record of historical interest, in which we are interested in this measure.</P>

      <P>We do not know of any. On the last stage, Senator Sweetman asked about deeds.  I said that I thought perhaps deeds, if engraved in colours, might be described as paintings. I have looked into the matter and I am informed that, while the draftsman has been unable to give us any clear definition of a painting&mdash; there is in fact no definition known to the lawyers of a painting or works of art generally&mdash;the opinion is that a painting done on a particular article, such as a cup, a carriage, or a banner is not a painting.  Such an article, of course, has a utility value apart from the painting which it carries and it obviously has another purpose. &ldquo;Painting&rdquo; would seem to apply to an object which is merely intended to be a painting and not to have another primary purpose.  The draftsman does not think that we can define a painting in such a way as to bring in what would <Col N="800" /> be of historical interest.  Apart from the fact that there seems to be no definition available in the statutes, the difficulty is that we would require such a definition as would enable the customs officers administering the Act to interpret it.  May I say that paintings can be of value from the historical point of view?</P>
      <P>There may be portraits of prominent Irishmen; there may be views of places before substantial changes were made in those places and before town planning arrangements came into vogue; there may be old castles or buildings which have since disappeared or have fallen down; there may be pictures of costumes of a particular period; there might, for example, be pictures of musical instruments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>A picture might be of historical interest because it belonged to some celebrated Irish artist.  But, even so, we are only asking for a photographic copy for record purposes. Generally speaking, our aim is to get photographs of any pictures which might be described as being of value for the future when the history of our own social time or our own civilisation is being written.  Although the Bill came in at short notice, I hope that the documents we were afraid would be exported may not be exported.  But we have heard that there is that danger and that is why the Bill is being brought forward.  As I explained, we had in contemplation introducing a general measure, but we are not touching works of art.  The measure of a permanent nature that we had in contemplation was one dealing with documents.  If we find that the present measure will work satisfactorily, we shall carry on with it.  But if, as Senator Douglas apprehends, amendment will be necessary, then we shall have to come back with an amending measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister that there is no mention of lithographs?  A lithograph is a drawing on stone.  It is executed by a graphic artist on stone and then an impression is taken from the stone. <Col N="801" /> It was a very frequent form of art in Ireland.  Messrs. Marcus Ward and Co., Belfast, for instance, had specialists in their employment.  It is superseded, of course, by the photogravure and the application of photography instead of direct drawing.</P>
      <P>As regards the point about paintings, a painting comes under the classification of graphic art.  It has to be expressed in pigments.  That is the specific difference in character, that there is a pigment used.  There is also ceramic painting, where the material employed is fragments of coloured glass ground into powder and subjected to heat.  These paintings are of great interest, and many of the specimens, for instance, in the museums in Venice, are of enormous value&mdash;of greater value even than many jewels.  So I think we ought to be a little more precise in our definitions. I am sure it will be granted, for example, that drawings, etchings and engravings are not documents.  A document must have some reading matter.  It ought to be on record in libraries of words rather than in those devoted to pictorial characters.  So I agree with Senator Sir John Keane that the definition clause requires something more precise than we have here, and that some things are put in here under wrong categories.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Getting away from this definition business for a moment&mdash; I suppose the Minister has considered it and it is not merely for me to suggest it, but dealing with this one matter affected by an Emergency Order, there is only one document in jeopardy now, and unless the Constitution forbids it, it can be dealt with by Emergency Order.  Apart from that, however, the Minister has not answered the administrative question that I asked him.  If I, or my representative, wanted to send away a miscellaneous collection of articles, including documents, paintings, and so on, have I or my representative to go to the Minister's Department and say &ldquo;I want an export licence for these goods,&rdquo; or can I go about my business in the ordinary way?  Or does this mean that I will be told that I will have to wait until somebody can be <Col N="802" /> sent to ransack the collection before a licence to export is given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the owners or possessors of these paintings or documents are persons of integrity, and we will try to deal with them from our point of view as fairly as possible. I think I can assure the Senator, in the first place, that as far as the Library authorities and my Department are concerned, we would try to deal fairly with persons who have these things.</P>
      <P>They would have to acquaint us&mdash;I think there would be no way out of that&mdash;if they had documents over 100 years old or, in the case of the Minister having made a special Order covering a particular document in a particular person's possession, or covering some series of documents such as the Parnell manuscripts which I have mentioned, and in that case we would try to give an Order to the owner, if we knew the owner, and he would then be in a position to make known to us the description, the actual description, of the document or documents. I think I may say that all we would ask the owner to do is to let us know, in the first instance, what actually the document was like, to give us a description of it.  Generally, the Library authorities will be able to determine from a short description whether it has any interest for them or not.  They have spent all their lives at this work.  They have a fairly good idea of what documents are there.  It would be only one chance in a thousand that some document would turn up that they would never have heard of before.  We must assume that they will have a general idea of what there is in the country and, therefore, they will be able to judge, from a comparatively short description, whether a document is of value to them or not. If they consider it to be of value to the historical collection, then they may ask for permission to examine the document, and under the Bill we are empowered to get facilities to examine it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Senator talks of ransacking collections, I think he is viewing the thing in a most unfavourable way. <Col N="803" /> I do not know why it should be suggested that responsible servants of the State should go out to ransack anybody's collection or create inconvenience and unpleasantness for themselves as well as for those with whom they are dealing.  When they get a description of the document, if they are interested in it, the Bill will entitle them to write&mdash;and I am sure they will write in a proper way&mdash;asking for permission to examine the document or documents described. Having examined the document, they will then be in a position to say whether it should be photographed or not, and I think I can assure the Senator again that the Library, in the future as in the past, will try to carry out its work with courtesy and with the least possible inconvenience to anybody.</P>

Must I go to some Government Department and say: &ldquo;I want to send these things away, and is it necessary for me to have an export licence, or can I go now straight ahead and carry out the move?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I cannot assure the Senator on that matter.  This law will be like all other laws.  It will be for the courts to determine eventually whether, in exporting a document without permission, the Senator, or anybody in his position, contravened the law or not.  I cannot say that in advance. All I can say is that if a person has any doubt whatever, I do not think it is asking too much that he should communicate with the Director of the <Col N="804" /> National Library, stating what he has. The Director will facilitate him in every way possible and, unless the document is down the country it is only a matter of hours to make a copy.  In case there might be any feeling that we want to interfere with people in carrying on an export business of a commercial nature&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Section 2 (3) says that the Minister may from time to time by Order declare that any particular document or painting, and so on, belonging to a particular class shall be excluded from the operation of the Act. So that, if it is a case that somebody is exporting pictures that have no value from the historical point of view, we can either give him a complete exemption or can, I dare say, arrange that the export licence will cover a number of articles, or at any rate interfere with his business to the least possible degree.  We have had no experience yet of the administration, but as I have said, the number of persons dealing in these things is rather small, and we have no reason to doubt that with co-operation on both sides very little difficulty will arise.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I was not present to move the amendment.  I must thank Senator Ryan for his assistance. The purpose of the amendment is very simple.  The House will remember that, when the Customs Bill has going through earlier this year, fairly strong objection was taken by some of us to certain of the provisions which meant, very shortly, that a man was to be presumed guilty until he proved his innocence.  It was contended at the time that those powers were absolutely necessary in present circumstances in regard to the export of certain articles.  It should be borne in mind that that measure was to apply only for a period of five years.  In this Bill, we are asked to say that a person who attempts to export a document which is over 100 years old be assumed to be guilty before his trial and that he shall be put to proof that he did not commit the offence.  There is the greatest difference between this Bill and the Act to which I have referred.  I am sure <Col N="806" /> the Minister will agree with me when I say that to determine whether a document is 99 years old or 101 years old might require the most expert knowledge.  Yet, we are asked to say that a man is to be assumed guilty in a case like that until he proves his innocence.  That does not seem to me to be a reasonable proposition or one which we ought to accept.  I shall not waste the time of the House in dealing with the principle involved.  The principle will, I think, be accepted on both sides.  In the case of the export of tea, everybody knows what tea is and there need be no discussion about it.</P>

      <P>Whether a document is 100 years or 101 years old might be a question which would test the knowledge of an expert.  That is not a matter to which the ordinary revenue law should apply.  I understood the Minister to say on Second Reading that this was almost an <i>ad hoc</i> measure, required to save a particular collection of articles.  So far as that is concerned, I should be quite willing to assist him, and to give him the Bill as it is, having regard to the fact that the Dáil is in recess.  But I did understand the Minister to say that, though this Bill was now introduced as an <i>ad hoc</i> measure, a more general Bill would follow dealing with the whole question. If we are to give the Minister this Bill to meet a particular situation, he ought to give us an undertaking that the general Bill will deal with this matter and will include a repeal of the provision and the principle that a man is to be deemed guilty until he proves his innocence in a case such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with what Senator Sweetman has said.  A Bill, containing extraordinary powers, was brought in here to deal with an emergency problem.  The principle of that Bill is now being applied to a measure with the purpose of which we are all in agreement but which includes a very large number of articles. I do not think the Minister understood the question put by Senator Sir John Keane.  If he did, he certainly did not answer it.  I suggest that the answer <Col N="807" /> to Senator Sir John Keane's question is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  If there are any paintings in his house, he cannot export them without a licence under this Bill, as it stands.  The Minister may, after a short time, make an Order under Section 2 (3) excluding certain types of paintings from the operation of the Act.  The Senator will then know that certain types of paintings can be exported, but the measure is very wide and it is just as well that people who are anxious to carry out the law should know that they cannot export paintings.  People who propose to exported, paintings may very soon find themselves badly caught because, in the ordinary way, they will look at the lists in the post offices or at the Department of Industry and Commerce and it will never occur to them that the Department of Education has made an Order prohibiting export of these articles.  There should be some publicity with a view to letting the people know what they will be deemed to know under this Bill when it becomes an Act.  In the case of documents, the Department of Education will probably know quite well if I have a document over a hundred years old, that I know it is of that age.  The kind of document they will be concerned with will, probably, be one about which they have already approached me.  They will probably know all about it, and I have no wish at all to make it difficult in a case of that kind.  But what I do not want is that a person who, in clearing up the assets of an estate or in the ordinary course of his duty, sends out a certain number of papers and finds the parcel is opened and examined by the customs authorities and there is a document challenged because it is old &mdash;some expert says it is 100 years old. You might stop it, but do not attach a penalty.  This should not be attached to the general customs provisions. It should have provisions and penalties of its own if it is to be a permanent Act.</P>

      <P>The laws in other countries are more severe than what we are seeking to obtain here.  With regard to historical documents, we are not in a very happy position in this country.  The number available is very <Col N="808" /> limited.  During the past 50 years the country has lost very valuable papers. It is of the greatest importance that what are left should be preserved. There are people who will always plead ignorance of the law and if they can show, even under the Customs (Temporary Provisions) Act, that they acted in good faith, the court will take that into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should the State be allowed to do anything?  Some lawyers complain very often that we have too many inspectors; that we have to have a staff of officials to deal with each particular enactment which we put through the Oireachtas.  There are two ways of ruling a country. There is the totalitarian way, which is generally complained of, and there is the way where you expect the people to co-operate with you.  If the people co-operate and the State, through its officials and Departments, acts properly by them, I see no reason why the plea of good faith in every case could not be accepted.  It is not accepted very often when it is pleaded on behalf of Ministers, but it should be always accepted, apparently, when it is pleaded on behalf of private citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, perhaps, unfortunate that we have to deal with this in a Customs (Temporary Provisions) Act.  Perhaps that Act will be continued after the period, but in any case I think when we go into the question we will find that if this scheme is to be administered through the customs, ultimately it will have to be controlled by some Customs Act, even if it has to be a special Act with special penalties appropriate to the particular case. There will be further legislation dealing with this matter.  It may not be my Department which will have to deal with it.  I think the general question of public records, if the law is to be amended, may come up from the Department of Justice, but that will give us an opportunity, if a Public Record Bill is being brought in, of <Col N="809" /> amending the present measure, if it is necessary to do so.  On the other hand, we may find it necessary, if national archives are to be properly established, to look for powers.  In any case, there will be further legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Either the Minister has not understood, or does not want to understand.  I will put one specific question to the Minister.  Does he think that a person should be convicted who sends for export a document that is 101 years old, even though that person believes that it is not 100 years old?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But that is not ignorance of the law; that is what I was trying to make clear to the Minister. Ignorance of fact is a very different thing, but this is a question of fact, as to whether a document is or is not 100 years old.  Everybody is presumed to know the law.  At least, I might be given credit for appreciating that much.  Whether a document is or is not 100 years old is a fact and if it turns out that a document is over 100 years old, no matter what plea of justification is put in, as the law stands the man concerned must have the stigma of a conviction against him under the Customs Act.  That is what I am objecting to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Customs Act stands, it applies to all statutory instruments and, this being a scheme which was administered by the Customs, I think it would involve great administrative difficulties, even if it had been possible in the time to have two separate customs codes.  If the Customs (Amendment) Act applies for the time being to violations of any kind of enactment, it should certainly apply to this.  The House has already accepted the Act.  The fact that there was opposition to it is beside the question.  It is now the law.</P>

      <P>On the section, I still want some clarification, if the Minister will give it to me.  Perhaps I should go to the Revenue Commissioners and not to the Minister.  What I want to know is perfectly reasonable. I believe that there is no contraband in a consignment of goods that I want to move.  Can the move proceed forthwith, or must I wait for a general export licence before the goods are moved?  The Minister may not have understood my other questions; otherwise the reply was unsatisfactory.  He said: &ldquo;I cannot tell you what the law is.&rdquo;  A Minister in charge of a Bill should be able to understand that question.  Must there be a standstill on the movement and a release before the articles, a miscellaneous consignment of goods which the owner believes contains no contraband, can be moved? That is a perfectly straightforward question and I feel the Minister should be able to answer it.</P>

Senator Sir John Keane has talked about goods and about articles and I am not clear whether he is referring to documents or paintings.

      <P>I want to make one more effort at explaining why I object to this Bill.  Whether a document is or is not 100 years old is a matter of fact.  It is a matter of an expert's opinion, and it might very well be that I would have a document in or about 100 years old.  I might write, as the Minister has suggested, to him or to the Director of the National Library, and might be told that it was not 100 years old, that it was only 99 years old, and I might then export it without a licence.  Having exported it without a licence, it might be discovered, as a matter of fact, that the document was more than 100 years old. Both the Minister and the Director of the National Library might find that their first opinion was not quite correct and these historical matters are very often matters of opinion.  The situation then is that, no matter what happens, under the code by virtue of which the Minister brings in this penalty, I must be convicted and fined three times the value of the article, although I did everything that I possibly could with regard to it.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the Customs (Amendment) Bill sets out that the person concerned shall for each such offence forfeit either treble the value of the goods or £100, at the election of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>I do not see why, without some protest, even though we may agree in regard to <i>ad hoc</i> legislation, a person who took all those precautions should have placed on him the stigma of a conviction and should be forced to go hat in hand to the Revenue Commissioners and say: &ldquo;Please let me off the fine, because I did everything I possibly could&rdquo;.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney-General has to ask himself whether on the merits of the case he should prosecute and whether public policy demands that there should be a prosecution even if the case does not seem to be a very strong one from his point of view.  I think on neither ground would the legal adviser of the Government recommend a prosecution in the type of case Senator Sweetman has mentioned, but because such cases may <Col N="815" /> occur, we are asked not to take the precautions that are necessary.  We know that works of art and historical documents are brought to American markets, Continental markets and English markets, and we know that people who stoop to that kind of thing can do it in our despite.  Let us at least show these people who want to do that deliberately and maliciously, and who try to make money irrespective of the loss to the nation, that there are penalties attaching to such an offence.  That is my answer to Senator Sweetman.</P>

      <P>On the section I am raising a point of general principle. I think it was you, Sir, who ruled that I could not raise it on Second Reading but that I might raise it on the section.  I feel that the Minister should examine in all its aspects the question of agricultural education.  I do not think the Minister would deny that if we had the best brains, the highest technique and adequate capital&mdash;I put capital as a subsidiary&mdash; employed in agriculture to-day, the output of the country could probably be doubled.  Of course it is a matter that cannot be brought about overnight, but I do feel that the Minister should address himself seriously and systematically to laying the foundations <Col N="816" /> for a vastly improved technique in the whole of our agricultural output. He is faced with limitations undoubtedly&mdash;lack of education, a number of uneconomic holdings and a large number of other difficulties&mdash;but there are certain things which the Minister can do to-day through agricultural education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that the Minister should make the college part of a rational progressive scheme of agricultural education.  I think I shall be able to narrow it down very quickly.  I venture to say all our colleges under the Department are concerned mainly with research, manurial crop experiments and the training of students in agricultural botany, tillage operations and stock raising, but none of these operations, to my mind, has any relation to the farm as an economic and productive unit.  This is not a new question for the Minister.  I was on an agricultural commission which sat shortly after the State was formed, at which it was recommended that the Government should use agricultural instructors to manage demonstration farms with a view to showing farming operations in practice and that the farm, under such management, should be such a farm as an ordinary farmer of intelligence would operate, that there should be accounts and balance sheets, a farm in respect to which any farmer could say to himself: &ldquo;Here is something I understand; it is not just a series of detached experiments showing the effect of potash on one row and nitrates on another; it is not a demonstration in a form of milking or a demonstration in a certain elementary treatment of cattle diseases.  It is a farm as a whole possessing every aspect of farming operations leading up to balance sheets and showing what I might call the complete economic family life of the farmer.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Government has never addressed itself seriously to this matter. Now it has an opportunity.  It <Col N="817" /> has an opportunity of setting aside a certain section of this farm or of treating this farm as a whole.  I do not see why this Johnstown Farm should not be conducted on completely different lines from Clonakilty, Glasnevin or Athenry, and why the Government should not say: &ldquo;Now we are going to use this farm like any farmer would.  We are going to keep accounts, to grow crops suitable to the district and harvest these crops in the ordinary way a farmer would and market them, and at the end of the period we are going to get out accounts and balance sheets, showing interest and capital and all the rest of it.  Incidentally, and most important of all, we are going to use this farm as a means of ascertaining costings so that at least, as far as the soil and conditions of Johnstown Castle are concerned, we shall know the cost of crops in that district.&rdquo;  That is a very definite and clear proposition.</P>
    <P>I do charge the Department of Agriculture with putting this question of economic farming in a totally secondary and subordinate place and with failing to give our farmers any assistance in this vital matter&mdash;the farm as a going concern.  I should like the Minister to deal with this matter because it is very important.  There are other farms to which this system could be applied.  If you got it going properly in a place like Johnstown Castle, you could apply the same principles in the case of farms which are not strictly under the Government, farms managed by co-operative societies.  I am glad to see that co-operative societies are to an increasing degree acquiring farms.  These farms should be run as live demonstration farms.  That is the only way the practical farmer will be convinced.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately I was unable to be here when the Second Reading of this measure was under discussion.  There were certain things I should like to have said but before I say some of the things I want to say now, I should like to hear the Minister on this section.  The section says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As soon as conveniently may be after the passing of this Act, the Minister shall establish on the <Col N="818" /> Estate a lay agricultural college and may for that purpose do all such things as he considers necessary.</P>
    <P>(2)  The college established under this section shall be named the Johnstown Castle Agricultural College and the said name shall not be changed.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement on the Second Reading was brief.  I should like to hear form him what he purports to do under this section and what his views are?  He is going to establish this agricultural college and we are empowering him to do all such things as he considers necessary for the purpose of establishing it.  What plans has he in mind with regard to its establishment?  What are the things which he regards as necessary to do in order to get the kind of college he wants to get?  In other words, what plan of agriculture does he intend to have operated in this college?  As Senator Sir John Keane said, we have a number of agricultural colleges here at present&mdash;a limited number indeed. The number has not been added to since the State was set up, and, so far as I know, their capacity to take in students has not been added to either.</P>

      <P>But I want to hear from the Minister how this new college is going to fit into the general plan of agricultural education.  Surely, on this section, I am entitled to have that information? When we are giving power to the Minister to set up an additional agricultural college, it is important that we should be given some idea as to how it is going to fit into the general plan of agricultural education, and as to whether or not he is going to pursue a different line here from what has been pursued elsewhere.  I have not had an opportunity of reading all the debates in the other House. I take it that there was a good deal of discussion about soil survey.</P>

      <P>We could perhaps shorten this discussion if we had from the Minister his views as to what plan or shape he intends to give this college. Of course, he stated in his Second Reading speech that the advantage of getting this was that you could establish here a school where you had soil conditions, a type of farming, and so on, similar to a considerable area in Wexford, and I presume in that part of Leinster.  No matter what you may be disposed to do in a place like Johnstown, you have to take cognisance of your soil conditions, of your traditional type of farming and all that sort of thing, and the type of agricultural education you will impart in a school like Johnstown can only be the type of education which your soil, your climatic conditions and so on, will enable you to impart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it has been stated that there is some policy in regard to the inauguration of a soil surveying branch in this college.  I do not quite know what the Minister's policy is on that, and I should like to have from him some information as to how he intends to man that branch.  If he intends setting up a soil surveying branch in the school, I should like him to tell us how we are situated in the matter of scientific workers for that branch of agricultural education and research.  I welcome that decision.  It is a matter which, I think the Minister will admit, I have raised on a number of occasions, and I welcome this step.  If it is part of the Minister's policy to go into the investigation of soils there, I should like to know whether or not he intends to do that in relation to a particular area, or is Johnstown to be made a centre for the country?  If that is what he has in mind, I am afraid the location of Johnstown makes it rather difficult to do that sort of thing for the country as a whole.  Geographically, it is somewhat remote.  Postal facilities and so on make it more difficult to reach than would be regarded as satisfactory from the point of view of the farmers who are interested.  I am in a difficulty, and I am discussing this rather in the dark until I hear what are the Minister's views and policy and plans.  This being his native county, and the soil conditions there being particularly well understood by him, <Col N="820" /> I am sure that he himself, apart altogether from any help from his technical officers, will have no difficulty in planning what should be done.</P>
    <P>I agree absolutely with Senator Sir John Keane that this step is terribly necessary and terribly important.  The kind of shape which the Minister gives this new college will have considerable influence on the shape we are going to give our agricultural endeavour for perhaps a number of years to come. There is no doubt that there is a great necessity for this step and for the expenditure of a considerable amount of money.  When I see all the fuss we make about our Institute of Higher Studies, I think we would be far better employed and the money would be spent to much better advantage on some such undertaking as this.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say anything disparaging about that realm of higher education which I and people like me can find of little avail in our calling, but I cannot help feeling&mdash;with the opportunities that are available in a place like this, and the terrible necessities that confront us with regard to the better working of our land in the future&mdash;that the expenditure of money on an effort like this would have much closer relation to the lives of the people and to the possibility of bettering their conditions than any expenditure we could incur in Merrion Square on our Institute for Higher Studies. I should like to know from the Minister if his idea is that he is now going to add one more college to the number he has got already&mdash;Clonakilty, Ballyhaise, Athenry and Glasnevin&mdash;as a group of colleges under the control of the Ministry of Agriculture?  Has he in his mind some sort of co-ordinated plan whereby each of these colleges will become distinct in its own way, but each working in a particular branch of a combined effort, and all working towards a common purpose, to give us trained minds and to engage in that kind of research which will make it possible to spread a knowledge of farming technique which is terribly lacking in this country to-day and without which agriculture cannot progress?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I explained, both in the Dáil and in the Seanad, that it <Col N="821" /> is intended to set up a college in Johnstown. Part of its activities will be the same as those which are being carried out in Ballyhaise, Clonakilty and Athenry.  That is necessary because there are more students applying for admission to these colleges than we can place at the moment.  I would like to point out to Senators who have not followed the working of these colleges that they are doing very essential work for young men who are going back to manage their own farms.  It is essential to impress on these young men the importance, first of all, of having properly bred animals and good milk yielding cows.  That is all impressed on them at the colleges as well as how to feed animals.  Then, as regards tillage, there is the question of proper manuring, proper tilling, and the great importance of having proper seeds.  They are taught other things as well, but I am just mentioning some of the main things taught in these colleges.  Senators who come from the country will agree with me, I think, in this, that if they look back 40 years they will admit that in that period there has been a remarkable improvement in the knowledge of our farming community.</P>
      <P>I can well remember, when I was young, a farmer saying that he was going to put some bag manure on his crop.  He does not say that now. Leaving the war years out, he will say, if he can get it, that he is going to put so much phosphate, so much potash so much sulphate of ammonia on his land.  He does not accept bag manure any longer from the shopkeeper.  He has, first of all, to know what is the composition of it.  The farmer going to buy a feeding mixture has to know how much carbo-hydrates, how much oil and how much albumenoids it contains. There is no doubt whatever but that there has been a great advance in the knowledge which farmers have to-day as compared with 40 years ago. I do not say they have enough knowledge. I think there is room for more education in this country.  I do not say that any Senator has given the impression that we are worse than other countries, but there is that sort of idea among certain sections of this country that we are not as well up in farming as they are in other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have been in all those countries.  I want to say that in the three big countries, as it were, England, France and Germany, where I spent most of my holidays, farming in them is a long way behind ours, taking them on the whole.  I still want to say that we can improve.  There is great room for improvement here.  I am quite prepared to admit that.  However, to come back to Johnstown Castle, the intention is to have an agricultural college there.  There are very good gardens at Johnstown suitable for the training of horticultural students.  In addition to the agricultural college, we will have a horticultural school or college there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also mean to do soil research there.  The reason why we are starting it there is, first of all, because there is room for it, and, secondly, because we are going to undertake a scheme of land reclamation there on about 200 acres.  The reclamation of these 200 acres will be the foundation, if you like, for our soil research department which we mean to make applicable to the whole country.  I think that when the war is over, and when there is an improvement in transport conditions and communications it will not be too great an inconvenience for a farmer to have to post his sample to Johnstown. After all, a farmer when getting a sample of soil analysed is not in a desperate hurry about it, as a rule.  A day or two will not make any great difference to him, but it will be very convenient for the Department to have the soil research department at Johnstown. We hope to have most of the work done there, as time goes on, and to get the other colleges as well as the <Col N="823" /> county agricultural instructors to join in this soil research.  It is only when we get everyone interested that we can do a big lot in soil research.</P>
    <P>I do not think that costings could be done properly in a place like Johnstown, because if you have students there doing research, and if you have a principal doing a certain amount of experimentation, then, obviously, he cannot do costings because in his experiments he must waste a good lot of time and, perhaps, good land.  Therefore, he cannot do costings.  I think that costing would be better done by taking returns from a number of farmers throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Probably it would have been revived before now but for the fact that the war intervened.  The war is, again, made an excuse for this economy.  But now, I think, there is no further excuse, and it should be revived.  I would like to say that in setting up this college for the education of our boys it is, of course, only one arm of our education.  We have the winter classes and their staffs.  I was reading some time ago a review on this question of agricultural education, so far as it applies to some of the Continental countries, and they seem to be rather unanimously in favour of trying every effort to provide what they called the travelling <Col N="824" /> school, which is exactly what our winter classes are.  I think that, if we can broaden the scope of our education and make it possible for more people to benefit by the education system that we have at present, we are on the right lines by giving opportunities to more of our people.  As far as Johnstown is concerned, I think we should proceed as we are proceeding with the additions that I have mentioned.</P>

With regard to the Minister's references to the other colleges I want to say that it is no credit at all to this State&mdash;indeed, it is indicative of the attitude towards agriculture right from the beginning&mdash;that never since the State was founded was there an additional room built, so far as I know, for an agricultural student in this country.  Go to all the other schools and see the immense buildings that have been put up and the additions that have been made to secondary schools throughout the country.  It is true, of course, that this work was done by religious orders.  Nothing was done by Governmental effort.  In this college, there will be certain accommodation. I am convinced that you ought to add to the accommodation at all the existing schools.</P>

      <P>We cannot talk about an agricultural college without discussing the number of students it can <Col N="825" /> accommodate and the structural plan. That will have to be considered in relation to what is being done elsewhere. That is why, I submit, I am perfectly in order in discussing these things.  We should like to discuss agriculture on the Appropriation Bill but in that case the Minister for Agriculture does not attend; it is the Minister for Finance who is present then. That is what we are confronted with. I put it to the Minister that he is going to run this new school partly as the existing colleges are being run.  I have no fault at all to find with them and I would not like anyone to misunderstand me; they are excellent institutions and turn out tip-top boys, who eventually go into the State service or back to their farms.  They are boys of whom the country can be very proud.  If Johnstown Castle is to do the kind of work that ought to be turned on to it, the position of the other colleges ought to be considered simultaneously.</P>
      <P>I do not know that I agree with the Minister in what he says in regard to our technical knowledge of agriculture. I am not denying that there have been advances, but I am afraid our advances are not comparable with those made in that science elsewhere, and I may mention, in this connection, the advances that are being made in this matter in the Six Counties.  Unless our colleages are cognisant of that fact, we will be behind-time.  I know of experiments that have been carried out in the North by the Ministry of Agriculture in collaboration with certain farmers.  No equivalent work is being done here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no wish to broaden the scope of the discussion at this stage but the Minister made reference to what can be done in regard to horticulture at Johnstown Castle.  I welcome that, but I make this suggestion to the Minister: it is very important that county organisers and county instructors should be men of education, trained not only in general education but, to a high degree, in agricultural education. In my opinion it is very important that the men who will be trained for the purpose of horticulture should have the highest possible education.  Horticulture <Col N="826" /> is one branch of agricultural science that requires much more sympathetic assistance than has been given to it in the past.  That branch has been the cinderella of agricultural education. It is important to select the very highest type of student we can get to specialise in horticulture.  The science of fruit-growing, plant life, etc., is the most highly skilled and most sensitive aspect of agriculture.  Therefore, if a considerable amount of space and energy is to be devoted to preparing people in horticulture, at Johnstown, every effort should be made to get the best possible type of student.  Unless that is done, the work will not be done in the way in which it should be in order to make it a success.  I am not speaking without some experience.  I have had close contact with this matter.</P>
    <P>In regard to what the Minister said about soil researches, I should like to learn his views as to how the institution will be manned.  How many skilled people have we available for that purpose? We are really very backward in the study of soils&mdash;the Minister knows that&mdash;in comparison with what is being done in the Six Counties and in Britain.  The developments that have taken place in British agriculture during the war have left us very far behind.  Theirs is a remarkable record of achievement and we will know all about it when we begin to compare yield per acre here against yield per acre there.  I know that they had advantages that were not available to us and they had the urge to work that was created by the war.  That state of affairs will compel us to stir ourselves more than we have done up to the present.</P>
    <P>How many students will be accommodated at Johnstown?  Are we going to have the type of student who will pay his way in the college and will go back to his own farm, or are we going to have a considerable number of scholarship students who will go there for the purpose of being trained to become servants of the people later on? That is a matter of considerable importance. What the Minister has said about itinerant classes is of considerable importance, but the Minister knows as well as I do the number of <Col N="827" /> years which must pass before a county instructor in any county can succeed in giving one course in one parish in the county.  One class in one year is all he can do.  How many agricultural instructors will go to their graves before we have succeeded in giving one course in one parish in a county?  That presents a new problem.  My view about adult agricultural education is that if some plan could be devised which would make it possible to bring a number of people of 21, 24, 30 years, or even older, if they so wished, into our agricultural colleges during the winter for, say, a course of lectures and discussion it would do far more to spread enlightenment with regard to agriculture than any method that has been adopted up to the present.  I am quite convinced that the folk schools in Denmark were the foundations of their agricultural uprising.  I went to an agricultural class myself and I am sure Senators did too.  I am sure the Leas-Chathaoirleach was at more of those classes than I was.</P>

The winter classes with the agricultural instructors are purely technical and there is nothing the same opportunity to have discussions. There is a fair amount of cramming and not a great deal of time to do the full course.  If we could take young or middle-aged men into these colleges for a fortnight in the winter and give them a course of lectures and let them have discussions on the scientific side of agriculture and encourage them to talk, there would be much more enlightenment than ever was spread through the agricultural classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that Johnstown Castle be made a centre where farmers' sons and others would have a chance to do a short course in the winter.  The people of the adjoining countryside should be <Col N="828" /> encouraged to go there, too.  Those who go should be shown the failures as well as the successes.  One of the quarrels I have is that, when you are brought to these colleges, the buildings are brushed up and nothing is out of place, no beast ever died there, no seed ever failed and there was no crop sown which did not yield a hundredfold.</P>
    <P>With regard to costings, I agree they have to be got from various centres under varying conditions, but somewhere or other there should be a group of specialists examining, dissecting and balancing the costings.  An agricultural college is the place for that and I suggest Johnstown Castle for that purpose. It would be a great mistake if we were satisfied to go on the orthodox lines of agricultural colleges as we knew them in the past, and I hope the Minister will serve us well by having the courage to adopt a different attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to convince you that what I say is in order.  I am profoundly disappointed at the Minister's speech.  He was asked what his intentions were regarding this college and I gather he intends it to be another of those standard pattern schools, teaching agriculture in bits and pieces.  It may specialise somewhat in soil research and, if I heard the Minister aright, it may pay special attention to horticulture.  Horticulture would probably be a most fertile form of study.  It may interest the Minister to know that I have personal knowledge of an ordinary country house garden which last year sold produce to the amount of £300 an acre.  That shows what can be done with horticulture. I can show the Minister the figures if he wishes, as I have access to them.  The owner would be glad to acknowledge the assistance received from the horticulture instructor in that county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not yet said that he appreciates our backwardness in the question of showing farm economy as a whole, showing people a working farm like that lived upon by themselves. Surely, he might have said at least that.  In the colleges, we see bits of crops here and there, we know there are lectures, test tubes, soil analyses and laboratories, but they are not so important, or rather they are only leading up to the culmination of all farming, which is productive farming, farming as an economic means of livelihood. I have had experience of the output of these colleges&mdash;I have seen a few of them&mdash;and I have not yet seen anyone coming from them who is able to view farm management as a whole. A man may be able to answer a question about stock, about elementary <Col N="830" /> medicines, about soils and manures, but the training to set out a farm plan, to deal with rotations and the management of labour, does not receive the attention it deserves.</P>
    <P>Here is an opportunity.  There are about 1,000 acres in Johnstown.  I do not agree with the Minister that it is not possible there to combine the two aspects and have a college devoted to the master and pupil aspect as well as a practical farm.</P>
    <P>There is quite enough land there to segregate 150 or 200 acres, and to say that that section has to be economic; that everything that goes on in that section has to be the same as a farmer-earning his livelihood would have to provide and nothing else.  All labour would be costed and, if men were taken on, their employment would be a charge on the books.  A set of books would be kept.  The whole thing is perfectly feasible.  I deplore the lack of imagination on the part of the Minister in not seeing the transcendent importance of that proviso with regard to agriculture.  Again, I say that if approached seriously our whole agricultural output could be doubled in a generation.  This schoolmaster and research aspect is all right, but for those who live out of farms as going concerns, and whose livelihood is farming, that aspect is neglected.  Is it not deplorable to be told that the system of costing set up was scrapped shortly after the last war, and that it has not yet been revived?  It is only going to be revived now, yet we have the Government fixing prices of produce in order to fix prices concerned with subsidies and the cost of living.  We have no fundamental knowledge of what these costs are.  I think the whole thing is very depressing. Would the Minister consider calling in the body that is known as the advisory council?</P>

If called in, that body could advise on what it considered to be the best method of managing this new acquisition in the interests of practical farming as a livelihood and as a going concern, as well as from the point of view of management.  To what extent is the Minister going to specialise in this college on the care and practical upkeep of machinery? Has he provided at any of the colleges instruction in the use and management and repair of tractors and agricultural machinery?  If not, will he consider setting aside a section where students would be able to do running repairs, to take down tractor engines and generally do work of that kind?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator realise what an agricultural college is?  He talked about bits and scraps of agriculture. What we are doing is to bring boys to the colleges and to say to them: &ldquo;Here is a cow which will make money for you.&rdquo;  The Senator wants us to send young men to Denmark to see what they do there, and then to come back and teach our boys how they do things in Denmark <Col N="832" /> and not how they are done in Clonakilty or other places.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator made some ridiculous suggestions.  The Senator has the idea that our young men are being taught all about test tubes. When boys go to college here they are taught how to milk a cow, how to feed it, and how to record what the cow yields.  They are also told that, if they want to have good cows when they go home, that is how to get them.  What could be more practical?  Then they are brought to the pig byre and shown sows and their good points and told how to secure sound animals when they go home, how they should be fed, and how the young should be dealt with.  The Senator thinks that the ordinary farmer does not keep any pigs.  The boys are also brought out to the fields and shown how oats should be properly sown, the proper variety to sow according to the soil, the proper way to manure oats and how it should be harvested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as it goes. It does not lead up to a balance sheet or how to show a profit in the essential things that the farmer has to deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have always to begin somewhere.  The farmer starts by learning how to fatten cattle, how to grow oats and barley and the balance sheet comes at the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is how a boy is taught how to become a practical farmer.  When he goes back home he says to his father: &ldquo;You must get rid of some of these cows&rdquo;.  After a long time the father agrees to buy a better type of heifer and gets a better milk yield.  That would affect the balance sheet.  The boy then says to his father: &ldquo;You should buy proper seeds if you want proper crops.&rdquo;  The <Col N="833" /> father agrees and again he gets better crops and that means a better balance sheet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>After a while the father of that boy sees that the young fellow did learn something because he says to himself: &ldquo;I am better off than I was.&rdquo; In other words, the balance sheet has improved.  That is what we are trying to do.  Senator Sir John Keane wants us to start by showing boys how to keep balance sheets.  What is the good of a balance sheet if a farmer does not improve his methods?  The Senator suggests we should keep proper balance sheets and that the college should teach them to do so, in order to find out in that way whether they were making money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The object is to enable them to do better, to see whether they are losing money and, if so, to try to make more money, and to do better.  We are not going to waste the time of agricultural colleges teaching boys how to make out balance sheets.  Senator John Keane says it would be a good thing if students were taught how to keep balance sheets.</P>

      <P>I pointed out that the Senator said that agricultural colleges dealt with bits and scraps and had test tubes here and there, and that when the boys went home they should keep balance sheets.  We are going to teach them how to improve their methods.  That is what they have been taught in the other agricultural colleges.  Some Senators stated that we had not been doing much to improve farming <Col N="834" /> methods.  I was looking at some notes which have been supplied to me in connection with the work of agricultural colleges, and it is interesting to find that in 1931-32, 153 students went through agricultural colleges, State owned and State aided.  Last year the number was 306 or exactly double. Now we are adding Johnstown Castle which is better still.</P>

      <P>I do not think it was. Anyway, the number of students increased from 153 to 306.  When we get Johnstown Castle going I suppose we will get more still.  As I said, there is a great demand for places by a number of young men throughout the country and I feel that we will be doing well when we add Johnstown Castle to the list of colleges we have already. With regard to soil research, a director has been appointed.  He had been working in the Albert College for years on soils and he has been appointed to take charge of the soil research in these colleges, with Johnstown Castle as headquarters.  He will have to get a number of helpers, but at the moment I cannot say how many. It will depend on the demand from the agricultural population and what services they want as time goes on.</P>

      <P>Clause (c) is also mentioned in Section 2, and therefore whatever it means in Section 2 it means in Section 11.  It says &ldquo;the Minister may carry out the provisions of clause (c) thereof&rdquo;&mdash;that is, in Section 2.  In other words, he is authorised to retain the services of the servants and employees and to remunerate the pensioners; so that I think that in Section 2 he is authorised to retain the servants, whereas in Section 11 he is authorised to remunerate the pensioners.  I think that one has to deal with the retention of servants, and the other with the payment of moneys.</P>

Expenditure out of public funds is one of the most important functions in the Dáil&mdash;we only appear in that matter in a very slight way&mdash;and if there is any force in Senator Sir John Keane's point, it would be necessary to re-convene the Dáil, and of course it is right that the Dáil should be convened if the matter is of such importance and if something has come through the Dáil which should not have come through.</P>

If £10,000 of that is taken off, then what the Senator wants to know, I take it, is whether estate duty is charged on the £90,000, or whether the first £10,000 or the last £10,000 is taken off.  What really happened was that estate duty was charged as if this had not been part of the property.</P>

      <P>In page 2, line 18, to delete the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of this Bill provides that a local authority may adopt schemes for certain purposes set out in the Bill.  It goes on to speak of schemes for civic improvement.  When we refer to Section 1, we find that the expression &ldquo;civic improvement&rdquo; includes &ldquo;anything which tends to improve the amenities of the functional area of the local authority concerned or is otherwise conducive to the welfare of the inhabitants or any class of the inhabitants of that functional area&rdquo;. This word &ldquo;class&rdquo; has arisen in connection with other legislation and has, I think, been the subject matter of an action in the courts quite recently. Those with whom I discussed the expression, including some lawyers, say that the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; presents tremendous difficulties and that it is an exceptionally unsuitable word to use in legislation of this kind.  One wonders what is meant by &ldquo;any class of the inhabitants&rdquo;.  Does the phrase mean the working class, the employing class, the farming class, or what does it mean?  If the word &ldquo;section&rdquo; were substituted for the word &ldquo;class&rdquo;, it would be far more satisfactory and the purpose of my amendment is to insert the word &ldquo;section&rdquo; in substitution for the word &ldquo;class&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>When this Bill was drafted, there was no special intention in regard to the use of the word &ldquo;class&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;class&rdquo; has an entirely general meaning. The amendment substituting the word &ldquo;section&rdquo; for &ldquo;class&rdquo;, I do not think, would get us very much further, because, so far as I can gather, the word &ldquo;section&rdquo; means in general a division or a portion or an act of <Col N="844" /> cutting.  I think the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; in the section will have to be defined by usage.  It is obviously intended to mean people of every group or vocational order in the community. I do not think that the section would be improved by the substitution of one word for the other.  I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>My view is that no defence of the use of the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; has been made.  The Parliamentary Secretary is absolutely at sea as to what is meant to be covered and the argument against the use of the word &ldquo;section&rdquo; which, in my opinion, is a better word, is simply to say: &ldquo;This is the draftsman's Bill and we are standing on it, rightly or wrongly.&rdquo;  I think that is not a very satisfactory attitude.  In my opinion, the Parliamentary Secretary might have consulted with his advisers as to whether there is not a difficulty about the word &ldquo;class&rdquo;.  I am informed by lawyers that there is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand Senator Duffy's viewpoint with regard to this matter, but the whole of this Bill is of a very tentative, experimental character and it can only be interpreted by experience.  The purpose of Section 1 is to define the reasons for putting the Bill itself into operation, that is to enable local authorities to acquire gifts, property or money, for purposes which will not result in a saving of the rates but will be in the form of genuine civic improvements.  Civic improvements are meant to affect every group and class in the community.  The word &ldquo;class&rdquo; is used in the most wide, general sense.  I hope it will never become subject to litigation.  If it did, I think there would be many other sections in the Bill which could be questioned in the same way, because the Bill is tentative and experimental. I cannot believe the substitution of one word for the other will in any way improve the Bill or enable it to do what it sets out to do in a more efficient manner.</P>

      <P>(f) a joint board or committee established by or under a statute to execute functions belonging to two or more of the following bodies, that is to say, councils of counties, corporations of county or other boroughs, councils of urban districts.</P>
      <P>The expression &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; is given, in this Bill, a rather restricted meaning.  I do not know why, because the expression has been defined in a number of recent Acts of the Legislature. It has been defined in the County Management Act, in the Public Assistance Act, and various Acts passed in the last five or six years. Why it is given the restricted meaning it has here in Section 1 is a bit baffling.</P>
      <P>I am endeavouring to extend the definition so as to include a joint board or committee established by or under a statute to execute functions belonging to two or more of certain bodies. I have in mind a board controlling a mental hospital.  That would enable the joint board, let us say, of Portrane and Grangegorman Mental Hospital Committee, to draft the scheme envisaged here for the purpose of accepting gifts, if gifts were offered, as they might very well be offered to a body of that kind.  There are a number of people who might consider that the giving of a gift for the purpose of improving the amenities of a mental hospital, and particularly for research work in connection with mental diseases, might very well be what is envisaged here.  I am endeavouring to bring that board within the definition of a local authority which will, when this Bill becomes law, be entitled to formulate a scheme.</P>

I think that a mental hospital may be controlled by the county council if that mental hospital caters only for the county in which it is situated.  It may be controlled by a joint board set up by adjoining county councils.  I think this amendment is totally outside the scope of the Act, which is to improve the amenities of the functional area of the local authority concerned, or conduces to the welfare of the inhabitants or any class of the inhabitants of that functional area.</P>
      <P>The Senator's amendment, if carried to its logical conclusion, would mean that the joint board of a mental hospital should draw up a scheme for improving the amenities and the grounds of the mental hospital in a manner conducive to the welfare of the inmates or a class of inmates of the institution.  I think the amendment is totally outside the scope of this Bill and I think it should be rejected.</P>

      <P>That is a complete misrepresentation of what has been suggested. What I am endeavouring to suggest is that a joint board, having <Col N="847" /> certain functions, be authorised to prepare a scheme.  There is no proposal to ask anybody to make them a gift. There is no proposal as to how the gift, if it is made, should be used.  The proposal is that if a joint board established under a statute to execute functions belonging to two or more named bodies is being offered a gift, it should be empowered to prepare a scheme to enable it to accept the gift. I think there is nothing illogical in that proposal and I suggest it is not outside the scope of this Bill.  It is at least as commendable as the proposal to include in the definition a vocational education committee or a committee of agriculture.  However, I am prepared to hear the Parliamentary Secretary on the point, because I do not accept the view of Senator Ryan that his objection is the right one.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the best way in which I can deal with amendments Nos. 2 and 3, and in particular with amendment No. 2, is to point out that this Bill, which was sponsored primarily by Mr. George Bernard Shaw, for the purpose of enabling the gift which he made to Carlow Urban Council to be adopted in a legal manner, is, as I have already said, very definitely experimental in character.  Senators will note Section 1:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Civic improvement includes anything which tends to improve the amenities of the functional area of the local authority concerned or is otherwise conducive to the welfare of the inhabitants or any class of the inhabitants of that functional area.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has not been found possible to go any further in regard to defining the improvement of an area over and above what could reasonably be done through a levy of rates.  It has not been found possible to phrase that clause in such a way as would make it impossible for a county council beyond all doubt to do anything which might possibly be done through the spending of the local rate.  When this Bill has passed, there will be an experimental period during which we hope that, if county councils adopt the scheme, they will <Col N="848" /> do so because of what has been said in connection with the Second Reading of the Bill.  There is no exact legal interpretation of that clause and there is really no point in trying to complicate the Bill further by adding to the number of authorities, or by doing anything beyond leaving it in as general a form as possible.  We are very anxious that the Bill should pass into law as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am being perfectly frank about it.  Mr. Shaw was 89 yesterday and he is most anxious that this scheme, which is of his own designing, should pass into law as soon as possible.  I would not deny that amendments may become necessary. If the custom should grow up of making bequests to local authorities, it is almost certain that some donor, sooner or later, will encroach on the fields of activity in which it might be said that a civic improvement scheme was doing something which the rates could genuinely do.  The no-man's-land between what is really an innovation, an unusual improvement or unusual change in the amenities of a a local area and improvements which definitely should be defrayed from the rates is very large, and we want to keep this Bill as simple as possible.  If Senators are willing to accept that explanation I should appreciate it, as that is the real reason why I do not like to complicate the Bill with any further additions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">

      <P>I do not want to be accused of holding up a measure which would enable a local authority in Ireland to accept a gift from Mr. George Bernard Shaw.  He is probably one of the most notable Irishmen of the day, and I hope that some of my friends on the other side will appreciate that probably the greatest monument to his life is the result of the elections announced yesterday in Great Britain, because Mr. George Bernard Shaw did more over a period of 50 years to bring about that result than any man, British or Irish, has ever done or attempted to do.  The Parliamentary Secretary, however, does <Col N="849" /> me an injustice, because I am not trying to complicate the Bill.  I am endeavouring, as he will see, to enable a joint board set up by two of the bodies named in Section 1 of the Bill to do what either of these bodies might do.  I do not see how that complicates the Bill in any way, with this exception, of course, that if we amend the Bill, no matter how desirable it may be to make the amendment, there will be delay because it will mean submitting the Bill, as amended, to the Dáil for approval.  If the Parliamentary Secretary assures me that that is the only solid ground for objecting to the acceptance of this amendment, I do not intend to press it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to satisfy Senator Duffy so far as I can in this matter.  There are one or two objections, apart from those already given.  First, some of the joint boards mentioned by him, namely, councils of counties, corporations of county or other boroughs and councils of urban districts have tended in the past to be, on the whole, permissive and rather temporary bodies, and because, among other reasons, they have been rather temporary in character, it was felt unwise to include them.  For the purpose of administering a Bill of this kind, it was felt that they should not be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to the question of <Col N="850" /> mental treatment, this no man's land between what can be done which would not ordinarily be done by the rates and what might be done by the rates is particularly difficult to define, because, under the new Mental Treatment Act, it is possible to have quite elaborate research schemes for mental treatment, and, so far as I know, there is nothing in the Bill which would prevent a number of local authorities from contributing jointly to mental research.  If it came to a question of having an especially beautiful ornamental garden surrounding a mental hospital, there is the matter of the no man's land which would be very hard to define.  It sounds very simple, but a very minute increase in the rate could produce a very beautiful ornamental garden, and it was felt, particularly in the case of mental hospitals, that the area of no man's land in respect of the Bill would be particularly hard to delimit.  These are the chief reasons why we have not included these joint authorities or mental hospital authorities&mdash;because of the work which can be done by joint hospital boards in regard to such things as research&mdash;and equally the fact that some of these joint committees have tended in the past to be temporary bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As in the case of another Bill, I am trying to understand the other person's point of view. I cannot get this from the Parliamentary Secretary: Suppose a man gave a gift which would have the effect of reducing the rates, what is the objection to it, from the point of view of this no man's land which the Parliamentary Secretary mentions?  Surely there is no objection whatever to it and surely there is equally no objection so far as a mental hospital is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can conceive, in respect of a mental hospital particularly, a person being very anxious, because of some kindness to a member of his family or something like that, to do something to commemorate the memory of that person by making such a gift.  Supposing a person wanted to give a sum of £1,000 to a mental hospital committee or the interest from it for a year or two to provide additional benefits for <Col N="851" /> the inmates of that hospital at Christmas time, where would be the objection to accepting a gift of that sort?  I cannot appreciate the Parliamentary Secretary's point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>We might take this point into consideration.  There is a street in Dublin called Shaw Street.  I do not know whether George Bernard Shaw owns this street or not, but assuming he does, and assuming he desired in the next few days in recognition of the introduction of this Bill to bequeath that street to the Committee of Management of Grangegorman Mental Hospital, is it not a fact that as the law stands that committee must refuse the gift?  If the proposal is that they should be enabled to accept it, it means that the Parliamentary Secretary must come back with a new Bill to enable the joint committee to accept this gift from George Bernard Shaw.  I do not see any reason why a body of that kind should be precluded from accepting a gift.  It is notorious that they are precluded because if any local authority were entitled to accept a gift of the kind mentioned, there would be no need for this Bill.  The Bill is introduced to enable certain named local authorities to accept gifts and decides that no other body except those named in the Bill shall be entitled to accept such gifts.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that both Senator Sweetman and Senator Duffy have misconceived the object of this Bill.  This is a Bill for the purpose of enabling local authorities to accept gifts for civic improvement.  A gift to a mental hospital is not a gift for civic improvement.</P>

      <P>Again I am endeavouring in this amendment to get clarity.  The proposal here is that the schemes which are authorised may be in respect to civic improvements generally&mdash;&ldquo;a particular class or particular classes of civic improvements or one particular civic improvement&rdquo;.  I suggest that the sub-section as it stands is meaningless and I am endeavouring to make an alteration in the wording by substituting the words &ldquo;or a particular description&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;a particular class or particular classes&rdquo;.  That is to say, the section would read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A local authority may from time to time adopt schemes for the acceptance holding and administration of gifts of real or personal property for civic improvements and any such scheme may be in respect of civic improvements generally or a particular description of civic improvements or one particular civic improvement&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I could not agree that Senator Duffy's amendment improves the phraseology.  Again we have to read this section in an ordinary common sense way.  For example, a particular class of civic improvements might mean the inauguration of a number of scholarships for a particular purpose in connection with vocational education.  Particular classes of civic improvements might mean a number of scholarships not only for vocational education but for vocational education and agricultural education.  One particular civic improvement might be taken to mean the establishment of a memorial park for the benefit of the inhabitants of a particular area.  I can only read the section in an ordinary common sense way and I frankly do not think the amendment would improve it.</P>

      <P>The actual variation of a civic improvement scheme is quite <Col N="855" /> definitely under this Bill a matter for the authority, but an application to the court is clearly a function of the county manager under the County Management Act, so that the section of the Bill is quite clear.  The county council has power to vary the civic improvement scheme, and it is the work of the county manager to carry out the actual variation on the instruction of the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too sure that the Parliamentary Secretary is quite right, and I will try to explain to him why.  Sub-section (3) reads: &ldquo;A civic improvement scheme may be varied by the local authority.&rdquo;  I take it, therefore, that the definition of a local authority in Section 1 must mean the council automatically?  Am I correct?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 starts off: &ldquo;A local authority may, from time to time, adopt schemes.&rdquo;  If it is necessary to define that the local authority means the council, that it means the elected members of the council and not the manager, why was it necessary to put in sub-section (5)?  The words &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; are exactly the same in Section 2 (1) as they are in Section 2 (3), and if they mean what the Parliamentary Secretary suggests in sub-section (3) they must equally mean it in sub-section (1).  Therefore, sub-section (5) is terribly unnecessary. I cannot conceive the Parliamentary draftsman putting in sub-section (5) if it was entirely unnecessary.  Therefore, I would suggest that whoever gave the Parliamentary Secretary that explanation was not quite accurate because, if &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; means one thing in one place and not in another, it is a new method of construction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Sweetman has confused an application to the court for the variation of a civic improvement scheme with its variation <Col N="856" /> by the local authority.  In sub-section (1) of this section the local authority is empowered to adopt a civic improvement scheme.  In sub-section (3) the local authority is empowered to vary that scheme if sanctioned by the court.  Sub-section (5) provides that the adoption of a civic improvement scheme shall be a reserved function.  Probably Senator Sweetman intended by his amendment to provide that the variation of a civic improvement scheme shall be a reserved function also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, the variation of that scheme is made by the local authority which adopted it.  In accordance with sub-section (3) a civic improvement scheme may be varied by the local authority which adopted it.  If the adoption of it is a reserved function, does it not follow that the variation of it is a reserved function also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>The local authority which adopted it may be the county council. <Col N="857" /> If it is a reserved function the scheme can only be adopted by the elected members of that local authority.  Therefore, the local authority which adopted it would still be the county council, and it may be varied by the county council.  The question is whether it should be varied by the elected members or by the county manager, so to speak.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can elucidate this particular problem.  Suppose a civic improvement scheme were adopted in connection with the bequest of a benefactor who died and left money for the establishment of a memorial park in a certain part of a town, and specified the actual townlands in which that park should be constructed. Later on, it was found far more suitable to use those townlands for the purpose of erecting houses, and it was necessary to apply to the High Court to change the civic improvement scheme and build the memorial park in a different place.  That would quite clearly be a variation of the original bequest.  As I understand it, and as I have been informed, it is for the local authority, the urban council, to come together and to vote that a variation be applied for to the High Court.</P>

I think the alteration of a scheme is entirely a matter for the county manager and that the county council would be told they had no right to vote on it. The county council never performs reserved functions.  All the executive functions are done by the county manager, and the County Management Act provides that all legal matters are to be conducted by the county manager. I think the county manager would tell the council which came together to <Col N="858" /> vary a scheme: &ldquo;That is none of your business and you have no right to vote on it.&rdquo;</P>

The whole difficulty here is the same difficulty as we have had with every Bill which came up to-day, starting off with the Agricultural Wages Bill and going on to the National Stud Bill, the Johnstown Castle Bill and this one&mdash; that they were produced to us at a ridiculous time, and that we were then put in the position of having to take it or leave it.  The attitude was: &ldquo;If you do not want to take it, call the Dáil together again, and we will brand you as the people responsible for it.&rdquo; That was the line taken with all those Bills, in fact, though it has not really been said in that blunt, coarse, rude, way.  But that is what it amounts to. I have been quite deliberate in putting down amendments even in the very limited time at our disposal.  For those five Bills, we had only one week between the Second Stages and to-day. Of course, I know Senator Quirke will tell me, quite accurately, that we could have postponed the sitting until next week, but we had to consider, and consider carefully, the civil servants who are trying to get away on holidays.  It would not be fair to leave them out of our consideration.  That was one of the reasons why I agreed&mdash;although I had not the time I would have liked to go through those Bills&mdash;to sit this week rather than postpone them for another week, but because I felt that being asked to rush through things in the way that we were asked to rush through them was such a bad principle, I have put down a great many amendments, and I have quite deliberately spoken to some of them although I knew perfectly well before I came in here to-day that it was only just a matter of making a protest, because obviously no Minister or Parliamentary Secretary was going to call back the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I think even at this late hour it would not do to let Senator Sweetman get away with anything like this.  There was agreement to take all these Bills to-day and to sit late to-night to finish them.  That agreement was subscribed to by Senator Sweetman on behalf of the majority of the people on the other side of the House. That was the agreement come to with all Parties, if one may be excused for mentioning Parties in this House. Now we have Senator Sweetman coming along and protesting against the way that he is being rushed.  It is Senator Sweetman and a few other people who are responsible for that. In fact, I was pressed into action myself, not, mind you, on behalf of the civil servants who would be held here if we did not finish to-night, but by reason of other arguments that were put up, and I think the strongest argument that was made for finishing to-night was the Galway Races.</P>

      <P>Then we had Senator Sir John Keane protesting against the way that he was being rushed, although he spent a good deal of time to-night speaking about the agricultural colleges.  When he had made all his speeches on that question he simply folded up his tent like the Arabs and went away.</P>

      <P>I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary if it is intended on this stage to move an amendment to meet the point which was mentioned by Senator Ryan so as to make sure that when the Bill becomes an Act the revision scheme will be a function of the elected members of the county council.  Under the Bill as it stands there is no assurance that the elected members will have anything to say whatever if, on the application of some person, a revision scheme is sanctioned by the court. The point raised by Senator Ryan ought, I think, to be made clear.</P>
