    <Title>King's Inns Library Bill, 1945 (Certified Money Bill)&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is the outcome of discussions which took place between the authorities of the King's Inns Library and the Department of Finance.  It was, I understand, represented to the Department <Col N="175" /> of Finance some time ago that books in the library deteriorated, and that something would require to be done to have them reconditioned.  The Department was impressed by the case made at the time, and agreed to make a grant of £3,000 last year, which was spent for that purpose.  During the discussions the point was made that an annual grant of £430 odd, previously devoted to the purchase of books for the library, should be spent as between repairs to books and the purchase of books.  In order to bring that about, the law requires to be amended, and at the same time the Department of Finance agreed to introduce the necessary legislation towards that end. These proposals are the outcome of the discussions.  When this Bill was going through the Second Stage in the other House other points were raised, such as the provision of legal text-books, and so on, but as far as I know they do not arise.</P>
      <P>I am informed that such matters are not really appropriate to this measure at all, but I have been asked to explain, for the information of those interested, that at the present time a committee which, I understand, is representative of the Law Reporting Society speaking for both branches of the legal profession is considering such matters as those to which I have referred. On that committee, there is also a representative of the Office of the Attorney-General.  No report has yet been made, and it is not possible to say what action may be taken when a report is received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The only observation I wish to make in regard to this Bill is not so much in regard to the Bill itself as in regard to the other matter which the Parliamentary Secretary has just mentioned.  One of the difficulties that those of us who are engaged in the law meet, and which the ordinary public meet very much more than we do, as stated in the other House, is that there are very few text-books which deal with the law as it is since 1923.  One of the reasons for that is that any book published here dealing with our own law is likely to <Col N="176" /> have such a limited market that the cost of publication is likely to be prohibitive unless the price of the book is raised beyond the means or the desire of the ordinary public to pay.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that his Department ought to consider making it clear to the committee which I know is considering this matter, that if it is deemed necessary in the interests of having the interpretation of the law available, some sort of subsidy towards the provision of such explanatory books should be made available.  It is only by some such help that the provision of text-books could be kept at a price commensurate with what the public could pay purely because the circulation is bound to be very limited.</P>
      <P>While I am on that subject, I may say that I fully appreciate that one of the difficulties that may exist in a period of emergency is the time-lag that is very evident in the preparation of official legal documents both in the King's Inns Library and elsewhere. This does make it extraordinarily difficult to carry on business.  I do not know whether it is the business of the Department of Finance or elsewhere, but I would urge that provision be made to ensure that the Statutes are made available very much earlier than they are available at the present time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill as a Senator, and welcome it as a Bencher of King's Inns.  I cannot understand why it should have provoked opposition in any quarter, especially as it is as far as I can see, the most non-contentious Bill that could come before any House.  In the first place, it is the product of an agreement between the Benchers of King's Inns and the Minister for Finance, and the Minister is giving effect to that agreement by the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may interest the House to know where the sum of £433 6s. 8d. in the Bill comes from.  In order to ascertain that matter, it is necessary to go back into history, and I think the historical background of this Bill is worth stating here in order that the House may know exactly what it is doing.  I do not intend to talk about text-books and other matters which are irrelevant to <Col N="177" /> this Bill.  We have to go back to the time of the introduction of printing in the Fifteenth Century.</P>
    <P>After the introduction of printing, copies of books multiplied and, of course, printing at that time was a potential for good and evil.  Therefore, there was what I may call a rigid Press censorship. Out of that Press censorship, and later out of the law of copyright grew the practice of requiring publishers to deposit free copies of these books for the use of certain specified libraries.  Now, the first time, as far as we can ascertain, when books were ordered to be deposited for the use of a national library was in the year 1537 when Francis I, King of France, in order to build up his royal library, issued an ordinance called the Ordinance of Montpelier, on December 28th, 1537, requiring every publisher to deposit a free copy of every book in his royal library.</P>
    <P>The king intended at that time and by that means, to preserve for future generations the literary output of the nation from that onwards.  Subsequently, in the year 1617, Louis XIII made a decree requiring that two copies of every book should be deposited for the use of the Royal Library, then at Paris.  That idea of obtaining free copies of newly published books for the use of the State or the national library spread to other countries, including England, where it was used for the purpose of Press censorship.</P>
    <P>The first Act, passed in 1662, was the Press Licensing Act.  This required three copies of every book newly published to be deposited&mdash;one for the use of the Royal Library, the second for the Bodleian Library, and the third for the use of the University Library at Cambridge.  The idea at that time was to censor all literature.  The copy in the Royal Library was perused by the king's counsellors for the purpose of detecting sedition, and in the universities by the divines to ascertain whether there was anything blasphemous or contrary to religion.  1662 was the year that Act was passed, and it continued until 1694, when it expired.  From that time there was no protection for publishers <Col N="178" /> against the pirating of their books, so they petitioned Parliament, and in 1709 the first Copyright Act was passed shortly after the Union with Scotland.</P>
    <P>By that Act it was required that nine free copies of all books published should be deposited.  One of these went to the Royal Library which the King kept in his palace in London. Another of them went to the Bodleian Library at Oxford and a third to the University Library at Cambridge.  A fourth went to the Sion College in London, a theological college, and in addition there were five free copies to be deposited for the use of Scottish libraries, one for the Faculty of Advocates at Edinburgh, and four for the Scottish Universities at Glasgow, St. Andrews, Edinburgh and Aberdeen.</P>
    <P>That was in 1709.  From 1709 onwards the publishers tried to evade the obligation.  There was no copyright in Ireland before the Union with the result that a number of valuable books published in England were printed here in Ireland on inferior paper and undersold the orthodox editions published in England.  When the Union was passed and came into operation on the 1st January, 1801, the British Government proceeded immediately to introduce a Copyright Act for Ireland. In introducing that Act the Government did so not so much for the benefit of literature as to protect the revenue because owing to the alleged pirating of copies of books in Ireland there was a diminution of the excise duty on paper payable in England at that time.  When the Copyright Bill was going through Parliament in 1801 a clause was inserted in the House of Commons providing that a free copy of every book should be forwarded to Trinity College Library, Dublin, and when the Bill was going through the House of Lords a clause was inserted providing that a free copy should be sent to the Library of the King's Inns.  That is the origin of this £433 6s. 8d.  Under the Act of 1801 publishers tried to evade their obligations and in 1814 a further Copyright Act was passed requiring them to contribute these eleven copies but giving the concession of extending the <Col N="179" /> copyright from 14 to 20 years.  In 1836 a Copyright Act was passed by which publishers were relieved of their obligation to furnish free copies in six cases, leaving the obligation to furnish free books in five cases still there. These six cases were the Sion Library in London, the Four Scottish Universities and the King's Inns Library.  That Act provided that in view of the right to receive a free book each Library which was so to speak disenfranchised should receive compensation out of the Consolidated Fund.</P>
    <P>The Act provided that that compensation was to be measured on the average value of the books received by the particular library during the three years ending the 30th June, 1836. That valuation was made and the different libraries received different compensation.  The library attached to the University of Glasgow got £707, the Library of St. Andrew's £630, the Library of Edinburgh University £575, the King's Inns £433, the Sion Library £363, and Aberdeen University Library £320&mdash;I am omitting shillings and pence&mdash;making a total of £3,028.  This charge was made on the Consolidated Fund of the late United Kingdom and the grant continued to be paid down to the introduction of the Copyright Act of 1911 by which the 1836 Act was repealed. Section 34 of the 1911 Act provided that the right to receive compensation from the Consolidated Fund should continue but contained the provision that compensation should not be paid in any year unless the Treasury was satisfied that the money paid for the previous year had been spent on the purchase of books for the use of and preservation in the library.  That grant continued to be paid out of the public moneys of the late United Kingdom until 1921. I do not know exactly what happened after 1921, but in 1927, when the Industrial and Commercial Property Protection Act was passed, Section 174, sub-section (1) provided that the right to pay compensation which obtained before December, 1921, should continue.</P>
    <P>That grant has been a charge on the Central Fund since that time.  The <Col N="180" /> Benchers of the King's Inns have used the £433 6s. 8d. each year on the purchase of books.  The intention, when the right to obtain free books was given, was that the libraries of the day should preserve them for a future generation.  Unfortunately, it was forgotten that books cannot last for ever unless they are bound and re-bound. At the end of the last war the authorities of the library of the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh, which was a copyright library, found themselves in financial difficulties owing to the accumulation of a large number of books which had not been bound or preserved.  They made a gesture of handing over the library to the nation and in 1925 it became the National Library of Scotland. The Faculty of Advocates retained the law books.  These books required rebinding, and a Scottish benefactor, named Sir Alexander Grant, in 1923 made a donation of £100,000 to the Library of the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance here has made a donation of £3,000 to the King's Inns for the rebinding of books.  The Benchers of the King's Inns appreciate that very much, because it will enable them to have valuable books in the library preserved for future generations of law students and scholars. The Benchers found that the sum of £433 6s. 8d., while very useful for purchasing books, could be usefully employed also in the binding and rebinding of books, and they made representations to the Minister for Finance for authority to use portion of that grant for the purpose of rebinding. This Bill is the result of these representations, and I can only say that the Benchers of the King's Inns appreciate very much what the Minister for Finance has done, firstly, by making the grant of £3,000, and secondly, by introducing this Bill so that they may have a free hand either to purchase books or spend the money on binding and rebinding.  For these reasons I support the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not detain the House very long.  I entirely agree with Senator Sweetman in what he has said, but I do not know that it is relevant to this Bill.  When there is a question <Col N="181" /> of a grant for the publication of books. I would like the Minister to remember to be generous towards the person writing the book.  The circulation here is too small for it to pay anybody to write a book at the moment, and grants will be required if we are to keep up-to-date.  The Incorporated Law Society have always been anxious to encourage people to publish, and they intimated their willingness to give a grant to anybody to publish a book on any subject which they approve.  They are always willing to help the Minister in a matter of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make one small point.  Senator Ryan said that he did not know why there should be opposition to the Bill.  I have read through the debate in the other House, and as far as my recollection goes there was no opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.J. O'Reilly Mr. P.J. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the suggestions made by Senators Ryan and O'Dea in regard to the matter of text-books.  There is a great difficulty at the moment, in so far as the Incorporated Law Society prescribes certain conditions, and these conditions cannot be complied with at present because the text-books are not available as the result of the present serious condition of affairs. Perhaps, the Parliamentary Secretary might convey a suggestion in regard to this matter&mdash;that is, pending the time when it will be possible to publish the text-books in this country&mdash;to the effect that an arrangement could be come to with certain well-known English publishers for the provision of these text-books, so far as Irish law is concerned.  The difference between these text-books, after all, is not very much, and I think it should not be impossible for the English publishers, if they were approached in a proper manner, to leave out the parts which particularly relate to English law, as it stands at present, and to insert the <Col N="182" /> parts, which are omitted at the moment, which provide for the existing Irish law.  I am putting forward that suggestion as a temporary arrangement in order to meet the difficulties that exist at the moment.  I am glad to hear of the arrangements that have been or are being made for the modernisation of this library, because it is well known that there is a great difficulty at the moment in view of the shortage of paper for such text-books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can understand this, the amount of money mentioned in the Bill has been paid, in the past, to the King's Inns Library for the buying of new books, and I assume that the money has been spent, year by year, on the purchase of new books.  Now, if that is so, and if portion of the money is to be diverted in the future for the purpose of binding or rebinding existing books in the library, it seems to me that there may not be sufficient money available for the purchase of new books and that, therefore, the original purpose of the grant will disappear altogether.  That is a point which, it appears to me, should be raised in connection with this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I cannot say to what extent the total sum of £433 6s. 8d., which was previously made available to the authorities of the library, was used for the purchase of books in any year, but from the information which has been placed at my disposal it appears that these authorities are satisfied that this sum, when divided between the purchase and the binding or the re-binding of books, will be adequate to meet their needs.  Now, as one who has no intimate knowledge of the requirements of these legal gentlemen, I take it, and I accept it, that when they are satisfied with an arrangement such as this it must be all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Senators Sweetman, O'Dea and O'Reilly, the fact that a committee is at present examining this whole question of text-books appears to me to be a clear indication that the difficulties are appreciated, and the further fact, <Col N="183" /> that on that committee sits a representative of the Attorney-General's office, is sufficient to establish the point that all those responsible are aware of these difficulties.  Naturally, I cannot say, and I think it would not be reasonable to expect that I should say, in advance of any report that this committee may make, what the attitude of the Department of Finance will be, but the House may safely take it, having regard to the way in which we have met these authorities, as Senator Ryan has explained, in the matter of the provision for the binding and re-binding of books and also the carrying out of the undertaking to have the sum that was annually provided for this purpose divided in this way, that we will not treat any reasonable recommendations of the committee in a niggardly fashion.  I think I am safe in giving that undertaking to this House on behalf of the Minister for Finance and his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">

      <P>As the House is aware, the main purpose of this Bill is to abolish the office of the Minister for Supplies and to transfer his functions to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and also to transfer the administration and business of the Department of Supplies to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It provides for the application of moneys, voted for the service of the Department of Supplies in the current financial year, to the same purposes, to be administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce in the future.  It provides also for adaptation of references to the Minister for Supplies in various statutes and statutory documents and in Memoranda and Articles of Association of various companies.  It provides for the continuance of licences that were issued by the Department of Supplies, and for legal proceedings which had been taken by the Minister for Supplies and which may not be concluded on the transfer date, and it also provides for the transfer to the Minister for Industry and Commerce of lands and property in the possession of the Minister for Supplies.</P>

    <P>The decision to effect the amalgamation of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Supplies <Col N="185" /> was arrived at because, in present circumstances, it is believed it will make for the more efficient working of both services.  To an increasing extent, the business of supervising the supply position &mdash; procuring supplies from abroad and distributing them internally&mdash;is becoming associated with the problems of post-war development with which the Department of Industry and Commerce has been more and more concerned in recent months.  It is to be hoped that the work done by the Department of Supplies during the emergency will diminish in the future, that no new restrictions upon supplies will become necessary and that the existing restrictions will, in course of time, disappear or, at least, be modified to such an extent as to require in lesser degree the services of a separate Department. On the other hand, it is to be assumed, and hoped, that the normal work of the Department of Industry and Commerce will develop again and that, to an increasing extent, the time of its officers will be turned to long-term planning and the immediate development work on which they were engaged prior to the outbreak of hostilities.  The circumstances affecting both Departments suggest their amalgamation, particularly as that amalgamation will increase the efficiency of the services of the various sections of the Departments and permit of some economies.</P>
    <P>I do not want to stress the economy aspect, because it was not for the purpose of economy alone the decision to effect amalgamation was taken.  It was based primarily upon the consideration that the discharge of the public services entrusted to these Departments would be increased in efficiency and that the difficulties and problems associated with the bringing to a conclusion of the Department of Supplies, which was purely an emergency Department, set up for the purpose of dealing with matters arising out of the emergency and intended to terminate with the termination of the emergency, will be modified as a result of the amalgamation.  Therefore I recommend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no reason to object to this Bill.  The only thing that puzzled me, and it still puzzles <Col N="186" /> me, is why the Department of Supplies was formed.  I have never been able clearly to see the necessity for the two Departments and I shall not oppose the action of the Minister in bringing one of these Departments to a conclusion.  I do not propose to waste the time of the House arguing back over the past as to whether the setting up of this new Department was wise or not.  So far as trade and industry are concerned, they will welcome the decision of the Minister.  I know that, in theory, there have been two Departments.  I have been solemnly informed by officials that they were consulting the other Department, located in the same building.  I have no doubt that such consultation took place but I have much doubt as to the necessity for such consultation. What is proposed by the Government now is acceptance of the realities of the situation.  That should tend towards efficiency and should simplify, if it is possible to do so, many of the functions carried out by the two Departments.</P>
      <P>To the mind of the ordinary man, the two Departments have been virtually one.  I know that there have been certain distinctions of function but most of us looked upon them as one Department, with the Department of Supplies as the predominant partner. By a special concession now, it is losing its name but I rather hope that it will still be the predominant partner &mdash;at any rate so far as its official staff is concerned.  It does not seem to me that this is the time to write the epitaph of the Department, whether that epitaph be favourable or unfavourable. It will be possible to come to an adequate and fair judgment on its work only after the lapse of two or three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be very easy for me to state at considerable length the matters in regard to which I think the Minister came to wrong conclusions.  It would be as easy for me to mention the matters in respect of which I was in agreement with the action of the Minister. Possibly, that would be in order on this Bill but it would be, to some extent, irrelevant and I do not want to treat this as an occasion when a great Department of State is disappearing <Col N="187" /> but rather as an occasion when we are giving legal effect to what has been slowly and gradually taking place and which it is desirable should take place.</P>
    <P>I was quite frankly critical of the actions taken by the Minister on a number of occasions, but I think that I do represent, to some extent, the manufacturers and, to a considerable extent, the traders, and when I say that the general consensus of opinion is that we always received courtesy from the Department and that, taken as a whole, the Department succeeded in getting a very efficient set of men to operate on its behalf.  A good many of the mistakes of the Department&mdash;if they were mistakes&mdash; were attributable to Government policy and those that were attributable to individuals were due largely to the fact&mdash;this is the only criticism I shall make and I make it because it may have some relevance in the future-that as soon as the officials became really familiar with the work, from our point of view, they were liable to be turned on to a completely different type of work.  That did not always happen but it did happen in the case of quite a number of officials who had to do with business details.  It did not apply to the senior officials but it did apply to a considerable extent to other officials.  I suggest to the Minister that, during the time, which, I hope, will be short, and which, I am sure, he hopes will be short, in which licensing and control will be necessary by the Department of Supplies, he should make an effort to keep the same officials handling the same work. That would lead to efficiency and would be appreciated by traders generally. It should not be impossible Departmentally to arrange that officials would not suffer in the matter of promotion because of this arrangement. We have to make these arrangements in business.</P>
    <P>Oftentimes a man who would be entitled to promotion by going elsewhere is kept in the same position for the sake of convenience, and steps are taken to secure that he does not suffer in respect of salary or promotion because <Col N="188" /> of that.  It would be most unfortunate if, in relation to such matters as control of imports, exports and production, we were to have a new set of officials after the change-over who would have to learn the business.  I am giving the opinion of traders and manufacturers generally when I say that I hope that will not be so.  On this Bill, a discussion as to the work of the Department of Supplies during the war period would not be appropriate.  This is a purely administrative Bill, and not a Bill suited to such discussion.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the remarks of Senator Douglas with regard to the relations of the now defunct Department of Supplies and the industries and trades with which its operations were concerned. It was a Department of which it could be said that during its existence it got more kicks than ha'pence. Much of the criticism was felt to be desirable and necessary, but I think it would be very churlish if I, as another representative of industry, did not now pay my tribute to the Department officials for the amount of help and assistance they gave traders generally. There were times when their actions caused a lot of ill-feeling and soreness, but, taking it by and large, as has been said by Senator Douglas, and speakers in the other House, it is a matter of surprise, not that that Department made so many mistakes, but that it made so relatively few.  I do feel that at least I should pay that little tribute to the officials of the Department, and I am sure others feel as I do about it. In saying that, may I also express the hope that, although the functions of the Department are to be continued, the day is not very far distant when the need for such functions will disappear. We do feel that there is a danger that the exercise of power and control has gone on for so long that it has become a habit, not merely with senior officials.  May I say in the presence of the Minister, who is now losing one of his functions, but who still retains both in an individual capacity, that there is the danger that these officials do not see how irksome the exercise of these controls and powers is to the people over whom <Col N="189" /> they are exercised.  I do not want to retract anything from the tribute I have already paid to the Department, but I do again express the hope that the need for all restrictions and control will disappear in the very near future, and that traders and manufacturers will again be permitted to carry on their business in that competitive fashion which alone can make for efficiency.</P>

    <P>I want to join in the welcome extended to this Bill, mainly, because to me it is something in the nature of a landmark which indicates that we are about gradually to get back to a resumption of the work of industrial development which unfortunately we had to leave off six years ago.  I should like to join also in the tributes paid to the Department for its work during the emergency.  I desire to underline the remarks made by Senator Summerfield when he said in effect, that too much attention has been paid to the minor mistakes made by the Department and practically no attention to the marvellous work it achieved in spite of enormous difficulties.  While paying our tribute to the officials of the Department, from the highest to the lowest, I think it is only right that we should pay tribute on this occasion also to the man who was responsible for framing their policy, who was responsible in the Department and outside it for seeing that that policy was effectively carried out.  I am very happy to think that notwithstanding the efforts made to undermine his work and to belittle all that he achieved, on every occasion that the public got an opportunity of expressing what it thought, it made no mistake in expressing appreciation.  To-day, in paying tribute to his work, we are merely in line with the public in expressing our appreciation of all the Minister did to maintain essential supplies during the years of the emergency.</P>

I speak on behalf of the women of Ireland, for whom the work of the Department has been of such enormous advantage.  The Minister and the officials of the Department had a tremendously difficult job in trying to divide as fairly as possible among the whole people of Ireland, rich and poor, the resources of the <Col N="191" /> country, and whatever goods were imported. I think everybody in this House is glad to have the opportunity of expressing appreciation of the very efficient manner in which the Minister discharged his difficult task, and I think we are all glad to avail ourselves of this opportunity, the first since the Minister has come to this House in his capacity as Tánaiste, to say how pleased we are that he has been honoured with that office.</P>

      <P>Now that the Department of Supplies as such is being would up, my only regret, a regret shared by many people, is that the circumstances which led to the formation of that Department have not also passed.  I refer to the shortage of supplies which still necessitates a system of rationing throughout the country.  There is a matter of very grave concern to the vast majority of the people with whom I have been associated from time to time, namely the question of the tea ration.  In the adjoining country it has been found possible since the cessation of the war in Europe to increase the tea ration to five times the quantity of the ration in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be associated with the terms of approbation which have been extended to the officials concerned with the allocation of supplies during the emergency.  I know that many hard things have been said about them but, at the same time it is undeniable that since they got into their stride, they have done their <Col N="192" /> work remarkably well.  On every occasion that I appealed to them or made representations to them on behalf of constituents, I found that in the main they were very anxious to help in almost every case.  In one case in which I was particularly interested myself, I found the help and guidance of the Department of Supplies of great assistance during a very trying period. While I have no hesitation in paying them that tribute, I am certainly in agreement with the hopes that have been expressed that the time will soon come when Departmental interference in, ordinary business will not be necessary, and when business people throughout the country will be able to carry on their business without interference from the Department.</P>
      <P>I hope the quantity of supplies available in the country will soon be sufficient to render unnecessary further interference by officials of the Department with traders throughout the country.  Those people who are anxious to start new businesses&mdash;I know several of them who have come into the country with some capital&mdash; must be afforded an opportunity of securing supplies of shopkeeping lines, to enable them to carry on and to give the employment which is very necessary in many districts.</P>

      <P>The impression is being created in the minds of members of this House that because the functions of the Department of Supplies are being transferred to another Department, the Department of Supplies and all it implies goes by the board.  The Minister made it perfectly clear that that is not so.  The dual office which he held disappears, but the Minister, a tually in person, remains responsible for the supply services and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  This has misled Senator Summerfield and some of us into becoming jubilant immediately, to suggest that all controls disappear, and that the sky is the limit and that the industrialists will be happy for evermore.  While we all desire that the supply situation should be such as to enable the removal of the great majority of the controls, we must realise the position has not reached <Col N="193" /> that stage, and that it would be a disaster of the first magnitude if controls were removed in respect of many articles which are in short supply and which are likely to be so for a long time to come.</P>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, I want to go on record as stating that in my view it would be an error of judgment to remove controls in respect of commodities which are in short supply and in respect of commodities in which those with the monopoly&mdash;those who got in on the ground floor&mdash;can make unlimited profits.  I feel, however, that there is little need to impress that view on the Minister.  I think it corresponds pretty well with what he has said himself recently, and for some considerable time, in regard to the situation, but I feel we should not let this point go by default.  So far as the administration of the Department is concerned, there is general agreement that it was confronted with a very big and difficult task, and that that task was dealt with in an excellent manner.</P>
      <P>Everyone who has spoken has borne testimony to the courtesy of the Department's officials and their axiety to meet often unreasonable demands and unresonable requests.  They have done that, I think, in a very exemplary manner.  At the same time it would be a mistake to assume that no errors were made.  Some serious errors were made, but we need not discuss them now.  It is sufficient to say that the public must not be left under the impression that because the Department of Supplies as such is being abolished, the supply system is also abolished. It should be made perfectly clear that the system is being continued, for the present, at any rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>While I want to be completely associated with the remarks made by Senator Douglas as to the courtesy and consideration of the officials of the Department now being wound up, I do want to refer to one matter.  The Bill itself provides for the transfer of the functions of the Department of the Minister for Supplies. While I gladly welcome that transfer of the functions, I do so in the hope that under the Department of Industry and Commerce the method <Col N="194" /> of dealing with the claims of those who had their property taken over in County Kildare will be more accelerated. I think the Minister will agree with me that the delay in dealing with compensation claims in the cases where bogs have been acquired in County Kildare has created a great deal of unrest and a certain amount of justifiable friction.  The people there feel that they have not been treated very fairly, that while it may be necessary in the national interest to acquire their property, the Department of Supplies, which we are now winding up, did not deal as expeditiously as it should have dealt with the assessment of compensation and the payment of that compensation.</P>
      <P>I, therefore, take advantage of this opportunity to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as the Minister about to be in charge of these functions, to give us an assurance to-day that those matters will receive more expeditious attention in the future and that he will endeavour, as soon as possible, to clear away all outstanding difficulties in that respect.</P>
      <P>There is a feeling abroad that in the administration of the powers of acquisition necessary during the emergency period, consideration in many instances was not paid to local amenities and I hope that the new Department carrying out the same functions will set a better example.  While saying that, I subscribe wholeheartedly to what Senator Douglas said about the courtesy and consideration of the Department as a whole, but there have been cases&mdash;it was inevitable there should be cases having regard to the number dealt with&mdash;where the treatment of individuals has not been very satisfactory.  There was one particular case in which, in consequence of the taking of a man's land, his stock was able to get on to the public road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After representations, a very fine pair of gate piers and a fine gate was set up and so far as anything that wanted to travel the road was concerned that would have been an excellent barrier, but the people who put up the gate and the pier knew they were being put up for the purpose of retaining stock, and yet they allowed <Col N="195" /> a grass margin of six feet on each side of the pier so that if the cow had been trained to travel the road there would be no difficulty, but if the cow went round the corner it could get out over the grass margin.</P>
    <P>These were some of the difficulties which, it was to be hoped, would receive more expeditious attention from the new administration of the Department.  The Minister will admit that it is necessary to wind up cases about compensation and to ensure that the people who have had their livelihood taken from them in County Kildare by the acquisition of bogs which they were using will be treated in a generous manner so as to ensure that there will be the same happy reciprocation between them and the new Department, as Senator Douglas told us existed between traders in general and the old Department.</P>

      <P>I feel that the citing of individual cases in this debate might take away from the tribute due to the Department of Supplies.  It is generally agreed in this House and throughout the country that the Department has served the community very well during a critical period. Tributes have been paid by industrialists. I want to pay a tribute from the ordinary man's point of view. Tribute is due to the Department because of the great success of the rationing system.  Were it not for the great success made of the rationing system by the Minister for Supplies this country would not be in the happy position it is to-day.  If we were to imagine what would have happened if our rationing system had collapsed during the war years we would have to agree that it would be a serious burden.  One man would be placed against another and the best off man would get the most of the country's goods which were in scarce supply.  If a breakdown had occurred, the poor would have got nothing, and a tribute is due to the Department which it would be a pity to spoil by the introduction of individual cases.  I am sure that every member of the House could tell us of cases in which he considered there was hardship, but in the long run the Department has been a great success.  Were it not for this success, and the value of the coupon&mdash;it became as valuable as the pound note&mdash;the pound note would also lose its value, as happened in fact in European countries in 1918 after the last war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is anything I might add except to remark upon the future of food control.  Unless we are satisfied that the same control will continue to be exercised by the Department of Industry and Commerce, I think the Bill should be opposed, but once we are satisfied that the control will be continued, I think we may be assured that the supply position will be safeguarded.  Even at this stage a very serious situation could arise if controls were to be withdrawn, but I am satisfied that in the new Department, under the same Minister, the position will be regulated in such a way as to give an even-handed deal to all the people and to ensure that <Col N="197" /> consumers get their fair share of commodities in scarce supply.</P>
    <P>I suppose we all hope that controls will be eliminated altogether soon.  I feel sure that as soon as that position is arrived at, the Minister will remove the controls, but in the meantime the Department of Industry and Commerce should keep sufficient powers to ensure a fair supply for all sections in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my first duty to thank the Seanad for the tributes to the staff of the Department of Supplies which have been expressed by those Senators who spoke on the Bill.  I think that these tributes are fully justified.  Members of the Seanad, industrialists and traders, saw the work of the Department of Supplies from one angle only.  I was privileged to see the work of the staff of that Department from another angle, and I would like to go on record as saying that it was the efficiency of the staff, their devotion to their duties, their willingness to accept greatly increased and often troublesome duties whenever necessary, which made my work as Minister, during the emergency, comparatively light&mdash;certainly much lighter than it might have been.</P>
      <P>The effect of this Bill will be to amalgamate the staff of the Department of Supplies with the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I can assure Senator Douglas that in the process of amalgamation it will be, naturally, my endeavour and the endeavour of the senior officers of the new Department to allocate the different sections and sub-sections of the Department to officers whose experience will enable them properly to discharge the duties arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Supplies grew from small beginnings.  In the early stages of the emergency it was a very small Department indeed, reckoned by the number of staff in its service.  As the emergency developed and new problems arose, the staff had to be augmented very considerably, and inevitably officers had to be taken from duties on which they were previously engaged and put on to other duties regarded as more urgent or more important, while the newer arrivals in <Col N="198" /> the Department's service were given the easier and less difficult tasks.</P>
    <P>That process of change continued while the growth of the Department continued and to some extent the proper staffing of the new Department of Industry and Commerce will require further changes, but it would be the normal course to pursue, and certainly the one that wisdom would suggest, to retain on the existing duties, where possible, officers who discharged these duties satisfactorily in the past.</P>
    <P>It is quite true, as has been stated by some Senators, that the disappearance of the Department of Supplies as such does not mean that there has been any change in the supply position which makes it possible for us to contemplate the relaxation of certain restrictions, or the abolition of other controls, which emergency conditions called for.  It is the policy of the Government to get rid of these controls as quickly as possible, but so long as there is a scarcity of essential materials it is necessary to retain rationing in some form and control of distribution and control of price. I hope that nobody will assume that with the enactment of this measure any of the existing controls deemed necessary in relation to existing conditions will cease to be operative, or cease to be enforced when the amalgamation is completed.  I do not like to attempt any forecast as to future changes in the position, but I think it is extremely unlikely that any of the existing rationing schemes can be abandoned for 12 months, and some of them may have to be retained for a much longer period. Certainly, it will be two or three years before trade and industry will be operating upon what might be described as a normal basis, that is, some basis in which restriction upon the total quantity of goods available will not require Government supervision of distribution and use of essential commodities.</P>
    <P>Senator Summerfield, and those for whom he speaks, may be assured that no power to deal with emergency conditions will be retained for one moment longer than it is required.  Already a number of Emergency Powers Orders have been revoked by Orders made by me as Minister for Supplies under the general powers of the Emergency <Col N="199" /> Powers Act, and Orders made by the Government as Government Orders. The process of revoking these Orders will be continued as changes in the general conditions permit of it.  I fear I cannot hold out any hope that the enactment of this measure will be accompanied by a general amnesty in respect of penalties imposed for offences against the Emergency Powers Regulations. The necessity for maintaining these regulations is as great now as it ever was, in fact, the necessity for the regulations and their enforcement is probably greater, because there is in the minds of people a feeling that the end of the emergency is approaching, and consequently they can be less particular in their adherence to the letter of the regulations than they were during the period when the war was actually in progress in Europe.  There is always a temptation to people to take a chance.  That temptation is increased by delays in the legal machinery which make a situation in which the hearing of charges before a court frequently takes place many months after the offences have occurred.</P>
    <P>If the trading community felt that the regulations themselves would be liable to be repealed before any offence they may have committed will be the subject of legal proceedings, then they would be tempted to expect lenient treatment and would be more likely to take a chance.  On other occasions I have availed of the opportunity to make it clear that all these controls will be not merely enforced but will be made effective by the same means as in the past until they are formally abolished.  When they are formally abolished then they will be no longer binding and nobody will have received preferential treatment as a result of their abolition.</P>
    <P>I can assure Senator Sweetman that I share his desire to deal expeditiously with compensation claims arising out of turf development schemes, but there are many cases in which there are legal difficulties.  In so far as delays have occurred they are not always attributable to the staff of the Department of Supplies.  Other Departments are also concerned and the facts of individual cases do not permit of expeditious <Col N="200" /> treatment.  The desire to pay compensation promptly is shared by me and the officers of my Department.</P>
    <P>On the matter of tea rationing, if I am not out of order I would refer Senator Ruane to a statement I made in the Dáil.  I think that is all I require to say on this stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister has referred to one matter, the practice by <Col N="201" /> virtue of which a licence is revoked and sometimes causes very considerable embarrassment, on occasions, even to the justice concerned.  I urge the Minister in cases where there are prosecutions, to ensure that it would be brought to the notice of the justice before he fixes any penalty if it is the intention of the Department to revoke the licence.  This would occur only after an offender had been convicted, but before the justice imposes the penalty.  If the licence referred to in this section is to be revoked, that intention should be notified to the justice before he fixes the penalty so that he will not fix one penalty and the Minister then come along and fix a second penalty.  It is a matter the justice should take into account when he is fixing the penalty.  I am not suggesting that licences should not be revoked. I am merely suggesting that all the facts should be before the justice when there is a case arising out of a conviction on which the licence will be revoked.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add this to what Senator Sweetman has said.  I am not one of the members of the House who has had very much experience of being troubled by traders and others making appeals to me, but I feel it is contrary to the principle of law and justice that no indication should be given to the person whose licence is revoked as to the period for which that penalty is to be imposed. If I commit an offence I should be punished, but if a man loses his soul he knows he is going to Hell.  In the case of breaches of the law, so far as the Minister for Supplies is concerned, when you have committed an offence you never know the degree of punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some cases, not so many, have been brought to my notice in a casual way, not through appeals for intervention, in which people have lost a permit for a motor car or tea or sugar licences. If I am to be put out of business, I ought to know the period for which I am to remain out of business.  In some cases it may be a matter of months. One does not know.  But one has got to live, and one is entitled to know the period of the punishment.  The <Col N="202" /> policy of the Minister is to take away a permit after the court has passed its judgment, and neither the defendant nor the justice in the case knows when the permit is going to be restored, or what prospect the defendant has of earning his livelihood. I do not agree with that.  I think it is unjust, and not the way to appeal to people from the point of view of getting respect for the law.</P>

      <P>I have just heard what Senator Sweetman and Senator Baxter have said, and I would like to say that I do not approve of the suggestion of notifying the district justice. The district justices are the judges as between the Minister and the defendant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the judges of the case before them.  Up to the present, they know perfectly well that if there is a conviction the licence will be revoked.  If they are told beforehand that it will be revoked, and they are supposed to take that into account, it will make it much more difficult for the Minister to cancel the revocation and give back the licence to the defendant. I know that licences have been given back after being revoked, and that is better than that you should have a hard and fast rule.  I prefer that district justices should not be given any dictation.  They administer the law very well, and it is better to leave them alone.  There may be differences in the penalties.  Some are more severe than others, but it is very hard to know when they are really more severe.  A penalty of 10/- imposed on a man in Connemara may be as great as a penalty as £10 imposed on a man in another county.  I would like to have all these matters left to the absolute discretion of the district justices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator O'Dea has put his finger on the main point. The justice is concerned only with the case before him.  He has merely to decide the case and what is the appropriate penalty.  The revocation of a licence to trade in any particular commodity <Col N="203" /> is not intended as a penalty. It is not a punishment, it represents a decision by me, as Minister responsible, that a particular trader, having regard to the general circumstances arising out of the conviction, is not to be trusted in the distribution amongst the public of essential commodities which are scarce.  When a trading licence is cancelled it is not very often that it is restored.  That may happen in one or two cases where the circumstances are exceptional or it may happen that the notice to revoke the licence was not proceeded with when it was discovered, on examination of the circumstances, that no other channel of distribution could be found for a particular locality and that the convicted trader, unsatisfactory though he may be, was the only effective means of getting supplies into the locality.</P>
      <P>In answer to Senator Baxter, I would say that when trading licences are revoked they ordinarily stay revoked. There is no question of restoring them, and the person concerned will not be concerned in the sale of the commodities over which control is exercised until the control is removed altogether. That does not apply in the case of a car permit.  Misuse of a car permit, whether a private or hackney vehicle, is not an offence under the Emergency Powers Orders of the same kind as the sale of tea at an excessive price or outside the ration.  In such case the withdrawal of the permit is not as a rule for an indefinite period.  In accordance with administrative practice the permit is restored after some months.  Another penalty is frequently imposed, namely, the reduction of the amount of petrol allowed to the permit holder corresponding to the amount of petrol misused.  If the licence was revoked a problem would arise in selecting new persons to whom a licence would be issued in order to provide the hackney service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A problem would arise when the local dispensary doctor or clergyman was deprived of his car in giving the public the service for which they were allowed the car.  I have frequently endeavoured to make it clear that the granting of a permit is not intended to <Col N="204" /> give holders a convenience that other members of the public are not given. It is intended to enable them to discharge some duty which the public require from them.  Consequently the withdrawal of a permit in consequence of the misuse of a car is really a penalty on the public rather than on the individual concerned.  In such cases the temporary withdrawal of the permit or the reduction of the petrol allowance is merely designed to bring home to the individual concerned the necessity for adhering to the regulations.</P>
    <P>The suggestion therefore which Senator Sweetman made is one that it would be unwise to adopt.  It implies that the withdrawal of the permit is intended as a penalty on the individual. It should be clear that a penalty is not intended as such.  It is a reorganisation of the method of distributing essential commodities by the elimination of traders who have shown in the past they cannot be trusted to distribute them fairly.  As an administrative matter it is not the appropriate concern of a district justice at all.  Such permits as are cancelled consequently remain cancelled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, if he reads the reports of ordinary criminal cases, will appreciate that a judge almost always inquires&mdash;I am not talking now about major offences or crimes, but of minor offences&mdash;whether a conviction will mean that the person concerned will also lose his employment. I suggest that there is a perfect analogy there in the case of a person losing his licence to trade meaning the loss of his means of livelihood&mdash;and that it ought to be at least a practice of the Minister's Department to inquire what the effect of the revocation of the licence will be, and if the person's livelihood is dependent on whether the licence is going to be revoked or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very glad to hear the Minister say that there <Col N="205" /> was an alternative to the revoking of a permit in the case of the withdrawal of motor car licences, because I have personal knowledge of two or three cases of licences being withdrawn or withheld for from five to seven weeks, which caused great inconvenience and even hardship to the people concerned. I interviewed some of the officials of the Minister's Department, and I must say that I have always found them extremely courteous, but in spite of representations made, not alone by myself but also by the people who initiated the proceedings, nothing has been done about those two or three cases, so far as I am personally aware. I suggest that it is a very great hardship that a man, who often has a large family dependent on him, should have his licence withdrawn&mdash;his only means of livelihood.  That is why I suggested, earlier on, that consideration should be given to that particular type of case.  When it is a question of a court case, I suggest that the people concerned have been punished severely enough.  They have served a half, or, in some cases, two-thirds of their sentence already, and in view of the changed circumstances I think that this would be a very favourable time for the Minister to review these cases, particularly as he has admitted that there is an alternative form of penalty. I think that that would be better because, at the moment, depriving these men of a permit means that they and their families are almost starving, and it certainly will not ensure that the new arrangement will begin under the best possible auspices.  Accordingly, I would appeal to the Minister to avail of this opportunity now to extend this to cases such as I have mentioned. They have all been punished already, and some of them very severely, and since this new arrangement has the good will of all concerned I would appeal to the Minister to look into that particular type of case and remit the punishment that has already been imposed. I must say that, apart from the personal hardship on these men, a lot of inconvenience is also caused to the people in the locality concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with a good deal of what the Senator has said, I would not be in favour of anything <Col N="206" /> like a general amnesty.  It was found by experience that the cars owned by a great many of these hackney-car owners were used, not for the convenience of the public, but for the personal convenience of the owners.  Some of them took out the licence for that purpose only, and in such cases I do not think that the permit should be restored at all.  Before the war, many vehicles were registered as hackneys but it was found that the cars were not being used for the convenience of the public at all, but for the convenience of their owners. Where that was found to be so, the licence was cancelled, and I think it is right that such a licence should be cancelled and that it should not be restored.  In the case of a hackney-car owner, dependent on the hackney-car for his livelihood, if it was found that he had committed an offence on one occasion against the regulations, restoration of the permit would be made after a period, and in any such case, representations made on behalf of the individual concerned, by either Senators or Deputies, will be considered in relation to the particular family circumstances, which is often a ground of appeal, because it is quite clear that in one case a revocation of the licence for three months might be a greater hardship than the revocation of the licence for a longer period in another case: that the revocation of the licence for a short period in one case might be a more severe penalty than its revocation for a longer period. I agree with that, but I could not agree with a general amnesty.</P>

They think that that is the way to go about it and that, if you have sufficient <Col N="207" /> influence, your permit can be restored.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>Well, I do not know what experience the Senator has.  I shall approach him the next time that I want anything done, but my view is that when a licence is revoked the person concerned should be told how long the revocation will be for.  I think that that really would be the proper way of dealing with the matter, instead of this business of feeling that if you get enough Senator O'Deas or Senator O'Reillys to make representations it would be all right, instead of asking Senator Baxter.  I do not mean to introduce political questions into this, but I do want to know whether I can inform these people if I can do anything about the matter or not, because otherwise, I do not want to be bothered about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if there were a revocation of a permit for a certain period, that would not prevent Senators or Deputies being approached in the case of clergymen who are doing their parochial duties, or doctors carrying out their medical duties, but it must be remembered that some of these people might be 80 years of age and could not be expected to carry out their duties by riding on a bicycle, while others might be very much younger and could easily do so.  Individual circumstances have to be taken into account.  It is not the same thing to require one of these men to do his duty on a bicycle as it is to require the other.  Normally, in the case of persons of that class, the <Col N="209" /> permit would not be revoked unless it was clear that the individual concerned had flouted the regulations on more than one occasion, and had knowingly done so.  In the ordinary case of slight misuse, no further action is, I think, taken than to write to the individual concerned referring him to the regulations and requesting him to adhere to them in future.  It is only where there has been a sort of persistent misuse of the vehicle, or misuse in such form as to create the possibility of public comment or public belief that the individual concerned has got privileges which other individuals in the same class have not got, that the revocation of the permit is affected. Normally, that revocation is not maintained for more than three months.  It is only in circumstances which are exceptional that the revocation extends beyond three months.</P>

      <P>When I said a few moments ago that essential facts might come to the notice of the Department, I was not answering for the Minister nor had I any particular knowledge in that regard.  My remark was in the nature of a suggestion as to what I should like to be the position. When Senator Sweetman said that it should be intimated to the district justice, before arriving at his decision, whether or not a licence would be revoked, the Minister said that revocation was not a punishment but merely action taken by the Minister in the exercise of his duty, having regard to the circumstances of a particular case. I think that the Minister is quite correct in taking that view.  The Minister is justified in revoking a licence when he considers that the holder has abused his privileges under the licence.  He is justified in doing that in cases in which a person has sold tea, sugar, or butter, which he received for normal distribution to his customers, at a higher price than that fixed.  In my opinion, that person should be punished, because his is a greater crime than many other offences.  I do not agree completely with the Minister when he says that, when a licence is revoked, it is revoked, and nothing can be done about it. <Col N="210" /> There can be cases in which licences are revoked and in which, in the light of facts later elicited, it could be fairly strongly argued that there had been a slight miscarriage of justice.  Where there has been even a slight miscarriage of justice, I think that the licence holder is entitled to have the position rectified.  I know a case in which a licence holder got a double quantity of sugar through a miscalculation on his part.  That was not discovered by the Department for some time.  That trader was entitled to a supply of sugar for catering, which was another part of his business.  Through his own fault, he had not got that supply and, when he got the double supply for distribution in his business he utilised it for catering purposes.  His licence was revoked&mdash;quite properly, but in the light of the facts which later transpired, I think the Minister should reserve power to grant the licence again in such a case.  The Minister is quite correct in revoking a licence in every case where there has been a conviction but he should reserve power to re-grant the licence if he considers that exceptional hardship is being imposed on the trader.</P>

      <P>In my remarks on this motion, I want to make clear that I am not finding any fault with the manner in which the Act has been administered. I do not urge that unreasonable penalties were imposed, but I suggest that the situation has so changed that the Minister might well consider having future prosecutions tried in the regular courts rather than in an exceptional court.  I can well understand that, in the circumstances of the last three years, it was, probably, necessary to have recourse in certain cases to the Special Criminal Court, but that situation is rapidly altering.  I do not want to be taken as complaining that the Special Criminal Court was an unfair court.  I do not think that it was.  Statements made to me by lawyers practising in that court confirm the view that it was impartial, competent and efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am basing my case for departing from that practice on the principle that the State should not have recourse to special courts for the trial of civil offences save in exceptional circumstances.  We ought to get back as rapidly as we can to the trial of these cases by the ordinary civil courts.  I urge the Minister, if he finds that it is not in his power when this Bill is implemented to determine the court in which a prosecution will be brought, and if that is to be decided by some other authority, that he <Col N="212" /> should come back to the Oireachtas for power to enable him to determine that these prosecutions will be brought in civil courts.</P>

      <P>I should like to endorse the plea made by Senator Duffy.  I feel that there is great danger in extending the category of cases to go before special courts.  The only cases which should go before these courts are cases that have a political aspect, in which certain pressure might be brought to bear which juries would be unable to resist.  We should, as soon as possible, get back to having all other cases decided by civil courts.</P>

      <P>I sincerely hope that the Minister is not going to be influenced by the unholy combination which we have just seen and the appeals which we have just heard.  Could there have been any greater criminals than the people who were brought before these courts during the emergency&mdash;saboteurs, black marketeers, etc.?  Now we have certain people, representatives of capital and labour, so interested in them that they want to make it easy for these people to carry on in future.</P>

Nobody could defend their actions in a crisis such as we passed through here when these people, for their own petty interests, tried to exploit the community. Still, we have this unholy combination making an appeal to the Minister to have them tried by the ordinary courts.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will not consider for one moment reducing the penalties on people who are prepared to exploit the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters to which I would have referred if I had known beforehand the trend which the debate was going to take.  I think I am entitled to refer to these matters now.  First of all I should like to say that I agree with the case made by the &ldquo;unholy combination&rdquo;<Col N="213" /> and that I am completely horrified by the remarks of Senator Foran.  Senator Foran has decided in his own mind that everybody charged at these courts were saboteurs and black marketeers.  Why then bring them before a court at all?  Why not deal with them in the regular dictatorial fashion?  If, however, you are going to try people, you should try them before courts in which people will have the greatest possible confidence and let the people feel that they have been tried in the fairest possible way.  Many cases have been tried before the military court, but I think everybody, even the Minister, will agree that we want to get away from that as soon as possible.  Certainly the principles enunciated by Senator Foran revealed a mentality which I thought did not exist amongst the members of any Party in this House, and I hope that on reflection he will change his mind.</P>
      <P>The matters, to which I want particularly to refer, arose out of the first part of the discussion.  I quite sincerely expressed approval and praise of actions of the Department, on the assumption, which was made perfectly clear by the Minister, that this was a transfer of functions, but Senator O Buachalla thought it was a landmark&mdash; in other words, that we have reached a stage in our history where we were getting away, or any rate commencing to get away, from the shortage caused by the war.  Anyone who has any actual knowledge of the supplies position knows perfectly well that, in regard to a large number of commodities, the position is worse than it has been at any time during the war.  That may not apply to every commodity but it applies to a certain number and any one who entertains any other idea is simply digging his head in the sand. I know the Minister has no such idea. This Bill does not mean that we are abolishing the Department of Supplies but that we are joining the two Ministries together and that we propose to carry on the functions of the Department of Supplies as heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second remark I want to make is that there is a very great danger&mdash;and <Col N="214" /> I find a certain amount of resentment expressed about it&mdash;that in a wild desire to throw bouquets at officials or Ministers, one may sometimes overbalance the praise.  I think that, after what we have heard from Senator O Buachalla and Senator Mrs. Concannon, one is justified in saying that they got a little bit overbalanced. The plain truth of the matter is that we have gone through an extremely difficult situation during the past five or six years.  We have not got out of that in some respects as well as we might, but in many respects we got out of it in a manner that we never dreamt of or expected.  Some credit for that is due to the Minister, much of it is due to the officials of the Department, but a great deal of it is due to the shopkeepers and industrialists, who had to change their whole system, and who, I think the Minister agrees, rose to the occasion with a degree of efficiency that most of us did not altogether expect. There is a danger, when you start throwing bouquets in that way, of making it appear that one Department provided the whole supplies of the country.  That is no service to the Department, because it only means that you will have certain cynical remarks passed outside afterwards.</P>
    <P>We had Senators Duffy and O'Reilly going to the other extreme.  They want exactly the same system of control as was heretofore carried on.  I do not.  I am personally convinced that the situation from now on will in many respects be very different from that which it was during the war, and that different methods may have to be applied to deal with it.  If you are not going to get rid of control, I think the problem will have to be viewed very largely from a different angle. For instance, the tendency as the war went on was to have more and more State control in other countries from which we got supplies.  That cut out very often the personal contacts between the purchaser of supplies here and suppliers in other countries.  I am convinced that if we are to get supplies, we should go to very considerable lengths to re-establish these personal contacts.  I can easily conceive circumstances in which a Government or Government officials in other countries <Col N="215" /> might be very much more reluctant to send supplies to this country than traders in the particular country who want to get back their trade.  I give that as one instance in which we are approaching somewhat different circumstances in which different methods will have to be applied.  I personally have not the slightest doubt that the Minister and his principal officials realise that.  I think the public ought to recognise that, and that we should not be faced with demands such as we had from some Senators for a continuance of the same controls.</P>
    <P>We hear talk about rationing. Senator O Reilly is not a member of this House very long.  If he were, he would remember that we on these benches begged the Minister to institute a rationing scheme and argued with him when he was against it. Therefore we certainly are not going to object to such a scheme so long as it is necessary.  On the whole, the rationing scheme was a success but I think that in a very short time the basis of the rationing scheme will have to be changed.  I personally, as some Senators know, am interested in various textile commodities.  In respect of some of these, frankly I have no hope of any serious improvement within twelve months.  In the case of others, I shall be bitterly disappointed if there is not a marked improvement. It is quite likely that the Department which will be virtually the same Department, will have to reconsider the system of rationing.  There is another matter which goes to show the changed attitude that will be necessary.  The Department at the moment provides that shopkeepers will surrender all their coupons after a certain time and then start again after a period of about two months.  That method worked perfectly well in most cases because the stocks of shopkeepers were going down but now you may get the reverse position when stocks will be slowly going up and whereas in the past they wanted less and less coupons, they will want more in future.  There will therefore have to be some other system instituted.  So far from its being a question of maintaining old controls, it will be a question of a <Col N="216" /> different system and of different methods of control.  The necessity for co-operation with manufacturers and traders will be just as great.</P>
    <P>Again, a great deal of care will have to be taken in the control of prices.  That is an extremely difficult matter.  The most important thing to take into consideration is to see that whatever changes are made do not seriously interfere with employment. It is perhaps much too optimistic to talk about falling prices.  There are certain commodities in which I have not the slightest doubt prices are far too high.  In some cases that may be due to profiteering but I do not think it is.  Once there is freedom in trade with other countries prices are going to drop.</P>
    <P>I anticipate in certain trades, especially in one in which I am interested, that it will not be long until turnovers are considerably lower by reason of the fact that stocks all round will be cheaper.  It is quite obvious that the profit required to keep employees going on £1,000 will not be adequate on £500.  I do not want to take extreme cases.  In the past the main supplies were dwindling and we must now look to slightly increased supplies and, if necessary, a different set of controls.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I am particularly glad to see the two Departments together is that I do not see how any industrial development which was supposed to be the business of the Minister for Industry and Commerce can be separated from the question of supplies, because any plans for any new development of industry depend to a very large extent on the supply position. Therefore, in common sense, the two Departments should be together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to begin by thanking the Seanad for agreeing to give me all stages of the Bill to-day.  In connection with the trial of cases by the Special Criminal Court, I should point out that the decision as to whether any individual case will go to that court is taken by the Attorney-General and not by me.  I can understand the existence of a desire to have some tribunal other than a military court for the hearing of cases of the <Col N="217" /> kind that arise under these Emergency. Powers Orders relating to rationing and price control.</P>
      <P>Senators who want to urge on the appropriate authority that the District Court alone should be used, are free to do so.  I will urge strongly in the other direction.  I will urge that where there are cases which have more than a local interest, and where there are more than local ramifications, there is need to maintain trial by the Special Criminal Court in substitution for trial by the District Court.  It will go on record for the benefit of any Government with the responsibility of guiding this country through a war that District Courts are unsuitable instruments for the enforcement of Emergency Powers Orders in rationing, price control, or similar restrictions of a temporary character created by abnormal circumstances.</P>
      <P>It may be that in the future, during a period when these controls have to be operated, some court other than a military tribunal will be created to which such cases can be referred as against the District Court, but if, on that date, there is no alternative court to the District Court I would urge that a Special Criminal Court should be employed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to say anything arising out of the remarks of Senator Douglas relating to a number of matters which have concerned them or may concern them in the future.  I am sorry that when he threw his cowslip on the grave of the Department of <Col N="218" /> Supplies, he resented other people throwing bouquets.  The fact that their bouquets did not contain brickbats was due to the fact that sometimes people throwing bouquets containing brickbats are liable to overbalance.</P>

    <Title>Unemployment Insurance Bill, 1945&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide that there be paid into the Unemployment Insurance Fund on behalf of every soldier who served more than three months in the Defence Forces since September, 1939, or who may have future service in the Defence Forces, a sum of money which will ensure for him the right to benefit from the Unemployment Insurance Fund in precisely the same manner as if his service in the Defence Forces was service in insurable employment.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to state what the actual cost of the measure may be.  On the basis of existing contributions payable under the Unemployment Insurance Act the immediate cost falling upon the Exchequer will be £270,000. In fact, the amount paid into the Unemployment Insurance Fund from the Exchequer will be whatever amount is required to enable benefit to be paid when the claim is made, so that an exact estimate of the total sum involved cannot be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="219" /> The annual cost in future is expected to be about £45,000.  The Bill is a simple measure designed to achieve that purpose, and there is a reference to the insurance industry employment scheme.  That is because of the fact that any person employed in the insurance industry is entitled to benefit under a special scheme.  The Bill provides that he will secure the same rights as if he had been employed in the industry during the emergency.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill, the conferring of these benefits on the members of the Defence Forces who have been discharged or who may be discharged is part of the general scheme set out in the Government's White Paper relating to Army demobilisation. It is intended that the rights conferred by this Bill will be permanent, in respect of those who may join the service for periods longer than three months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be agreed that this measure is satisfactory.  There is only one aspect of it to which I wish to draw attention.  It is not clear to me whether the sum which is to be paid into the fund is the equivalent of the value of the stamps and the State contribution if the soldier had been employed for the same period.  It is possible it will be equal to that amount, but that is not clear.  If it is equivalent I wonder why the Bill is drafted in such a roundabout fashion.  It should be a simple thing to say that the State would pay into the fund an amount which would be equivalent to the income of the stamps and State contribution in respect of the same period, 50 weeks or 150 weeks, whatever it may be.  If the contribution payable under this Bill is not equivalent to the amount which would have been payable if the soldier had been in civil employment and insurable it means that there will be a further drain on the fund.  In other words, the Insurance Fund will be called upon to meet charges which would not normally arise were it not for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the likelihood or the danger that demands on the Fund may grow in the future, I think it is an <Col N="220" /> undesirable situation if the Fund is called upon to bear a strain which it was not normally intended to bear. Apart from that the Bill is a satisfactory one and is eminently just to the men who have been discharged from the Army.  It will prevent the need in the future for special measures to deal with special cases, often in a very unsatisfactory manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Bill provided for the payment into the Fund of 1/7d. for every week served by every soldier there would be a subsidisation of the Unemployment Insurance Fund, because some of those who will be demobilised from the Army will not claim from the Fund, or only claim to a lesser extent than the amount that will be put in credit, and consequently the Insurance Fund is subsidised and that fact might be used at some stage as an argument for a reduction of contributions or an increase of benefit.  The Bill provides that there should be paid into the Fund only such amount as is required to meet the claims which demobilised soldiers may make when unemployed. Under the scheme the Fund will recover what was expended from the Exchequer.  The actual amount to be paid into the Fund and the time at which payment will be made will have to be settled by order.  In reply to Senator Duffy I could say that there is no danger that the assets of the Fund will be depleted as the result of the introduction of this Bill.  If we were to adopt the alternative method of paying into the Fund the amount of the contribution for every week of every soldier then there would be an increase in the assets of the Fund which would come from the taxpayers as a whole and would therefore be unjustifiable.</P>

      <P>Exactly, but it is part of an obligation which the State will have to meet.  The State recovers at the present time a proportion of the contribution against the cost of administration. It will still recover that. In other words, the only difference between the provisions in the Bill and actually paying the full amount, including the State's contribution into the Fund, is that we have taken steps to ensure that there will be no expansion of the fund at the taxpayers' expense. That is not what we are setting out to do in this Bill.  The only thing we are setting out to do is to see that the soldier will have this credit in the fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said when introducing this Bill in the Dáil, it is not one which lends itself to the kind of debate usual on Second Reading, as it deals with a number of distinct and unconnected matters.  The purpose of this Bill is to effect certain amendments of the Court Officers Act, 1926, which experience of the working of the system set up under that Act has shown to be desirable.  I shall try to explain as briefly as I can the various provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Under Sections 2 and 3 it is proposed to take power to enable the Minister for Justice to relieve the Master of the High Court of the purely administrative functions and duties in relation to the central office and the other offices of the High Court which are vested in him at present by Sections 4 and 5 of the 1926 Act.  The Minister will be able to exercise this power only after he has consulted the President of the High Court.  If an Order is made relieving the Master of the administrative duties, these duties will then be performed by an officer of the High Court who will be nominated for that purpose by the Minister, again after consultation with the President. The judicial control provided for in the 1926 Act, so far as the conduct of business in court is concerned, is being fully preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 deal with the pension terms of a limited class of court officers, namely, the Master of the High Court, the taxing masters of that court, and county registrars. These officers are at present pensionable under the Superannuation Acts on ordinary Civil Service terms, which means that they can qualify for full pension only with a minimum of 40 years' service.  The Act of 1926 lays down, as an essential qualification for appointment to any of the offices in question, a minimum period of practice in the legal profession&mdash;in the case of the Master of the High Court, ten years' practice at the Bar, and in the <Col N="223" /> case of taxing masters and county registrars, ten and eight years' practice, respectively, as solicitors.  The earliest possible age at which appointments can be made is, therefore, about 30 or slightly over.  In practice the persons appointed are usually older; in the case of county registrars, for example, the average age on appointment has been about 40.  The result is that, under Superannuation Act terms, few, if any, of these officers can hope to qualify for full pension, and, where the person has been appointed at a fairly advanced age, his pension is very meagre altogether.</P>
    <P>Under Section 4, it is now proposed that these officers should have the same pension terms as district justices enjoy under the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, viz., full pension of two-thirds of salary after 30 years' service, and proportionately for shorter service. Section 5 makes special provision for existing officers, who are being given the right to opt in due course between the new terms and their present terms.</P>
    <P>Section 6 proposes to amend the present law as contained in Sections 23 and 24 of the 1926 Act, relating to the qualifications for appointment to the posts of probate officer and examiner in the High Court.  At present a person to be qualified for appointment must be a serving court officer with a minimum of 12 years' service in the court offices.  Section 6 proposes two amendments, viz., (i) it dispenses with the requirement of 12 years' service in the case of any court officer who is a barrister or solicitor, and (ii) it opens up appointments to barristers and solicitors of not less than six years' standing provided that the Minister for Justice, after consulting the President of the High Court, is satisfied that at the time there is no court officer with the necessary qualifications suitable to be appointed.</P>
    <P>The object of Section 7 is to enable a second examiner to be appointed in the High Court.  The work at present done in the examiner's office is the same as was formerly done by the two chief clerks on the chancery side and their staffs. What is now proposed is, in effect, a <Col N="224" /> return to the system of two chief officers.  Actually, this does not mean the creation of an additional post.  So long as there are two judges doing &ldquo;chancery&rdquo; work, it is convenient to have a fully responsible officer attached to each judge.  At present the examiner attends one judge, and the assistant-examiner the other.  The law and practice require that certain final steps be done by the examiner in person, so that at present when the assistant-examiner has done the work, he must submit his papers to the examiner before the case can be finally disposed of.  The only way by which this can be avoided is by the appointment of a second examiner, which will be made possible by Section 7.  In practice, it will mean the conversion of the assistant-examinership into an examinership.</P>
    <P>Section 8, which was introduced during the Committee Stage in the Dáil, provides that officers of the Central Office of the High Court nominated to be registrars will rank as principal officers.  It was suggested that these registrars should be regarded as principal officers for the purposes of the 1926 Act, and no objection was seen to making this minor concession.  No question of alteration in rank or pay is involved.</P>
    <P>Section 9 enables the Minister for Justice to require any court officer to perform the duties of another office attached to his own or any other court, where such an arrangement is convenient and practicable.  Provision is made for consultation, where necessary, with the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court, and retrospective sanction is provided for certain arrangements of the kind in question that have been made in the past with doubtful legal authority.</P>
    <P>Section 10 proposes that the assignment of county registrars to particular counties should be a matter for the Government rather than the Minister for Justice, as it is at present.  A county registrar is appointed by the Government and there is no point in the Minister for Justice having to make a formal separate assignment to the only county in which a vacancy exists at the time the appointment is made. <Col N="225" /> In practice the Government will appoint expressly to the existing vacancy.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is merely a machinery provision intended to remedy a minor defect in the existing statutory provisions relating to the revision or alteration of district court districts or areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to Section 12, since the enactment of the 1926 Act, no appointment has been made to the office of under-sheriff.  According as vacancies occurred in that office, the duties were taken over by the County Registrar for the County or County Borough in accordance with Section 54 of the 1926 Act.  This system has worked well on the whole, but in the case of Dublin and, to a lesser extent, of Cork, the duties of the County Registrar are already so heavy that it is not desirable that he should also be made responsible for the duties of under-sheriff. It may also happen in the course of time, in some of the other larger counties, that the double duties of County Registrar and under-sheriff will prove too exacting for one officer.  Accordingly, it is proposed in Section 12 to take power to enable a County Registrar, to whom the duties of under-sheriff have already been transferred, to be relieved of the whole or part of those duties and also, as regards any county in which an under-sheriff is still operating, to enable an order to be made, if thought necessary, declaring that the provisions of Section 54 of the 1926 Act shall not apply so that the County Registrar will not be vested with the under-sheriff's duties on the latter vacating office.  In any such case it is proposed that the Government may appoint a person to be sheriff and he will be responsible for such of the duties, functions, etc., of the former under-sheriff as are not vested in the County Registrar.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides for the repeal of Section 45 of the Debtors (Ireland) Act, 1840.  Section 45 required every under-sheriff to nominate a deputy resident or with an office within one mile of the Four Courts for the receipt of writs, decrees, etc.  In modern conditions this requirement is unnecessary. Compliance with it involves some trouble administratively every time a <Col N="226" /> County Registrar takes over an undersheriff's duties.  Repeal of the provision will mean a small saving to the Exchequer as the deputy nominated for each County Registrar is allowed to retain a proportion of the lodgment fees which would otherwise be surrendered to the Exchequer.  The Incorporated Law Society and all the officers concerned have been consulted and there is unanimity of opinion that this out-of-date provision may be repealed.</P>

      <P>The main thing that strikes anyone reading this Bill, in my opinion, is that it is yet another example of the trend of legislation, that has been so recently noticeable, of taking power out of the hands of anybody who has it in order that it may be vested in a Department of the Government.  The effect of many provisions of this Bill is to take the power out of the hands of the judges, so to speak, and to vest that power, instead, in the Department; and the effect also is to take a certain amount of power away from the Oireachtas and delegate that power to the Minister by means of the provision in the Bill of a tremendous number of sections which say that the Minister &ldquo;when he shall so think proper&rdquo; may do so and so.  It appears to me that that is an objectionable method of legislation, that it is taking too much discretion away from the Oireachtas and leaving too much discretion in the hands of the Minister.  I fully appreciate the Minister will tell me that he can only exercise that discretion after consultation with the President of the High Court, but I do think that the Minister will also agree that he is not in any way bound, under the measure now before us, to accept the advice that the President of the High Court may give him, and while, as a matter of administrative procedure, it might be advisable to have that for certain matters, I think it would be better for the Minister to deal with them under the direction of the President of the High Court instead of doing certain things afterwards.  One of the things that we are particularly jealous of here is the independence of the judiciary, and I would not like to see any measure <Col N="227" /> going through this House that would even remotely militate against that independence, and I am sure that the Minister himself would agree with that.  We are legislating here, not merely for a Ministerial office, but for those who may come after the Minister, and it seems to me that this is not a satisfactory way of dealing with the matter.</P>
      <P>There are certain details with which we can deal better on the Committee Stage, but there are one or two matters to which I should like to direct the Minister's attention.  The Minister is given certain discretion in two of the sections of the Bill, and I should like to have some enlightenment from him in regard to them.</P>
      <P>Section 7 deals with the appointment of a second examiner.  I entirely agree with the Minister that this section is, in principle, absolutely desirable.  The situation, by virtue of which an assistant examiner, having done all the work, had to submit it to the examiner for signature, was not satisfactory.  I should like to know if it is mandatory that an assistant examiner, who has been carrying on the work, be appointed as the second examiner.  It would be very unfair if he were passed over in the appointment of second examiner.  If he was competent to be assistant-examiner, under the system in operation, he must, <i>ipso facto</i>, be equally competent to be the new examiner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to have an explanation from the Minister in relation to Section 10.  I take it that, once a county registrar is assigned to a particular circuit, he must continue in that circuit.  I should like to have an assurance that this section does not enable either the Government or the Minister to transfer a county registrar from a circuit to which he has already been assigned to another circuit, without his consent.  If that were to be the case, the section could be utilised in a very harsh way.  I do not think that there is any doubt about the matter but I should like to have it amplified. My real reason for rising at this stage was to point out that the whole tendency of legislation in recent years has been to vest more and more discretion <Col N="228" /> in Ministers and their Departments and, therefore, in the officials of their Departments.  That is an undesirable tendency.  It may have been necessary during the emergency but it should be arrested at the earliest possible date. I should be very slow, for that reason, to accept this Bill in all its verbal implications though I am in wholehearted agreement with many of the principles contained in it.</P>

      <P>In the summarised version of this Bill with which the Minister provided us, I regret that there seems to have been no provision made for the very reasonable and equitable claims of the staffs of the circuit court offices.  I have in mind three officials, aged 43, 46 and 48 years, who are on the staff of a circuit court office.  These officials are liable to be retired on a week's notice without recognition of the many valuable years of service given by them.  That service was absolutely necessary to the smooth running of the administration of the circuit court.  Such treatment of officials who have given almost half a century of service cannot be considered fair or equitable.  On the Committee Stage, I hope to have an amendment drafted which will cover such cases and I am sure the Minister will give it sympathetic consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what I might describe as stop-gap legislation.  The Bill is an amending Bill, and is accordingly disjointed.  The Minister has not stated fully why this Bill has been introduced. Some portions of it are quite necessary, having regard to the working of the courts, but the main provisions of the Bill, which relieve the Master of his functions, has, in my opinion, been brought about by the difficulty of working the provisions of the Courts Officers Act, 1926, in regard to the Master's control and superintendence of the officers of the courts.  I hold no brief for the Master, nor for any other person.  The Minister has assured us that this legislation is necessary, and I accept that assurance. Unfortunately, it would appear that the system provided for in the Courts Officers Act, 1926, has not worked satisfactorily. That is because human beings are human beings.  There may <Col N="229" /> have been incompatibilities between the Master, as the head and manager of the central office, and the officials of the Department of Justice, and that is the whole reason for this provision in the Bill.  I shall not say where the blame lies, but it is unfortunate, because there will now be a truncated Mastership of the High Court.</P>
      <P>Under the Courts Officers Act, 1923. Section 5 (2), the Master is enabled to exercise the powers and authority given him by the Act, by statute and by the rules of court.  The legislation here takes away the powers which were given him by statute, but not the powers given him by rules of court. The object of this Bill, so far as the Master is concerned, is to deprive him of the control of the officers of the court.  There may be good reason for that, and I do not say that it is wrong. So far as I know, there is a good deal to be said for it.  In substitution for the Master, the Minister takes power in this Bill to appoint an officer serving in the central office, or a principal officer attached to the High Court.  We have, accordingly, a unique position. Under the Act of 1926, the Master was appointed to control and superintend the central office and the offices attached to the High Court.  These offices were: the Central Office, the Office of the Taxing Master, the Probate Office, the Bankruptcy Office, the Examiner's Office, and the Accountant's Office.  It so happens that at present, the Master, according to the Estimates, receives £200 a year for performing the duties of the Registrar in Bankruptcy.  As a result of this Act, the junior officer in the central office who may be appointed by the Minister to manage the central office and the offices attached to the High Court will have the control and superintendence of the Master in so far as he is Registrar in Bankruptcy.  I quite agree with the Minister that this Bill was necessary for the smooth working of the courts, but I should have preferred to have the question considered upon a broader basis.  I should also be more satisfied if there had been consultation not only with the officers of the courts and the President of the High Court, but also with the Rule-making Committee of the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="230" /> It is the intention of the Bill to take away from the Master control of the officials in the courts, but it will not effect that so long as the Rules of Court specify duties which shall be carried out under the direction of the Master.  Order 33 of the Rules of the High Court and Supreme Court, 1926, provides as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every judgment or order, which according to the practice at the time when these rules came into operation, would require to be entered by the proper officer, shall for the future be filed under the direction of the Master.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that although this Bill is intended to relieve the Master of the management of the central office and the control of the officials therein, that order, which is not affected by this Bill, still gives to him the power to direct the filing of the judgments and the orders in the office.  I fear there will be a clash between the Master and the officer who is appointed to fulfil the statutory functions of the Master. However, I am only putting this point forward so that the Bill may be considered in the proper light and so as to ensure the smooth and satisfactory working of the offices of the court.</P>
    <P>There is another matter.  The Central Office of the High Court which was established by the Court Officers Act, 1926, was based upon the Central Office of the Supreme Court of Judicature in England which was established originally by the Supreme Court Judicature Act of 1879 and which was continued by the Supreme Courts of Judicature Act of 1925.  Under the Rules of Court, it is provided that there shall be what is called a practice Master who has to attend there every day, to control the business of the central office and to give the necessary directions with respect to the practice or procedure relating to the business thereof. Under the Courts Officers Act, 1926, as it stands, the Master of the High Court is what might be called a practice Master, that is to say, if an official of the court has any difficulty or doubt as to the practice to be followed in a particular matter, he can repair to the Master.  Now, if the Master is no <Col N="231" /> longer to have anything to do with the officers of the court, an officer in doubt cannot repair to him, therefore he must go to the officer who may be nominated in place of the Master.  The officer who may be nominated in place of the Master may be any officer serving in the office, according to the Bill.  He may be a junior clerk.</P>
    <P>The whole idea of court officers is this: that they are experienced in the practice and the procedure of the courts.  They are not deemed to know what is called the substantive law, but on practice and procedure they are experts.  The Minister will no doubt appoint an officer to replace the Master in the High Court as far as the control of other officers is concerned but I suggest that he should appoint an experienced official who will be able to direct other officials and advise them as to the proper procedure and practice in every particular case.  I am making that suggestion now so that the new system may work properly and produce harmonious working.  That is all we desire. I should like the Minister to remember that this arrangement, after all, is only what we might call a stop-gap.  Sooner or later when the present Master retires, the whole question will have to be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the Dáil said that the Master being a lawyer may not be a good man to handle officials or to deal with civil servants.  I dispute that. A lawyer is as good a man to do business as any other man.  It all depends on the individual concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>So, therefore, the mere fact that the Master is required by the Court Officers Act to be a barrister of 10 years' standing is no disadvantage at all.  It is the man himself who may be at fault.  Therefore, I say that the proper head of the Central Office should be a lawyer of common sense. I am sure that the Minister in dealing with this rather delicate problem will work out matters as satisfactorily as he possibly can, having regard firstly to the powers in the Bill, and, secondly, to the fact that the Master will still retain power under the Rules of Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="232" /> The other matter dealt with in this Bill is the position of under-sheriff and county registrar.  Prior to the Sheriffs (Ireland) Act, 1920, the under-sheriff was appointed by the High Sheriff. Thenceforward the Government appointed the under-sheriff and he became a Government official.  All the powers, duties and authority of the High Sheriff were transferred to the under-sheriff by that Act.  The High Sheriff retained some ornamental functions, such as entertaining judges on the occasion of assizes, and a few other functions of no consequence.  When the Courts Officers Act came to be passed in 1926, the office of under-sheriff was in effect abolished.</P>
    <P>It was abolished by providing that no further appointments should be made to the office of under-sheriff.  The title under-sheriff was carried into the Court Officers Act of 1926 without having any High Sheriff.  That Act provided by Section 54 (3) that the functions of under-sheriff should be transferred to the county registrar when a vacancy took place.  I maintain that that was a fundamental mistake.  It was a fundamental mistake to transfer the functions of an executive to a judicial officer.  The county registrar, apart from the fact that he has sufficient work to do in his own department, is an officer of the courts and is not the proper person to execute the processes of the courts.  That is an executive function and should remain an executive function.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we have what is called a cat and mouse section.  The difficulty about the county registrar carrying out the duties and functions of the under-sheriff arose quite recently, and in a marked manner, when the sub-sheriff of Dublin retired, and under the Act of 1926 his powers, duties and functions were automatically transferred to the county registrar of Dublin.  It was immediately seen by everybody that a county registrar of Dublin could not do two men's work.  That is one of the reasons why this Bill is urgent to relieve that situation.  But what does this Bill actually provide?  It provides firstly that the Minister may make an Order that whenever a vacancy arises, the powers, duties and functions of the under-sheriff shall not <Col N="233" /> vest or be transferred to the county registrar.  He may also make an Order that in the case of a county registrar in whom are vested at the present time the powers and duties of the under-sheriff, these powers and duties should cease, in order to make way for the appointment of what is known as a sheriff.  As a result of this Bill we have three names for one official carrying out the one duty.  There may be in one county or county borough a sheriff, in another county or county borough an under-sheriff, and in a third county the duties and functions are carried out by the county registrar.  The Bill also gives power to the Minister, when an under-sheriff retires or when there is a vacancy in the office of sheriff, by Order to revert the duties and powers to the county registrar.</P>
    <P>In other words, it is a cat-and-mouse and in-and-out type of section.  My suggestion is that there should be one officer with one name for executing the processes of the courts, that he should be called a sheriff, and that legislation should be brought in, if necessary, changing the title of under-sheriff in any county or county borough to sheriff, and that the county registrar in each county should be relieved of the duties of under-sheriff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment I was dealing with the office of sheriff provided for in this Bill, and I stated that there are three titles for the same office.  We have &ldquo;sheriff&rdquo; in this Bill, &ldquo;under-sheriff&rdquo; in a previous Bill, and, under the Court Officers Act, 1926, we have &ldquo;county registrar&rdquo;, all executing the processes of the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My submission is that there should be one officer, with one title, to execute the process of the court, and that that officer should be called a sheriff. A considerable amount of confusion has been caused in statutes by having the officer performing these functions designated by different titles in different counties, with the result that in a number of statutes there are a number of explanatory clauses providing <Col N="234" /> that where the word &ldquo;under-sheriff&rdquo; is used in the case of a county in which there is no under-sheriff, it shall be deemed to mean the county registrar.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should seriously consider remodelling or reframing this legislation, not necessarily now in this Bill, but at a later stage, so as to unify the office of the person who executes the process of the court, and to designate him by one uniform title in every county and county borough as the sheriff.  Under this Bill the Minister has power, by Order, to relieve the county registrar of the duties formerly carried out by the under-sheriff.  He has power to do so, so to speak, at his will or as he thinks proper.  I would suggest to him that he ought to make a survey of the conditions operating in every county, and that he should endeavour as far as possible to segregate and separate the office of county registrar from that of sheriff.</P>
    <P>A clear case was brought home to the Minister in the case of the county borough of Dublin.  When the late under-sheriff, Dr. Lorcan Sherlock, retired and when, under Section 54 (3) of the Court Officers Act, 1926, his duties came to be performed by the county registrar of Dublin, it was clearly seen that he would be unable to combine his present office of county registrar with its multiplicity of duties, with the very onerous office of sheriff.</P>
    <P>Although that is a glaring case, there are other cases throughout the country not quite so glaring, but almost so.  In my submission, the county registrar has quite sufficient work to do, to do it properly so to speak, in his own particular sphere, the judicial sphere, and I say that it is a fundamental mistake in the Court Officers Act of 1926, to impose executive functions on an official of the Judiciary, namely, the county registrar.  I trust that the Minister will reconsider the position and that at a future date legislation will be introduced providing for the office of sheriff.  That officer should be an officer of the Minister, that is of the executive power and should have no connection with the Judiciary except to execute the writs and processes issued by the judges.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="235" /> There are other matters in this Bill to which I desire to refer briefly.  I am altogether in favour of the two examiners of the High Court.  I think the system of two chief clerks worked very well in the old days when there were two Chancery Judges, and the system introduced under the Court Officers Act, 1926, of having only one examiner where there were formerly two, and making the other examiner merely on assistant examiner did not work so well, because the officer who was the examiner had to go over the work done by the assistant examiner who was quite as competent as himself.</P>
    <P>A difficult situation was created in the courts when the two examiners retired almost simultaneously recently, and one officer serving under the former examiner was made examiner, while the other officer was made assistant examiner.  Both officers appeared to be of equal status, but having regard to the legislation then in force one officer only could be appointed to the position of examiner.  I am glad the position is being rectified by this Bill. It is quite a proper thing that each Chancery Judge in his department should be self-contained.  That is what this Bill provides.</P>
    <P>There is another matter-an amendment was introduced on the Committee Stage of this Bill by the Minister in the Dáil.  That is Section 8 in this Bill which provides that a registrar of the High Court shall be a principal officer within the meaning of Part I of the Court Officers Act, 1926.  In Section 3 (2) of that Act, there are enumerated a number of officers who are principal officers-namely, the Master of the High Court, Taxing Masters, Probate Officers, Registrars in Bankruptcy the Official Assignee, Examiner and Accountant, but for some reason or another in the Act of 1926, the office of Registrar of the High Court was omitted.</P>
    <P>The office of Registrar of the High Court is a most important office, because the Registrar of the High Court is an official of long experience, as a rule, in the practice and procedure of the High Court, and as a rule the judge has to refer to his registrar for guidance <Col N="236" /> on practice and procedure I cannot understand why the position of Registrar of the High Court has been, so to speak, degraded as it has been by legislation and by the Department of Finance as regards salary.</P>
    <P>I am now going to speak of the relative positions of the Registrar of the High Court who is now a principal officer within the meaning of the Court Officers Act, and principal officers in other Departments.  The Minister for Justice may say to me that he is not concerned with salary, that that is a matter for the Minister for Finance, but he is concerned with the salaries of the officers of his Department, and I would ask the Minister now to consider making representations to the Minister for Finance in respect of Registrars of the High Court for the purpose of putting them on the same level as the principal officers in other Departments.</P>
    <P>A principal officer in the Department of Finance, according to the Estimates, has a basic salary of £700, rising by increments of £25 annually, to £900 a year.  A principal officer generally in the other Departments&mdash;the Department of Justice or the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;has a salary of £700, rising by increments of £20 to £800.</P>
    <P>The salary of the Registrar of the Supreme Court according to the Estimate which I have here before me as provided by the Department of Finance is £600-£800, a year, below the salary of a principal officer of any other Department.  I am now referring to the Registrar of the Supreme Court because in the near future there will be a vacancy for that office.  The present officer has a personal salary.  He is an old official and he is approaching the retiring age.  The person most appropriate to fill the office would be a registrar of the High Court.  Now, the salary of the Registrar of the Supreme Court, according to the Estimate is £600-£800, something like the salary of an assistant principal in another Department.  Under Article 25 of the Constitution every Act signed by the President has to be deposited in the office of the Registrar of the Supreme Court and every authentic text of the Constitution under the same article has to be deposited with him so that <Col N="237" /> he is a most responsible officer.  Yet the view was taken that he was only worth £600, increasing by increments to £800, while a principal officer in other Departments had a salary of £700 to £800, and a principal officer in the Department of Finance had a salary rising to £900.  In the Estimate there are four registrars of the High Court; one has a salary of £800 rising by increments of £20 to £900.  He is an old officer.  The next has a salary of £700 rising by £20 to £800.  He is a responsible registrar of the High Court and has the same salary as a principal officer in any Department other than the Department of Finance.  Another registrar has a salary of £600 rising by increments of £20 to £700.  There are two registrars with salaries of £500 rising by £20 to £700, far below principal officers in other Departments. I do not know why these salaries were fixed at these rates. There is a note in the Estimate that the salary of £500 rising by increments of £20 to £700 is subject to review. Am I to take it that the Minister for Finance intends to reduce that salary?</P>
    <P>At all events, now that the registrars of the High Court are raised to the rank which they ought to have occupied under the Act of 1926, namely, principal officer, the Minister for Justice should make representations to the Minister for Finance to place these officers on what might be called a proper scale of salary.  From the point of view of the administration of justice it is most important that the men who are engaged in what I may call the office work, routine and procedure of the courts should be men of experience, and thoroughly competent and certainly I would say that the salaries which have been appropriated by the Department of Finance to these officers are not sufficient to attract the best men.  The Minister, after this Bill, will introduce another Bill called the Juries Act in Section 7 of which certain duties which were formerly performed by the Master of the High Court and the under-sheriff have been transferred to the registrars of the High Court. The registrars of the High Court are getting added duties and I trust the Minister at all events, will see that <Col N="238" /> these officers who are the pivot of the administration of justice in the courts will be properly remunerated.  There is one other matter.  In this Bill in Section 2 the Minister is given power to appoint an officer to manage the Central Office.  Under Section 58 of the Court Officers Act of 1926 it is provided that the person who has to manage any office may manage it by officials or through officials.  I think that that is a matter that should be considered by the Minister between this and the Committee Stage.  Section 58 provides:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the powers, authorities, duties and functions conferred or imposed by Part I of this Act on the respective officers therein referred to as principal officers and by Part II of this Act on the county registrars shall be exercised and performed by these officers with the assistance of the officers and servants employed in the offices under their management respectively, and every such principal officer and county registrar shall arrange for the exercise and performance by officers or servants in the office under his management of such of his powers, authorities and functions (other than those which he is for the time being expressly required by statute or rule of court to exercise or perform in person) as he cannot conveniently exercise or perform himself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would suggest that a new section should be inserted in the Bill giving the new officer who has to manage the Central Office the same powers as are given to the principal officer in the Act of 1926.  He is in a new office for the purposes of the Act of 1926, and, therefore, a special section is necessary to enable the officer to be appointed to manage the Central Office by directing the officials under him to perform the duties of the office.  I am merely making that suggestion for the purpose of consideration by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Apart from these observations I think the Bill on the whole is a good Bill.  It is not a final measure.  It is stop-gap legislation but stop-gap legislation is often most necessary and often beneficial.  With these few remarks I wish the Bill success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just a small point or two to make.  It is very obvious from the speeches of Senator Sweetman and especially of Senator Michael J. Ryan that this is really a technical measure which requires a considerable amount of study and practical experience in the courts.  It is a very healthy thing that we can have such an examination of this Bill as we have had from Senator Ryan.  He has gone to a good deal of labour and it is of value to the House and those of us who are laymen to hear such a discussion on it.  What has been puzzling me about this measure is the fact that while the Minister is making provision for the superannuation of Circuit Court officers and registrars and a number of other people he has neglected the situation which exists elsewhere.  I have no practical experience of a Circuit Court area in the country.  Senator Seán T. Ruane has referred to what conditions are like in his own county. I think exactly the same conditions exist in my own county.  There is an official there who I am satisfied has reached the retiring age, at least he has reached that age at which a man ought ordinarily to be able to retire.  I am not exactly certain, but my opinion is that he is held there because there is no provision for superannuation.  A colleague of his some time ago worked on until he became ill and went to the grave.  I think that is the situation all over the country.  It wants to be rectified and I wonder, when the Minister has decided to provide for certain officials under this Act, he has not taken any steps with regard to these others.  I would like to hear the Minister on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Dáil there was reference made to the position of District Court clerks.  I did not read the debate fully, but from what I saw of it I understand that the Minister indicated that he was considering this question. I wonder why it is not possible to deal with these officials under this measure, too.  I would like to hear from the Minister what difficulties are there or whether, in fact, he has no policy with regard to them.  No matter what view we took at the time the District Courts were established in this country after the signing of the Treaty, we all <Col N="240" /> know what the difficulties were for the people who undertook their responsibility. That is 25 years ago and a number of them were then men of 40 years of age.  They should have had, as most of them had, practical experience of the law.  They were engaged in one way or another in activities connected with solicitors' offices or in different capacities.  Anyhow, they had experience and legal training.  A number of them up and down the country have reached the age when they must retire.  I think I actually know of one man in my own county who has had to retire within the last six months.  I am sure there is no provision made for him.  It is terribly unjust and I can hardly believe that it represents the point of view of the Minister.  There is no doubt that these men undertook a task which not so many were prepared to face up to.  I think the status which our courts achieved in the early days of this State was, to a very considerable extent, due to the integrity, capacity, earnestness and sincerity of the men who went in as District Court clerks.  They went in as the young men went into the Volunteers, with no feeling that they were going to expect superannuation.  They went in to serve the State and take the consequences of what was coming to them from the service which they offered the State then.  I think it would be very unbecoming of us, now that we have reached the position of stability which we enjoy and achieved a prestige for our courts, if the services of these men who made a major contribution to the building up of that prestige should not be taken cognisance of.  I feel the Minister is not the sort of man to ignore that, but it is an urgent matter.</P>
    <P>I believe some time ago one of his predecessors gave consideration to a scheme of superannuation.  As far as I know nothing came of it.  I do not know why.  There is a problem there, and perhaps the Minister would be prepared to let us know what progress has been made and what is his attitude exactly on this question.  I do not know how many men are concerned but it would not be a very large number and it would not mean payment of <Col N="241" /> a large sum of money.  But there is a principle involved.  There is above everything the principle that the State owes to servants who have given excellent service some tribute, and we ought not to be slow to recognise that fact.</P>

      <P>As Senator Baxter has said, Senator Ryan has been very helpful in his statement.  I expect the Minister will take note of some of the amendments he has suggested.  I think he has suggested an amendment that words should be inserted to take away the powers given to the Master under the rules of court.  I think the Minister thinks that would be necessary.  The Court Officers Act of 1926 gave power to the county registrar to employ certain officials in his office.  They were employed.  Some of them were taken on a new but most of them had been there for many years.  I understand that Senator Baxter referred to one of these officials as being there for 40 years, and I know of one who has been there 40 years.  Some years ago this man was advised by his doctor to retire but he could not do so.  He had a very bad heart and was in danger of death at any moment but, because he had a wife and family and was not entitled to a pension, he had to keep going on day after day doing his work as best he could.  That is a dreadful position for a man to be in.  I believe this man is only one of several all over the country and there are also other difficulties connected with them.  Not alone are they not pensionable but they are not permanent.  The county registrar has to get permission from the Minister to keep them on in employment at all.  Their position is most insecure.  I am quite sure the Minister does give that certificate and they are kept on, but that insecurity is very bad for people doing responsible work of such a nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their duties are of a very technical and serious kind.  I see by the Dáil report that the Minister for Finance was said to be considering the matter, but I am sorry provision was not made in this Bill so that they would get that proper protection that any ordinary citizen employed in an office ought to get.  After all, in most countries these <Col N="242" /> people are provided for by old age pensions.  We in this country should not be slow to give them the protection that officials of county councils and other officials get.  The Court Officers Act also refers to the District Court clerks.  Their position is altogether peculiar.  I know one man who was clerk of the pretty sessions for very many years.  After we took over the State he retired on a small pension, but afterwards was re-employed as a District Court clerk.  He was in that position for 20 years before he retired.  By taking that office he saved the State the pension he would have been drawing, and yet not one penny was added to his pension when he retired from the position of District Court clerk.  No allowance was made for his 20 years' service. That does not seem to be justice, and I think the matter ought to be looked into.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan has mentioned that there ought to be more examiners.  I am very sorry power is not given to the Minister to appoint examiners.  I think a great many of the delays that occur in court are due to the fact that we have not sufficient examiners. With regard to the rest of the Bill, I think we are all in agreement that it is necessary and we ought to adopt it, but I wish that if at all possible these amendments should be made to give protection to certain officials.</P>

      <P>Whether he should or not he is concerned with it.  I think everyone will agree that in matters of staff the Minister for Finance must have the last word, otherwise you could not carry on the State at all.  It is not alone a question of temporary officers in the Department of Justice. There are temporary officers in other Departments also, such as the Land Commission, and I know that there are a number of hard cases, but if the Minister <Col N="243" /> has to deal with the temporary people in the Department of Justice he will also have to deal with temporary people in other Departments.  So that this is a bigger question than some Senators may think.  However, as I have said, I could not get this question settled in time.  On the question of the county registrar doing the under-sheriff's work, the point is that outside Dublin and, I think, to a lesser extent, Cork, there is scarcely enough work for the county registrar to deal with, and the county registrar alone has been able to deal with all these matters in counties outside Dublin and Cork.  By comparison the county registrar in Dublin has considerably more to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am aware of that. He is a very exceptional person, but we are well aware in the Department of Justice of what the position is in the different counties, and I think I can safely say that the county registrar, at least, is not overworked in any of these counties and that, accordingly, outside Dublin, and perhaps, Cork, there will be no necessity for appointing a sheriff.  It may be necessary to do so in some cases, and if it is, then, when this Bill is passed, we shall have power&mdash;a power which we had not up to now&mdash;to appoint a sheriff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not agree with Senator Sweetman that we are trying to take away from the judges powers which they already have.  In the old days, as, I am sure, Senators know, the judges actually appointed the staffs. That was done away with when a new Government was set up here, and when a Minister is responsible for the appointment of the staff, that means that he is responsible to the Oireachtas, which can take him to task in regard to the matter, and I do not think that that could be done in the case of a judge.  It is only in the matter of staffs that we are interfering with the Master's powers.  We are not interfering with his quasi-judicial functions at all.  There may be a certain <Col N="244" /> amount of responsibility in regard to the matter but, nevertheless, it is not desirable that there should be an exception made in the case of court officers or that they should be treated differently from civil servants in other Departments of the State.  On the question of principal officers, I think that Senator Ryan is overlooking one thing, and that is that under the 1926 Act certain officers who are called principal officers have not the same status or the same pay as other principal officers.  The Master, for instance, is in a different position, and there is a big difference also, both in regard to pay and status between some of the people named there as principal officers.  As a matter of fact, there are actually officers in the courts who are not styled principal officers&mdash;they will be after this&mdash;who have bigger salaries than principal officers in other branches of the Civil Service.  One of them, I understand, has £900 a year, and so it is not a fair analogy at all.</P>

      <P>I am not as familiar with the staffs in the courts as Senator Ryan is.  I have not had personal experience of the matter, but I do know that that is the case.  The Master is styled a principal officer and he gets a much bigger salary than any similar principal officer in the Civil Service.  Others who are styled principal officers get lower salaries than the principal officers in other Departments. I think, therefore, that there is nothing in that matter of the name &ldquo;principal officer.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I cannot see anything in Senator Sweetman's point about taking away certain powers.  I do not think we are taking any powers away from the Oireachtas, which is what I understood him to say.  After all, if the Minister is responsible for the staff, he is responsible to the Oireachtas and will have to answer for it there.  With regard to Senator O'Dea's point about temporary officials getting permission to remain on after 65, I think that that is a general provision in the Civil Service, and that if after having reached the age of 65 a temporary official can satisfy the Minister that he is physically fit, the Minister for Finance generally agrees to keep him on for a longer period, since he does not get a pension, but that, of course, is considered a privilege.</P>

      <P>Well, I have had no decision on that matter.  I made no promise in the other House, and I could not do so.  We had to appoint a sheriff for Dublin City; that was the urgency in regard to this matter, and not the other question; but when we were dealing with the one case I thought it better to take advantage of it to deal with the other. There will be no more undersheriffs. There has been a lot of misunderstanding on this matter.  At any rate, I know that I have got many letters from all over the country from people who evidently had the idea that we were going to appoint sheriffs for every county.  I want to make it clear <Col N="246" /> that that is not the intention.  It is only in places where too much work will be put on the county registrar that the Minister will appoint a sheriff and put such duties as he thinks should be put on the sheriff and not on the county registrar.</P>

      <P>Yes.  All these people are now being appointed by the Civil Service Commissoners and will be pensionable.  I know that in the case of some of the older people there are certain hardships, but in the case of the county registrars there is only a limited number.  Undoubtedly, it was very hard on a man of 45, being appointed and giving up his practice as a solicitor, that under the Civil Service regulations he would have to have 40 years' service before being eligible for a pension.  That would be obviously impossible in the case of a man of 45, and so the Minister for Finance agreed to give him the same pension terms as the district justice has, and, of course, there was a very limited number there.  The temporary officers in the courts are analogous to a lot of other people in other Departments such as temporary surveyors in the Land Commission, and so on, and that question could only be dealt with separately by the Minister for Finance. I do not think it could be dealt with in any other way.</P>

      <P>As regards Section 10, the position at present is that, when there is a vacancy for a county registrar, the Government appoints him and then the Minister for Justice has to make an Order assigning him to a particular county.  That should be unnecessary.  The Government now proposes to appoint the county registrar to a particular county.  Instead of two operations, there will, in future, be only one.  As regards the second point, it is not mandatory upon the Minister to appoint the assistant examiner but that is what will, in fact, happen.

      <P>This Bill was rendered necessary by the change made in the Electoral Act. Up to this year, the qualifying date for getting on the register of electors was 15th November.  We have been having numerous elections in June of late and there has been trouble on each occasion about the register. Because of that, the Minister for Local Government decided to make September 15th the qualifying date for residence and April the month in which the register would come into force instead of June.  Consequential on that, it was necessary to bring in a Juries Bill so that the qualifying <Col N="248" /> date for jurors would correspond.  The Bill was availed of to deal with a few other matters which required attention. One of these matters referred to opportunities for the performance of their religious duties on Sundays by members of a jury which had been locked up.  Provision is made for that.  Another matter which required to be dealt with was the position of a juror who received information that a near relative was seriously ill.</P>

      <P>I do not understand the necessity for the difference between Section 7 and Section 8.  In reading those sections, we are presented with the same difficulty that we have had during the past few years, because it is necessary to refer to a large number of Acts.  This is one of the worst bits of legislation by reference we have had for some time.  If I read the two sections correctly, the persons who are to be liable for jury duty both for the wards of court and in the common law section of the High Court are the same.  The jurors are to be drawn from the same panel.  If I am right in that, why are not the jurors summoned by the same man?  It might happen that the Registrar of the Wards of Court would summon a man to-day and that the Central Office would summon him to-morrow.  I am not sure that I am right in saying that the jurors are to be from the same panel.  If they are not, perhaps the Minister would explain on what qualifications the common law panel is made up in Dublin and the country and on what qualifications the panel for the Registrar of the Wards of Court is completed.</P>

      <P>I understood that the law provided that certain jurors would be summoned on certain occasions down to, say, the letter K and that jurors for the following sitting would be summoned from K to M and so on. If that is the practice, the same person should summon both sets of jurors.  Otherwise, you might have a man summoned to two courts on the same day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that there will be any difficulty, in practice, or that there will be any conflict between the functions of the officer of the High Court under Section 7 and those of the Registrar of the Wards of Court under Section 8, because the jury that will be summoned under Section 7 is the ordinary jury for the trial of civil actions in the Four Courts, while the jury, under Section 8, is to be summoned for the purpose of deciding whether a person is or is not of unsound mind.  It is very rarely that that jury has been summoned.  So far as my recollection serves, it would be only once in three years.  In practice, there would be no conflict between the two officers.</P>
      <P>In the explanatory memorandum issued by the Minister in connection with this Bill, the Minister states with reference to Section 7:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This section deals with the summoning of jurors and any duties subsequent to the summoning in civil cases in the High Court.  At present these duties are divided between the Master of the High Court and the under-sheriff for the County of Dublin.  It is considered simpler and better to entrust these duties to the Registrar of the High Court who deals generally with jury trials under the direction of the President of the High Court.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the Minister, in his explanatory memorandum, states that it is considered better to entrust those duties to the Registrar of the High Court, the Bill does not so provide. The Bill simply states that the duties to which the section applies shall be performed by &ldquo;such officer serving in the central office as the President of the High Court may from time to time <Col N="250" /> nominate in that behalf&rdquo;.  That might mean that the Registrar of the High Court would be appointed but the section does not say so.  The summoning officer might be a person other than the Registrar of the High Court.  However, that is a matter which can be rectified.  No doubt, the President of the High Court will nominate the registrar.  That reinforces my argument on the last Bill that the Registrar of the High Court has added duties under this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which is not mentioned in this Bill to which I would like to refer.  Under an Emergency Powers Order it was provided that only seven jurors should be necessary to try a criminal case in the Circuit Court.  The requirement that 12 jurors should be necessary in a criminal trial in the Central Criminal Court has not been affected by the Emergency Powers Order. I do not know whether the emergency which produced that Order still exists, but I think the sooner we get rid of that position the better.  I believe that in the Circuit Court a number of serious crimes are tried, and the consequences are almost as great as those arising from a trial in the Central Criminal Court, so that for the purposes of justice we should revert as soon as possible to the trial of criminal cases in the Circuit Court by 12 jurors and not by seven as at present obtains.</P>
    <P>An extraordinary case happened quite recently in the Circuit Court in Dublin.  A person was charged with stealing some property of the Electricity Supply Board&mdash;I do not know whether he was an employee.  There were seven jurors trying the case.  In the middle of the trial the solicitor for the defendant pointed out to the judge that the foreman of the jury was an employee of the Electricity Supply Board.  When the foreman's attention was called to that fact he informed the judge that another member of the jury was also an employee of the Electricity Supply Board.  Two of the seven were interested parties. However, the jury were discharged and a new trial had to take place. That was a case where, through <Col N="251" /> inadvertence or otherwise, these employees of the Electricity Supply Board happened to be sworn on the jury.  If one juryman should get ill or something else should happen, reducing the number to six, it would be a rather serious matter.  I think that now, at all events, the Minister should consider the revocation of that Order, or procuring the revocation of that Order as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The basis of the Order was the difficulty of transport in the country.  I do not think that transport in the country will improve very much from its present position so far as juries are concerned, unless every juryman is a person who owns a private car.  Certainly in the City of Dublin, where the difficulty of transport does not arise, there is no justification in my opinion for retaining in the Circuit Court a jury of seven in criminal cases.</P>
    <P>We know that in Dublin at the present time the Circuit Court judges are employed a considerable portion of the year&mdash;two Circuit Court judges, often three&mdash;trying criminal cases.  I would suggest that, as far as Dublin is concerned, where there is no difficulty of transport, the system of 12 jurors in a criminal trial should be reverted to.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a rather novel section, a section appropriate to this country, namely the section enabling a jury in murder cases to separate for the purpose of attending a place of religious worship.  I know that in a number of cases the law as it stands produced certain difficulties, especially when the juries happened to be members of different religions.  In some cases the minority went with the majority or the jury did not go at all. This is a very novel section and I think a welcome one.  As far as I know there is no such provision in English law.  Perhaps the necessity would not arise very much there but, at all events, it is a novel section and we welcome it.  For these reasons, I support the Bill and I trust that the suggestion which I made concerning a reversion to a jury of 12 in criminal trials, at least in the Circuit Court in Dublin, will receive consideration from the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to that of Senator Ryan in regard to the abolition of the jury of seven in the Circuit Court.  I realise that there are difficulties in the country, but these difficulties do not arise in Dublin.  Senator Ryan says that there is no transport difficulty in Dublin.  Perhaps Senator Ryan has never tried to catch a bus at the rush hour.  At the same time, from the point of view of the jurymen in the city, I do not think there could be any difficulty in reverting to a jury of 12.  For the same reason, in connection with Section 6, I do not think that the jury should be reduced below 11.  I quite approve of the exception which is provided for there.  Where a near relative, say a wife or a husband falls ill, it is desirable that the juryman concerned should be discharged.</P>
      <P>I think the case which gave rise to this section was a criminal case in which I myself was engaged.  The difficulty was one which placed the judge and counsel in a quandary but eventually the solution arrived at was that the juryman was not told of the incident until the case was over. If the effect of the section were to reduce a jury below 11, I doubt if in any case the trial should go on and I suggest that an amendment on these grounds might be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the whole, I welcome the provision in Section 5.  I am not certain, however, that very much harm was done by the old system.  Some people might feel that under the old system quite a few Protestants were given a chance of saving their souls because what generally happened was that the Protestants went to a Catholic service with the other jurymen! I do not think it does any harm to Protestants to attend for once a Catholic service, but there should be no compulsion in the matter.  I should like if an amendment were inserted providing that the minimum instead of being ten should be 11, because, in a criminal case, it is very important to my mind to get unanimity, and whereas you may dispense with one juryman, if you dispense with two, it may make all the difference between acquittal or conviction. <Col N="253" /> I do not much like that provision in the section.</P>

      <P>I rise for the purpose of voicing as strongly as possible my commendation of the point of view put forward by Senator Ryan and the last speaker with regard to a jury of 12.  I think that in the interests of justice it would be much more satisfactory to have a jury of 12.  When we speak of the inconvenience of travelling down the country, I do not think that in serious matters such as criminal trials the question of transport difficulties should enter into the matter.  I do not think that anybody down the country would consider transport difficulties when it is a question of meting out justice.  The general custom in the past was to get a verdict of 12 jurymen.  It was felt that when a case was tried by 12 jurymen there was a clear verdict and such a verdict carried great weight.</P>
      <P>Unless in a sudden case of illness affecting one member of the jury it would be more than desirable to have the full 12 and I will strongly urge that the number should not be reduced under 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

      <P>There is a small point that strikes me about this problem of juries.  I have come up against it frequently.  It is especially a problem in our small farming counties&mdash;I refer to the question of the expenses incurred by jurymen.  I do not know what the position is in law, but I have frequently seen in my own county town men who had travelled 40 miles to serve on a jury, sometimes pushing 20 miles on a bicycle to catch a bus, and getting back in the same fashion.</P>
      <P>In those days, when you are paying expenses to county councillors, members of committees of agriculture, members of vocational committees and members of the Dáil and Seanad, I think that it is a hardship to expect jurymen to pay their own expenses. I have no doubt it is a hardship because I have seen cases of it myself. I have met men in county towns who had travelled 40 miles.  You would wonder why they were in the town and when you asked them, you found that they had a real grievance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="254" /> They had come away from farms at the most difficult period of the year and it cost them £1, £2 or £3 before they got home.  I suggest to the Minister that that is a problem that must be tackled.  It is a different matter in Dublin, although I admit you have greater demands on the time of jurymen in the capital.  But when a Dublin juryman has finished his day he can go back to his home, unlike the unfortunate country members of Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann who must find lodgings for themselves in the city.  There are not so many jurors as a whole, but the very fact that they are few makes the hardship all the greater.  When a man is summoned from his crops and his stock at a busy time of the year he undoubtedly has a grievance.</P>

      <P>On the question raised by Senator Sweetman as to the summoning of juries by different officers, the position is that the officer who deals with lunacy cases is considered to be the best person to summon a jury dealing with a lunacy matter.  I consulted with the President of the High Court on that matter, and I find that it is only rarely that it happens. The other registrar does not deal with cases of lunacy but, of course, it is from the same panel that the names are taken.</P>

      <P>As regards the point raised about the juries of seven members, that was simply an emergency measure.  We will go back to 12 as soon as possible, but I do not think that emergency conditions have passed so far as transport is concerned. Indeed, the Department was afraid that the whole system would break down, and that you would not get jurymen to come in.  Therefore, the number has been restricted in country places, and as residents of County Dublin may be summoned to attend on juries it also applies to them.  A juryman might have difficulty in getting backwards and forwards owing to bad transport conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that everybody knows that <Col N="255" /> transport is nothing like what it was pre-war and until conditions are reasonably satisfactory we ought to keep to the seven.  That is the case that was made for it.  People have complained that they could not get home at night and had to meet heavy expenses.  They really had a grievance. I agree that there are cases heard in the Circuit Court which are very serious, but they are not as serious as those in the Central Criminal Court, and we have, therefore, continued the 12 in the Central Criminal Court.  There is no suggestion that we are trying to do away with 12, although once in a while the number might be allowed by the judge to drop to ten. We follow the practice permitted by Section 54 of the Juries Act of 1927, which gives the judge certain discretion.</P>

      <P>When we were drawing up the Bill we looked at the present position and we followed the same procedure.  About the question of jurors' expenses, I do not think that anyone has asked that juries should be paid for their services.  The Department of Finance has examined that matter and they will pay reasonable subsistence allowances and transport expenses.  That has been fixed up.</P>
