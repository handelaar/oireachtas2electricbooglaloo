      <P>I move amendments Nos. 1 and 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  In page 3, Section 4, to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  The quorum for a meeting of the board of trustees shall be one-third of the whole number of the members of such board.</P>
      <P>2.  In page 3, Section 4, to delete sub-section (2) (inserted in Committee) and to substitute therefor the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  Subject to the provisions of sub-section (2) of this section the board of trustees may act notwithstanding one or more vacancies in its membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the last meeting of the House, an amendment was inserted to the effect that the board might act notwithstanding one or more vacancies in its membership. It struck me at the time that, if that provision were allowed to stand, <Col N="1214" /> there might be a large number of vacancies in the board&mdash;six or seven&mdash; and yet the board might continue to act.  In these circumstances, I thought that it might be helpful to put in the amendments which I now submit.  The amendment which proposes to fix the quorum is taken from Sections 18 and 19 of the Vocational Education Act, so that we shall be acting according to precedent.  The number of vacancies could not, if my amendment were accepted, at any time exceed five, and the ambiguity which appears to be present in the amendment inserted at the last meeting would be removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Grady)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that we cannot accept those two amendments. We have already fixed the quorum at three.  Under this amendment, the quorum would be fixed at one-third of the total membership.  As the entire body consists of eight members, it is obvious that you could not have an attendance of one-third of that number. Apart from that, each of the contributing bodies is under a statutory obligation to fill vacancies as they arise and the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is bound to see that these bodies discharge their statutory duties.  It is felt that the Bill is better as it stands than it would be if these amendments were accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Patrick J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in any way committed to the fraction, one-third.  I merely suggested that because the Act from which I took the first amendment provided for a quorum of one-fourth and it struck me that that would be a rather small number in this case.  The necessary attendance might be only two.  One-third of the membership of the board would be two and two-thirds.  Since we cannot have the two-thirds, it is obvious that three would form the quorum.  When the quorum does not work out at an exact figure, the practice is to take the next greater whole number.  I should prefer a quorum of half or even a larger number.  I submit this amendment, providing for one-third, for the purpose of removing the ambiguity that seems to exist in the amendment carried on the last day.  That amendment provided <Col N="1215" /> that the board &ldquo;may act notwithstanding one or more vacancies in its membership&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Patrick J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>No&mdash;one or more.  With his legal instinct, Senator O'Dea suggested an amendment providing that the board could act &ldquo;notwithstanding one or two vacancies in its membership&rdquo;.  That amendment was not accepted by the Parliamentary Secretary, but the amendment in the name of Senator Quirke, referring to &ldquo;one or more vacancies&rdquo; was accepted. More, I say, is a very loose way of stating the provision necessary to secure that the acts of the board are complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Bill stands, the quorum is definitely fixed as three, and under Section 13 of the 1856 Act which actually remains in force all the powers and duties vested in the trustees may be exercised and discharged at meetings at which not less than three members are present.  If you take Senator O'Reilly's amendment as against the quorum of three, already fixed, you will find that there is really nothing in it, that they both amount to the same thing.</P>
      <P>I think that the three is a reasonable number, and that you cannot reduce it lower.  If you make it larger you will possibly find that you will have a meeting of only three members, and if the quorum is fixed at four the meeting would fall through.  I feel that three is a reasonable number having regard to the total membership of the board as eight.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 5, section 12, subsection (1) <Col N="1216" /> (b), in line 41, to delete the word &ldquo;sixty&rdquo; and insert instead the word &ldquo;sixty-five&rdquo;; in line 42, to delete the word &ldquo;thirty&rdquo; and insert instead the word &ldquo;thirty-five&rdquo;; and to delete line 43.</P>
    <P>This amendment is for the purpose of removing what will be for all time, while it remains in the Bill, a source of contention as between counties Galway and Mayo.  During the discussion on the Second Stage of the Bill certain arguments were advanced in support of the imposition of a percentage of the maintenance charges on County Mayo. The only argument, as a matter of fact, which appeared to stand on its legs was that made by the Parliamentary Secretary who, I believe, must have been misinformed.  He said that the people of Mayo derived certain benefits from the navigation scheme in the matter of drainage and of turf transport.</P>
    <P>Since that discussion on the Second Stage I have made contacts with people in touch with every aspect of this scheme in Mayo, and I am reliably informed that no turf goes over or ever went over the canal from Mayo to Galway or from Galway to Mayo.  So far as the relief of drainage which this scheme is supposed to give to Mayo is concerned, I would like to quote for you, Sir, and for the members of the Seanad, an excerpt from the Report of the Drainage Commission, which, as you know, preceded the introduction of the Arterial Drainage Bill.  This Bill, the Corrib Navigation Bill, is in direct contradiction to the recommendations of the Drainage Commission as set out in paragraphs 302, and 303 of the Report, which goes on to state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Several of the existing navigation schemes are still nominally maintained, although traffic is negligible and there are no prospects of increased trade, as the traffic formerly carried is now more expeditiously dealt with on the roads.  To bring some of these navigation schemes to an efficient state would now require a considerable outlay without any compensatory increase in business. The abandonment, however, of these canals or canalised rivers might in some cases leave them available for <Col N="1217" /> river discharge and give an increased outlet for floods...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The same Report definitely singled out the Lough Corrib navigation scheme as a case in point, referring to it as follows in paragraph 303:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The short canal, five-eighths of a mile in length, connecting Lough Corrib and the River Corrib with the sea, is a case in point.  Over it are five swing bridges built in 1859.  Two were renewed last year and the renewal of three more of the lough gates is contemplated.  The total cost of these works is from £40,000 to £50,000, although the only traffic consists of one or two pleasure boats making one passage up or down the canal each year and these boats could easily be lorried to or from the docks at very little expense.  If abandoned, the canal would form a very useful drainage channel for dealing with flood discharge.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should think that disposes of the argument that the Lough Corrib navigation scheme is of any benefit to the people of Mayo for the purposes of drainage.  On the last occasion my friend Senator O'Dea referred to the fact that two bridges were built in Galway and that Mayo was not asked to make any contribution.  As a matter of fact Mayo was asked to contribute but did not, for very sound reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. S.T. Ruane Mr. S.T. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>From 1865 until 1941 Mayo, or that part of the county which is known as the Barony of Kilmain, made an annual contribution to the maintenance of that scheme.  In 1941 it transpired that the levies were made by a body irregularly constituted. The maintenance charges were, therefore, irregularly levied.  Mayo then ceased to make any contributions as from that date.  To relieve any feelings of uneasiness among my Galway friends, let me say that it is not contemplated in Mayo to sue for a recovery of the amount, wrongfully levied and collected since 1855.  This amount in the aggregate totals considerably over £20,000.  We have our own navigation schemes in Mayo. Some time ago the Mayo County <Col N="1218" /> Council approved of a scheme to make a swing bridge connecting Broadhaven and Blacksod Bay.  The only thing holding up that scheme is the fact that the materials required are not easily obtained.  When that work is done it will be of very considerable benefit to craft passing round that part of the coast, and not confined to Mayo craft. Similarly at Achill Sound, a new swing bridge is to be built when materials can be procured.  These two works will cost a considerable sum of money and will be of general benefit, but we are not asking Galway for a halfpenny.</P>
      <P>In so far as the bridges built in Galway are concerned, I am very credibly informed that the cost of those works was, in the main, borne by a grant from the Road Fund, and, therefore, the responsibility for the scheme is not increasing the burden on the ratepayers in Galway.  The people in County Mayo who were responsible for these maintenance charges are farmers whose land is among the most highly rated in the country.  They never derive any benefit from employment schemes because there are no unemployed from the area on the register. There are no people on the dole and they can never avail themselves of work carried out by the Government schemes for the relief of unemployed as other areas may do.</P>
      <P>In other parts of the county where there is a reasonable amount of unemployed to carry out these works, benefits have been derived from them.  It is felt, in Mayo, that an area which for such a long time has been contributing to a system from which they never got any benefit should be relieved of any further responsibility, and while we wish Galway people well in every sense of the word we do not feel that it is right or just or proper that Mayo should have to continue for all time contributing to a maintenance charge, I do not mind how small it may be, towards the upkeep of a scheme that is of benefit to County Galway alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last occasion on which this matter was debated, Senator Mrs. Concannon spoke in a very eloquent manner on the beauties of Lough Corrib and of the opening that exists <Col N="1219" /> there for improvement by the expenditure of a little extra money.  I should like to assure the House that we have some very beautiful lakes in Mayo also. In North Mayo we have Lough Conn. People who visit that lake annually from many parts of the country and from overseas, like to refer to it as the Killarney of the West.  I am quite satisfied that with a little expenditure on the amenities of Lough Conn we would make it more attractive and more remunerative to the people of Mayo.  If such expenditure is undertaken, I assure you that we shall not look to Galway for monetary assistance. Because of these considerations I feel that I am not asking anything unreasonable in requesting the Seanad to support my efforts for the removal of this unjust burden on Mayo.  I appeal also to the Parliamentary Secretary to accept the amendment.  The lifting of this burden, as I said at the outset, will remove for all time a bone of contention as between the counties of Galway and Mayo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I must compliment my friend, Senator Ruane, on the very cool effrontery with which he has proposed this amendment.  I have not heard anything like it for a very long time, and I am sure it has taken the Seanad by surprise.  On two different occasions I pointed out the injustice inflicted by this Bill on County Galway, particularly on the borough of Galway, and the equally unjust relief given to Mayo.  My friend, Senator Ruane, is not satisfied with that.  He wants to remove liability for even the miserable 10 per cent. that Mayo has been asked to pay, notwithstanding the fact that for some years past they have not contributed one penny towards the cost of the navigation.  They have refused point blank to pay one penny, and I am sure they will refuse to pay again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we are asked to remove the liability for the miserable 10 per cent. of the expenses of the board of trustees which Mayo is asked to pay under this Bill.  Mayo's liability was fixed under a very old award made, I think, in the year 1859.  The ratepayers of Mayo were held to be liable for 32 per cent. <Col N="1220" /> of the original outlay and of the cost of maintenance.  That was a very reasonable contribution and yet this Bill reduces Mayo's contribution under this particular clause to 10 per cent. And my friend is not satisfied! I suppose there are some people you cannot satisfy.  If the measure of their liability had been left as it was, I am sure there would not be a word of protest but because the Government have thought fit to give this tremendous concession to Mayo, my friend, emboldened by that concession, comes along and says: &ldquo;I want to get rid of the whole liability.&rdquo;  I think that request is so ridiculous that it need not be answered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept this amendment.  We have endeavoured to hold the scales of justice as evenly balanced as possible between Galway and Mayo, but judging by the speeches which we have just heard we have evidently been wronging both counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>You have been wronging Galway, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>That convinces me that we have been fairly just to both counties.  Under the Act of 1856, as Senators are aware, the charges were first levied and the various contributing bodies were bound by law to make certain contributions.  In the case of Mayo the old contribution was 32 per cent.  The charge to be levied under this particular section is now to be reduced to 10 per cent.  In arriving at the figure for the various contributions to be made by the contributing bodies, we had regard to the expenditure in the different areas as a sort of yardstick measurement of the amount of contributions of these various bodies.  In any case, under Section 12 (2) the Minister is empowered at any time to review the charges, and if a case can be made for so doing, reallot them on a different basis and alter the percentage up or down, as he considers just.  With regard to the point made by Senator Ruane, as to the erection or renovation of bridges in Galway, I think he can make his mind easy on that matter as I am not aware that the ratepayers were called <Col N="1221" /> upon to contribute towards that expenditure. The cost of the erection of these bridges was borne entirely from the Central Fund, and I doubt if anyone can reasonably assume that the ratepayers will be less generously treated in regard to such works in the future than in the past.  I think that on the whole any impartial observer will have to agree that we have endeavoured to be fair to all parties concerned, and for that reason I regret that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I have a good deal of sympathy on this occasion with Senator Ruane.  On the last occasion Senator Ruane suggested that Mayo should not pay something that the council was quite legally bound to pay.  On that issue I was quite clearly prepared to be against him, but this appears to be a question of the future.  It appears to me to be a question of the benefit to be derived from these works, in the future and I did hope that the Parliamentary Secretary would give us some indication as to what benefit Mayo would derive and would not merely have adopted the attitude of getting up and saying: &ldquo;I have decided on a certain proportion for each county and you must accept my decision as being good and proper,&rdquo; without giving us rhyme or reason for the grounds on which he came to that decision.  If that is the line to be adopted on legislation of this kind, it appears to me that it is utter waste of time to come here at all. It would be very much better if the Executive decided what laws they were going to promulgate and leave it at that.  I suggest that we are entitled to hear the reasons for the Government's proposals in this matter.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that the yardstick was the expenditure in each area. Let us hear what benefit Mayo will derive from this expenditure.  If his reasons are good and sufficient, then I shall oppose Senator Ruane, but until such reasons are produced to the House it appears to me that the case made by Senator Ruane is left unanswered.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say, in reply <Col N="1222" /> to the references made by Senator O'Dea to the fact that Mayo has not contributed anything since 1941, that I gave the reason for that?  Mayo County Council obtained the opinion of very learned counsel that the sums of money which they had been paying since 1865 were levied by a body irregularly constituted and that they were not legally responsible for these contributions. That was why Mayo stopped the payment of levies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ruane Mr. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Sweetman pointed out, we have got no evidence from the Parliamentary Secretary that any benefit will accrue to Mayo as the result of the perpetuation of this scheme.  If I could go back to the people of Mayo and say: &ldquo;Well, you are going to get such and such a benefit and you are not going to be asked to pay very much,&rdquo; I would gladly do so, but I should like to be able to tell them what benefit they will derive from this navigation scheme.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that in the case of the erection of bridges along this navigation scheme the bulk of the expenditure will be defrayed out of the Central Fund.  It is a considerable relief to me to hear that, because the estimate for the construction of these bridges runs into a sum of £50,000. Ten per cent. of that £50,000 would mean a rather heavy levy on Mayo. Even if it were made a county-at-large charge, it would entail the striking of an extra 3½d. or 4d. in the £.  It would naturally make the people in Belmullet and North Mayo ask: what contribution are we getting from Galway towards the construction of the canal between Broadhaven and Blacksod?  It would make the people in Achill ask: what is Galway contributing to the cost of the swing bridges to be constructed at Achill Sound?  If the assurances for which I have asked were given, I would gladly withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Bill passes, Sir, I should like to draw attention to what seems to be a rather peculiar provision in this Bill and in some other Bills of this character.  I would draw your attention to the provisions of Section 6, which provides that &ldquo;Article 12 of the Schedule to the Local Government (Application of Enactments) Order, 1898, as amended by any subsequent enactment, shall apply to the Board of Trustees&rdquo;, set up under this Bill.  It is extraordinary, however, that that Article, to which reference is made in this Bill, has, in part, been repealed by the Local Government Act of 1931, and that further provision in that regard is being made in a Bill which will come before us very shortly. It seems to me that if we want to make provisions in a Bill of this kind for the qualifications or disqualifications contained in the Application of Enactments Order, they should be set out specifically in the Bill, and that we should not be asked to say that certain provisions shall have effect although, elsewhere, these provisions are repealed. I do not know what the Parliamentary Secretary may have to say about this, but I would urge upon him that it is important that in a Bill of this kind the actual matters that are being repealed should be set out in the Bill, and that it should not be done in the manner in which it is being done here.</P>

      <P>In page 2, Section 1, line 21, to delete the word &ldquo;similar&rdquo;; and in line 22, immediately before the word &ldquo;to&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;similarly&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have submitted this amendment, a <Col N="1225" /> Chathaoirleach, as a suggested improvement on the definition of the word &ldquo;indecent&rdquo; in the definition part of Section 1.  Before the discussion on the last day I tried, so far as I could, to interpret what the meaning of the word was, and during that discussion Senator Magennis who, if anybody, should know what the meaning of these various definitions was, after so many years of trying to implement them, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not profess to understand the remaining part of the definition &mdash;&lsquo;or likely in any other similar way to corrupt or deprave&rsquo;&mdash;because I do not know what a &lsquo;similar way&rsquo; might be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, that statement impressed me immensely on the last occasion and, during the interval, I tried to suggest to the House a better definition. Accordingly, I am now suggesting that the deletion of the word &ldquo;similar&rdquo; in line 21, and the insertion of the word &ldquo;similarly&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;to&rdquo;, in line 22, would make the definition clearer.  The definition would then read: &ldquo;the word &lsquo;indecent&rsquo; includes suggestive of, or inciting to, sexual immorality or unnatural vice or likely in any other way similarly to corrupt or deprave&rdquo;.  The insertion of the word &ldquo;similarly&rdquo; there would qualify the words &ldquo;corrupt or deprave&rdquo;.  During the previous discussion it was emphasised that this Bill refers to one type of immorality only: that is, immorality of a sexual nature.  For that reason, I suggest that it is well to clarify the definition and remove the indefiniteness in which it is now.  I agree with Senator Magennis that the phraseology used at present in the definition section does not make sense.</P>
    <P>To use the phrase as it is at present: &ldquo;likely in any other similar way to corrupt or deprave&rdquo;, would seem to qualify whether the word &ldquo;indecent&rdquo; was suggestive of, or inciting to, sexual immorality or unnatural vice. I think the House should agree with me that the transposition of the word, in the manner that I have suggested in my amendment, would be more intelligent, and that the deletion of the word &ldquo;similar&rdquo; where it occurs, and the insertion <Col N="1226" /> of the word &ldquo;similarly&rdquo; before the words &ldquo;to corrupt or deprave&rdquo; would remove the qualification which at present seems to apply to the word &ldquo;way&rdquo;.  I hope I have made myself clear, but at any rate I think that the proposal in my amendment is clearer than the wording in the present definition section of the Bill, and for those reasons I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like this proposal.  If we put in the words &ldquo;in any other way similarly to corrupt or deprave&rdquo; a person may say that the Sweeps or betting, are inclined to corrupt or deprave.  Similarly, with an incitement to drink.  There are other things likely to corrupt or deprave such as an incitement to betting or to drinking. If the word &ldquo;similarly&rdquo; is put in, it would bring within the ambit of the Act anything calculated to suggest or to incite in the mind of a person what might be corrupt or depraved. Therefore, the proposal would bring in all things which are of their nature, objectionable, and I confess that I hold betting or drinking to excess to be very objectionable from the social point of view.  If this Act is to confine itself to sexual matters the amendment would have the effect of extending it beyond its natural purpose, to any matter or advertisement or suggestion which might in any way have an undesirable effect upon the public.  There might be a good deal to be said for an Act of that type provided it was not a Censorship Act, but that is something we would have to consider from another point of view.  The effect of the amendment read grammatically and literally would be to give the meaning I mention.  I submit that viewpoint to the Senator, because it is the meaning I would take as a lawyer.</P>

      <P>Surely Senator Kingsmill Moore realises that this is a question concerning a definition in Section 1.  It deals with &ldquo;the &lsquo;great&rsquo; twin brethren&rdquo; the words &ldquo;indecent or obscene&rdquo;.  The ambit of the wording of the Bill could not be extended <Col N="1227" /> in the way Senator Kingsmill Moore suggests, because we are dealing with the Principal Act, which is an Act to prohibit the sale and circulation of unwholesome literature. If you read the Act through, one single section dealing with periodicals devoted to crime, is the only extension you can find that goes beyond the reference to sexual matters. Consequently, the words as used in the definition clause are to be construed as intended to deal exclusively with what is sexual.</P>

      <P>The Minister would be well advised to leave well enough alone.  I confess that I am not at all clear what difference, if any, the amendment would make.  The Act when passed with that definition, worked fairly well.  If by any chance there was to be a complete change, it seems to me the Bill would have to go back into Committee, to have this reconsidered. I suggest that it would be unwise to make a change now.</P>

      <P>I do not like the introduction of this amendment by the Minister.  It semes to me that it would be quite possible by it to undermine the whole intention of the Bill.  There is nothing to prevent anybody entering this country by air, by road, by sea or by train bringing in one book or 20 books under the guise of personal luggage. What we set out to do was to prevent the circulation of books which were considered to be of an unsuitable nature.  As I understand the amendment, there is nothing to prevent the wholesale importation of books and publications of the type that we want to prevent coming in.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the amendment.  Having suffered from various customs officers in other connections, when my baggage was held up and searched to see if I had any explosives or propaganda material, it seems to my reasoning that we have been facing too long the possibility of this development of the customs becoming not only disagreeable but a confounded nuisance.  In ordinary circumstances tact is exercised by the customs officers, but even so, as Senator Magennis will agree, it very often took months to decide if a book was on the border line. Eventually, we were not quite decided. I can imagine an ordinary customs official, probably very harassed at the end of a busy day, being inclined to be very hasty, indeed.  Anything that gives a margin, within which the danger of bringing a certain amount of disrepute on the country through hasty action can be averted, is a very good thing.  I assume that the amendment means that if a book is brought in as personal property, and is subsequently found to be undesirable, it will still be liable to censorship.  I assume also that some evidence will be forthcoming of ownership by the person who brings in the book, such as having his name on the book.  With regard to the exploitation of the amendment to import and circulate undesirable material, I cannot believe that there is such a danger.  Persons who want to do that will find many other ways of doing it than slipping such material into their personal luggage.  I do not think that any customs official, seeing a collection of curious books, would accept them as personal luggage without requiring <Col N="1230" /> verification.  For that reason, I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>In every case where the author, editor, or publisher is known to the board to have an address in Ireland, the Censorship Board shall send a letter to that address stating that the book is being examined.</P>
      <P>This amendment is somewhat similar to one moved on Committee Stage but the amendment moved in Committee has been simplified.  Where the author is known to the board to be an Irish resident, the board should send him notice.  In the previous amendment, I went further and asked that the board should give the author time to communicate with them.  I merely provide now that notice should be served in cases where the author has a residence here.  That is, I think, a reasonable request.</P>

      <P>I can see no reason for this amendment.  It is the book which is being considered and not what the author may have at the back of his mind regarding the book.  It was, I think, Senator Hayes who observed on the last occasion that you would not send the author's case for the book around with the book.  It is what the book contains that is in question and not what the author thinks about it. The amendment might do harm in another way.  If there was an interval and if the information got out that the <Col N="1231" /> book was under consideration by the board, harm might be done.</P>

I could not carry this amendment and it is not of sufficient importance to be pressed to a division.  When the Minister goes out of his way to provide that an author in America or England &ldquo;may&rdquo; be communicated with, he has not a good case against me when I suggest that an Irish author should be communicated with.  I should not worry in the slightest regarding the other authors.</P>

      <P>In page 5, Section 8, in sub-section (1), line 21, and in sub-section (4), line 34, to delete the word &ldquo;five&rdquo; and insert instead in each place the word &ldquo;ten&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the appeal should be signed by ten members of the Oireachtas instead of by five members. On the Committee Stage, I said that I thought five members was too small a number.  Certain members of this House and, possibly, some members of the other House object completely to censorship.  If five such members got together, they could render the operation of the Act nugatory, because they could appeal against every unfavourable decision by the Censorship Board. It is only reasonable that the number should be increased to ten, which is not a large number if the case which they support is justified.  What I want to avoid is five members getting together and appealing against every unfavourable decision by the Censorship Board so as to render the Act inoperative. If those members considered that there should be no censorship, they <Col N="1232" /> would be within their right in objecting to every banning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the number ten would be too large.  We went into this question fairly fully on the last stage.  Members of the Oireachtas will not appeal very often, the reason being that authors and publishers can appeal on their own behalf and, if their appeal is not considered frivolous, they will be repaid their £5.  It is only in rare cases that this procedure will be adopted.  Members of the Oireachtas have a right at present to table a motion calling for the revocation of an order to ban a book.  The Minister will not, in future, be the banning authority and that right to move for revocation will not be open to members.  I should be prepared to compromise and provide for appeal by seven members, if that would meet the Senator, but ten would be too many. I do not mind.  I do not think there is any likelihood of a combination of people deliberately getting together to object to everything.  There would not be much usefulness in that at all.  The author and the publishers can always appeal.  But I thought this was a valuable right for people who may think that it is in the public interest that the banning of some book should be reviewed. That is why that idea was brought in at all.  Ten would be too big.  Perhaps seven would be better. If that is acceptable I will agree to something like it.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister be good enough to assist in clearing my mind?  What is to be the procedure in regard to the action of members of Parliament?  Does someone approach the members and ask for their intercession?  If so, is there any case to be made for soliciting the intervention of the five members, or is it a legal fiction that is to govern the procedure that they are tempted to move of their own accord to institute an appeal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not quite clear as to what they are to do.  Presumably they will have read the book.  If they have not read the book, it will be much easier to lend themselves to any constituent or constituents who solicit their intervention. If they have to read the book, <Col N="1233" /> it would be very important that they should.  The members of the board from whose prohibition order they are instrumental in appealing against, have to read the books and form judgments on them.  Are they likely, in a frivolous mood, to institute an appeal and to put the appeal board to all the trouble of inquiry, simply because they were asked by constituents? My mind is in some perplexity as to how this is intended to function.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I can clear the Senator's mind.  If five Deputies or Senators make an appeal it can be heard.  If the author or the publisher thinks that the book ought not to have been banned, either is likely to appeal himself, but there might be remote cases in which it might happen that a book was considered by five members of the Oireachtas sufficiently important that it ought not to have been banned. They can make up their minds any way they like, either by people coming to them or acting on their own volition. Deputies and Senators may consider whether they ought to appeal. Some constituent perhaps who is fond of reading may come and say: &ldquo;This book ought not to have been banned.&rdquo; If he is a Deputy or a Senator he will read the book.  I think any Deputy would do that.  He will have a sense of responsibility and he will not do it lightly.</P>

He has said that with great gusto several times, and I have a good deal of sympathy with him.  I do not want to be in the position that I can be asked to read these books and put up a case for an appeal.  I would like to put what the position seems to me to be.  I may be asked to give my name for the purposes of appeal.  I resent very much this provision of the Bill about five Deputies or five Senators.  I do not like it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It brings members of the House still <Col N="1234" /> further into administration when they should be concerned with legislation. It ought to be our business to provide an Act of Parliament and the business of somebody else to work it.  We should not be pushed into the administrative machine after we have provided that machine.  For that reason I do not like this provision apart from the fact that it has other difficulties as well. Both Senator O'Donovan and Senator Magennis conveyed an impression which was not the right impression, that is to say, that they seem to imply that members of the Dáil and Seanad who are asked to have a decision on a book reconsidered will previously have made up their own minds that the decision ought to be changed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is quite possible that five members of the Oireachtas would ask to have a decision reconsidered without being previously satisfied that the first decision was unjust.  There is no such thing in the Bill as that before they ask for reconsideration they have had to make up their minds that the book is a proper book.  That is not so. For example, if a churchman said to me:&ldquo;They have banned so and so and I do not think they ought,&rdquo; I might be put in the position then of signing my name to a document asking that the decision should be reviewed.  It would not be my own opinion, and it is quite wrong to suggest that people who have asked for a review have already made up their minds that the book should not have been banned.</P>

      <P>Not exactly.  If you are going to have this right, although I do not approve of it, I think that five is a better number than seven or ten. Presumably, you are basing it on the notion that you want to extend the machinery of the administration of the Act to allow people other than the author and publisher to bring appeals. If so, you ought to trust the five members of the Dáil or Seanad.  I think five is a better number than ten.  I do not agree with Senator O'Donovan's scheme.  I have a higher opinion of members of the Dáil than he has.  I do not think the members of either House would seek to nullify the Act, and I do not think that has happened in any case.  If we are going to legislate for a situation when seven members of the Oireachtas are going to use their power to nullify the provisions of an Act of the Oireachtas, we might as well give up altogether.  If there is any case to be made, it is a case for a small number and I do not think the Minister is well advised to change it.</P>

      <P>I would like <Col N="1236" /> to support it on the lines of Senator Hayes.  On Sunday last I was hailed by an eminent ecclesiastic.  He said: &ldquo;I am just reading a magnificent book; you ought to read it,&rdquo; and he showed me the book.  I said: &ldquo;The first two volumes have already been censored.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;I suppose this will be censored too.  It is really a book which everyone ought to read.&rdquo;  The circumstances might be that a person, in whose judgment I had complete faith, might tell me that a book was a very good book and should not be censored and I might feel, relying on a judgment such as that, that it would be my business to put my name to an appeal of that kind.</P>
      <P>It is certainly not my intention to put my name to an appeal until I have read the book, but as Senator Hayes has pointed out it may not be always possible to read the book.  I think we should preserve the right for a substantial number of Senators or Deputies&mdash;I think five is a substantial number&mdash;on the advice of people whom they are entitled to trust, to bring an appeal such as this.  If you require ten they might not all know the same person and might not have the same knowledge of his character to be able to rely on the advice which he gave.</P>

On the assumption that it is members of the Oireachtas who should have this right, apart from the editor, author or publisher, I would very much prefer the number five to ten.  I think it is important to consider the reason for this or any other similar provision.  I think I would be correct in stating that if there was any other pre-eminent reason for the introduction of this Bill, other than the desire of the Minister not to be the censor, it was the desire to provide an appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>These were the two things and all other things are incidental. There seems to be more or less <Col N="1237" /> general agreement that if there is to be an appeal the author, editor or publisher should have that right.  That question does not, therefore, arise now but there is the further question: should there be any other method by which public opinion even of a sectional character, should be able to express itself to the extent of asking for the re-examination of a book?  The Minister indicated in the Dáil, and I think here, that there might be under certain circumstances an outside opinion, which would not necessarily be that of the author, editor or publisher which might wish to exercise the right to ask for a revision of a decision to ban a book.  I think in that respect the Minister is quite right.  Much though I dislike the provision, I prefer to see it there rather than restrict the right solely to the author, editor or publisher.  If the right of appeal is to be given to some members of the Oireachtas, it clearly ought not require the consent of a large number.  It looks now as if this provision is going to remain in the Bill and I can think of three possible grounds on which I might put my name to a request for an appeal.</P>
      <P>One would be that I had carefully read the book, and that, in my humble opinion, I believed that it should not have been censored.  The second reason would be that I had read the book, that I believed it to be a good book, but as I was not quite clear about some of the matter in it, I believed the decision should be open to review. The third instance in which I might put my name to a request for an appeal would be one in which I was approached by a person holding a responsible position, particularly if I felt that he represented a minority point of view.  If I felt that there was a minority point of view, which was a responsible point of view, I should not like to take the responsibility, even though I might disagree with it, of refusing to that minority the right to have a revision of the decision in regard to a book in which that minority was interested.  In that case I might not feel obliged to read the book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1238" /> For my part, the Church to which I belong has no bishops, but if I were approached by a bishop or by a person holding a similar position in another Church, who said to me: &ldquo;This is a book which my religious denomination feels has a certain value for our people and its circulation is to be prohibited here; will you help to have the decision in regard to it reviewed?&rdquo;, I would say: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  I would feel myself perfectly justified in doing that. Bearing that in mind, if there were some circumstances in which possibly there might be a conflict of opinion, I think the Minister might find it much more difficult to operate this provision if the number were changed to seven or ten.  Everybody knows that as regards the vast majority of books which are censored, there would be unanimity, and it is only in a comparatively small number of cases that this question will arise.  As for the suggestion of Senator O'Donovan that this provision is inviting members of the Oireachtas to defeat the operation of the Bill, because they disapprove of it, I think that is a most unworthy suggestion. I do not think a man who would stoop to that would be fit to be a member of this House.  For my part when legislation is passed against which possibly I may have voted, unless it be a matter of my individual personal conscience, I consider it to be my duty to support and obey that law, and I believe that is the position of every other member here.</P>

      <P>I hope the House will not ask for more than five members to act in this capacity.  I know that in many instances in which I have been pursuing the most commendable proposals, I found great difficulty in finding even one person to support me.  No fair-minded person would ever say that these proposals were not objective, free from any Party bias and in every way desirable.  I feel that even if I were to seek five members to support me I might find it very difficult to secure that support.  I feel that on any question connected with censorship I would find it very difficult indeed to get five Senators to support me, not to speak of getting ten.</P>

To me it seems it would be no different; therefore, I submit, the discussion is out of order.  We ought to give a reasonable opportunity to have an appeal in matters of this kind and I submit that five is a reasonable number but that ten would be an impossible number.  If Senator O'Donovan wants to dispose of the right of appeal altogether he will insist on ten, but I wonder why he should stop at ten?  Why should he not say 20, because his object evidently is to cut out the right of appeal?</P>

      <P>My views on this matter coincide fully with those of Senator Hayes.  I would much rather that members of the Oireachtas did not have the right to lodge appeals.  One thing that does occur to me is this: as I mentioned already, Senator Douglas and certain other Senators may feel that that is unfair to members of the Oireachtas.  I do not like the provision that members of the Oireachtas may lodge an appeal without being asked to pay the fee which other people are expected to pay.  This question of deciding whether an appeal should be made or should be supported is a very difficult one.</P>
      <P>We are expected to read the books. Very often we will be asked to read books in which we have no particular interest, or which we are not practically qualified to read.  Very often, having read a book, we will say: &ldquo;I cannot make up my mind.&rdquo;  I may be asked whether I am speaking from experience. For years I was a member of a public library committee. During those six years I suppose I must have been asked to read some hundreds of books&mdash;not exactly to censor them, but, to use the common word, to &ldquo;vet&rdquo; them.  To me it has always been a tremendous worry as to whether or not I should say: &ldquo;I do not think that is a suitable book.&rdquo; Even from the views of members of the House on many occasions here, it can be seen that the tendency is to give the other fellow the benefit of the doubt.  If you are in doubt you say: &ldquo;By all means let him have the benefit of the doubt.&rdquo;  If someone comes to you and says: &ldquo;I think this book ought to go before the appeal board,&rdquo; you read the book, although you are not really competent to read it, but you still are not able to make up your mind so your whole feeling is: &ldquo;Let him have the benefit of the doubt.&rdquo; Therefore, I can quite see that this provision would lead to chaos, not because members of the Oireachtas will be indifferent to their responsibilities, but rather because they will take them very seriously.  For that reason, I should rather see the provision cleared out of the Bill altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to five or ten, if I must make up <Col N="1242" /> my mind I am in favour of five as against ten.  I need not go into the reasons for that.  You can think of the Minister's difficulty presently, when he is going to appoint his Censorship Board and appeal board, in getting the right people, people of the right ability, to read and report to him on these books.  To expect that, in a general way, you can get a large body within the Oireachtas capable of performing the same functions is not within reason, in my opinion.</P>

      <P>I have listened to this debate with great attention, and from the speeches I have heard from every side of the House my feeling is that I ought to support Senator O'Donovan's amendment.  If the Minister cannot see his way to accept ten, then let it be seven, but five is too small a number out of two Houses numbering practically 200.  We have 198 members, and in my opinion five out of 198 is too small a number to deal with this very important matter.  If the Minister is satisfied with seven, I suppose we will accept it, but I am sorry it is not ten.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave us several explanations for his introduction of this novelty into the amending Bill.  The one of which I took particular note is that it is a safeguard against the Censorship Board.  I think that is enough to make the thing objectionable.  The Minister appoints five persons, and we have <Col N="1243" /> been assured here that, from the very fact that the Minister has selected them, they are deemed to be fit and proper persons, but yet he considers that there is a necessity to create a safeguard against them.  What form does the safeguard take?  Members of the Oireachtas, who, so far as I can learn from the debate, may not have read any of the books, and may not care a jot whether they are censored or not, are to be approached by constituents and persuaded to lodge an appeal.  That is the safeguard, if you please, for the due and proper censorship of books in this State.  I want to know whether they must read the book.  Senator Kingsmill Moore assures us that, in the circumstances, he would read it.  Senator Douglas says the same.  I think they will all want to read the book.  That being so, how are they to assure themselves that it is a fit and proper subject for appeal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, Sir, I state, with all respect, that there is a great confusion of thought about this whole matter.  I say that with all respect to the Minister, who, I know, is doing his best.  It is the border-line cases, as Senator Douglas calls them, about which an appeal will be really necessary.  As the Minister told the Dáil&mdash;and one member of the Dáil spoke in the same sense &mdash;there are certain books that speak for themselves: you have only to consider such a book casually to realise that it is obscene.  Such books, surely, are not going to be appealed on by members of the Oireachtas, at the solicitation of someone or another. Therefore, presumably, if all goes well &mdash;of course, I am speaking now on the assumption that my amendment will be rejected&mdash;if all goes well, what will happen?  The border-line cases will be the cases on account of which members of the Oireachtas will be approached, and these are the cases which, everybody is agreed, are of exceeding difficulty. They presented a problem for the Censorship Board which was set up for the express purpose of dealing with such books, and they will set up a problem for &ldquo;the five&rdquo; also, particularly in view of the pressure that, presumably, <Col N="1244" /> can be put on a member of the Oireachtas by someone who can move mountains of votes.  This means putting no responsibility upon five persons, no duty to observe certain requirements in the examination of the books.  Is it to be a spontaneous movement within the Oireachtas that certain members who are precluded from the reading of a prohibited book should move in the matter?  Then what the Minister is doing is passing his responsibility that he had before this Bill was introduced to the members of the House itself, and I previously pressed the argument of Senator Hayes that this is giving an administrative function to members of the Dáil and Seanad which they never dreamed would be imposed upon them and which it is not proper to impose upon them.  However, I am afraid that I am only beating the air.</P>

I do feel that there should be some body other than the author and publisher with the power to appeal, and what better body could there be than members of the Oireachtas?  I see that it is proposed that Bishops and other people will be allowed that right, but I think that the members of the Oireachtas are best suited to deal with an appeal, and I hope the House will allow the section to stand as it is and that it will refuse the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am in favour of the amendment for this reason: the author and publisher have a right of appeal, and I cannot understand who else could want to appeal except the author and publisher.  Senator Sir John Keane has a different view.  He says that public bodies may suit better and that an author might not like to have his name published in connection with an appeal, but in that case there would be no trouble in getting the publisher to serve notice of appeal.  If an author or publisher asked me to sign my name, as a member of this House, to a notice of appeal, I would say: &ldquo;No; go and appeal yourself.&rdquo;  I do not see any necessity to give this power to members of the Dáil or Seanad and for that reason I am in favour of deleting it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the amendment.  On the Second Reading I stated that we had no explanation from the Minister for Justice, when introducing this Bill in the Dáil, or from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who deputised for him in this House on the Second Reading, as to the reason why this provision was introduced.  The provision giving members of the Oireachtas power to appeal against the decision of the Censorship Board is an innovation in legislation.  I do not look upon this as to whether or not this right of appeal is a safeguard against the Censorship Board.  I regard it from the point of view of the Constitution, and from the point of view of the proper separation of the powers and proper functions of the two Houses of the <Col N="1248" /> Oireachtas and the members thereof. Members of the Dáil are elected to represent constituencies, as provided by the Constitution.  Members of the Seanad are intended to represent the different vocations, and they have their own special function, which is particularly the function to represent the views of other people in legislation only.  I think this right of appeal given to members of the Oireachtas may form a dangerous precedent.  If it does not form a precedent, then it stands alone and, in my submission, is without any proper justification.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows that there are hardships inflicted upon people by law. We are aware that income-tax inflicts hardships, that even the rationing of food, of gas or of electricity may impose hardships, but only the people aggrieved are entitled to appeal on law.  I cannot understand why members of the Oireachtas, who are not aggrieved by any decision of the Censorship Board, should be given this right of appeal.  It may be said that this is a matter of public importance, one in which members of the Oireachtas as public men should take an interest, but when the author and publishers of a book are given the right of appeal, in my submission, there is no case, as I stated on the Second Reading, for dragging members of the Oireachtas into it.  Therefore, I suggest that this amendment should be accepted by the House.  The Minister, no doubt for some good reason of his own, which, up to the present, he has not stated clearly, introduced this amendment into the Bill.  There may have been some pressure from some quarter for the introduction of this provision, but on its face, and as it stands in the Bill, there is no case for it.  I am not prepared to support a provision for which no case has been made by the Minister or by the other responsible authority sponsoring the Bill.  Therefore, I support the amendment of Senator Magennis, that the power of appeal given members of the Oireachtas against decisions of the Censorship Board should be deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seems to me to raise two questions.  The first <Col N="1249" /> one is, should there be anyone else other than the author, editor or publisher? If the amendment were carried, as the Bill stands there would be no one else.  It also raises the question whether, if there is to be somebody, members of the Oireachtas are the best people.  On these two questions I have a definite opinion.  I believe that there ought to be some responsible persons other than the author, the editor, or publishers, and I believe the Minister would be ill-advised to accept the amendment unless he provides an alternative. What that alternative should be will arise on the next amendment in my name.  I do not propose to repeat at this stage, though I may on the next amendment, the reasons why I do not think members of the Oireachtas are the best persons for this purpose.  I propose to deal with this matter from this point of view, whether there should be any person other than the author, editor or publishers, because that is the main principle involved.  Senator Ryan was quite clear about his views. He does not want anybody else, and it is there I join issue with him.  In that I disagree with him completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said in the debates that no case was made for an appeal by anybody else. I think a very good case was made, but I want to make it again.  I do not want to misrepresent the Senator, but his assumption was that nobody but the author, editor or publishers were interested in whether a book was allowed to be circulated in this country or not.  That is where I join issue with him.  I can easily conceive a book being printed outside this country which a number of people here would consider it highly desirable should be on sale and available, but the author, the editor, and the publishers might not care twopence whether anybody in Ireland ever saw it.  Senator Ryan's view is that if they do not care, why should anybody want to get it.  Senator Sir John Keane mentioned one case.  I do not want to discuss a particular book as that would be highly undesirable and not in order.  However, it is extremely important to realise that a case arose in the past where the circulation <Col N="1250" /> of a particular book was desired for circulation by responsible members of a Church.  Whether that book should or should not have been censored does not arise.  Persons in that responsible position should have some way by which they could ask for an appeal from, or for revision of, the decision in cases in which the author, editor and publisher may reside outside the country and have no interest in the circulation of the book here.  I entirely agree with the argument set forth by the Minister on the last stage and in the other House&mdash;that there should be some provision for an expression of opinion in cases where the author, editor and publisher are resident outside the country and are not interested in the fate of the book here and in which responsible people here think there is a case to be made.  I hope the Minister will not accept this amendment except he provides an alternative.  I should be in favour of the amendment if some suitable alternative were provided.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.  I regard the matter from a different angle from that of other Senators who have spoken.  I think that there will be something Gilbertian in the situation which will be created if this amendment be not accepted.  Here, we are, part of the Legislature.  If this Bill becomes law, it will become part of our legislation. With the retention of this paragraph, a number of legislators are to be the means of setting in motion machinery which will, if it succeeds, defeat the operations of a board set up by ourselves under our own legislation.</P>

If five members set in motion an appeal which succeeds, that appeal will have upset the deliberations of the body of men which the Bill sets up as competent to judge in this matter, after due consideration, on facts which will not be available to anybody else, save casually. The five members of the Oireachtas will be, as it were, the self-starter. They will be the means of setting an <Col N="1251" /> appeal in motion&mdash;an appeal directed against the board set up by the very legislation covered, in general terms, by this Bill.  Five legislators will be asked to set in motion machinery to disturb the considered decision of the Censorship Board set up under the Bill. I may be crazy about this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Coming down to the personal equation, I take part in passing an Act, and to-morrow I agree, at the solicitation of somebody who comes to me, to set in motion an appeal which will, in fact, disturb a decision of the Censorship Board set up to do a certain type of job.  There is something Gilbertian and ludicrous about that situation.  The only aggrieved people that should be regarded as having a right to appeal are the author, editor and publisher.  I am not at all impressed by the arguments about the rights and the interests of the public.  If any other person than those I have mentioned feels aggrieved, we must assume that that person has read the book or pamphlet concerning which he desires to appeal.  If he has had that pleasure or privilege, then he should have no grievance.  He must have read the publication of which he wants more widespread distribution.  I have given cause for humour to some of my fellow-Senators, but I have the courage to say what I think, and I think that the Seanad would be wise to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>The proposition put forward by Senator Summerfield appears to me to be so ludicrous as to deserve, at least, some comment.  During the past few months persons have been sitting in Dublin Castle hearing appeals against income-tax assessments&mdash;probably, from Senator Summerfield and others.  According to his argument, the assessment of the inspector of taxes should always be accepted and there should be no right of appeal to the special commissioners.</P>

      <P>According to the Senator, when the Appropriation Bill comes up, we ought not to pass the salaries of the judges of the Supreme Court, the High Court or the Circuit Court because the District Court should be good enough for every purpose. That is the only logical deduction from what the Senator has said&mdash; that we should cut away appeals in every case.  If you provide for an appeal in one type of legislation, you are equally entitled to provide for it in another type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Summerfield must misapprehend the meaning of this Bill.  It is not a Bill for the purpose of censoring books.  It is a Bill for the purpose of providing a Censorship Board which will consider books and if, within the terms of the Act, it considers the books should be censored, will censor them.  That is quite a different thing from what the Senator has, evidently, in mind.  The Minister has provided in this amending Bill an appeal board.  To my mind, it has become an unmanageable appeal board, because it consists of five members. But that is beside the present question. The Minister provides an appeal board.  If you say that, by putting the machinery of appeal into operation, you will defeat the operation of the Bill, you say something which is contrary to common sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no great enthusiasm for the idea of legislators having this right of appeal, but to set an appeal in motion does not defeat the Act.  It simply puts the Act into operation. The two fundamental things in this Bill are: (1) the Minister disappears as the censoring authority, and (2) an appeal is provided.  If you provide a right of appeal, you should certainly give certain people power to lodge an appeal.  I think that the Senator is acting on the assumption that, when a man appears in court, he ought to be condemned and, if he is not condemned, that the ends of justice are defeated.  Manifestly, that is not the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> I do not understand at all why it should be assumed that if you put an appeal into motion, you defeat the objects of the Act.  The appeal board will consider the matter under the directions which they get in this Act. They will simply act in a legal way, within the terms of their mandate, and it is not open to anybody to say, whichever way they decide, that the ends of the Bill have been defeated.  I have stated already that, for myself, I do not by any means hanker after this power.  I feel that it will be an embarrassment and a nuisance to members of the Oireachtas to be put in a position in which they may be asked to set an appeal in motion.  But I do agree with Senator Douglas that if you are going to adopt this amendment without adopting any board as suggested in amendment No. 7 you are doing a very serious thing.  I think the machinery the Minister put into it should be left in it for the moment, or if it is taken out, some other machinery should be put in its place.</P>

      <P>Like many other Senators who have spoken.  I am in grave doubt as to whether we should leave this right to members of the Oireachtas to make the appeal. Remember the issue before us is not whether there should be an appeal or not.  That is decided.  We are agreed there must be an appeal.  The question is whether we should not widen the field of individuals or bodies who should have the right to lodge an appeal and to set the machinery in motion.  I am in doubt about it in this sense&mdash;I do not think it will work.  The members of the Oireachtas themselves will find it a burden which they would be sorry to take on had they known of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, I believe that the provision which enables members of the Oireachtas to lodge this appeal without paying any fee will cause them more embarrassment than they are bargaining for.  If publishers and editors think that individual members of the Seanad and Dáil can lodge the appeal without having to pay a fee these people will be approached more often than they will bargain for.</P>
      <P>At the same time, there is this to be said about it&mdash;in a matter like this one cannot be dogmatic or certain.  There are many things in legislation in respect of which you cannot find out whether you are right or wrong except by the principle of trial and error. When I am in doubt with regard to legislation, I never forget that it is the right of the Oireachtas always if it discovers that something it has already done is not working out in the way it was intended, to amend legislation. Again, if I am in doubt, I have to leave myself pretty much in the hands of the Minister since he is the person who has the responsibility for saying whether the thing is workable or will do what he wishes to have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, I am in doubt whether we should leave this power in the Bill, but since I am in doubt I am disposed to take the chance.  If we find out it does not work, and should abuses creep in, we should say we will take <Col N="1255" /> our courage in our hands and amend the law in such a way that the abuses can be checked.</P>

      <P>I oppose this not from the viewpoint of a jurist or a lawyer but as a plain man.  I cannot see, for the life of me, why the Opposition are grousing or why persons should act at all when already there is an appeal board.  Why clutter up the machinery any more than it is already?  That is my point.  It seems to me that Senator Magennis's proposition which I support, suggests that these words be deleted: &ldquo;or any five persons each of whom is a member of Dáil Éireann or of Seanad Éireann&rdquo;.  I cannot see why that provision should be inserted. I think it is unnecessary, futile and provocative in its essence.  Whether there is anything sinister in it I do not know.  I do not want to impute motives which may be unfounded.  It seems to be a matter of <i>quis custodiet ipsos custodes?</i>&mdash;who shall guard the guarddians? This kind of thing could be multiplied <i>ad infinitum.</i>  We could, indeed, have five persons after the appeal board itself who would rule on decisions of the board.  I think this proposal is unnecessary&mdash;more than unnecessary&mdash;and provocative.  There may be something behind it, but I cannot see the reason for it when it is obvious that it is so patently unnecessary. I have much pleasure in supporting Senator Magennis and I may say <i>en passant</i> that I hope he will press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I had two objects.  The first was to get rid of the thing myself. If it had gone on I would have resigned my position as Minister for Justice because I would not have it.  The other object was to take away any possible grievance among any section of the <Col N="1256" /> community.  I am still satisfied the proposal is a good one and I am not going to accept this amendment.  No Senator or Deputy is going to be forced by anybody and they ought to be quite capable of standing on their own feet and telling their constituents so.  Why should they move them for the sake of £5 which will not be forfeited at all if the board thinks the amendment is not frivolous?  Why should they make an appeal in a frivolous way when the editor or the author has the right to appeal?</P>
      <P>The case mentioned by Senator Douglas was the case I made in the Dáil and it might never occur, the case of a publisher or an author in a foreign country whose book was banned and who might say: &ldquo;I do not care. There are only a few people there anyway and I will not bother about them.&rdquo; There might be a section of our people, a small section, I admit, who would want to read such books and they would like to have the opinion of the appeal board on them.  This proposal would, therefore, cover the case where the author or publisher might not bother his head.  The principal reason for it was to try to make it as acceptable as possible and I have no other motive of any kind.  If the Seanad does not accept it I cannot help it, but I want that provision left in the Bill.</P>

      <P>He did not contradict me.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&ldquo;and I accept altogether the argument which he made though I do not accept everything he said.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now let me, with your permission, Sir, refer to the argument he put forward. I am quoting from column 1163 of Seanad Éireann Debates, Volume 30, No. 8.  If I do not begin at the beginning, I have no doubt he will complain that I am giving a garbled quotation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I quite agree that an author, an <Col N="1258" /> editor, and a publisher must have the right to appeal.  The question is whether there should be anybody else, and, if so, who?  I should imagine, although I have not heard him speak on the subject, that the Minister does not want everybody in Ireland to have the right to appeal, and, if so, I completely agree.  A possibly unworkable situation could be created on that basis but I do not like or approve of the proposal that the onus should be placed on five members of the Dáil and Seanad acting together and I want to give briefly my reasons&mdash;I gave some of them on the Second Reading, but the Minister was not here&mdash;for objecting. In the first place I do not think it fair to put the peculiar duty on members of the Oireachtas of being a kind of guardian of the correctness or otherwise of the operation of the censorship&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That does not square with what we have heard from the Senator just now.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And I should like the Minister to realise that whereas this will not be a matter of much importance to quite a large number of Deputies and Senators, there are a certain number who will naturally be appealed to by persons outside to exercise this duty. I may be a person who would be appealed to and frankly I am not going to ask for an appeal in respect of a book, unless I have read it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to spend time, which I might otherwise give to public work, reading Bills, etc., on reading books that people, who might be more or less my constituents, think I should read for the purpose of seeing whether they were possibly censored or not.  It would be worse if I were a member of the Dáil and had, as many members have, a number of constituents dissatisfied with censorship.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely that is speech in favour of my amendment?  I accepted it as such. Now this evening we had Senator Hayes.  Senator Hayes spoke against the five member idea on the ground, the very proper ground, that it was giving administrative duty to a member of the Dáil or Seanad who had <Col N="1259" /> legislative functions conferred upon him.  When Senator Summerfield put that point very forcibly, a point against what Senator Ryan calls in question as a novelty in legislation, Senator Hayes proceeds to argue against Senator Summerfield and objects to his saying the very thing which he himself had urged.  Surely it is not a deliberate Assembly where this sort of thing goes on?  It is more a mockery of a legislative Assembly than the reality. Now, as regards the Minister, I desire to speak with the utmost respect.</P>

      <P>Yes, if you like.  Footnotes are frequently provided to my speeches and as frequently I accept them.  There is a contrast because I know the Minister took a great deal of pains in this matter, as he himself has said, to try to make this legislation as free as possible from points of friction with some people who are really what we might call &ldquo;sore-heads.&rdquo;  There are sore-heads on censoring and many of them have spoken here.  I suggest with all respect that the Minister has not secured the result desired.  There is joy in the camp of those who wish to destroy censorship altogether, because of the introduction of this provision.  Senator O'Donovan has put his finger on that <Col N="1260" /> and I need not add anything.  It would probably weaken rather than strengthen his argument.  I appeal to the Minister to see on reflection that this is an unnecsary excrescence on his legislation.  It serves no useful purpose except perhaps that there may be publishers far, far away, beyond the reach of wireless, to whom there may be some passionate appeal on the part of an anti-censor advocate: &ldquo;For Heaven's sake, appeal against the Censorship Board condemnation of your book.&rdquo;  It might serve that purpose but what the Minister has forgotten is that he himself has power to do the very thing which he contends the introduction of the five-member idea is necessary to do.  He can grant a permit to anyone.  Let us suppose there is some book&mdash;and there might be some book&mdash;which for the general public is depraved in the last degree. There are some highbrows, intelligentsia who are sin-proof owing to their previous studies.  They might wish to read this book for some design of special studies.  All they have to do is to state their case and the Minister has power both under the Principal Act and this Bill, to give that permit.  He himself has it in his own power to remove that disability.  He adopts this roundabout way against which members of the Dáil have protested and members of the Seanad are protesting. I shall not occupy your time further, but I do mean to press this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, Section 8, sub-section (1), line 24, after the word &ldquo;order&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;issued by the Censorship Board&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As I explained on the Committee Stage, I wanted the insertion of the words &ldquo;issued by the Censorship Board&rdquo; so as to limit the application of appeal to the prohibition orders issued by a new board to be appointed after this Bill has become an Act.  I did so in the hope of drawing attention to the retrospective character of the section in which the words occur.  It is possible, in virtue of the section as a whole, to lodge an appeal against a prohibition order away back to the beginning of the Censorship Act of 1929&mdash;in other words, to 1930, when it first became operative.  Now, during all those years the same kind of thing that we heard this evening from Senator Sir John Keane resounded on public platforms or were read in the Press, in magazines, and what not in the way of publicity. These findings of the Board of Censorship in the past have been declaimed against, and here again to-night we had the very latest example; so that, no matter what the Minister does in the appointment of a judge as chairman of the board, it cannot be regarded as a fair appeal court because, steadily all through the years, for 15 years down to date, the contempt of court has been committed and permitted.  Unless the members of the appeal board have been living out of the country, it is impossible for them not to have heard some echoes of those partly underground rumblings as well as explosions of rage above ground.  It is against justice, I suggest, to call it a fair appeal in these circumstances.</P>
      <P>One of the points made all along in this campaign against censorship was that there was no appeal possible from the prohibition orders issued by an arbitrary and irresponsible board which condemned books.  I wonder, Sir, would it be in order for me to read an example of this, which is exactly on all-fours with that of Senator Sir John Keane's to-night.  I am about to read, if I have your permission, Sir, from the Dublin <i>Evening Mail</i> of Tuesday, February 15, 1944.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, Sir, but perhaps I may be in order in relating the fact that an abject apology was published by the directors <Col N="1263" /> of the <i>Evening Mail</i> by which they disclaimed all those things which Senator Sir John Keane alleges here to-night under shelter of privilege.  I hold that you cannot have a fair appeal against the past findings of the board, and, that being so, I object to the power being given to go back to 1930.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, here is my principal argument. It has been alleged that there was no appeal.  There was an appeal. The fact that there was an appeal is proved, and, as we say in philosophy, from the actual to the possible the transition is easy.  There was one appeal, I know.  I am informed that there were something like twelve.  I do not know whether that is correct or not, but at any rate I know of one, and that suffices to establish the existence of an appeal authority.  I do not bind myself to twelve, although my informant could be regarded as a very good authority. From 1930 downwards, in time, why did not these authors and publishers of these superb masterpieces amongst the &ldquo;masterpieces of the world&rdquo; lodge an appeal?  Why did they not call upon the Minister to exercise his powers under the Act of 1929 to raise the prohibition orders or to have them varied?  He could do either.  This is one of the facts of the principal Act, which is conveniently forgotten by critics of the Censorship Board&mdash;just as they forget the Minister's power to grant a permit to a reader who desires to read a prohibited book.  I regard it as a violation of justice to say that there was no appeal and give the right to the publisher and author and five members of the Oireachtas to lodge an appeal against those past findings.  I could very well imagine enemies of the country saying: &ldquo;How Irish to have your appeal authority in being, and for authors and publishers to disregard it and&mdash;not thinking it worth while to appeal&mdash;to have five members of the Oireachtas, acting in conjunction, to call for an appeal against these past prohibition orders!&rdquo; The Minister on the last occasion said that the books in most cases speak for themselves.  That was perfectly true.  I think that he described them as mostly rubbish, but as regards the others that are not rubbish <Col N="1264" /> I consider that I am entitled to presume that the authors and publishers did not think it worth while to appeal.  I argued this before and the result was naught.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In this amendment Senator Magennis wants to insert these words &ldquo;issued by the Censorship Board.&rdquo;  Prohibition Order is defined by this Bill in Section 1 to mean an Order made under Sections 7 or 9 of the Act.  Therefore, &ldquo;prohibition Order&rdquo; in Section 7 of the Act is an Order made by the Censorship Board and &ldquo;prohibition Order&rdquo; under Section 9 is an Order made by the Censorship Board.  Therefore the words in the amendment &ldquo;issued by the Censorship Board&rdquo; are totally unnecessary.  As far as this section is concerned, it only gives an appeal to the Censorship Appeal Board from an Order made by the Censorship Board, and comes into force by virtue of this Bill.  The appeal will be from an Order to be made in future under Section 7 or Section 9 of the Act when it is an Act.  I submit that this amendment is unnecessary, because the Act has already made provision for it by the definition of &ldquo;prohibition Order&rdquo; in Section 1 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point made by Senator Ryan might be an extremely important one, so important that we should adjourn this matter, if there is any doubt&mdash;and I think there is&mdash;until next week or until after Christmas.  The Minister's object, as set out, was to allay dissatisfaction with regard to certain books felt by persons who thought that there should be a revision.  I need not repeat the words of the Minister, but his object will be completely defeated if Senator Ryan's views are correct.  After listening to Senator Ryan I am inclined to <Col N="1265" /> think that his views may be right, but he will appreciate that it is difficult to say immediately that I agree with him. The matter is of importance, and if there is a doubt, I suggest that it should be carefully examined and, if necessary, we might postpone this stage.  The Minister probably believes that the period for appeal against a prohibition Order made by him in the past, on the advice of the Censorship Board, is limited to 12 months.  I do not believe there will be more than a few books in dispute.  I think his object would be defeated if we were to allow the Bill to pass with no provision for appeal or for revision dealing with books about which there has been controversy. The Minister knows that as well as I do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to oppose the view of my colleague, Senator Ryan, but I entirely support the suggestion that the Bill will have to be recommitted.  In my casual reading of the Bill, reinforced by the remarks of Senator Ryan, I think Section 15 (1) (b) would be adequate to provide for appeal in the case of books which had already fallen under the ban of the old Act.  I am still inclined to that opinion.  If Senator Ryan has considered the question and if there is a difference of opinion, or any doubt, the Bill should be recommitted so that I should have an opportunity of discussing it with Senator Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring merely to prohibition Orders.  I have not considered Section 15 fully.  It appears to me there is no appeal against past Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that any book banned up to date is considered to be a book banned under Section 15. I am advised about that by the draftsman; and there does not appear to be any doubt about it.  That is as it ought to be.  I am not saying that any book banned under the old Act ought not to be banned.  There was no question about that.  The right of appeal in that case ought to be there.  As to members of the board not being present, the same applies there as in the other case.  A book will be there to be judged as a book.  Whether people say <Col N="1266" /> that certain books should be banned or not remains to been seen after the appeal board has a chance of reviewing the whole matter.  I am perfectly satisfied&mdash;and I am sure Senator Magennis is&mdash;that Section 15 provides for an appeal for any book.  Any book banned becomes a book banned automatically under this Act when it is passed.  I am not prepared to rule that out.  If people consider that something objectionable was done let that be dealt with by the appeal board.  I imagine the reason more people did not appeal under the 1929 Act was that they felt they would be appealing to the Minister and that there was no good appealing to the same person who censored the book.  That is the reason there were not more appeals. It is only fair, if there is any question in that respect in people's minds, that the matter should be reviewed by the appeal board.  The right of appeal stands.</P>

For books banned under the existing Act, the period would be 12 months from the operative date, and, for any other books, 12 months from the time of the banning.  That is all the difference such an amendment would make, and I do not think that there is any necessity for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I looked up this matter during the interval.  As a layman, I am inclined to think that it will not work out as Senator Ryan fears.  The provision is probably right, but it is a rather clumsy way of dealing with it.  What is bothering me is the situation which would arise if Senator Ryan, who is an experienced lawyer, should turn out to be right.  If the appeal board were to decline to take any books prior to that date, there would be no remedy save by way of mandamus, the onus for the cost of which would be on the author.  Unless a wealthy author, such as G.B.S., could be found to spend the money in contesting the question, as a matter of principle, we might find that there was no way of remedying the position. For that reason, I suggest that we might agree to take the remainder of the amendments and then adjourn the present stage until to-morrow or, if necessary, until next year, on the understanding that, if postponed to next year, we would take the Final Stage on the same day.  I think the matter requires more careful examination than can be given it now.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a measure to consolidate and amend the whole of the existing law relating to rent restriction which is at present contained, partly, in the series of Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts commencing with the 1923 Act and, partly, in Emergency Powers (No. 313) Order, 1944, as modified by the amending Order made this year.  It may, therefore, be of assistance to Senators if at the outset I review briefly, as I did on the corresponding stage in the Dáil, the history of rent restriction as embodied in these various enactments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1923, was, like the Act it replaced&mdash;the British Act of 1920&mdash;expressed to be a temporary measure with a limit of three years on its period of operation.  It continued the application of control to pre-1919 built premises with a poor <Col N="1271" /> law valuation not exceeding, in Dublin, £60, and, elsewhere, £40. Houses built after the 2nd April, 1919, and flats newly constructed after that date were exempt from control.  The Act passed in 1926 had as its purpose the prolongation of control for a further period of three years during which decontrol would be gradually effected by a reduction year by year of the poor law valuation limits of control until complete decontrol was achieved in 1929.  The expectation that control would be completely dispensed with by the year 1929 was not realised, and, in fact, the process of decontrol which the 1926 Act had introduced was arrested by a further Act passed in 1928, by which time the poor law valuation limits of control had been reduced to £30 in Dublin and £25 elsewhere.  This continued to be the position until early in 1944 when the stress of emergency conditions made it necessary to consider the question of extending rent control to a wider range of premises.  This was done by Emergency Powers (No. 313) Order, 1944, under which premises with a poor law valuation not exceeding £60 in Dublin and Dun Laoghaire and £40 elsewhere were brought under control Thus rent restrictions were applied for the first time to houses built after 1919. Under an amending Order which was made this year, premises erected after or in course of erection on the 8th February, 1944, and premises reconstructed into flats since that date were exempted from the scope of the original Order.  Broadly speaking, the present position is that rent control applies to all existing premises of a poor law valuation not exceeding £60 in Dublin and £40 elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Except for the fact that different standards are provided for the determination of the lawful rent, there is no essential difference between the control imposed by the Acts and that imposed by the Emergency Powers Orders.  Under the 1923 Act rents are restricted by reference to the 1914 level of rents while under the Order the 1941 level provides the basis.</P>
    <P>Before I go on to deal with the Bill itself, I should, perhaps, refer to the <Col N="1272" /> Reports of the Town Tenants (Occupation Tenancies) Tribunal.  This tribunal was set up under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Black in 1936 following the passing of resolutions by the Dáil and Seanad.  The tribunal, after a long and painstaking examination of the problem, presented separate and conflicting reports early in 1941. Even though the reports revealed wide differences of views on fundamentals, the tribunal's careful and detailed examination of the existing Rent Acts and the suggestions made for their improvement have been of considerable assistance to us in the preparation of the measure that is now before the House.</P>
    <P>Senators will probably recall that when this Bill was first circulated, there was circulated with it an explanatory memorandum.  During its passage through the Dáil the Bill has been fairly extensively amended&mdash;especially Part III, which contains the new and special provisions for the relief of poorer classes of tenants.  Accordingly, in some respects the explanatory memorandum no longer correctly represents the provisions of the Bill.  If for no other reason but this, it is probably desirable that I should endeavour to explain, as briefly as I can, the Bill's more important and complex features.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to repeal in their entirety all the existing Rent Acts and to re-enact, with certain amendments and improvements in form and drafting, almost all the provisions of these Acts.  The Bill also incorporates the Emergency Powers Orders which will be revoked as soon as the Bill becomes law.  Thus the whole rent restriction code will be contained in a single Act which will obviously be of considerable advantage to everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Bill proposes to continue the control of pre-1919 houses that are at present controlled by the 1923 Act, one important change proposed is that embodied in the attempt which Chapter 1 of Part II makes to dispense with the need for the production of evidence of actual 1914 rents or of estimated 1914 letting values.  The need for some amendment of the law in this regard must be self-evident. It is hardly necessary for me to stress the difficulty of producing <Col N="1273" /> reliable evidence, after the lapse of more than 30 years, of the rent that was paid in 1914.  It is clearly desirable, therefore, that we should endeavour to frame provisions which will make it unnecessary to go back to 1914 in order to get the evidence essential for the determination of the lawful rent.  It is important, however, to remember that there are many cases in which the lawful rents have been settled on the basis of the existing law, either as the result of court proceedings or by agreement between the parties where the 1914 rent was known. Senators will, I am sure, agree that it would be most undesirable that any such settled cases should be disturbed. To do so would serve only to create uncertainty and to open up possibilities of quite unnecessary disputes and litigation.</P>
    <P>The only feasible way by which the objects we had in view could be achieved was by preserving the 1914 standard as the fundamental basis for determining the lawful rents in these cases while, at the same time, so framing our provisions that it would be unnecessary to produce evidence of actual 1914 lettings.  This we did by dividing all 1923 Act controlled premises into two categories.  First, we took those premises the standard rents of which have been determined by the court under the 1923 Act and the amounts of which are known.  In these cases, Section 8 of the Bill provides that the basic rent shall be the sum of the standard rent and the increase thereon of 20 or 25 per cent. permitted under the 1923 Act according as the premises are a dwelling or a business premises.  Section 8 embraces all those cases in which the standard rent, having been determined by the court, is now a matter of official record and, therefore, easily and readily ascertainable.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil, the scope of Section 8 was widened so as to embrace cases in which the standard rent had been the subject of arbitration proceedings. This was done primarily in order to cover the case of one large Dublin company which has, for many years, played a prominent part in the housing of the working-class section of the people at very reasonable rents.  I <Col N="1274" /> should, perhaps, avail myself of this opportunity to make it clear that no special privilege is being accorded to this company.  Their houses remain subject to control as they always have been under the 1923 Act, but, instead of having the basic rents determined by the court under Section 9, the basic rents will be settled under Section 8, without recourse to the courts, by reference to the actual 1914 rents of which there are complete records available.  The rents of the company's houses were the subject of an arbitration award by an arbitrator appointed by the Minister for Home Affairs of Dáil Eireann&mdash;I think it was in 1920&mdash;and, in a sense, therefore, the case is on a par with those cases in which standard rents were settled by the courts in proceedings under the 1923 Act.</P>
    <P>The second category of 1923 Act cases comprises all cases in which the standard rent has not been determined by the court or as the result of arbitration proceedings.  In these cases, under Section 9 of the Bill, the basic rent must be determined by the court as the amount which the court considers to be reasonable having regard to the basic rents of other 1923 Act controlled premises.  At the outset basic rents for comparison purposes will have to be found entirely from within the category of Section 8 cases. In that connection I might mention that the intention is to have prepared registers of standard rents already determined by the courts.  To these registers will be added, from time to time, particulars of basic rents determined under the new Act and, in this way, a record of standard and basic rents will become available which should be of considerable assistance to landlords and tenants and also to the courts.</P>
    <P>It may be said, in criticism of the scheme embodied in Chapter I of Part II of the Bill that, since there will probably be many cases coming within Section 9, in which the parties have been able, on the basis of the known 1914 rent, to settle the lawful rents between themselves without recourse to the courts, the effect of the new provisions will be to render such <Col N="1275" /> cases liable to be made the subject of litigation under Section 9.  It is true that theoretically these cases would be liable to be reopened under Section 9.  In practice this is most unlikely to happen.  The basic rents of the premises by reference to which the rent of a house in such a case would have to be determined under Section 9 are themselves determined by reference to 1914 rents. It would, therefore, be a foolhardy tenant or landlord who would resort to court proceedings in order to try to upset a rent arrived at on the basis of the known 1914 rent, and agreed upon as the rent lawfully permitted under the 1923 Act.</P>
    <P>Chapter 2 of Part II re-enacts the provisions of Emergency Powers (No. 313) Order, as amended by the recent Order, governing the fixing of lawful rents for premises to which Chapter 2 applies, these being the premises at present controlled under the Emergency Powers Order.  The basis for the determination of the lawful rent in these cases is the rent passing on the 7th May, 1941, or, if the premises were not let on that date, the rent at which they were last let during the previous five years.  This follows the scheme for the 1923 Act, but with 1941 rents furnishing the standard, it is free from the objections that can be urged against the continued application of the 1923 Act provisions to premises controlled under that Act.</P>
    <P>The provision of two different standards for the determination of the lawful rent, each applicable to distinct categories of premises, made it necessary to consider the position of premises that might, by reason of a change in the rateable valuation, slip from one category into another.  For example, a pre-1919 built house of £29 poor law valuation would be subject to control under Chapter 1 of Part II.  If, on a revaluation, the poor law valuation were raised to £31, it would come within Chapter 2 control.  The converse case of a reduction in the poor law valuation bringing a house from Chapter 2 control into Chapter 1 control might occur, although perhaps more rarely.  The point is of importance <Col N="1276" /> to both landlords and tenants since, in one case, the change might mean a substantial increase of rent for the tenant and, in the other, a substantial reduction for the landlord.  I feel that a change in rateable valuation should not, in itself, operate to effect either an increase or reduction in the rent. Variations of the basic rent, if permitted during the period of control, could only lead to uncertainty and doubt, and might well operate harshly and unjustly against genuine buyers for value of controlled premises. Accordingly, the Bill provides&mdash;the relevant provisions are Section 7 (2) (b) and Section 10&mdash;that Chapter 1 controlled premises will remain subject to Chapter 1 control even though an increase in the rateable valuation may have taken place which would otherwise have taken the premises into Chapter 2, and, in the converse case, premises will remain subject to Chapter 2 control despite a decrease in the rateable valuation.  I think that this is the best solution.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill provides the one really novel feature of the measure as compared with the existing legislation and, possibly for this reason, has excited more interest and discussion than any of the other provisions of the Bill.  Part III puts at the disposal of poorer classes of tenants a cheap, simple and expeditious means of having their rents reviewed by the courts and, where they are too high, having them reduced to the lawfully permitted limit.</P>
    <P>Views may differ as to the need for special provisions on the lines of Part III of this Bill.  For my own part, I believe that such provisions are necessary, although I am not prepared to go so far as to agree with the statements that have been made that we shall have mile-long queues of tenants waiting at the Dublin District Court to apply for provisional orders.  The problem of how the Rent Act code could be made a really effective instrument of relief for the class of tenants who needed protection most was discussed at some length in the Agreed Report of the Town Tenants' Tribunal.  There we find it stated, as the considered and unanimous view of the tribunal, that, by <Col N="1277" /> reason of the usually tedious, troublesome and complex nature of Rent Act cases, &ldquo;so far as many of the poorer tenants are concerned, that is to say those who need the Rent Acts most, this great remedial code is a dead letter.&rdquo;  There can, I think, be little doubt that, through poverty or ignorance of the law, or because of a reluctance or inability to institute legal proceedings with their attendant formalities, many tenants fail to secure for themselves the relief which the law provides for them.  The conclusions of the tribunal in this regard are, I believe, borne out by the experience of social workers who move among the poorer sections of the people.</P>
    <P>The tribunal's proposal for the appointment of special officers with specified functions as a solution of the problem was carefully examined and it was only after the fullest consideration that it was decided not to act on it. It was felt that to interpose between the tenant and the court an officer with powers to conduct a kind of preliminary investigation of the case would only make for more protracted proceedings and would, in the long run, defeat its own purpose.  This would certainly be so in the case where the landlord proved &ldquo;difficult&rdquo;&mdash;the very kind of case in which the tenant would be most in need of relief.  It seemed to us after a careful examination of the whole question that the best and most practical solution would be to secure for the tenant a cheap and informal means of access to the court and prompt adjudication there upon his claim for relief.  Under such a scheme it might be hoped that tenants would not be deterred by the cost and formalities that court proceedings normally involve.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Part III of the Bill have been designed to achieve this object.  It is hardly necessary for me to discuss these provisions in detail at this stage.  Senators have, I am sure, by now become acquainted with their general scope and purpose. I would like merely to mention at this stage that, while the framework of the scheme as originally embodied in the Bill has been retained, it has been <Col N="1278" /> extensively amended in its details during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil.  There was general agreement in the Dáil&mdash;and when we come to consider the Bill in Committee, this House will, I am sure, also agree&mdash;that Part III has been considerably improved as the result of the amendments made in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I feel that I should not take up the time of the House in explaining the remaining provisions of the Bill as these can, I suggest, be more usefully and conveniently discussed on Committee Stage.  If there are any particular provisions as regards which Senators may desire information at this stage, I shall try to deal with them when I come to reply to the debate.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I would like to say a few words on the subject of rent restriction generally and the effect which it is likely to have on the building of houses for letting.  I can hardly conceive that at this juncture anybody could be found seriously to suggest that rent control could be dispensed with now or in the near future.  For 30 years a large number of tenants have enjoyed protection under the existing Rent Acts against arbitrary increases of rent and the threat of ejectment if such increases were not paid.  If such control were to be removed or even modified to any appreciable extent, I have no doubt that the result would be demands for increased rents and ejectments with all the hardships and dislocation that this would entail for many people.</P>
    <P>So far from it being possible to remove or modify the control under the 1923 Act, it was found necessary, as Senators are aware, less than two years ago, to extend control to a large range of houses not previously controlled, including houses built since 1919.  I may say, in this connection, that the Government took that very serious step only after they had fully satisfied themselves that the circumstances warranted it.  Numerous cases, not merely in Dublin but in other parts of the country, were brought to notice in which landlords were endeavouring to take advantage of the exceptional scarcity conditions in the matter of housing accommodation to exact increased <Col N="1279" /> rents from their tenants.  In some cases tenants were ejected or threatened with ejection merely in order that the landlord might be in a position to re-let at a much increased rent.  It was in these circumstances that the Government made Emergency Powers (No. 313) Order, 1944.  The Bill, as I have already explained, proposes to continue for a period of five years the control at present imposed by the Emergency Powers Order and, of course, the control under the 1923 Act also.</P>
    <P>Since the 1944 Order was made, it has been amended by an Order made this year so as to exclude from control houses erected after, or in course of erection, on the 8th February, 1944, and houses reconstructed into separate, self-contained flats after that date.  This exemption was incorporated in the Bill as originally introduced and, during the Bill's passage through the Dáil, the position was made even more favourable from the point of view of the builder of new houses by the amendment which substituted the date, 7th May, 1941 for the date 8th February, 1944, in the exemption clause.</P>
    <P>I have referred in detail to this exemption from control of newly-built houses and houses newly reconstructed into flats because I think that there is a tendency in some quarters to minimise or under-estimate the value and importance of the exemption from the point of view of the speculative builder.  I have, on the other hand, no desire to exaggerate its significance, and I certainly would not try to argue that rent control, even with an exemption in favour of new building, does not exercise some adverse effect on the building by private enterprise of houses to let.  I am afraid that that situation will just have to be accepted, because I see no prospect of our being able to dispense with control for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>I would submit, however, that in providing for the complete exemption from control of all new building, we are holding out a valuable inducement to private enterprise to embark on the <Col N="1280" /> provision of those houses for letting for which there is such a real need at the present time.  The point will, of course, be made&mdash;it is too obvious to be overlooked&mdash;that the 1923 Act contained a similar clause exempting from control post-1919-built houses and that, despite this, these houses have now been controlled.  I do not think that this really affects the validity of my argument.  It is true that houses built between 1919 and 1941 have been brought under control, but the fact must not be overlooked that the rents of these houses are controlled on the basis of 1941 levels of rent.  Will anybody seriously suggest that the investor who put his money into the building of houses between 1919 and 1941 is being treated unfairly or unjustly in being restricted now to the rent which he was able to get in the open market in 1941?</P>
    <P>I think that the immunity from control which the 1923 Act accorded to post-1919-built houses was, on any reasonable view, an immunity merely from control based on 1914 standards, which was the keynote of the 1923 Act. It could, in no sense, have been construed as a pledge of immunity for all time.  To treat it as such would have been to fetter all future Governments and Legislatures in a way which, obviously, could never have been intended. Similarly, the exemption from control provided for in paragraphs (b) and (c) of Section 3 (2) of the present Bill cannot, and should not, be treated as a guarantee that houses built after 1941 may not at some future date be brought under control, if, unfortunately, the Government and Legislature of the day should find it necessary to do so.  The value of the exemption for the investor or builder lies, I submit, in the fact that it provides a reasonable assurance that, if the houses in which they have invested their money are brought under control, the rents which may be charged will be determined by reference to an up-to-date standard which will take full account of the increased costs at which the houses have been erected.  There is no reason to assume that the Government or Legislature of 20 or 25 years hence, if, as I have just said, the need should then unfortunately arise <Col N="1281" /> for an extension of rent control, will be any less concerned to see that landlords are treated equitably than was the present Government two years ago when they introduced Emergency Powers (No. 313) Order.</P>
    <P>I am quite aware, of course, that restrictions on the rent do not constitute the sole burden of the landlord's or property owner's complaint against rent control.  There are also other restrictions such, for example, as those on the landlord's right to recover possession.  I would point out, however, that these further restrictions are an essential feature of any effective scheme of rent control and, provided that the landlord is allowed to charge a rent that is reasonable and fair to him, these restrictions do not, in my view, afford a very genuine ground of complaint.</P>
    <P>Taking everything into consideration, I would suggest that any reasonable person thinking of investing money in the building of houses has no real grounds for fearing rent control. If, of course, he is the type of person who would not scruple to take advantage of serious emergency conditions to exact an exorbitant and profiteering rent, then he has something to fear from rent control, and I have little doubt that the House will agree that rent control would at any time amply justify itself if it curbed or prevented attempts by individuals of that kind at unscrupulous exploitation of the dire needs of the house-hunting public.</P>
    <P>I have dwelt so much on that aspect of the matter, Sir, because I think an attempt has been made to misrepresent what has been done here.  That, probably, will be dealt with during the course of the debate on the Bill, but that is my explanation for dealing so fully with the effect of rent restrictions on future building.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a Bill that it is somewhat hard to speak about on Second Reading, because it is very much more a Bill for consideration in Committee than now.  At the same time, it has somewhat amused me to throw my mind back a great many years.  I think it was 16 or 17 years ago that I remember the Minister <Col N="1282" /> and his Party coming to a debate in the Dáil and saying that at that time there was the very greatest urgency for a Bill of this nature.  We travelled along from that date to 1936. In 1936 a commission was appointed, and that commission, as the Minister has stated, reported early in January, 1941.</P>
      <P>We have now travelled almost five years from that date, and I think that one would have been entitled to assume, after that period&mdash;16 or 17 years from the very beginning, and nine years from the date on which the commission was appointed&mdash;that when the Minister came to give us a Bill to-day it would have been one which he could safely regard as a monument &mdash;almost that he could say, in the words of the only Latin tag that I can ever remember: &ldquo;<i>Exegi monumentum aere perennius,&rdquo;</i> but I am afraid that this Bill falls very short of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, with the exception of Part III, as the Minister says, has nothing novel in it.  With the exception of Part III, the Bill may very properly be described as yet another example of the stand-still policy of the present Government because it is, in effect, a stand-still Bill.  While all of us agree that in the circumstances in which we are to-day rent control of some sort or kind is absolutely necessary, I do think that it is desirable that we should look at the matter quite frankly and seriously from the point of view of the principles involved. Let us admit frankly what it is: that rent control is in effect an additional taxation appointed to be borne by a particular class.  It is a taxation which must be borne by the owners of houses so that tenants may have their cost of living cheapened. Now, I think that it is absolutely essential that we should have some form of control of that sort at the present time, and I do not want to be taken as being in any way against control, but I do think that it is only right and fair that we should at the same time frankly admit what we are doing, and that is that we are imposing additional taxation on a particular class.  So far as control is concerned, <Col N="1283" /> during a period of war or of post-war stringency, if we consider it from the angle that we are preventing profiteering, preventing something that is anti-social and that should be attacked and controlled with the utmost rigour, it is perhaps unfortunate that not only in this one respect, but in other respects also, the same control of other kinds of profiteering, which anyone moving about the City of Dublin can see has happened, has not been introduced.</P>
    <P>The whole basis of any rent restriction must be that we are controlling something of which there is a monopoly, or rather controlling the exploitation of a monopoly, and while it is absolutely necessary to control it I do think that it would be better if we took the frank line of admitting that in so doing we are imposing additional&mdash;necessarily additional&mdash;taxation on a particular class.</P>
    <P>So far as the individual clauses of the Bill itself are concerned, I am afraid that I find myself very disappointed. I find myself disappointed in that the Minister has not taken into account many of the matters which were referred to in the agreed report of all the members of the tribunal, and has not taken into account some of the matters referred to in individual reports in separate instances.</P>
    <P>If I may go into a little detail without trespassing on the Committee Stage, in respect of the allowance for repairs, the Minister has made a very great mistake.  In the words of the tribunal, if the 10 per cent. and 5 per cent. addition for repairs was not excessive in 1923, it seems manifest that it would not be adequate now, yet the Minister has reduced the percentage to 8½ per cent. and 4¼ per cent., respectively.  It is not so much on the question of the exact percentage that I wish to speak. If you only provide a fixed percentage for repairs, you are going to give, so to speak, a bonus to those who do the least they possibly can do.  I know there is a provision, where a tenant finds that premises have been let get into such a hopeless state of repair, that he has certain remedies.  I am not thinking of that case.  I am thinking <Col N="1284" /> of a case where a person who owns a house wants to keep it in good repair and would like to spend more on it. In that case there should be a provision that a court would have a discretion to deal with it.  That was referred to at some length in one of the reports of the tribunal.  It would mean in the long run, that the premises of good landlords&mdash;and it is only the premises of good landlords in which I am interested&mdash;would be kept in better condition.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of legislation for individual cases.  We all know the saying, &ldquo;Hard cases make bad law&rdquo;, but there is a particular type of case which is deserving of consideration. I happen to know of one particular instance where a landlord owns a great deal of property, which is practically all occupation property. That landlord has had the property since 1914, and has never in any single case increased the rent for any of the occupants under the 1923 Act or otherwise. He never added anything on, though he was perfectly entitled to do so, so long as the individual tenant or family who was there remained.  When a tenant goes out, or if there is a reletting to a new tenant, in that case he does increase the rent to the permitted rent under existing legislation, but he never increased the rents of existing tenants.  Under the provisions of this Bill it means that he is going to be tied to the 1941 level, though it may have been a rent which he was allowing the family of a person who remained on for many years to pay, because it was outside the previous level. I know of other cases where a man has a house, whose daughter or son were going to get married, and who let it to one of his own family or in-laws at a reduced rent.  In a case like that, it appears to me that when that particular premises come back into the open letting market, so to speak, there should be some provision by virtue of which a court could deal with it in a discretionary manner.</P>
    <P>I mention it now so that the Minister may take a note of it, as it is a little bit more complicated for a private person to deal with.  It is absolutely essential, if the register and so forth <Col N="1285" /> are to be kept effectively, that there should be implied, in every contract for sale of a controlled house, a provision that the vendor would have to furnish to the purchaser any information in his possession as regards the rent, if under the 1923 Act as regards the rent in 1914, or if outside the 1923 Act as regards the rent charged in 1941.  It would appear to me that that is absolutely essential if we are not to have more and more confusion as property changes hands.</P>
    <P>As far as Part III is concerned, I am afraid that I take the view that it will result in a bottle-neck; that the provisions will be more cumbersome in the end, and that it would have been far better to provide the type of official envisaged in the report.  It will be found that the ordinary tenant will not go and make his case in the way the Minister envisages to the District Court clerk.  It will be found that he will labour in ignorance of his rights. I am in entire agreement with the report and with the Minister that, amongst the poorer classes of tenant which we solicitors meet, there is great ignorance of what their rights are.  It would be much more desirable to appoint some official who would in a very short time be able to deal with the whole problem in the slum areas, because that is what this is concerned with.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to three other small points.  I do not know whether the Minister felt that this was the correct Bill in which to introduce it, but it appears to me now, at the end of the emergency, when we hope there is going to be a period of building, that something should be done to ensure that the houses are not going to be jerry-built like some of those built 10 years before the emergency.  Solicitors in Dublin can tell the Minister that time and again they come across cases where people put their savings into buying houses and, having done so, after a year cracks appeared in the main walls, and in many cases expenditure was necessary, while in some cases the buildings could not be properly repaired on account of being structurally unsound.  The warranty implied in the Act does not go far enough. <Col N="1286" /> There will have to be some stringent legislation before the building of houses gets on the way by speculative builders, who did not understand their job, in order to ensure that people will be protected from that type of jerry-built speculation.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Minister did not include in the Bill a provision to cover attempts to contract out of the measure by a system of hire-purchase. So far as I can see&mdash;I speak subject to correction&mdash;there is nothing to prevent my saying, if I own a house the rent of which is £26 a year: &ldquo;I shall not set the house but I shall sell it on an instalment basis,&rdquo; which, in fact, may mean that the person going in will have to pay a rent of £40 a year.  Provision against that was made in the legislation of Northern Ireland and I suggest that provision to prevent fraudulent contracting out of the Act should be made here.  Something must also be done in regard to the bogus flat.  I am not a bit happy about the definition in the Act.  Before the Bill passes, it is essential that we should get some better definition of the self-contained flat, some definition which will ensure that a person will not be able, merely by rigging up a small partition through which you could push your finger, to take the house out of the realms of control as envisaged in this Bill.  There have been far too many cases of that type in the City of Dublin.  We shall have to arrive at a more precise definition of &ldquo;self-contained flat&rdquo;.  It should be a separate dwelling within the four structural walls of a house and not merely one room here, another across the landing and another upstairs.  I had intended to speak for a somewhat longer time on the Bill but, having regard to the gruelling the Minister received on an earlier measure, I shall let him off lightly on this occasion.</P>

      <P>This Bill is an admission that there is something seriously wrong in regard to housing generally. Even the Minister has not been enthusiastic in relation to it.  On the contrary, he was apologetic.  He <Col N="1287" /> apologised, in the first place, for having to introduce a Rent Restrictions Bill and he wound up by apologising to the builders for referring to their profits.  I think that everybody will agree that rent restriction is not an ideal, social or economic solution for the problem with which we are dealing. The real solution is the provision of an adequate number of suitable houses to meet the needs of the community. No other solution will be satisfactory to the Minister, the builder or the occupier.</P>
      <P>Admittedly, if the Government is unable to provide, or induce others to provide, all the houses required, something must be done to prevent ramps and rackets in respect of a scarce commodity.  I have been looking at the report, presented this year, on housing in Dublin and it is a very illuminating document, although it refers only to Dublin.  It shows that, in 1938, to get rid of slums and basement dwellings, Dublin required 22,172 houses.  To deal with overcrowding&mdash; that is, overcrowding so-called in the report&mdash;would require 3,257 houses, so that in 1938 there was a shortage in Dublin of more than 25,000 houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How is that being met?  The number of houses erected by local authorities&mdash;Rathmines and Pembroke Councils are included with the Corporation &mdash;in the 17 years from 1922 to 1939 was, on the average, 766 per year.  Wastage alone accounted for 1,300 houses, so that, in that period of 17 years, only half the wastage was being made good. It is true that, following the enactment of the 1932 Housing Act, the number of houses built increased considerably. In the period between 1933 and 1939, the Corporation of Dublin provided, on the average, 1,273 houses per annum.  Private builders provided on the average, 1,175 houses per annum. That is, of course, the real crux&mdash;the inability, over a period of 20 years, to make any impression whatever on the housing deficiency in Dublin.  The same applies to Cork, Limerick and other large centres.  It is the explanation of this Bill and, obviously, it is a second-best attempt at solution.  It is really no solution of the problem, but <Col N="1288" /> the Bill has to be produced in the same way as the Minister for Supplies would issue an Order controlling the price of any other commodity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to occupy much time but, if one side is entitled to attack the principle of rent restriction, a Senator who thinks otherwise should be entitled to say why the Bill is before us, whether we approve of the principle or not.  This is not the first Rent Restrictions Bill. The first Rent Restrictions Bill was introduced in 1915.  There have been innumerable Rent Restrictions Bills of that type, but we have not made much headway with new ideas in relation to rent restrictions.  As a matter of fact, this Bill, in certain respects, is a reactionary departure from past enactments and from the existing law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, for instance, the provision which prescribes the datum line for restriction.  When the Bill was introduced the Minister provided that the Act would apply to every house erected or every house reconstructed prior to the 8th April, 1944.  For some mysterious reason he, on his own initiative, introduced proposals in the Dáil to exclude from the operations of the Act houses built between the 7th May, 1941, and the 8th February, 1944.  I have been endeavouring to <Col N="1289" /> find out why, and I discovered that one organisation which apparently has considerable influence with the Minister persuaded the Minister that it would be unfair to them if houses erected between 7th May, 1941, and the 8th February, 1944, were to be controlled at all.  They must have a free hand.</P>
    <P>But this is an organisation which had an issue of capital a couple of years ago offering the £1 shares for 26/- and it was well over-subscribed. Further, I might make this point that so long as there is no dead line in relation to control and that it is left to the court to decide what is a fair rent, there can be no argument whatever against continuing control not merely in respect of houses built before 1944 but in respect of all future houses having regard to the fact that the court will determine what is a fair rent.</P>
    <P>I might draw the attention of the Minister to legislation introduced in Britain quite recently.  Here is a <i>Daily Mail</i> comment on what they call &ldquo;Bevan's Bill.&rdquo;  This is the statement:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Local authorities are to be given powers to fix for four years the maximum selling prices or rent of houses built under licence by private enterprise...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that actually in Great Britain, the Minister's opposite number is introducing legislation authorising local authorities to fix not merely the rent of houses yet to be built, but the prices at which they may be sold.  I think that is a very common sense practice and one entirely in conformity with the regulations applied by the Minister for Supplies during the whole of the emergency.</P>
    <P>I gathered from the statements made elsewhere that the Minister is of opinion that certain builders, building employers generally, are rather in the way of being public benefactors, getting a very small return on their outlay and a small return on expenditure on improvements, repairs and so on.  What is the experience of those who are in a position to judge the rate <Col N="1290" /> of profit earned in the building trade? I was speaking some time ago to a public official who had wide experience of house building and he mentioned to me the case of a firm which on average built 25 houses a year between 1933 and 1939, and he told me the net profit earned on that enterprise was £26,000.</P>
    <P>This is an official with wide experience of building by local authorities, and he informed me that in the case of a house which was constructed at a cost of, say, £900 or £950, between 1933 and 1939, the average profit would be £150 per house.  These are the people to whom the Minister apologises because he introduced this Bill. Now, let us see what control means under the Bill, because, let us bear this in mind, that the restrictions imposed in this Bill are more favourable to the landlord than the Order which will disappear when this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>On that point, I would like to refer to the White Paper which accompanied the Bill when it was originally tabled. The first paragraph of the White Paper says, referring to the Order:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These Orders will be revoked as soon as the Bill becomes law, but the control imposed by the Orders will be continued under the new Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, Sir, was the position when the Bill was introduced.  It is not so any longer and the present position is what I have already shown.  Let us take the case of a house to which Section 8 of the Bill applies.  This was a house erected before 1914.  The standard rent is known&mdash;in other words, the rent has been fixed by some tribunal or authority prior to the introduction of this Bill and I want to take the case of a house with which I am familiar. This house was erected in 1890, that is 55 years ago.  Some time early in 1914 it changed tenants.  The tenant then in occupation was paying £36, but some time prior to the 3rd August, 1914, a new tenant entered into possession at £40 a year.  That then became the standard rent in respect of that house. To that, the Bill authorises the addition of 20 per cent.  It authorises all the additions&mdash;I am not mentioning <Col N="1291" /> rates because in this case the tenant paid the rates&mdash;which means that the landlord is now entitled to get £77 15s. a year for the house, but he has already informed the present tenant that he intends to do some improvements.</P>
    <P>No doubt, the house will be a better house when the improvements are carried out, but he proposes to expend £150, out of which he will collect 8 per cent., adding another £12 yearly to the rent of the house, bringing it almost to £90 a year.  I want to draw attention to that fact that here is a house which in 1914 was let at £40. Under this Bill the rent will be £90. It is improved, no doubt.  It is so much improved, indeed, that while it cost the landlord £500 when originally constructed, its present market value, I am informed, is £1,500.  I have been checking up on the amounts paid in rent in respect of that house.  The total sum to date is £3,000.</P>
    <P>The selling value of the house is £1,500, and if you deduct what the house cost, and the amount expended on betterment, there is a clear margin of profit of £3,000.  Senators may question that, but there are very many cases similar to it, if Senators desire to investigate them, but if there were no such cases it is sufficient for me to show that this is possible under the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is a rather strange thing that when money is expended on the improvement of a house, this improvement is not always carried out for the benefit of the tenant.  It is very frequently carried out to improve the property in the interest of the landlord.  While the British Government permitted 6 per cent. in 1920, when the market value of money was 6 per cent., our Government is offering 8 per cent. when the market value of money is 3 per cent.  Is it not an invitation to a landlord to invest his spare cash in the improvement and betterment of his own property when, in effect, you tell him: &ldquo;Take your money out of Government stock, corporation loans or something else where you get 3 per cent. and invest it in improvement in your own house where you will get 8 <Col N="1292" /> per cent.&rdquo;?  It is a further inducement to the landlord if, say, he has three tenders before him, one contractor willing to do the job for £100, another for £200 and a third for £300, to accept the highest tender.  If he has £300 to spare, lying in some investment from which he is getting only 3 per cent., here is an inducement to him to take out that £300 and invest it in some improvements from which he will get 8 per cent., thereby increasing his interest from the capital sum from £9 to £24.</P>
    <P>In regard to Part III of the Bill which deals with small premises, I do not want to discuss it beyond saying that this is another instance of the Minister taking one step forward and two to the rear.  He commenced by providing in his original Bill that the machinery for the cheap enforcement of this Bill would apply to all small premises in the four cities and in such other areas as were included, but in the Dáil he amended the Bill to exclude any houses erected before April, 1919, or any flat or tenement constructed since that date.  That is to say that any person occupying a tenement room or a pair of tenement rooms which were reconstructed since April, 1919, is not going to get the advantages of Part III of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is another point which I should like to raise so that the Minister might examine it.  So far as I can see the landlord is provided with ample opportunity to side-step the whole of this legislation in Part III in getting his basic rent fixed for him by the Circuit Court outside the provisions of the Bill altogether.  The advantage of Part III is that it is costless, or almost costless, to the tenant.  If the landlord can take the premises out of Part III then he can involve the tenant, who is a poor person occupying premises of less than £10 valuation here in Dublin, in whatever expenses may be entailed in initiating proceedings in the Circuit Court or in appeals or actually in a case stated which, I believe, lawyers agree can be a very expensive form of litigation.</P>
    <P>Then there is the case of furnished apartments to which Senator Sweetman <Col N="1293" /> has already referred.  I cannot see why the Minister shuts his eyes to what is going on, not merely in relation to furnished flats but in regard to offices.  A prominent public official told me in the last fortnight that he endeavoured to secure an office &mdash;quite a simple office, not three hundred yards from this building, which he knew had been let to the former tenant at £180 a year.  He was quoted £400 a year for it.  The same thing applies in regard to furnished flats.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking of the bogus furnished flat; I am speaking of properly furnished flats.  I am informed that people of quite small incomes&mdash;clerks, shop assistants, junior bank officials&mdash;have been charged £3 per week in Dublin for very modest flats with very imperfect furniture.  The Minister has an example before him of the Bill recently introduced in Great Britain which, by the way, is only following the Act already enforced for a considerable time in Scotland, where the facts can be examined.  It is entitled the Furnished Houses Rent Control Bill and shows that, so far as Scotland is concerned, there is no difficulty in introducing a set of regulations which will enable the State or the local authority to come in and prevent a ramp in relation to the rents of flats.</P>
    <P>It must be obvious to the Minister that if houses are in short supply, people who have money will be prepared to come in and pay any price in order to get a house or, failing that, to get a flat.  I think the Minister is wrong in excluding from the Bill houses with a higher valuation.  I am not concerned so much with the occupiers or tenants of houses the valuation of which is £70 or £80, but I am concerned with the pressure these people bring to bear in the demand for lower valued houses by the fact that if they cannot get a house of the valuation which they would normally look for, they are prepared to come along and compete even for labourers' cottages. The Minister is quite well aware of that.  In previous legislation the desire was not so much specially to protect occupiers of the more highly <Col N="1294" /> valued houses as such but it was recognised that if these people were being rooked by the landlords they were going to come down and compete with other people whom it was desired to protect.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of the question to which I would like to refer and that is the failure of the Minister to recognise that so long as he fails to deal with ground rents he is not going to solve this problem.  Take the case of people, let us say, in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.  Many of them, 15 or 20 years ago, were paying £50 rent. In fact I have the actual figure paid for property.  A number of houses were built at a certain period and let at £52 a year.  At the time the ground rent was £6 and the margin to the landlord, therefore, was £46 per house.  In the interval, the ground rent has gone up to £16 per house, so that the margin is reduced from £46 to £36.  I do not know how the owner of that house is to be compensated for the increase in the ground rent.  It is not provided for in the Bill, so far as I understand it, but it is a serious matter, particularly for people who own houses of the kind I mentioned &mdash; houses which let for £1 a week.  I do not want to stress this, because I would be told that it is not within the scope of the Bill.  That is true, but I think on the Second Reading we might be permitted to draw attention to certain omissions from the Bill which should be dealt with.  It seems to me that we cannot deal very effectively or intelligently with the problem that is submitted to us in this Bill unless we see all aspects of it.  I am drawing attention to the abuses &mdash; in fact the scandalous exploitation&mdash;in regard to ground rents in the City of Dublin and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, and I take it that what is true there is true elsewhere.</P>
    <P>One final word: I expect that we will be permitted a reasonable time to frame amendments to this Bill. Although it was a considerable time under discussion in the Dáil, and although a large number of amendments was tabled and a considerable number accepted, in my view there was a number of those amendments which damaged the Bill.  It is less satisfactory now than when it was <Col N="1295" /> introduced in the Dáil.  Therefore, I plead that a reasonable time be given to this House to consider what amendments we would like to submit.</P>

      <P>Senator Duffy referred to previous speakers having expressed themselves as being opposed to the principle of restriction of rents. I did not hear those remarks myself. I understood the Minister to say that while he recognised that rent restrictions were necessary he was not altogether enthusiastic about them. That did not show, I think, any particular opposition.  I should say it is the attitude that any Minister, having regard to his responsibilities, should adopt.  Senator Duffy struck me as being similar to the man who put up something such as a bottle to be knocked down&mdash;the old game of cock-shot.  There was nothing really to be knocked down.  Had he waited for my remarks he probably would have had something to hit at.  So far as I am concerned, I intend to refer to the whole principle of rent restriction, and the attitude that, having regard to their responsibilities, people should adopt towards it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This rent restrictions idea was born in very exceptional circumstances.  The first Act bearing upon rent restriction was adopted in England in 1915, and, significantly enough, was called a War Restrictions Act.  That suggested that it was to be of a temporary nature and to meet very special circumstances. Now that peace has come, and that we seem to be in for a considerable spell of normality, I think the opportunity should be seized and utilised to go to the very foundation of this principle of rent restriction.  It is obvious that it very seriously interferes with the rights of certain citizens, and, although such citizens are in the minority, this being a nation which claims to act justly and in a Christian fashion, the views of that minority should certainly be considered. I have explained that at the time the prototype, if I may use the term, of this Act was passed, there were exceptional conditions existing. The very life of the English nation was at stake and it was obvious that, as prudent and sensible men, the Government <Col N="1296" /> in England at the time considered that they must sacrifice some interest in order to save the life of the nation as a whole.  Hence, they said: &ldquo;Unjust and all as it may be, we will secure the co-operation of the largest possible number by giving them relief from their economic burdens in the form of reduction in rent.&rdquo;  That, so far as I can see, was really the origin of rent restriction.</P>
    <P>As the cost of living increased in England, naturally the people who depended solely or very largely upon interest derived from rents found themselves obliged to raise those rents. On the other hand, the people with fixed incomes, particularly those of the wage earning classes, found that they had to resist such increases.  Being in the majority, naturally they had their way, and the first Rent Restrictions Act was passed.</P>
    <P>We have to bear in mind then, the whole time we are discussing the question of rent restrictions, the circumstances in which the first Act was passed.  Hamlet, as you know, said that the appetite grows with what it feeds upon, and hence the benefits of rent restrictions were so very nice in themselves that the people continually asked for more of such restrictions. They were very like that famous character in Dickens known as Oliver Twist.  I submit then that the first consideration should be: to what extent are we justified in spending the time of this House on an Act which will continue the disabilities under which a very considerable section of the population is already suffering? The doctrine of private ownership in house property, which this Bill is calculated to assail, has been accepted in the provisions of our Constitution. Therefore, in dealing with this Bill, I think we should try to see to what extent we are giving effect to the principles so embodied.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to monopoly in the case of house property, and the analogy to monopoly in land is utilised in this connection.  The question then is: is there an exact parallel between houses and land with <Col N="1297" /> respect to monopoly?  Let us consider what happens in the case of a house. From the very time it is built it is subject to destruction.  All the natural forces begin to operate.  I need not detail what those are.  First of all, the weather begins to act on it; acid begins to act on the stonework; insects of all kinds attack the woodwork; and in the course of a few hours fire may destroy the whole structure.  It is an artificial structure from the very beginning.  It is made by the hands of man, and, like everything else made by man, it may easily be destroyed.  As far as its tendency towards deterioration and ultimate destruction is concerned, it very much resembles the people who live in it.  Human beings too are subject to destruction.  I maintain then that there is no exact analogy between house property and land so far as the principle of monopoly is concerned.</P>
    <P>Now, if we examined the case minutely we would probably say that after all there is a portion of this structure which bears an exact parallel to that of land, that is to say, the site of the house; but land used as the site of a house differs very much from land that is used for ordinary agricultural purposes.  You have only to look at this very city to see what has happened to certain streets, which were once the fashionable streets of the city and which are now slum quarters.  So, the site value of land varies very much.  In that connection, I was in Toledo some years ago and I observed there a number of lizards hopping in and out of holes which they had bored in the cut stone bases to the main walls of the great Cathedral there.  That shows how even tiny animals like that will, in the course of time, destroy even the greatest structure.  Possibly, we are all familiar with the old saying in Omar Khayyam:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They say the Lion and Lizard keep</P>
    <P>The Courts where Jamshyd gloried and drank deep&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That was a case of decay and destruction.</P>
    <P>I think that perhaps I have said enough to establish the fact that monopoly is not justly alleged with <Col N="1298" /> respect to a house: at least, there is not the same measure of justification for it as there may be in the case of land.  Of course, land outside the city may vary a little bit, and of course if a great war should disturb the general economic situation, the value of agricultural land will vary, but if we take a long view of the question such variations are ultimately ironed out as normality in the general economic field returns.  We might also admit that land in the vicinity of cities will vary up and down in value according as the prosperity of the city varies, but such variation is, in turn, affected by improvements in transport and so, ultimately, we may say that land outside the city cannot be compared with land within the city.  Therefore, I should say that the case for a monopoly, so far as a house is concerned, is not a very good one and that the analogy is not very close.</P>
    <P>Now, I should like to ask why should the owner of goods such as houses be the only one made subject to continuous restrictions?  Senator Duffy spoke of people building houses and then demanding rents or looking for rents of a certain standard, and he describes that as being a ramp.  Well, these people were not obliged to build these houses, and it is not clear, therefore, why they should be obliged to set them at a particular rent.  There is no particular reason why they should be so obliged.  Senator Duffy referred to something like 8 per cent. profit being obtained on an investment of, say £150, but he forgot to mention that, from the moment the walls or the structure, representing that £150, began to deteriorate, a sinking fund had to be provided out of which such walls and structures would be replaced.</P>

      <P>They are not sufficient.  Now it is unanimously admitted that private ownership of land is likely to get the best results for the nation.  It is not clear, then, why the owners of house property should be the one section of the community whose extinction seems to be intended by the State.  I come now to <Col N="1299" /> a section that may be particularly controversial, but if the House will bear with me I think that the members of the House who may resent this most strongly will ultimately agree with me. At a recent meeting of the Insurance Institute the other day a speaker said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The monetary prosperity of a country would be meaningless if, as a result, a more ready flow of money was made available to spend on horses, dogs, cinemas, dances, drink and all the other supposedly accepted necessities of modern life, to the extinction of everything higher, nobler and more inspiring.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the speaker referred to some of the causes which have led to the infliction of injustice on the property-owning classes.  There is a great deal of that kind of thing not only in Dublin but throughout the country, and it really means that people such as those who are depending on house property&mdash;very often they are widows &mdash;are obliged to deprive themselves of even the most elementary necessities of life because of the high cost of living.  That high cost of living&mdash;a very big part of it&mdash;is, I should say, due to these frivolities represented by the practices mentioned by the speaker.  Now, we have a number of factories that have been established&mdash; and I am now dealing with the sociological aspect, which has a very important bearing on rent restrictions. These factories are protected by tariffs and are in the position, therefore, to charge execeptionally high prices. This fact, in turn, tends to increase the cost of living.  I do not say that the directors or owners of these factories get the full benefit, because it is known that at the moment the Government are sharing as it were the profits with the owners of the factories, but the fact is that these high prices enable the owners to give comparatively high wages, and these high wages, in turn, enable the wage earners to indulge in the practices mentioned.  It is, then, found that there are not sufficient financial resources left to enable these wage earners in many cases to get a sufficient <Col N="1300" /> quantity of wholesome food and other necessities of life.  Hence, we have diseases such as tuberculosis rampant.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, a manufacturer on a small scale told me that he had been obliged to secure the services of certain key workers from England for his small factory.  In order to secure the services of these men he had to pay very high wages.  He then found that the high wages had the effect that more than half of the wages were spent before the week-end was over in drink, with the result that the men did not turn up to the factory until the following Tuesday or Wednesday.  I suggest that if, after a social survey, the State feels that wages are still not sufficient to enable workers to pay reasonable rents or if there are people such as those suffering from diseases or other infirmities, who require greater assistance than is at present being extended to them, then the State should do something to secure that the wages are raised to a level sufficiently high to enable the workers to discharge their obligations in the form of rents, and to enable the other, poorer people, who are suffering from infirmities or diseases, to do likewise.  That, I think, should be really the fundamental cure and if we believe in this great principle of social security, I would suggest, to the labour representatives in particular, that that should be their aim: to lift these people above the stage where it is necessary for them to look for subsidies and to look for interference with the property of other people.  That I look upon as something to come in the future and something that I suggest should be supported by the representatives of labour.  After all, if we are living in a house which is subsidised in any shape or form by the State or the local authority is it not partaking of a form of charity?  It is destroying our independence, and that is not good for the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>The badger hunt serves as a model for the treatment of owners of house property, many of whom are poor widows, and most of whom are a class which can with propriety be claimed as being sober, modest and God-fearing, the mainstay of the State and a credit <Col N="1301" /> to the country.  I am acquainted with many owners of house property, and I plead guilty to being the owner of house property which my people have owned for 150 years.  As I have been dealing with tenants of houses, I can speak from first-hand experience. During portion of my time I was also a tenant, so that I can look at this question from both sides.  I was rather disappointed on reading the debates in the other House at the attitude adopted by many speakers.  In fact, the only thing I can imagine is that the type of cases referred to were reminiscent of a badger hunt, whereas I should imagine that a legislator should try to hold the balance evenly between the two classes and to act as fairly as possible.  I know of a house which was set at a rent of £40, on the assumption that it would be used in a certain way, as the tenant might have some difficulty in building up a successful business.  No sooner was the tenant in the house than he set one room at £78 a year, and not long after set another room at £52.  Therefore, the sub-letting principle is an exceedingly unjust one.  There may be cases where it is just, and which would justify a person who owns property setting it on certain conditions, but that people should exploit a letting such as I mentioned was never contemplated. That is only one of hundreds of cases that came under my special notice.</P>
    <P>Then there are cases where a landlord owns a house and a tenant goes in and after a short time sells his interest at a considerable profit.  Why should rights be filched away in that manner?  If I had my way I would abolish the present rent restrictions and would advise the Government to adopt the plan adopted in relation to land, that is, that there should be a national purchase scheme.  Owners are not under any obligations to build houses but, if they are simple enough to do so, they are liable in the course of a few years to have their rights removed.  Although the Minister suggested that owners would be <Col N="1302" /> reasonably safe in investing in house property, any owners that I know intend to get out of house property at the earliest possible moment.  Unless a person is a regular fool he is not now going to invest in house property. When it comes to that we must visualise the State being the ultimate owner of all house property, so that when a house falls in the State will be, in a measure, in control.  All house owners would welcome such a scheme, as it would explode the stories of fabulous profits that were mentioned in the House this evening.  House owners would be delighted with such a scheme.  I intend to move some amendments on the Committee Stage dealing particularly with sub-lettings and similar matters.  I am rather doubtful, after my experience, of the wisdom of encouraging tenants to go to the courts to claim damages for repairs.  While in one case a rent might be reduced, landlords very often are not able to carry out repairs if penalised to the extent of 80 per cent. In order to encourage owners to carry out repairs they are to be allowed one-twelfth of the rent, but if we take the rent of the average house at £24 yearly, the allowance would be £2.  Some three months ago I paid £4 10s. 0d. to have two slates put on my house.  That is an indication of the cost of house building at present.  I am sorry Senator Hearne is not here now, because he has an expert knowledge of building.  Everybody knows the cost of building has gone up to a figure never contemplated some years ago.  An allowance of £2 on a house let at £24 a year is, in my opinion, inadequate, and should be substantially increased. On the Committee Stage I feel sure that I will be able to deal with the matter more fully and in a way that will be helpful to the Minister and to the House.</P>
