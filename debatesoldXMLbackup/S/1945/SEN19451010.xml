      <P>I move that this Bill be recommitted because, I understand, under Standing Order 80, unless the whole Bill is recommitted it is not possible for me to ask that Section 11 be recommitted, seeing that there are no amendments.  It is the only section on which I wish to raise one point that could be dealt with adequately on the Report Stage later by way of amendment.  I ask the House to agree that the whole Bill should be recommitted, on the understanding that I am not going to raise anything except on Section 11, which was a section on which we adjourned reconsideration.</P>

      <P>When dealing with the Committee Stage of this Bill on July 27th, as certain Senators are aware, there was some discussion as to whether reference <Col N="862" /> of (c) of the agreement in Section 11 was not ambiguous, and Senators were inclined to think that there should be some amendment moved to say whether it should be to clause (c) of Section 10 of the agreement or not.  Reference to clause (c) occurs in two sections, in Section 2 (a) and in Section 11.  The point did not arise in Section 2; it did arise on Section 11.  Section 2 authorises the acceptance of the gift of Johnstown Castle, and deals with approval of the agreement and execution of the conveyance. Section 11 deals with expenses in connection with the administration of the Act out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  I should say first of all, that this section would, of course, have been sufficient if there was no reference at all to clause (c) of the agreement.  The reference is only made for information and clarification, owing to the importance of that particular clause in the agreement.  On that occasion I was asked why clause (d) was not mentioned as well as (c), as it appeared that the amount of money involved in (d) was more than in (c).  The explanation is that all the expenditure under (d) has been already dealt with in estimates that were before the Dáil; to a great extent in the Estimate for Public Works and, to some extent, in the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture.  It would be, therefore, wrong to ask the Oireachtás to agree to something that had been already agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to clause (c), there is only one clause (c) in the agreement.  There is a clause (c) in the inventory marked &ldquo;A&rdquo;, but that inventory is dealt with in clause (c) under the heading of &ldquo;No. 10 of the Agreement&rdquo;.  Therefore, there could be no ambiguity with regard to the clause (c) dealt with here. If Senators will examine the agreement, which is set out in the Bill, they will find that it starts off with the usual preliminaries to an agreement, &ldquo;whereas so-and-so&rdquo;, and that is followed up to No. 9.  Then we start again, &ldquo;whereas so-and-so&rdquo;, and that is where the mistake arose.  No. 10 was put in and should never have been put in.  We cannot amend the agreement now, because it was drawn up in consultation between the two parties. <Col N="863" /> But only if the No. 10 in the agreement had been omitted at the time the agreement was made, there would be no further trouble.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister mean the whole of No. 10?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just No. 10.  There should be no number there at all, because we are starting on a new clause of the agreement, and we say, &ldquo;whereas it is desirable...&rdquo;  The first &ldquo;whereas&rdquo; covers nine different points, and the next one should not have been No. 10, but should have had no number, followed by the letters (a), (b) and (c), down to (i).  As I say, it was an oversight, not a very serious error, to have a number there at all.  If any amendment was being made, we should go back with the agreement and ask the people to re-sign it with No. 10 omitted.</P>
      <P>As it stands, I submit there is no possible ground for ambiguity of any kind.  As I say, the mistake was really made when the agreement was signed, and, on the whole, it is better to leave things as they are.  That is the case, I submit, for leaving things as they are, and I am sorry I was not in a position to explain where the error first arose when this matter came up on the 27th July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully say that I am not satisfied with what the Minister has stated.  This agreement contains the following proviso at the end:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided always that this agreement is conditional upon the acceptance of the said intended gift by the Oireachtas and the enactment of legislation to give effect to same within four months from the date hereof as if no Act shall have been passed for the purpose aforesaid within such period (or such further period as the settlor may in writing agree to) these presents and everything herein contained shall be void and of no effect.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Bill to give effect to the agreement, so you must take the agreement <Col N="864" /> as you find it, and adapt your legislation accordingly.  In the agreement you have clause 10.  Let it be called paragraph 10 if necessary, so that it will read as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whereas it is desirable that provision should be made in respect of certain matters incidental to the said gift which cannot be effected without statutory authority but the settlor and the said Maurice Victor Lakin do not desire and it is not the intention and purpose of this agreement that the intended gift should be in any way conditional upon the matters hereinafter referred to save and except the matters specified in clauses (a), (b) and (c) hereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This clause (c), of paragraph 10, is the subject of the difficulty.  I respectfully say that it will be necessary to amend Section 2 and Section 11 so as to provide that the clause referred to in both sections shall be clause (c) of paragraph 10 of the agreement contained in the Schedule to the Bill.  I say it is not sufficient to leave matters as they stand because there is no clause (c). In fact when you read the agreement you see that it is clause (c) of paragraph 10.</P>
    <P>One other point, when I am dealing with this&mdash;the agreement provides that legislation should be enacted within four months from the date of the agreement to give effect to it.  The agreement is dated December 28th, 1944, so that the four months expired on April 28th, 1945.  The proviso does contain provision for a further period as agreed to by the settlor in writing. We have no knowledge that the settlor agreed to any extension beyond four months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister gave us an assurance on the last occasion that he had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that that should be incorporated in the Bill because it is an extension of the agreement.  You are not giving legislative effect to the agreement unless you have the authority in writing also incorporated in the Act.  In these two respects, it should be amended before it leaves this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ryan.  So far as the first point is concerned, he has said exactly what I had intended to say, with this exception that I do not think the agreement is defective.  I do not think it is a mistake putting in No. 10 there.  It is one of the clauses which were set out at the top of page 5 as agreed to and declared between the parties.  The drafting of the agreement as it was in the initial instance is perfect.  So far as whether there could be doubt is concerned, it could not possibly alter the validity of the Bill, and it would make it quite a clear Bill beyond all question of doubt if the figure 10 were inserted before the reference to clause (c).  If you do not do that, I suggest that it would be creating the same position as if we enacted a Bill of one section divided into various sub-sections and referred in sub-section (10) to sub-section (1) of the same section.  That would be slovenly drafting and might give rise to doubts.  I would press the Minister very strongly to agree to insert the figure 10 before the letter (c) to put the matter beyond all doubt in this case.  On the other point, I am afraid I am not sufficiently qualified to give an opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a lawyer but it seems to me that the two lawyer Senators have made the position perfectly clear.  What is the objection to putting No. 10 in?  The Seanad is meeting and the Dáil is in session and there would be no delay about it.  I presume that the Minister has some reasons to show that harm would be done by putting in No. 10.  To my mind, even taking his case, he did not suggest that it would not be as clear with No. 10 inserted.  Therefore we ought to do it, unless it can be shown that harm would be done.  I am not competent to express an opinion on the other point made by Senator Ryan from a legal point of view, but from a common-sense point of view&mdash;I do not say that law is not always common sense&mdash;and from the point of view of record, it is desirable that the Bill should show it.  It would probably save quite a lot of trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the extension of the time of the agreement before legislation might be passed, I did say that the six months' extension was agreed to by both parties.  That extension would give until the 28th October, but necessary documents have to be signed when this Bill is enacted. The Bill must become an Act before some of these necessary things can be done.</P>
      <P>The Bill will be in ample time if it is dealt with in the Oireachtas this week.  I think that both sides are arguing a very trivial matter.  If an error was made in the drawing up of the agreement by putting in the figure 10 where it should not have been put in, we should not follow that error and put the figure in the Bill, especially as there is no possibility of ambiguity. As I have pointed out, there is no letter (c) in the agreement other than the (c) with which we are dealing.  The only other (c) is in the inventory, which is only an addendum to the agreement, dealt with under the said section (c) in the agreement itself.  A slight error was admittedly made in the agreement and the legal men advising me say that we should not repeat that error by carrying it into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sweetman said that, if there were no numbers, it would look rather bad, even if there were no ambiguity, to put in the letter (c) without mention of the section.  I do not think so.  If Senators will examine the agreement, they will find that the first part starts off with the words &ldquo;Memorandum of agreement made the 28th day of December, One Thousand Nine Hundred and Forty-four&rdquo;.  Those words are followed by clauses numbered 1 to 9.  Those constitute the agreement made between the Minister for Agriculture and the donors of the property.  Then the agreement starts off again with the word &ldquo;Whereas&rdquo;. The part of the agreement which follows provides that the authority of the Oireachtas will be obtained for the making of the agreement in so far as that authority is necessary.  Those are two very distinct things.  In the first instance, we have the agreement to transfer the property on certain conditions. <Col N="867" /> In the second instance, we have an undertaking to get the authority of the Oireachtas to do what it is necessary to do.  The agreement is to be null and void unless the authority of the Oireachtas is obtained for the doing of the matters set out in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).  But if the Oireachtas were to turn down paragraphs (d) to (i) it would not invalidate the agreement.  It is plain that the agreement should never have contained that number 10.  The agreement is in two parts and the number 10 was wrongly inserted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been put there in error and what Senators ask me to do is to stultify the Oireachtas by putting the error in the Bill as well.</P>

      <P>Is not the agreement the predominant article in the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very important part of it.  If the second part of the agreement had been called Part II, it would be a different matter.  We should have to put in &ldquo;clause (c) of Part II,&rdquo; but it was not inserted as Part II.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If it had been, the reference would have been to clause (c) of Part II.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  But the number 10 is not relevant, because we pass on to the second part of the agreement, which should not be numbered 10.  It would be a great mistake for the Seanad to insist upon this amendment. The Seanad has every right to censure me for authorising the signing of an agreement with a mistake such as that in it.  All I can do is ask the House to forgive me for that oversight and not stultify it by doing the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not a party to any of the previous arguments on this <Col N="868" /> matter.  It is very interesting, in respect of a Bill on which we are all in complete agreement, to find ourselves at loggerheads with the Minister, with whom we are very seldom in disagreement. The Minister has several ways out of the difficulty.  He has the subtle way, the blustering way and the simple way.  The Minister is an expert in the use of the simple way.  He is very calm, most reasonable, and very persuasive&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Even when he is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case he invites us to censure him because of a small error in the agreement.  When we consider the multifarious duties that fall upon a Minister for Agriculture, none of us wants to censure him because the figure 10 occurs in an agreement for which he is responsible, being one of the multitude of things which he has to attend to.  There is a difference of opinion on this matter between the Minister and Senator Ryan.  It is quite plain that there is a difference of opinion between the Minister and Senator Sweetman and Senator Sweetman and Senator Ryan happen to be in agreement.  When there is such a difference of opinion, the ordinary Senator must consider which side he ought to be on.</P>
      <P>What is the governing principle in a Bill of this kind, of which I have seen a great many?  I think it is that, when a Bill is brought in to ratify an agreement, the Bill must follow the agreement. If there be a mistake in the agreement which does not need to be remedied by entering into a new agreement, what the House should do is follow that mistake in the Bill with which it is dealing.  To say that we would stultify ourselves by inserting the figure 10 in the Bill because that figure was only inadvertently inserted in the agreement, is to misuse the English language.  I am sure the Minister knows that we would not be stultifying ourselves by so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like you to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister has a very tender corner in his heart for us.  He would hate to see us go wrong in matters in which he considers us earnest and sincere.  To say that a Bill to ratify an agreement must follow the agreement is, I submit, absolutely sound both from the point of view of law and the point of view of common sense.  Therefore I suggest that the proposed amendment should be accepted so as to make the matter watertight and thus satisfy everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a remarkable day.  The Minister has come to the House and has voluntarily asked to be allowed to wear the white sheet of repentance.  There is no need for him to wear it.  The Minister has done nothing wrong and the draftsman has done nothing wrong.  It frequently happens, if two or three different people set out to produce a draft embodying certain matters which are agreed to, that they each produce a slightly different draft.  The mere question of the numbering of the paragraphs is a matter of colossal unimportance, so long as you can tell by the numbers what paragraphs you are referring to.  I agree with Senator Ryan that there is nothing wrong with the draft, but the numbers of the paragraphs are there in order that you may be able to identify the paragraphs about which you are talking.  So much for the draft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you are dealing with a Bill which refers to that draft, the important thing is that you should be able to say exactly what you are talking about.  Then, for the first time, if you are making a reference, you are bound to make the reference in the words which happen to have been adopted by the draftsman.  If you are making a reference to what appears in the draft whether correctly or incorrectly as paragraph 10 or clause 10, you are bound to refer to it in that way because anything else is an incorrect description.  Therefore, I submit to the House that there is no option whatever except to describe the paragraph in the way in which the original draftsman drafted it.  That is plain to demonstration.  If this House desires <Col N="870" /> to refer to a thing which is indicated either by letter, number, symbol or anything of that nature, it must refer to it in the way in which the original draftsman has chosen to indicate it.  There should not be any real difference between the Minister and the House on this matter.  There is a phrase much used by lawyers and which possibly may provide a method by which the Seanad can agree to the amendment.  Sometimes it is explained to a court that a thing is not really necessary in a document but it is put in, as expressed in the Latin phrase, <i>ex abundante cautela</i>&mdash;that, in other words, nobody can raise a factious objection.  My friend Senator Ryan says that it is absolutely necessary. To my mind it is absolutely necessary that if you desire to refer to portion of the agreement in the Bill, you must refer to it in the way in which it is identified in the original agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Kingsmill Moore has said nearly all I intended to say.  I think the statement that 10 was an error in the original agreement is a childish one from the legal point of view.  This is an agreement made between certain donors of property and the Minister for Agriculture. The Minister comes here and tells the House that this agreement to which he is a party is wrong&mdash; wrong in a very minor matter, namely the numbering of the paragraphs which means nothing as Senator Moore has said.  I should like to point out, however, that there are paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 already in the agreement so that it is only natural that there should be a tenth paragraph.  I certainly shall not vote for this Bill as it stands because I feel as a lawyer it would stultify my intelligence.  I do not care whether the Minister is advised by his experts or not.  I shall not vote for the Bill as it stands here.  I feel I would be wasting my time in this House and wasting my legal knowledge if I had to agree to the advice which the Minister has given to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also say that I cannot vote for the <Col N="871" /> Bill until the Minister produces here in this House and incorporates as part of the Bill the agreement of the settlor to extend the time within which this agreement should be ratified by legislation.  The four months specified expired on the 28th April, and legislation was not enacted by that time. Therefore the agreement was dead.  I say that in order to keep the matter alive the settlor should have agreed to an extension of the time before the 28th April and not afterwards when the matter was dead.  It may be revived but, at all events, an agreement to extend the time within which effect was to be given to the agreement by legislation, should be in the Schedule to the Bill, so that everybody might know that the Legislature is in fact giving legislative effect to a live agreement and not to something that had expired by the efflux of time.  Therefore, I suggest that this Bill should be amended by the insertion in the Schedule of the actual agreement to extend the time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>What the House is asking, is not going to handicap the Minister.  These requests are made by Senators who have a considerable experience of drafting and, from the point of view of wisdom, I suggest to the Minister that he should accept the suggestions put to him.  He can have no more than a layman's opinion on these matters as against the points of view put forward by lawyers in this House.  Obviously they would not ask for these amendments unless they were perfectly convinced of the necessity for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the figure 10 should be inserted in Section 2 and also in Section 11, but the Minister perhaps might wish to leave the matter over for Recommittal on the Report Stage in order that he could consult his advisers in the meantime.  Certainly I am not going to allow the matter pass without recording my opinion, through a division, if necessary, in case there is a row later on. I am quite willing to meet the Minister in any way by leaving the matter over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might say to the non-lawyer members of the House that I have no disrespect for the opinion of the lawyers in this House but I think that everybody knows that there are very few questions of law on which one will not get some lawyer to take a different view from another.  I was advised by my legal advisers that the Bill is all right as it stands and that we should not amend it.  It is quite understandable that we may have lawyers here in the Seanad who say that that is wrong.</P>
      <P>As I say, I should like to put it to the non-legal members of the House that it does not necessarily follow that because a lawyer says a thing is absolutely wrong, it is wrong.  Having said that, I should like to add that I think the lawyer Senator who made the best suggestion was perhaps Senator Kingsmill Moore.  He said that sometimes a certain phrase is put into a document.  I do not remember the Latin words exactly but I remember the translation.</P>

It is not perhaps strictly in order, but I want to say that the other point raised by Senator Ryan could have been met in Section 2, where it says: &ldquo;the agreement is hereby approved of&rdquo;, by the insertion of words to the effect that the agreement which has been extended to six months is approved of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant to refer to that point when I was on my feet.  I did tell the Seanad here on the last occasion that the agreement was extended for six months, under the agreement itself, which provides for that.  I do not think I could agree with Senator Ryan that a document of that kind should be produced, because I think that might lead to a very undesirable precedent so far as Ministers are concerned.  It must be obvious to the Seanad that if we pass this Bill, and if we do not provide for that, then the Bill might as well not have been passed at all.  It would have no effect.  I can only say that that matter has been made right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I say the Legislature must know whether or not they are giving effect to a dead agreement, and I certainly think it is a wrong line to adopt to say that it makes things awkward for Ministers.  This is as much a public matter as the agreement itself, and I think it should be incorporated in the Act.  I say it is quite possible that we are at the moment giving legislative effect to a dead agreement, something which has expired by efflux of time, unless we say that the time has been extended.  The agreement itself says &ldquo;that these presents are conditional upon the acceptance of the said intended gift by the Oireachtas and the enactment of legislation to give effect to same within four months from the date hereof and if no Act <Col N="874" /> shall have been passed for the purposes aforesaid within such period or such further period as the settlor may in writing agree to these presents and everything herein contained shall be void and of no effect.&rdquo;  It is quite obvious that this Bill was not introduced in the Oireachtas until after the expiration of the four months, and I see no reason why that agreement extending the period should not have been also incorporated in the Bill. The Bill was printed and introduced after the four months had expired, and I have a feeling&mdash;I may be quite wrong&mdash;that this agreement to extend the time was entered into after the four months had expired.  There is a presumption that that is so unless it is produced and incorporated in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are giving legislative sanction to an agreement which says: &ldquo;And if no Act shall have been passed for the purposes aforesaid within such period or such further period as the settlor may in writing agree to these presents and everything herein contained shall be void and of no effect.&rdquo; In other words, unless an Act is passed within four months the agreement is void.  I say that the agreement to extend the time to give effect to the agreement by legislation should have been entered into before the expiration of the four months and not afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a matter on which there may be a difference of opinion but at all events, whether the agreement to extend the time was entered into before the expiration of the four months or after it, I say that the agreement should be incorporated in the Bill. Otherwise there is no evidence that the time was ever extended.  If this Bill goes through the Oireachtas and becomes <Col N="875" /> an Act then the agreement and the Act itself contain a void, because the Act will be dated some time in October, 1945, while the agreement was made on the 28th December, 1944, and the agreement itself contains a provision that it should be ratified by legislation within four months.  Everybody is left in doubt as to whether or not that time was ever extended.  I say that there should be in the Bill, and therefore in the Act, some evidence that the time was extended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there should be something in the nature of a recital to show that.  I would not go quite so far as Senator Ryan and say it is absolutely necessary to have the agreement scheduled in the exact words, but I do think there should appear on the face of the Act something in the nature of a recital to say that it was extended.  I entirely agree with Senator Ryan there.</P>

      <P>As I explained already, I am at the very serious disadvantage that I do not know as much law as Senator Ryan, but, speaking as a man of common sense, I must say that if something follows on the agreement I do not see why it should not follow just the same as we are bound under this agreement to pay compensation to certain <Col N="876" /> men.  The Senator might ask, for instance, did we leave the jubilee nurse in the lodge?  Should we produce the jubilee nurse here to say she was left in the lodge?  Or, in the case of those employees, should we get their authority before the Senator says he is satisfied that they will get the compensation as laid down in the agreement? I think that all these things that arise out of the agreement are just the same, including the extension of the time for carrying it out.  I do not see that it is different from anything else.</P>

      <P>While I have no great belief in the infallibility of lawyers, I do not share the opinion of the Minister that one is handicapped by lack of legal knowledge when dealing with Acts of Parliament.  To me it is a question of common sense, and not of legal knowledge.  We are parties of the one part to this agreement, and, as such, we have to pass legislation by a certain time.  If it was the case of a private individual, he would have to sign a document or pay a sum of money, as the case might be, within a certain time.  We, as the Oireachtas, are fulfilling one part of the agreement, which would be void unless something else <Col N="877" /> happened.  It seems to me that, not as a matter of legality, but as a matter of common sense, there should be some mention or something in the Schedule to show that it has been extended for six months, and that what we are now doing is in order.  It should be there for the purpose of common-sense record.  I know that if I, as a private individual&mdash;and I often have to deal with legal documents&mdash;had to deal with some such agreement, I would certainly put down the date, if only for future reference, so that nobody could come along and say that it was not in proper order.  As this thing stands, it would appear not to be complete from the legal point of view, but even if there be no legal significance involved, I say that from the common-sense point of view it should be here, and that could be done very easily.</P>

    <Title>Air Transport for Export of Agricultural Produce&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Eireann is of the opinion that the provision of swift transport for agricultural produce exported from this country will be a matter of vital importance to our future export trade and requests the Minister for Industry and Commerce to investigate the possibility of the creation of an air transport service from Eire in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that there are some Senators who do not agree that air transport is a practical proposition for the export of agricultural produce.  I am convinced that it is not only practicable but that it is an absolute necessity for the successful development of our agricultural, horticultural and fishing industries. I am sure that the Parliamentary <Col N="878" /> Secretary, on behalf of the Minister, will tell the House that he is prepared to provide air transport for the export of any produce where a demand is made for such a service.  As far back as last February the cattle trade had a communication from the Department of Industry and Commerce with reference to air transport for live stock.  They wanted to know whether, if aircraft were specially equipped for the carrying of such products, a demand would exist for such a service.  I mention that fact to show that the Minister and his officials were apparently willing to create air transport for this country whenever necessity demanded that such a service would be of use, and my principal object in moving this motion is to show the Parliamentary Secretary and the House that a demand would exist for such a service if it were provided: that it would create a lucrative export trade for a good deal of produce which we do not now export and which could be exported if we had air transport, which there is a possibility of our being able to secure now.</P>
    <P>We are blessed in this country with a rich soil and a very mild climate.  It is most suitable for the production of all kinds of agricultural and horticultural produce, for which there is always a ready export market, and a good deal of this produce which we have not exported up to the present could be increased a thousandfold if we had proper organisation and cooperation amongst the farmers of this country.  I believe it is the duty of the Government to try to build up such an organisation on co-operative lines.</P>
    <P>There are great opportunities to create an export trade in early potatoes, in tomatoes, in all kinds of vegetables, in honey, in fish, and particularly in fresh meat.  Market gardening for export is not new to our Irish farmers.  It has been done very successfully in County Dublin for many years, and it has been done even for export in County Dublin.  County Dublin exported early potatoes and vegetables for many years to Great Britain and even to Belfast, but since the war started they were prohibited from <Col N="879" /> exporting that class of provisions, as it was felt by the Government that they should be reserved for the people of the City of Dublin.  The Government, however, at the same time compensated County Dublin farmers for that prohibition by granting them a subsidy which would give them a price equal to what they would have got if they were allowed to export that produce.</P>
    <P>New or early potatoes have been grown in many other parts of the country as well as County Dublin.  They have been very successfully grown for export around Dungarvan, and in districts with which the Cathaoirleach is familiar.  Acres of them have been grown in that district.  The system there was that English buyers came to Ireland every year about the first week in May and bought the crops on the stalk.  The average price paid, I understand, was £60 an acre.  They also paid all the cost of lifting, packing and transport.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach could tell the House that the same practice prevailed around Clonakilty, Glandore and other places, but it was Scotch buyers went there.  The terms of sale were the same as those of English buyers who went to Dungarvan.</P>
    <P>County Dublin farmers produce new potatoes about the first week in May, and the price realised is about 6d. per lb.  When the potatoes are lifted the farmers sow parsnips and other vegetables, which are also lifted during the year.  I believe it to be true to say that farmers around Rush and Lusk often realise from £250 to £300 from the produce of an acre of land.  The Channel Islands derive a big revenue from market gardening.  The climate and the system of farming there are much the same as ours.  The principal manure required is seaweed.  In County Dublin farmers often have to go seven or eight miles to secure seaweed, whereas in the South and West it is almost at the farmers' doors.  County Dublin is about four degrees North of the Channel Islands, whereas most of the seaboard counties in the South and West are only two degrees North of the Channel Islands.</P>
    <P>As the seaboard counties in the <Col N="880" /> South and West get the full benefit of the Gulf Stream they never suffer from hard frosts or from the cold cast winds which are often so disastrous to Dublin and other market gardeners. Tomatoes could be grown successfully in all parts of Ireland without artificial heating.  I heard of one farmer who erected a building measuring 60 by 20 feet, which produced every year a ton of tomatoes, the cash value of which was something about £200. Tomatoes require very little attention. I think the Government should press county councils to adopt some scheme whereby tomato houses could be erected with money advanced to farmers or agricultural workers for that purpose.  Parsnips, onions, and all classes of vegetables could also be grown for export and would realise a good profit for the producers.</P>
    <P>We could also export more cream, as I believe it would be very much more of an economic proposition to do that than to make butter for export. Honey could also be produced in greater quantities.  It is difficult to understand why every farmer and agricultural worker has not one or two hives of bees.  Bees require very little attention, and they do all the work.  There is no strike, no lock-out and no demand for a fortnight's holiday amongst bees.  Honey is a very valuable food.  I have been told that it has curative qualities for many diseases.  We could produce the finest honey in the world from the heather in our bogs and mountains, and there is always a good home and export market for it.  The sea around our coasts abounds with all classes of fish, prime fish, we fish, and shell fish, the export of which could be greatly increased. All classes of fish require to be marketed quickly and in good condition. I understand that lobsters require to be marketed alive.  That could be done if air transport were available.  I believe that what farmers in County Dublin or in the Channel Islands can do, could be done just as effectively in most parts of Ireland, particularly on the southern and western seaboards, and that the only thing needed is the setting up of some organisation to get farmers into <Col N="881" /> the way of undertaking such work. Irish farmers are not in any way lazy; they are prepared to do anything that will pay them.</P>
    <P>There are aerodromes now convenient to most of the big towns and cities in England, and I hope that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when in London lately, made arrangements to get permission for planes to land on these aerodromes.  If he succeeded in doing that he has done a good day's work for this country.  Such an arrangement would relieve a good deal of our transport and marketing difficulties, because most of the produce I mentioned is of a perishable nature, and would not stand rough handling.  The British will take all the food, of every description, that we can supply them with.  There is now a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor of that market with a produce that we have not previously exported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Grady)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Counihan has pointed out to the House, the Department is very anxious to keep abreast of the times in so far as aerial transport is concerned, and for that purpose, the circular to which Senator Counihan has referred was sent out to live-stock traders, among others.  We are aware, of course, that the time is not yet ripe for the transport of heavy goods by air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The data available to the Department is not sufficient to enable us to form an accurate estimate of the probable cost.  The only data available is that supplied from America which, as most of you are aware, has gone in for the development of serial transport on a scale greater than any <Col N="882" /> country in the world.  I daresay that circumstances in the States lend themselves to that form of transport because of the very long distances to be covered.</P>
    <P>There are obvious advantages in aerial transport due to speed, as against any other form of transport, but, incidentally, there are disadvantages which are far greater.  Among the advantages in the case of journeys hitherto covered by sea transport, ships, etc., by circuitous routes, a considerable saving in mileage could be effected by air transport as compared with the ordinary sea voyage.  There would also be savings under the heading of insurance, because first and foremost there would be less danger of breakages owing to the much smoother means of transport.  It would take less time to convey goods and there would be a saving in the charges for handling, and less risk of pilfering during the journey.  In packaging also there would be considerable savings.  In America it has been estimated that savings as high as 50 to 60 per cent. would be possible in packaging.</P>
    <P>Then there is another question, that of interest charges.  Goods in transit would take a shorter time and the interest on overdrafts should be considerably reduced.  Another point that might commend itself to the business community is the possibility of the more frequent replenishment of stocks. It would not be necessary to carry large stocks of perishable commodities if the time had come when rates of transport would enable the transportation of perishable goods by air but, for some years to come, I do not think that will be possible.</P>
    <P>From the data available from the United States in respect of nonperishable goods, it is estimated that the ordinary transport cost per ton mile is equivalent to half a cent. or 0.3d. per ton mile as compared with the charge for aerial transport of 70 cents.  That would for a considerable time rule out the transport of heavy goods by air. The only commodities which might be considered in the immediate future as affording a possibility of being transported by air would be very valuable perishable commodities, some of <Col N="883" /> which have been referred to by Senator Counihan, say, fresh cream, fresh cut flowers and certain vegetables and fruits, but even at the present time, owing to the very high operation costs of aerial transport, the possibility of making it a business proposition to send any of these commodities to the market would have to be ruled out by any business man.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, in passing, the Senator referred to the one commodity transported by air from time immemorial long before the aeroplane was dreamt of&mdash;the transport of honey.  The workers in that industry never indulge in strike action, they never seek shorter hours and they have been transporting honey by air ever since they first came to the knowledge of mankind; but when you pass from the hard-working bee to the less hardworking human, your costs go up immeasurably, and when you compare the cost of carrying honey by means of the bee with the cost of carrying it by aeroplane you find that the difference is absolutely prohibitive.</P>
    <P>I have said sufficient to indicate to the House, I think, that the Department is keenly alive to the possibility of aerial transport and this motion will have done a considerable amount of good if it helps to make our people air-minded. We want to keep abreast of the times in this new means of transport and, situated as we are in a key position on the inter-nation communications system, it is a commendable practice for the Department to try to move ahead of the times.  It is for that purpose the circular was issued which apparently gave rise to Senator Counihan's motion.  I do not think there is anything further for me to say at this stage.  I feel I have sufficiently covered the ground mentioned by Senator Counihan.  As to the effects of aerial transport on our agricultural policy, that can be considered and dealt with at another time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It would only be right to start by congratulating Senator Counihan on the assiduity with which he presented his facts to the House.  He has done a great deal of <Col N="884" /> research and has put up a good case.  I think it was a bit unfortunate that we had not got&mdash;I feel the figures must be in the procurement of the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash; some idea of the losses which occurred in pre-emergency days in respect of agricultural produce of the type that is quickly perishable, particularly tomatoes, as mentioned by Senator Counihan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be a great deal of loss occurring through bad handling and through delay in a considerable class of agricultural produce which could be ruled out altogether if Senator Counihan's suggestions were adopted. I fully appreciate that the cost of air transport must remain substantially higher than the cost of ordinary transport by rail or ship.  As I have mentioned that and as the Parliamentary Secretary is here, I do hope that our present transport costs will be substantially, and very substantially reduced. The Parliamentary Secretary gave us an example of the cost in America of a half cent per ton mile as against 70 cents per ton mile by air.  If he had followed up that example here he would find that the cost of our rail transport is far, far in excess&mdash;indeed far and away in excess&mdash;of the American figure.  That may be to some extent because of the greater distances merchandise must be moved. That would mean that your average cost over a mile comes down.  Even allowing for that factor, you will find that our costs here are too high and will have to be reduced if we are to make a success of the business of transport.  I do think that Senator Counihan made a case for the provision of air transport at some time and I hope that, at a not too distant date, the perishable goods which we want to export&mdash;not necessarily to Britain but to continental countries in order to obtain hard currency&mdash;will have a direct air route available.  This is a matter which deserves consideration in the post-emergency days in which we are now and at a time when we are spending so much money on airports.  I do not want those airports to be used merely as a junction or terminus by other people.  I want to see them used <Col N="885" /> by our own people.  One of the ways by which we can make them of use to our own people is by carrying out Senator Counihan's idea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'Donovan Mr. T.J. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to stress the importance of the points raised by Senator Counihan.  This is a matter which affects farmers along the southern seaboard who engage in the production of early potatoes, onions and flowers.  The production of early potatoes could be multiplied 100 per cent. if speedy transport were available.  Early potatoes are almost as perishable as fresh fish.  Having regard to the time occupied in digging them, packing them into sacks, getting them into the boat and transporting them across-Channel, I often wonder how they are bought at all at the end of the journey, or how good prices are obtained for them.  If those potatoes could be got to the market by speedy transport, in good condition, they would command higher prices, and that would meet, to some extent, the higher cost of the transport.  I do not suppose that air transport will ever be as cheap as rail or sea transport, but if we could get those perishable goods into the market in proper condition, the enhanced prices which would be obtained would, to some extent, off-set the higher charges.  Production could be increased appreciably along the seaboard in Waterford, Cork and Kerry.  Senator Counihan pointed out that people in Dublin travelled miles to Rush and Lusk to obtain seaweed. Along these counties, the seaweed is there for the harvesting.  Tons of it are brought in by storms, and it is there to be gathered.  In my young days, when early potato-growing was developing, men went out in boats and gathered the seaweed off the rocks. That was of great help at the time. Senator Counihan is to be congratulated on raising this matter, and I am glad that the Department and the Parliamentary Secretary are interested in it.  The people living on small plots along the coast will respond to any indication of goodwill shown by the Department.  If there is ready and quick transport to an available market, they will make use of it.  I hope that <Col N="886" /> this matter will not be put on the long finger, and that the Department will take whatever steps are necessary to secure that air transport services will be made available for those perishable goods at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I am right in interpreting the Parliamentary Secretary as indicating that Senator Counihan is, to some extent, pushing an open door.  That, I think, was the meaning of his statement.  One aspect of this matter has not been mentioned. We have suffered in the past because of the strangle-hold on our means of contact with the outside world which resulted from those means of transport being in the hands of people other than our own nationals.  We are living in times of progress.  I am sure that our up-to-date Department of Industry and Commerce needs no reminding from me that, if this projected goods-carrying air-service is to be established, a prime necessity is that it will be controlled by Irishmen and used in the interest of the Irish people.  We realise how badly off we were at the outset of the emergency period when we were dependent on outside shipping.  Our lot was only ameliorated to the degree to which we were able to get Irish-owned ships.  I hope that it will not be long until the vision referred to by Senator Counihan and subsequent speakers will be realised and that we shall see Irish-owned and Irish-controlled goods-carrying planes using our ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that Senator Sweetman mentioned that those ports were designed to be something more than mere hopping-off places or junction places for those using lines operated from other parts of the world.  They should be, and I hope will be, used by Irish nationals.  The more they are availed of, the less will be the operating costs.  Stress was laid upon the value which such a goods service would be to our agriculture.  Anybody listening to the expert statement by a man like Senator Counihan could not fail to be impressed by the picture he painted. I should not be, however, without hope that, when that service is available, it would be availed of for the purpose of <Col N="887" /> some of our industrial activities.  I do not suppose that this motion will be pushed to a division.  The Parliamentary Secretary has given it his blessing and everybody hopes that it will not be long until we see such a service in operation.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Counihan's remarks about transport, but I was more or less surprised to hear him speak of the different commodities which were available for exportation. The only thing we could claim to be able to export at the moment, or which we could have exported for years past, would be meat. People in the country reading the papers and, perhaps, reading the report of this debate, would believe that we had a surplus of stuff for export during the past few years while, at the same time, their supplies were rationed.  We had not sufficient supplies of butter, cream, eggs, or poultry.  We had nothing but meat for export and we did not require ships or aeroplanes to take the other commodities out of the country.  For some years to come, I think that we shall hardly have a surplus of those goods for export.  If we have enough to feed ourselves for a few years, I think we shall be well satisfied.  There is one aspect of this question which is a matter for the Government, that is the position of our railway system here.  As far as I can see, the railway system is not getting a fair deal because, if the railways were supported by the people and the Government, there would be no necessity for air transport or anything of that kind. Our producers could concentrate on producing, and the Government could then take note of the conditions under which the railways were worked and see that they worked properly.  In that way, there is no doubt that if we have surplus produce to dispose of, we shall get it to its destination in proper time.</P>

      <P>Tá brón orm nach rabhas i láthair nuair a labhair Seanadóir O Cuineacháin. There is one matter that strikes me in reading this motion.  Surely if goods <Col N="888" /> are to be transported by air, perishable goods should have priority.  We heard an old saying referring to the time when pigs begin to fly, but now it seems to be a question of when bullocks begin to fly.  Years before the last great war, before 1914-18, when civilisation wanted to exterminate the Boers, there was a big man in this city who carried on a big business by way of transporting vegetables and produce of that kind to Glasgow and other cities across-Channel.  That man was the late Alderman Flanagan, who carried on a thriving market gardening business.  However, after the 1914-18 war that trade ceased because, as I understand, the freight charges were prohibitive.</P>
      <P>We all know that vegetables are perishable goods and unless they are marketed in fresh condition they are reduced considerably in value.  If, therefore, we are to embark on any system of aerial transport, in my opinion, first consideration should be given to such perishable products.  It is quite possible that at some time in the future there may be a considerable development in market gardening for the supply of cross-Channel centres. If such a development is to come about, and if we are to have aerial transport, I suggest that these perishable products should get first consideration.</P>

      <P>I am rather reluctant to intervene in this debate having heard all the technical advice tendered to the Parliamentary Secretary from different sides of the House.  From one standpoint perhaps it is to be regretted that the people of this country seem to have wonderful ideas, vivid imaginations and an inclination to do everything on a large scale.  We never, however, seem to have people of capacity to take the initiative, carry out these ideas themselves and bear the cost of doing so.  There is no doubt whatever that air transport is going to be a big factor in the future in the development of international trade and commerce.  Nevertheless shipping has been at all times in the past a very satisfactory method of transporting goods.  We have not to go very far from this country to find <Col N="889" /> an example of the way in which an efficient shipping service can deliver such very perishable commodities as strawberries and other forms of horticultural produce to markets across the water.  As a result of the provision of efficient shipping facilities, it was possible to have fresh strawberries sent from Normandy every evening during the season and delivered in the Covent Garden markets at six o'clock on the following morning.  That is what I would call efficient transport of highly perishable goods.  I think it would be more satisfactory to consider the details of a transport organisation such as that than to talk <i>in vacuo</i> about transferring bullocks by air.  I, for one, would be very slow to advise this House to adopt proposals <i>in globo</i> dealing with arrangements for the transport of agricultural produce by air until we have first organised the shipping facilities at our disposal which could provide a quick service for any produce which we may have to export in future.</P>
      <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his officials on foreseeing months ago the possibilities associated with the development of air transport in this country and the prospect of making Eire a terminus or a stepping-off ground for Europe for American travellers. Therein they displayed considerable vision and I think the Minister and his Department are to be congratulated on that fact.  I think we should be satisfied in leaving this matter in such capable hands and await developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Senators and the Parliamentary Secretary on their sympathetic attitude to this motion.  I remember that some 15 or 16 years ago a gentleman in County Louth did a very considerable cross-Channel trade in meat and cream.  The service was worked so efficiently that the produce which he delivered at Greenore at 11 o'clock at night was delivered in London on the following morning.  In addition he had something like 500 customers to whom he sent individual parcels by that service. <Col N="890" /> I should be delighted to congratulate any Minister who would provide the means to re-open a trade such as that, which was of very material benefit at the time to the entire County Louth.  Now that there is a possibility that nurseries and other horticultural necessities may be more widely established, I think there is growing need for the development of rapid transport facilities for the products of these places.  In that connection, I think that perhaps the county council might sometimes get more adequate assistance. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would direct his Department's attention to an institution which I am glad to say is advertising its wares nowadays, namely, the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I am sure that with co-operation these two Departments will be able to arrive at some arrangement by which workingmen in the country may have grants and loans made to them.  In that connection, of course, whenever a grant has been sought or a loan obtained, perhaps the greatest credit that a man can have is his character, and I am perfectly certain that the industrious character of the people of our country should be almost sufficient for a State Department, if they were to watch how this thing has been conducted for five or six, or ten years.  If they were to do that, I think they would agree that an allowance, by no means ungenerous, would be warranted in the development of these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whilst I say that, I would not like the impression to be got away with that air transport is the sole thing that needs improvement.  At present there are places, even in north County Dublin, where excellent fishing facilities exist, and which are handicapped by lack of transport to some extent. Obviously the question of transport from remote places&mdash;possibly, air transport&mdash;is very important and there are many industries in some of those remote districts which would flourish if some method of rapid transport could be devised.  For instance, take the example of the Post Office.  If you post a letter in, say, Merrion Street or Merrion Square, it takes a penny or a <Col N="891" /> twopenny stamp, or whatever it is, to send that letter to Donegal or any other part of the country.  If you go down to, say, Brooks Thomas's in the city here and buy a load of timber, there will be the difference in the cost of transport according to the place to which you are sending the timber. These are difficulties that will exist until some far-seeing minds will be able to devise some way of meeting them. While saying that, I wish to be associated with the congratulations that have been given by other speakers to the Parliamentary Secretary and Senator Counihan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to apply a cold douche to my colleague, Senator Counihan, or to take away from the complimentary things that have been said to the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department with regard to the way they have applied themselves to the substance of this motion, but I have to confess that my comment about the motion is that while it is very desirable to have the quickest possible transport service between this country and any other country that is willing to receive our goods and able to pay for them, I do not think we can contemplate the provision of air transport services from this country for the export of perishable goods unless we first of all organise production here. Preparatory to the provision of any air transport service for the export of our goods, you must have a plan of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite possible to contemplate a farmer on our Kerry coast with a small consignment of potatoes, and others along the coast of Cork, Waterford and so on, all trying to have these small quantities collected and transported by air, but if you are going to attempt anything like that, it seems to me that you have got to sit down over the matter first, and see really what our people can produce of the commodities which we wish to export, and also to find out where it is going to be produced, or whether it will be produced.  You have to get the <Col N="892" /> greatest possible quantity of goods of a similar kind produced in a convenient area, in close proximity to the starting point of the air transport services, and whilst it is very important that the Parliamentary Secretary and his Ministry should apply their minds to the development of air transport services, there is no use in talking about our farmers transporting their goods by air, unless you begin with the land itself: look at it, and ask yourselves how we can use it most effectively so that we can produce the needed goods and get the greatest possible quantity of them at a place convenient to the starting point of the air transport service, with a view to getting an adequate income from the export of these commodities.  That is the first thing to be done before we start talking about an efficient air transport service for this country for the export of perishable and other goods that are required in a foreign market by people who can pay us&mdash; goods which cannot be got there at present in good condition.</P>
    <P>Now I have no doubt that the point put forward by the Leas-Chathaoirleach is a very good point indeed.  I do not know that we are going to compete with the Channel Islands and other places in the export of tomatoes to Britain.  Indeed, on that whole matter, I do not know that we can say very much at present.  We are not going into a discussion on that now, but if we had the Parliamentary Secretary's superior, the Minister, here, he might possibly tell us something about the capacity of Great Britain to buy luxury products from us in the future.  Tomatoes&mdash;in many Irish homes at any rate&mdash;are regarded as a luxury, and I do not see our people being able to give us tomatoes at anything like the price at which people from the Channel Islands and from along the Spanish coast and the South European coast were able to give them in the past.  I am convinced, however, that with regard to early potatoes, certainly, there are immense possibilities for development there which we have not yet visualised.</P>
    <P>I do not know that there are many <Col N="893" /> European countries that can produce the kind of potato we can produce. It is on a commodity like that, that I think you should concentrate, and if you are going to do that you will have to have a plan.  It would be no use in having one lot of potatoes in Donegal, another lot in Kerry, another lot in Cork, Waterford, and so on, and some even in Dublin, unless you have some scheme or plan for the collection and cheap transport of them all.  You have got to organise your production so that the starting point for your transport service will be near the point where the bulk of your exportable commodities will be available.</P>
    <P>One would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary where we are getting so far as the Agricultural Commission are concerned, or can they give us anything to go on in this connection?  But in my view, in any case, in this matter we would be putting the cart before the horse, because if you start an air transport service at the present time I do not think you can get the commodities that we wish to export together at a place situated conveniently to the starting point of that transport service so as to enable them to be exported at any reasonable profit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that I must agree to some extent with Senator Baxter in this matter.  It seems to me that we are rather getting in front of ourselves in considering air transport until we properly organise and exploit our present transport system in this country.  Some Senators, I think, made the comment that our transport system in the past has been in the hands of aliens who have had no sympathy with this country, and that obtains to a considerable extent to-day. The mover of the motion has in mind our nearest market, which is England, and I can see no reason for organising an air transport service to England so long as we have a sympathetic, nationally-controlled, cross-Channel service, as the proximity to England makes it possible for us to load our goods overnight and have them in the best markets in England the following morning.  In such circumstances there <Col N="894" /> is not much chance of the deterioration of perishable goods or stock, and if we concentrate on that aspect of the matter and organise our internal transport system so as to run with our cross-Channel system, I think we could do a lot to relieve the situation and to meet the complaints of the agricultural community as well as of the industrial community in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No very serious consideration has been given to that aspect of the matter, and I think it should be considered before we talk about embarking on a very costly experiment to develop an air service.  We have at our disposal, or could have at our disposal, a very efficient cross-Channel service, which would meet the situation very well if it were properly handled.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary, and through him to the Government, that we should concentrate on developing our internal transport system to link up with a properly organised cross-Channel system.  In that way we will have a very efficient service.  I have no great enthusiasm for the motion proposed by Senator Counihan, because it deals entirely with export.  We know very well that if we had a properly organised internal transport system, we would have a much better market. We would give our agriculturists and fishermen a good home market.  Therefore, as I said before, I have no enthusiasm for the motion, and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government will concentrate on what we have, rather than take a step in the dark because it is fashionable to talk about air services.  We read in the papers this morning that they are contemplating sending a horse to America by air.  I am sorry that Senator Parkinson is not here.  If that were developed, it would give the bloodstock owners a great opportunity.  But that is something very much in the future.  We have something here at our hand.  Let us exploit that.  If that does not serve our purpose, we can then look for an alternative.  I am not satisfied that we have exploited the transport service that we have at our disposal, and until that is given a proper trial, I have no desire to see any great effort made in connection <Col N="895" /> with air transport for agricultural or other produce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the speakers have been in favour of the motion except Senator Foran.  I do not know what experience he has had of the export of perishable goods.  I have had some, and I know that for nine months of the year you cannot export fresh meat to any of the British markets, without having specially prepared railway trucks fixed up with ice.  I have known several exporters who exported meat to the markets in England during the time of the foot-and-mouth disease, and during the economic war, and in many cases a big proportion of their consignments was rejected in the markets. That was some of the best meat that we had in this country at that time. Of course, Senator Foran knows all about it, and would not have any such thing as air transport.  What I am advocating is air transport for perishable or semi-perishable goods.</P>
      <P>I am not talking about the export of horses or cattle by air, although I believe that in the near future that will probably come too.  Since I put down this motion, I have had a good many communications from people who are very anxious for this development. I had a letter from one lady in the West of Ireland who complained of the laxity of our public men and of the Government in regard to the development of transport.  She said she was in Denmark at the Dairy Conference in 1931, and at that time they were flying day-old chicks all over Europe.  They were also using air transport for a good deal of their perishable and semi-perishable goods.  She wanted to know why we do not do things as well as Denmark.  We cannot do it, when we have people like Senator Foran who, when any progressive proposal is made, is anxious to put his foot down and have a joke at it.  I am surprised at Senator Foran.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the motion standing in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad requests the Minister for Finance to make representations to Comhlucht Siúicre Eireann, Teoranta, with a view to the introduction of flat rate railway charges for the carriage of sugar beet to factories operated by the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion has been put down by me, representing perhaps the northern beet growers, as we have failed to make any impression whatever upon the company which controls the sugar factories, although we have tried every means at our disposal, not for one year but for many.  Whilst the grievance from which we suffer may be borne by only a few, it is one which we feel bound to ventilate now, and which <Col N="897" /> we have done our best to ventilate for the past six or eight years.</P>
    <P>While the war was on I went to the Minister for Agriculture, and he definitely stated that at the earliest opportunity he would see that our grievance was redressed.  The beet factories and beet growing are national industries. The beet factories were founded by the State, and every county and every individual in the community contributed towards their creation.  We think we are justified in asking that our position should not be unduly prejudiced when providing the material with which the factories work. I noticed that a representative of the Department of Finance who attended a meeting of the sugar company said nothing unfortunately that would hold out any hope for us.</P>
    <P>There are four beet growing associations, and they have 15 representatives for each factory area.  The sugar company consults with growers on most matters and then comes to a decision afterwards.  On the Beet Growers' Association in Carlow we have two of 15 other representatives.  The growers of beet in Louth, Meath and Wicklow, being in a minority, are severely prejudiced in that respect.  With regard to the factories at Thurles, Mallow and Tuam, everything over 6/- per ton by way of carriage is paid for by the sugar company.  In the case of Carlow, after 8/- there is a subsidy of 1/- if the freight is 9/-, 2/- if it is over 10/-, and ends there.  There is no added subsidy if the freight comes to £1 per ton.  In Louth and Meath the average cost of freight is from 14/- to 16/- per ton. Although three factories are limited to a maximum cost of 6/- per ton, there is one factory to which the freight in some cases amounts to £1 a ton.  I submit that that is something that the Government cannot lightly pass over, and that it is worthy of serious consideration both by this House and by the Government.  If Mallow, Thurles and Tuam factories have a fixed minimum rate of 6/-, and if the general rate to Carlow is in the neighbourhood of 8/-, it could hardly be fair to expect the same amount of tillage from areas in a county like Meath.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="898" /> Farmers in Louth are most anxious about tillage.  In my case the freight on beet amounts to 14/- a ton, so that I am competing with farmers paying only 6/-.  The time has come when the Minister for Finance must see that justice is done to the counties I am interested in.  Some years ago county councils were abolished largely because they were supposed to be giving everything to their friends.  The sugar company and the sugar factories are certainly not showing any sympathy with the counties I speak for, and reserve all for their own.  On September 29th an article appeared in the <i>Leader</i> that is applicable to this case.  It said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The great world war has come to an end and the farmers of Ireland did not make any profits comparable to those of 1914/18 war.  On the contrary, the increases of prices were limited by demand and supply in Ireland itself, if we except the case of fat cattle, and here again prices were far below the English marketing price.  Food was scarce and there was no incentive to rear young animals, whether of cattle or pigs. Quite a number were content to cultivate the land and to make up for their deficiency in the usual branches of farming by concentrating on wheat, barley and beet.  The rearing of pigs was largely abandoned owing to the scarcity of feeding stuffs and the high price of wheat was only a poor substitute.</P>
    <P>Owing to intensive tillage, it is true that the soil is getting worn out. It is well known that many farmers tilled more than what was compulsory during the war years; some indeed went so far as to have nearly one-half of their farms under tillage counting the first year's hay, if not the second.  That intensive cultivation has so opened up the soil that it has the appearance of being run out and sadly in want of a rest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The article continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Still there is some profit in wheat and beet, and there is the dilemma. This will not be solved as a problem until the Government ruling about cultivating a certain percentage of <Col N="899" /> the farms is changed.  And then the matter will follow the usual law of demand and supply for there does not seem to be any other incentive to produce unless a Government subsidy is forthcoming.  Of course the subsidy that should have been given to the farmers, three pounds an acre, was given to the millers, and why? &mdash;it is hard to say.  It is one of the many mysteries of money going the wrong way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That article appeared in a paper that supports the Government.  All over Ireland I notice that growers have been asking for Louth wheat.  At one meeting I saw it stated that in Leitrim and Longford they liked to get seed wheat from Louth.  If the Minister were in the House I would say to him that money made on wheat-growing went more to outsiders.  We thought, when doing what was required of us, that we would have the State behind us at all times.  As to the possibility of growing potatoes, we find that that is not an aid to good farming.  On the contrary, potatoes are tremendously heavy feeders on manures which are both scarce and dear.  There is nothing like the same incentive to good farming in potatoes that follow beet-growing.  We see no justice in the rule which prohibits, or tends to prohibit us, from growing one of the two crops that have fixed prices, wheat and beet.  I was opposed to the present Government but they brought in one magnificent scheme which was well thought out as far as it went and for which they deserve every credit.  What on earth this year caused the Government to put their foot down with regard to the wheat scheme, I do not know.  In Louth we have spectacles that stare us in the face in our idle breweries and ruined malt stores.</P>
    <P>A foreign Government looked calmly on the growth of one great concern, Guinness, while the smaller breweries went down one by one.  Here we have a State-controlled industry with the Minister for Finance sending representatives to its meetings and permitting two or three counties in Ireland to be <Col N="900" /> charged 15/- a ton for the carriage of beet.  Unlike milk, which is under individual ownership, cattle, barley or oats, which are not State-controlled, beet is fully controlled.  There is no reason why it should not be distributed and its assets conferred on every member of the community just as when the State decided to erect these sugar factories.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that anyone can fail to see the justice of our case, because, be it remembered, we have been prejudiced severely in some of these Border counties.  The separation of the northern markets from us is a serious handicap.  More serious still is the fact that when the basis for our rents and our rates was founded in the courts, we were assessed highly, because of our close proximity to the markets of Liverpool and Manchester. These markets have gone, and gone absolutely.  We have suffered other bad effects in the closing down of our small breweries, a closing which was permitted and tolerated, while a big brewery was growing up the river from here.</P>
    <P>We have millers now and evidently the millers have some say in the basic price of wheat this year.  I see that there is a row in Tipperary about it and, though it does not affect me, I hope that the Government will not allow itself to be persuaded to alter its magnificent scheme.  I hope that they will see their way to implement it again to enable beet and wheat-growing to flourish.  We are coming now to a period of the year when we must start thinking of laying down our land. I am not satisfied with the way the Department has done its business in the matter of supplies of deep-rooting grass seeds.</P>
    <P>These deep-rooting grass seeds do not seem to be procurable anywhere, but if they do succeed in procuring them they will grow best on a sward from a corn crop following beet.  I appeal to the Minister to give his sympathetic consideration to this motion on behalf of the beet growers of Louth and Meath.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I believe that Senator McGee has made an unanswerable case for a uniform price for the carriage of beet to the factories from any part of the country.  I do not grow beet and I am speaking only as one interested in the justice of the case.  Wheat growers are practically in the same position as beet growers, and no matter in what part of the country the wheat is produced, the only amount that can be deducted is 6/- for its transport from the farm. Why cannot the same thing be applied to beet?</P>
      <P>I have great sympathy for the people who grow beet.  It can be a very slavish crop particularly in the lifting and putting of it on the roadside for transport.  Some of those transport companies are fairly stern about their regulations.  I understand that in many cases they give a week's notice to the grower to have his beet planked on the roadside on such a day and if he is not ready on that day, he might have to wait for another fortnight or three weeks before a lorry would turn up. All these are difficulties with which the beet grower has to contend.  No matter what sort of weather it is, he must have his crop transferred to the side of the road on the day named by the carrying company.</P>
      <P>An excellent case has been made for uniform transport charges no matter where the beet is grown, or whether it is sent to Mallow, Thurles or Tuam.  I understand from what Senator McGee has said that Carlow is in an exceptional position.  There may be two farmers in the same area, one of whom might get permission to send his beet to Thurles or Mallow for 6/- a ton.  His neighbour might have to send his beet to the Carlow factory at 13/- a ton or even more, sometimes as high as £1. That is unjust and the Senator has made an unanswerable case for a flat rate.</P>

These costs of loading and unloading are met with in all sections of our national economy, wheat and turf as well as beet and other things which the railway system is carrying in huge quantities.  Surely, it would be a businesslike approach to the problem for the body of growers to get together, ascertain the volume of tonnage and suggest to the company that there should be a flat rate for the whole of this country or such portions of it as we legislate for, or a flat rate for zones of the country, to avoid inequalities. Any businessman must agree that where you are in competition it is essential that your competitors will compete on level terms as far as possible.  I would throw out that suggestion&mdash;go in a body to the company which actually carries the goods.</P>

      <P>Senator McGee has made a very good case for the long-distance growers.  We have discussed this matter very often in the Beet Growers' Association, but the association has never been able to arrive at a united front and has never been able to approach the sugar company or the Minister with a united front. Senator McGee stated that the subsidies to Thurles, Mallow and Tuam were the same, and that they were paid in excess of 8/- per ton.  That is not so.  In Tuam, the subsidy they receive is in excess of 6/-.  That is to say, where a grower has 12/- to pay, 6/- of that is paid by the sugar company.  It is thus over 6/- in Tuam and over 8/- per ton in Thurles and Mallow, so that the subsidy is not the same in each case. There is a slight subsidy also in Carlow, but it is very slight, for the simple reason that growers around the factory are able to raise sufficient beet for <Col N="903" /> its needs and the company does not see any wisdom in subsidising long-distance growers.  If Senator McGee's motion is passed and put into operation, it will defeat its own end, because the sugar company will tend to get beet grown in the immediate vicinity of the factory or within a 50 miles radius.  If the motion be passed, it must apply to all articles of agricultural production.  If I send live stock from Cork to Dublin, they must be sent at the same rate as live stock would be sent from Louth to Dublin. The same must apply to milk.  I do not want to undermine the case made by Senator McGee.  He has made a good case and if he were to approach the Beet Growers' Association and put his case to them as he has put it here, I am sure he would get sympathy from them.</P>

      <P>I notice from the discussion that there is a difference of opinion amongst members of the Seanad and amongst beet growers as to the merits of the case so well made by Senator McGee.  I am not free to discuss with them or with the House the merits of the case.  As the Seanad is aware, the sugar company functions in the same way as any other company.  There is no interference with its activities by the Minister for Finance.  It is not the intention that there should be.  I think that members of the House will agree that, when a company is set up, it should be the duty and responsibility of that company to make its decisions in a business like way, having regard to all the interests involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While not hoping to succeed in giving satisfaction to every interest, the decisions of such a company should, broadly, be the best that could be reached in all the circumstances.  I do not know, anything about the members of the sugar company, but I should be surprised to learn that they were not people capable of examining, and anxious to examine, all the features of the case to which Senator McGee has referred, and all the other features to <Col N="904" /> which others could, I am sure, refer. Even if the Minister himself were here, I do not think that he could do more, having regard to our approach to matters of this kind in the past, than say that we see no objection to drawing the attention of the sugar company to the remarks made here, and to the remarks made in this House when the Appropriation Bill was before it.  That is the only assurance I can give on this fairly complicated matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The House finds itself in a rather difficult position when, a motion having been moved and seconded, the Parliamentary Secretary, on behalf of the Minister, tells the House that he is not free to discuss it.  The House feels that it can have only one side of the case.  I do not know if there is anybody in the House with sufficient information on the merits to let us have the other side. The House knows that we have amongst us a director of the sugar company, but I do not think that he should be called upon to answer here for the behaviour of that company. Certain aspects of this case strike me as aspects which demand consideration by the House, and a recommendation from the House, in view of the fact that the sugar company is operating under an Act of the Oireachtas.  The sugar company implements, so to speak, the policy of the Minister and of the Government, to have sufficient sugar beet grown here and manufactured to provide sugar for the citizens of the State.  Taxes are levied to that end.  It is almost impossible to imagine that, in the carrying out of this policy, there is no consultation between the sugar company and the Ministry from time to time.  Whether there is or not, the aim of the Government is to get produced such a quantity of beet as will give all the citizens a sufficient quantity of sugar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government must inquire as to how best that policy can be achieved. The most effective method known to them up to the present has been to raise the price of beet.  They tried various offers to the growers.  In one area, where a beet factory was established, <Col N="905" /> they found that the farmers would not grow beet at the price fixed. Even in Carlow, where the first factory was founded, they discovered that the area under beet was falling year after year and the price had to be considerably increased.</P>
    <P>If the purpose is to get maximum production of a particular crop, one must have an appreciation of what is the cost of production of that crop on marginal land, whether the crop be beet, or wheat, or potatoes.  When fixing the price, one must do so at such a figure as will make it possible for the owner of marginal land profitably to produce the crop.  The beet growers of County Louth are growing beet on what one might describe as marginal land.  Whatever their yields are, their net cash return per acre, or per ton, is, apparently, lower than the price paid to growers in any other part of the country.  I do not know what the beet growers will do in the circumstances. If Senator McGee were not so loud in his praises of the tillage efforts in Louth, he might have greater success.  If he were prepared to organise his beet growers and to say &ldquo;Not one acre of beet will we grow,&rdquo; he would, probably, be able to make these people sit up and bring them up against the situation to which Senator O'Callaghan has referred, of trying to find within a given area around Carlow, Tuam, Mallow and Thurles such a number of additional growers as would make up for the quantity of beet which the Louth growers were no longer prepared to produce.  Until there is such a situation, there may not be an appreciation of what is equitable.</P>
    <P>Considering the equities of the case, all my sympathy is with the people of Louth.  If the production which you get from Louth or Meath is essential in order to give the present ration of sugar to consumers, then I think you are on a tight rope all the time.  You are taking risks and you are up against a situation in which you may find yourselves unable to deliver the goods. There is no doubt that it takes as much to grow an acre of beet in Louth as in <Col N="906" /> Carlow or anywhere else.  From the point of view of the labour in the fields, if it is going to cost 8/- in Carlow and 15/- in Louth or Meath it simply means that the Louth grower, on his eight or nine tons, is going to get £3 less for his acre than the grower in Carlow or the grower in Kildare. All this money is being collected by the Government from the taxpayers and passed on to the growers.  If the production of beet is necessary for the well-being and proper nutrition of our people, and if the Government fixes a certain price per ton, the price received by the grower should be the same whether he resides in Carlow, Kildare, Meath or anywhere else.  If the sugar company are to ensure the supply of beet necessary for the country they should be a little bit more sympathetic to the growers in Louth.  If they are up against it and have to look to some area other than Louth they may find that it will be necessary to have a compromise, and I think they would be much happier if they agreed to reasonable demands now without being forced to do so at a later stage.</P>

      <P>With reference to consultations, which I think Senator Baxter and some other Senators mentioned, the position is as I stated in the beginning, that there are 15 representatives from each of the factory areas on the association.  On that association there are only two representatives from Louth and Meath, so that we are in a small minority, and on all deputations the representatives of other areas outnumber us.  Then the sugar company lacks the vision to deal with our demands in an equitable way. I was rather nervous when Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Duffy mentioned the case of companies which are outside Government control on a previous occasion because this motion was then pending.  We knew we were being treated in Louth and Meath by the sugar company with a complete absence of national outlook but we were silent at the time although we felt that our position was receding.  One can understand the difficulties of the Department of Finance in having surrounded itself with such companies but broadly <Col N="907" /> speaking our claim is unanswerable. We are beet growers comparable in efficiency to all others in the country and we are entitled to be paid the maximum price which other growers receive.  Possibly the absence of sympathy amongst other beet growers is responsible for our position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read in the <i>Irish Press</i> the other day a description of the oiling of the wheels and the greasing of the machinery in Carlow, in which it was said that the smell brought delight to the entire surrounding locality.  One of the growers in Louth happened to remark to me: &ldquo;I wonder will we get a whiff of it up here?&rdquo; The boys are getting full advantage of it in these counties in some of which commissioners had to be put in.  We had not to get any commissioner but I can picture some places where managers will eventually have to be appointed.  We have been refused <Col N="908" /> admission to the sacred doors in Clare Street.  Every time we have asked, the reply was in the negative.  There is a case to be examined in justice to these people who have more difficulties to contend with than perhaps the people of any other county in Ireland.  I am not wholly unprepared for the defeat of this motion.  I took some little risk in bringing it forward but I leave it where it is.</P>
