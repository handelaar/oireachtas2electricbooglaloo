    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has become necessary because, as I think most people are aware, the Act passed a couple of years ago compelled the courts to take a strictly financial view of the loss sustained by a widow whose husband was murdered because he was a member of the Gárda.  The purpose of this amending Bill is to make provision for compensation on a wider basis so that a judge, hearing an application for compensation, can take all the circumstances into consideration and will not be compelled to consider only the purely financial loss.  Under the previous Act, any assets which the deceased person possessed were also taken into consideration in assessing the amount of compensation.  A provision of that kind no doubt was contained in the Act but I do not think it was the intention that it should be interpreted in that way.  The Bill also provides that the judge may take any other circumstances which he thinks reasonable into consideration.  I personally was disappointed when I discovered what happened in some of these cases in which the judge felt compelled to take the assets of deceased Guards into consideration in assessing compensation.  The pension which an applicant would receive is naturally taken into consideration, but under the former Act the judge was also compelled to take into consideration such assets as an insurance policy or a house which the applicant might have purchased.  The result was that a <Col N="1102" /> very meagre amount of compensation was awarded in some cases.  This Bill is introduced in order to rectify these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this Bill will not cause difficulty to any member of the House.  We are all agreed that the dependents of Guards who lose their lives in the performance of their duties should be properly compensated. I think the Minister is making a very genuine effort to remove flaws that were discovered subsequent to judgments given under the 1941 Act.  Compensation is now being awarded not only for financial losses, but for every other loss, and a person who has already saved money or has any assets will not be penalised as he was, in fact, under the other Act for having these particular assets.  The Act of 1941, I think, covers cases only up to a date in 1940, and the Minister in the other House very fairly met the case with regard to Guards who lost their lives before 1940&mdash;from 1922 to 1940&mdash; by saying he would consider the question of paying an <i>ex gratia</i> sum in cases of genuine dependency.  I think that is a very fair offer.  In that way the whole question is now being properly met.  It is a lamentable thing that we should have to make provision for any such cases at all, but that is a matter into which there is no use entering now.</P>
      <P>I should like to make one other point.  A few months ago a school inspector was murdered.  When I got this particular Bill, it struck me that school inspectors should come under analogous provisions.  This school inspector was not killed by accident&mdash;he was murdered by a person because he was a school inspector.  I think it is clear that his death arose out of the performance of his duties as a State servant, and it seems to me in that case that where a member of the State service loses his life because of the performance of his duties, the principles of this Act should apply.  Fortunately, such cases are rare indeed, but we would all hope that they would be very few and far between.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter can be dealt with in the same way as the Minister intends to <Col N="1103" /> deal with the dependents of Guards who were murdered in the performance of their duties before the date of the 1941 Act, that is, previous to 1940. I know that the Minister, not being the Minister for Finance, is not in a position to make a declaration on this subject.  But I think the principle of the measure is good and sound, and the provisions could apply to the very rare and exceptional cases outside the Guards on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with Senator Hayes that the principle of the Bill is good.  I think the principle is extremely bad.  An Act was passed in 1941, to provide compensation for Guards' dependents in certain circumstances. Now, that Act has been invoked in the courts in certain cases which fell within its scope, and somebody has discovered that the compensation awarded and granted is inadequate. This is a proposal to require the court to review the decisions already given with a view to increasing the compensation, because this Bill provides specifically that the court may not reduce the amount of the compensation under review.  I think that this House ought to set its face definitely against the Executive endeavouring to mend its hand whenever it finds that some piece of legislation is not giving the results it was expected to give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A return was issued in the Dáil last week or the week before showing the amounts granted in the cases which were decided under the 1941 Act.  I am not arguing that these amounts were excessive at all, or that they were adequate.  I am arguing only that these are the amounts which the court considered reasonable within the framework of the 1941 Act, an Act passed four years ago, to deal specifically with this kind of case.  We all feel horrified when we read of the killing of a Guard in the discharge of his duty, and we all feel that there should be proper compensation for his dependents, but some of us also feel that the manner in which it is sought to effect that purpose is entirely undesirable. In some of the cases, compensation <Col N="1104" /> varied a great deal.  In one case it was an award of £500, in another case £870&mdash;that case is not finally decided yet.  In another case it was £1,150, in another £1,300, in another £1,470, and in another £1,654. These may be totally inadequate amounts, but there is nothing to prevent the Minister, or the Government on the initiative of the Minister, from making good the deficiency in another manner.</P>
    <P>If the Government consider that in a particular case the award which the court was entitled to make was inadequate in the circumstances, I submit that the Government might reasonably make an <i>ex gratia</i> grant of such an amount as in their opinion might be adequate in the circumstances.  This Bill is produced without any suggestion of what is involved.  What is it going to cost?  What is the Minister's estimate? It may cost £100 or £10,000, but we are left completely in the dark. The Minister has given us no estimate of what is involved, even in existing cases, when this Bill becomes law.  I am objecting to the principle of the Bill on the grounds that the Executive should not be encouraged to mend its hand in this manner by bringing in legislation with retrospective effect to achieve something which both Houses of the Oireachtas decided would not be achieved when we passed the original Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to say anything on this measure, but as a result of the remarks of Senator Duffy, I feel called upon to give my meed of support to the Minister's proposal. One would like to think, as Senator Hayes has said, that the powers contained in it would never have to be invoked in this country.  It is rather a depressing condition of things that such a measure should be necessary at all, but I for one am glad to see the Minister take the step of standing over his servants and being loyal to the last to them, as he expects them to be loyal to the State.  When all is said and done, in this country as in any other country, the Minister and his Department form the pivots on which the order and peace of this State and its citizens revolve, and the contribution <Col N="1105" /> which we are all prepared to make in supporting the Minister in maintaining his organisation, strong, vigorous and dependable, is really the test of the strength of our citizenship.  As far as I am concerned, I think the onus is upon all of us to be prepared to go at least as far as the Minister is prepared to lead in this matter.  I, for one, will not be found wanting in whatever we are called upon to do.</P>
      <P>I confess I am rather at a loss in trying to follow the line of argument of my friend and colleague, Senator Duffy.  In my county within the last few years a very gallant police officer was murdered, not indeed by any native of my county. but it was a very tragic event there.  The man was very widely mourned.  He had been very highly respected and had many years' service.  He was the friend of a great many people&mdash;the friend of all except the wrongdoer.  He left a wife and children.  I knew that officer and I knew his family, and if I were asked to put an estimate on the loss sustained I could not put it in money.  I do not think anybody could possibly put in money the loss of a man like that to his wife and family.  It is very difficult to try to evaluate in cash what compensation should be paid to the dependents in a case of that kind.</P>
      <P>Senator Duffy joins issue with the Minister in his approach to this problem.  May I point out to Senator Duffy what I think he is arguing for, and join issue with him in his method of approaching the matter?  He said that flaws have been discovered in an Act which has already been passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>There were no flaws discovered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I think the Senator suggested that the Minister discovered flaws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>No. With all respect, I suggest that what has happened is that the courts have not been able to award, under the Act of 1941, the sums which <Col N="1106" /> the Minister thinks ought to be awarded.  That is not a flaw.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;The sums which the Minister intended to have awarded,&rdquo; if you put it like that.  Is that a flaw or is it not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did he not say it in the Act of 1941?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not know until 1942.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not know until the Act was interpreted by the courts. When the courts put their interpretation upon the awards which this House and the other House put in the Act, it was discovered that the Act did not give what the Minister wanted and intended to give and, apparently, what the Oireachtas was prepared to give.  What is the Minister's proposal? The Minister's proposal is to come back to this House with an amended Act which he will pass over to the courts to interpret.  If you like, that is retrospective legislation, but at least it has this advantage over other measures which we have discussed here already, that it is not taking something from the citizen which the citizen had already been given by the courts. In fact, it is going to give the court power to add something that has already been awarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask Senator Baxter to reflect on this: that the court has no power under this Bill to award anything except in the circumstances described in the Bill?  Certain of those people may get nothing under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator did not argue that way when he was speaking. He did argue that, to him apparently, it was preferable, instead of leaving this to be interpreted by a judge in the court, to give power to the Minister himself to make an Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but to give a sum of money&mdash;an <i>ex gratia</i> payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>An <i>ex gratia</i> payment on the part of any Minister is something <Col N="1107" /> that is within the power of the Minister graciously to give.  Does the Senator suggest that that is the way the Oireachtas ought to do its job of work?  Is it not much more open and above board for us to put into an Act what we want done, rather than leave it to the Minister to give this much to one man and a different sum to another man?  It would then be open to anybody to say: &ldquo;Because So-and so got the ear of such and such a person he received so much, but the other fellow got so much less, although he had four children, while the other had only two?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could not that be done under the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is done under the Bill it will be done in open court. As far as I am concerned, I approve of and applaud the Minister's line in this.  While Senator Duffy may differ with us in regard to our efforts to solve the problem, I am sure he is with the rest of us in believing that every officer who is serving the State ought to be conscious of the fact that the services he is giving to the State will be fully recognised by the State if he forfeits his life in carrying out his duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill hardly calls for discussion at all.  We are all very pleased with and grateful to the Minister for having introduced it.  It is a fair and honest effort to adjust a wrong which existed under the previous Bill, and which was not intended by the Minister.  I entirely endorse the addendum of my friend Senator Hayes, in mentioning other officers of the State.  I have in my mind one officer, a school inspector, who lost his life by reason of the position which be <Col N="1108" /> occupied as an inspector of schools.  I will not go into the details.  Although it is not provided for in the Bill, I hope the Minister will be able to make some representations to the proper quarter, and that the dependents of this school inspector will be looked after either by way of <i>ex gratia</i> payment or under this Bill or some future Bill.  I am sure Senator Hayes and myself have the same inspector in mind.  He left a wife and young family, and it would not be right or just that the State should overlook his sacrifice, or the loss suffered by his wife and family.  That was my principal object in speaking, and I hope the Minister will make representations on that matter to the Department concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with that matter, all I can do is draw the attention of the Minister for Finance to it. It seems to be the same principle as the pre-1941 cases.  I must say that I do not understand Senator Duffy's arguments. There is no such thing on this earth, I think, as infallibility.  Bills are brought in, under which the Oireachtas does its best to cover all cases that are likely to arise, but from time to time we find that cases arise which have not been covered, and if we were to allow that state of affairs to continue I think we would be very blameworthy indeed.  If the courts find that something is not covered which the Oireachtas meant to cover, we take the necessary steps to meet that situation here.  That is all I am doing now.  I can see nothing wrong in that at all.  If we were in the happy position of being certain that for the rest of time there would be no recurrence of this, that no Guard would ever again be murdered for discharging his duty, there might be something in the arguments advanced.  I do not know whether we are in that position or not. I hope we are.  Whether we are or not, I think it is better to have the law right, and to leave the courts to decide according to the law.</P>

    <P>In pages 2-3, to insert the words &ldquo;intended for human consumption&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;which&rdquo; in line 35, page 2, in line 44, page 2, in line 2, page 3, and in line 11, page 3; and to delete the words &ldquo;seized in any abattoir or market&rdquo; in line 36, page 2, in line 44, page 2, in line 3, page 3, and in line 12, page 3, and substitute instead in each place for the words deleted, the word &ldquo;destroyed.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>As a result of the discussion on the last day on Section 3 Senator O'Donovan raised a point about carcases that came otherwise than from fair or market and to cover the point this amendment to sub-sections (1) to (4) was made.  As it is on the Order Paper it is rather confused, but what it really means is that there is the same amendment to the four sub-sections. If you take sub-section (1), line 35, it will read &ldquo;intended for human consumption which consequent upon the outbreak of disease have been destroyed.&rdquo;  That will cover the carcase taken from the fair or market and at the abattoir or butcher's shop.  I think that covers the point.  The same amendment is made to the four sub-sections.</P>
      <P>As explained on the Second Stage, these four sub-sections are exactly similar, but each of them deals with a different disease.  The four diseases are: rinderpest, pleuro-pneumonia, foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever.  Sub-section (3), I think, is the one that deals with foot-and-mouth disease, which is of more interest.  If ever there should be an outbreak of rinderpest or pleuro-pneumonia then sub-sections (1) and (2) will come into play, and if there should be serious outbreak of swine fever then sub-section (4) will come into play.  The same in all four sub-sections.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my appreciation of the attitude of the Minister.

      <P>On the Second Reading Senator Baxter referred to the precautions taken by the Minister and by the Department with regard to having people coming from fairs, markets and farms in Great Britain properly disinfected. I am in constant touch with the Minister's Department, and I am quite satisfied that everything possible in that respect is being done by the Minister and his officials.  But I am not quite satisfied that people coming from farms in Great Britain on which there are outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease are dealt with.  It is very difficult for the Minister and his officials to deal with that position unless it is done in Great Britain.  I wish also to refer to the provision of a disinfecting chamber.  I agree that the method adopted in this country is the same as in England and while it is very effective it is felt that it is inadequate for the purpose.  The process consists of a disinfecting box at the North Wall.  Passengers come out of a walled cabin in the ship and march into the draughty disinfecting box on a rainy or snowy morning and have to wait in a queue for their turn to enter the disinfecting box.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While those engaged in the cattle trade would suffer such inconvenience for the sake of keeping the disease out of this country it is not right to ask them to do so if it can be avoided. There should be a proper disinfecting chamber at the North Wall.  There cannot be any other method than disinfecting boxes, but proper accommodation should be available at the North Wall and Dun Laoghaire, where those concerned could wait in comfort before being disinfected.  While England continues <Col N="1111" /> to import meat from countries that are always infected with foot-and-mouth disease it will be continually breaking out in Great Britain.  For that reason we will always have to take precautions and incur the expense of maintaining proper disinfecting chambers. I understand that the position in Belfast is worse.  I was told that the disinfecting box is more than half a mile away from the stage where some of the boats arrive.  I think representations should be made to the Belfast authorities, because anything that affects Belfast in regard to the live-stock trade affects the whole of Ireland.  Many of our people when going to and returning from Britain, particularly from Scotland and the North of England, travel via Belfast. Representation should be made for the provision of greater facilities for the disinfection of those coming from Great Britain to Belfast or Derry.  I think the Minister should endeavour to make representations to the Northern Ireland authorities with a view to getting them to consider the suggestions I have made as to having a proper waiting-chamber, or waiting-room, provided for people who have to await their turn on cold, wet or frosty mornings, in order to be disinfected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with what Senator Counihan has said&mdash;that people, such as migratory workers, and others, who may be suspected of having contact, direct or indirect, with possible sources of infection, should be dealt with in a reasonable way, and with as little inconvenience as possible to them, but I think that the officials concerned with that matter take every possible step to prevent the spread of infection, and also to suit the convenience of the people concerned.  As the Senator himself has pointed out, every possible precaution should be taken to prevent the spread of the disease by avoiding contact between those suspected persons and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry, however, to hear what Senator Counihan said about nothing having been done in regard to what he called out-of-date methods of disinfection, and the long waiting list.  In view of what he has said, I shall certainly <Col N="1112" /> look into that matter&mdash;as a matter of fact, it has been mentioned to me already, and I have been inquiring into it&mdash;with a view to trying to do something to alleviate the hardships involved through a long waiting list. However, I would suggest to the Senator that we ought to do something in that regard in this part of the country before approaching Belfast: that we ought to put our own house in order first.  However, I shall make inquiries about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 17, Section 23, after sub-section (5) to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>For the purposes of effective maintenance of an existing drainage district by the council of a county or councils of counties (as the case may be) it shall be lawful for the said council or councils to execute such maintenance and carry our such repair to existing watercourses situate wholly or in part outside an existing drainage district as appear to the council or councils to be necessary or expedient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this amendment, I seek to give powers to a county council to carry out maintenance or repairs of drainage work on a watercourse that, in the opinion of the council concerned, is necessary, from the point of view of maintenance or repair, because it has been indicated by the Report of the Drainage Commission, that many drainage districts were not effectively planned: that they were planned purely in regard to their economic aspect, and that, because of that fact, many watercourses that should have been included in the drainage district were not included in it and, as a result, no maintenance or repair work was carried out in connection with that particular watercourse.  I can see that for a long time local councils cannot be charged with that maintenance, and in order to ensure the best possible results I think it is necessary to insert <Col N="1113" /> this amendment in the Bill to enable those watercourses to be repaired or maintained by the county councils in order to prevent flooding and other damage.</P>
    <P>I agree that this may cause a certain amount of worry to the Parliamentary Secretary, and that he may see something in this amendment that I do not see.  Perhaps it may not be necessary to insert this amendment, because I think that Section 49 gives power to the county council or to any Minister of State to initiate work on a particular watercourse, but I am not so sure as to whether a county council can have effective work carried out on a water-course in a drainage district under that section.  Perhaps it is possible to do so, but I, personally, fail to see how the money can be provided under that section for the carrying out of such work.  Again, I fail to see how the work can be carried out by various Ministers of State, or how the money can be provided by the county council, because it is clear to me that money can only be provided for the maintenance of existing drainage districts. For that reason, I am not satisfied that it is possible for a county council to carry out maintenance and repair work in connection with an area that is not wholly within a drainage district. That is my reason for moving this amendment.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary may be able to clarify this point, and if he can do so, I shall be satisfied to withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment would have the same effect as an amendment which was moved by the Senator on the Committee Stage&mdash;amendment No. 22, I think it was&mdash;which was subsequently withdrawn.  On that occasion I indicated my attitude on this matter, and I do not think there is any reason or necessity for my going into it now.  I do not see that the giving of the powers set out in this amendment is necessary; nor do I think it would be wise to give them, nor, if they were given, that it would be wise, or even possible, for a <Col N="1114" /> county council to exercise them.  I can only repeat that county councils will have their hands full in trying to maintain, up to a decent standard, the districts within their control and those which will be handed over to them under Section 23.  To think or expect that county councils can go outside the district and engage in doing new drainage work, to my mind, does not make sense.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 40, Section 57, before sub-section <Col N="1116" /> (6), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(6)  The commissioners may on the application of a drainage board or of a drainage trustee, and with the consent of the Minister, enter into an agreement with the council (in this sub-section referred to as the internal council) of a county in which is situate so much of a drainage district to which this section applies as is inside the State providing for the control and management of that part of such drainage district and the maintenance of the drainage works therein by the internal council.</P>
    <P>There has been so much discussion about this matter that I am reluctant to open up the question again, but we should have the situation clarified.  For the benefit of the House, I should like again to indicate briefly the peculiar position which will exist after the passing of this Bill.  In Cavan, where we have a drainage district partly inside and partly outside the State, part of the drainage works will be administered by the county council and other parts by drainage boards or trustees. My amendment seeks to enable the Minister to make arrangements with a council, such as Cavan, Leitrim or Monaghan County Council, to take over the maintenance of some of those works which form part of a scheme which is partly inside and partly outside the State.  I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary what the difficulties in the way of that being done are.</P>
    <P>I want to explain to the House the situation which will have been left unsolved after this Bill becomes law. The Lough Gowna, Lough Oughter scheme has within it part of the drainage of the Erne, on which a considerable sum of money has been spent. Where that money has been spent in recent years, the district is to be administered by the county council.  But there is the extraordinary position that only part of the district is to be administered by the county council. Another part is to be administered by drainage trustees.  The carrying out of this scheme involved the raising of a sum, as a county at large charge, by Cavan County Council of about <Col N="1117" /> £30,000.  £30,000 was to be raised off the riparian owners and there was to be a grant of £30,000 by the State. Ratepayers in Cavan will get three demands for drainage rates.</P>
    <P>If I am a riparian owner, I may get a demand from the county council as a ratepayer for my portion of the £30,000 which the county as a whole contributed to the original drainage works. Then, I may get a demand for another sum as a riparian owner whose lands were benefited as a result of the drainage works.  Although I may have had some of my lands drained by the carrying out of the work, there may be other drains on my land which were not improved or touched and which are still part of the Lough Gowna, Lough Oughter district.  I shall, accordingly, have a further demand from the drainage trustees administering the drainage district.  That is the position in Cavan at the moment and I do not know whether Senators will be able to make head or tail of it.</P>
    <P>A drainage board operating in part of that area has recently sent out a demand to 1,200 ratepayers for a drainage rate.  Some of the demand notes show that they are partly for current expenditure and partly for arrears going back as far as 1923.  There is utter confusion there at the moment. It is impossible to expect anything to be done until that situation is straightened out.  I saw a protest meeting advertised the other night in connection with this demand.  The attitude of the people is that they will not pay.  They say that, in a large part of this district, no work was done over the period on many of the drains and that they are being asked to pay for a service which they never got. The only way of straightening out that position is to allow the county council to take over the maintenance of the whole district.  They are levying a rate over the whole county for portion of the maintenance charge already.  I see no way of having the matter satisfactorily handled except by giving the county council the power I suggest.  I do not know what the objection of the Parliamentary Secretary to that course is.  Unless something be done, there <Col N="1118" /> will not be any rates paid or maintenance work done, and the problem will be a much bigger one because of the neglect.  In sub-section (6) the Parliamentary Secretary is taking power to make arrangements with the council of an outside county.  That matter has been already discussed.  What I am asking is that the commissioners may, on the application of a drainage board or of a drainage trustee, enter into an arrangement with a county council providing for the control of a drainage district and maintenance of the drainage works in so far as they are inside the State.</P>
    <P>I urge on the Parliamentary Secretary that this is the only way to bring to an end what I suggest is utter confusion, a position in which there is very considerable apathy, where a limited number are paying drainage rates and where others are not making any contribution. This is the only way I can see by which you can establish some authority that will be recognised and that will make a reasonable effort over the district as a whole to maintain the existing works.  I think if this amendment were accepted it would put the commissioners in a position to get machinery to do work that has been neglected and that will be neglected so long as the present confusion continues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a lot of sympathy with Senator Baxter's amendment because, as he stated, there is a position of confusion in regard to drainage districts that are partly within and partly outside the State. As regards the particular drainage district to which Senator Baxter has referred &mdash; Lough Oughter, Lough Gowna and the River Erne district&mdash; I am not sure whether that is one district or whether there are a couple of districts, but if there is only one district, the position is as Senator Baxter indicated.  That is, that up at the Six-County Border all the district is under the control of the Drainage Board.  The part in County Longford and Leitrim is also under the same board.  In between, there is a new district set up by the final award of the drainage <Col N="1119" /> schemes carried out under the Drainage Act of 1925, about which the Parliamentary Secretary has so often spoken.  If there is to be effective maintenance&mdash;and I should like to see effective maintenance&mdash;I do not think it will be achieved by the Drainage Board unless the Parliamentary Secretary introduces some other method of carrying out improvements because the report of the Drainage Commission indicates that the history of drainage boards shows that they have been a failure.  While county councils have also been to some extent a failure, they have not been the same failure as drainage boards and drainage trustees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Parliamentary Secretary is quite conversant with the needs of this district, but there is another very important drainage district which is also affected by this section, and which would be affected by this amendment. That is what is called the Ballinamore. Ballyconnell Canal.  That is a scheme carried out under the Drainage Navigation Acts from 1842 onwards.  The cost of that scheme as set out in the final award was £258,651 10s. 5d. Approximately £30,000 was raised by the Grand Juries, the predecessors of the different county councils, of Fermanagh, Cavan, Leitrim and Roscommon, in certain proportions as set out in the final award.  As well as that, a Navigation Board was set up to control the navigation of that canal.  It was a fully-fledged canal with locks and all the paraphernalia associated with a canal.  In the event of the inability of the navigation trustees to collect sufficient revenue to enable them to maintain navigation, they had power to collect navigation maintenance from the Grand Juries mentioned and subsequently from the county councils. The position at the moment is that the trustees should be appointed by the different county councils.  The County Councils of Cavan, Leitrim and Roscommon do not appoint navigation trustees, but the Fermanagh Council does appoint trustees, and these trustees have the right under the Act setting them up to collect from the councils a sum to maintain navigation <Col N="1120" /> on the canal that was never intended to be a success from a navigation point of view.  When the canal was built the only form of transport was horse transport, and yet that canal connected up certain lakes across which it was impossible to have water transport unless we had water horses.  The canal is now in a state of disrepair.  I agree that it is of great importance as an arterial drain.  Great improvement was effected from the drainage point of view by the carrying out of the scheme in the first instance.  It was a very costly scheme as I have shown by the figures set out in the final award.  That work, together with the River Erne mentioned by Senator Baxter, would be covered by this amendment of Senator Baxter.</P>
    <P>I have, as I say, a certain sympathy with Senator Baxter's amendment as this is a burning question, but I am not so sure that Senator Baxter's amendment will cover the matter because apparently the Parliamentary Secretary does intend to make some arrangement with an external council, as the Bill puts it, to carry out certain works.  I agree that that would be the more efficient way of dealing with the matter, but in the event of failure on the part of the Parliamentary Secretary to achieve agreement what is going to happen?  It will mean that those drainage districts are going to be left in the same old condition and that nothing is going to be done with them unless the Parliamentary Secretary undertakes to bring in legislation at a later date if he is satisfied that nothing can be done by way of making an arrangement with any external authority.  We have no guarantee as things stand that any arrangement made by the county council will have the force of law in the area where it is proposed to make that arrangement with the external authority.  If we are to gauge how far the Parliamentary Secretary will be successful, we have the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the Dáil when introducing his Electricity (Amendment) Bill gave some indication as to the measure of co-operation he got from the outside authority.  There is a possibility that the Parliamentary Secretary will find himself in the same <Col N="1121" /> position.  For that reason, I think that the Parliamentary Secretary, if he thinks this amendment is unacceptable, should undertake to re-examine the position and guarantee to introduce amending legislation so as to bring about some measure of relief and water control in the areas where those drainage districts are partly within and partly outside the State, in some form such as would enable the county councils to take responsibility for as much of the drainage districts as is within the State, in the event of failure to achieve some arrangement for maintenance in the first instance and reconstruction in the second instance.  I think that would be the proper thing to do&mdash;that in the event of failure to achieve the results which the Parliamentary Secretary hopes to achieve under this section, he would guarantee to the House to bring in amending legislation.</P>

      <P>Suppose I tried to get the Senators who are interested&mdash;before I am asked to make a further investigation of the problem&mdash;to study it a little more, I imagine that we will be making some progress.  Senator Baxter has referred to the Lough Oughter, Gowna and River Erne district. That is not a trans-border district. Who ever said that it was?  That district has nothing to do with Section 57 which we are now considering.</P>

No confusion of the kind mentioned by Senator Baxter can arise regarding it as to the many different rates payable in that district.  There is no such situation in existence.  Look at the Lough Gowna district, extending from Lough Gowna almost to the Border, below Belturbet.  All that portion in the hands of the drainage board of trustees will be transferred to the County Councils of Cavan and Leitrim.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only two trans-border districts affected by the section. One is the Lough and River Erne district, and the other is the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell district.  During the previous discussion I set out as clearly as I could the manner in which we propose to deal with these districts. The Lough and River Erne district is scarcely concerned, in so far as the area over which we have jurisdiction is very small, but the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell district is different. I clearly stated the position on the last day.  Senator O'Reilly and Senator Baxter know that district fairly well. If there is a board elected by the riparian owners of Leitrim, Cavan and Roscommon&mdash;a board of 15 members&mdash; in the manner I have described, with the vast majority elected from Leitrim and Cavan, with powers to strike the rates they regard as sufficient for maintenance and with powers to recoup these riparian owners from the general rate of the County of Leitrim, I cannot for the life of me see how that form of maintenance of the district should fail.  Whether I am right or wrong, I give it as my opinion that there is every reason why that district should be maintained, even at a higher standard, under these provisions, than the districts that are being transferred to the councils of the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
      <P>In the first place, the district to which Senator Baxter has referred is not affected by this section.  This section was designed for such a district as Ballinamore and Ballyconnell.  The Fermanagh part of the area is outside our territory and jurisdiction, but so far as the maintenance of that district is concerned, I can see no reason why it would not be maintained at least as good&mdash;and I would venture to guess that it would be maintained at a higher standard&mdash;as any other district under the control of local authorities.</P>

Are we to have any machinery whereby these navigation trustees will become effective?  Although they were supposed to be in existence for many years, there was not, in fact, any maintenance done.

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 42, Section 58, to insert after sub-section (4), line 32, the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( ) If, within one month from the passing of this Act, the council of the County of Limerick by resolution (of which resolution notice has, within seven days from the passing thereof been given by registered post to the commissioners) requests the commissioners to prepare and publish a draft award and ultimately a final award for the Mulkear and Cappamore Drainage Scheme, in accordance with the provisions of Sections 14 and 15 of the Act of 1925, the commissioners shall thereupon proceed so to do and the three immediately preceding sub-sections of this section shall on the receipt by the commissioners of notice of such resolution be void and have no effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording of this amendment is somewhat innocuous.  In reading it in the ordinary course, if one did not appreciate the point of view that was behind it, one might not realise that it effects and substantiates what I consider one of the most vital principles for which this House should stand. The Parliamentary Secretary, and also &mdash;having regard to the end of the second last day's sitting&mdash;Senator Hearne will be relieved to hear that I have no intention of discussing the merits of the Mulkear and Cappamore drainage scheme, or whether the river flows up the hill or down the dale.  I am interested purely in an objective principle, an objective principle which it appears to me that Section 58 of the Bill, as introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary, completely and absolutely violates.  We all know that there was, in connection with this scheme, litigation in the High Court, <Col N="1126" /> and I want to say now at the very beginning that I am in complete and absolute agreement with the Parliamentary Secretary when he says that the entire effect of the judgment of Mr. Justice Overend was that the next day the Commissioners of Public Works could have made a new draft award, could have held a new inquiry under the inspector as provided by the 1925 Act, and could eventually have made a final award.  That was the entire effect of the judgment of Mr. Justice Overend, and, if the effect of this section were to leave it at that, then there would be no reason at all for the amendment which I have down in my name.</P>
    <P>We have got to go back a little bit on this.  The situation as I see it was that the Limerick County Council, after the draft award had been made, and when the inquiry on that draft award was being held, went into the inquiry and put it up to the inspector at that time that the works were not ripe for an inquiry, and that the inquiry should, therefore, be postponed until the works were completed.  The inspector held a different view, and in consequence of that I am informed that the representatives of the Limerick County Council withdrew from the inquiry, and that the inquiry continued without them.  At this stage, the Limerick County Council sat down to consider what their rights really were. Having sat down to consider their rights, they were told by their legal advisers that their rights were this: That the only way in which they could get considered the matters which they held should be considered at the inquiry was to move in the courts so that the draft award would be upset, and that when that draft award had been upset, a new formal inquiry would have to be held, as a result of which they would be able to bring in evidence to their heart's content to show at that inquiry the merits of the contention which they wished to put forward. Accordingly, they introduced their proceedings in the High Court, and those proceedings wended a very long and tedious way.  I understand that practically the entire delay from time to time arose because there were negotiations shuffling backwards and forwards <Col N="1127" /> between the various parties to see if a way out of the <i>impase</i> could be arrived at without recourse to the decision of the judge.  No way out was found, and it had to go to final judgment. As a result, in that final judgment Mr. Justice Overend declared, as the Parliamentary Secretary rightly said: &ldquo;Yes; the Limerick County Council are entitled to have a new draft award and a new inquiry.&rdquo;  At that new inquiry Limerick County Council alleged that they could bring forward certain matters on the merits of this claim as to whether they should or should not rightly be considered as part of the cost.  I am not going to discuss whether Limerick are right in that, or whether they are not.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion, when discussing this Bill in Committee Senator Madden put down an amendment which was ruled out of order.  The effect of that amendment was to ask me to judge that Limerick were right under the merits of their claim, and that the commissioners were wrong.  If that amendment had been pressed, I would have felt that I did not know sufficient about the matter to judge in that way, and that I could not, therefore, support the amendment.  I would have felt that the amendment was calling on me to take over a position for which I had neither capabilities nor time nor information nor evidence available.  In consequence, even if the amendment had been in order in accordance with Standing Orders, we could not possibly have accepted it there and then.</P>
    <P>Now, I turn to an entirely different aspect of the situation, and I find that just what Senator Madden was asking me to do for Limerick County Council the Parliamentary Secretary is asking me to do on the other side in his section as it stands.  His section as it stands is asking me to accept that the Commissioners of Public Works are right and that the Limerick County Council is wrong.  I am not going to take up that point of view either.  I am not a judge, and I suggest that this House is not a body of judges.  It is our duty not to judge on the rights or the wrongs of a particular case; not to <Col N="1128" /> judge whether an individual is correct in his view and in his interpretation of the law as it stands, but to ensure that we, so to speak, keep the ring open; to ensure that we keep it open for an individual or for a local authority&mdash;because there is no difference so far as I can see&mdash;to have recourse to the rights that he is given, and to ensure that the person properly qualified to judge does judge when it comes to the point.  I do not know, and again I suggest that it is not for us to decide, whether the Commissioners of public Works or the Limerick County Council were right as to what could or could not be done at an inquiry.  All I suggest is that we are bound to satisfy ourselves that one of the parties to litigation has a <i>bona fide</i> belief that he has a case, and that, when we do satisfy ourselves that that litigant has a <i>bona fide</i> belief that he has a good, sound and just case, it is not for us to step in and say: &ldquo;No; you are not going to go on with that case. Although you have got over the first fence, we are not going to let you even come to the second.&rdquo;  That is the whole point in this particular trouble.  It must be considered as one continuous course of litigation&mdash;the setting aside of the draft award and the holding of the new inquiry.  The Commissioners of Public Works were told that their draft award must be set aside; that Limerick had, so to speak, got over the first fence.  Now, when they are coming along half way to the other, the Commissioners of Public Works or the Parliamentary Secretary are saying: &ldquo;You are not going to be allowed to go any further.  You are not going to be allowed to pursue your rights any further&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>All I have suggested in this amendment is not that the Limerick County Council are right&mdash;because I do not know whether they are or not&mdash;but that there was at the date when the Limerick County Council first started their litigation certain statute law in force.  All I am saying is that so far as they&mdash;the people who proved that the Act was not what everybody up to that had believed that it was&mdash;are concerned, they should not be penalised because they went into the <Col N="1129" /> courts to prove that the Commissioners of Public Works were wrong.</P>
    <P>If the section is passed in an unamended form that is what will happen. It is not only a question of Limerick County Council and the Commissioners of Public Works.  It is a question of every individual in the State versus a Government Department. If this particular principle is accepted, that no matter what words are put down in black and white by the Oireachtas, if these words hurt or harm a Government Department, and if an individual should prove that the Government Department was wrong, and that he was right in his interpretation of them, if in such circumstances the same thing can happen, that individual will be told that there has been a precedent for retrospective or retroactive&mdash;whatever term you like to use &mdash;legislation to be brought in to nullify the decision of the court.  If there is retrospective legislation that individual will be told: &ldquo;If you choose to pursue your case there is the same danger that the same thing will happen again.&rdquo; The result will be that the individual will have no right against the Government of the day no matter what that Government may be, and we will find ourselves disintegrating and going down hill to the position in which the courts which we honour and respect will not get that respect and honour which is their due.  For this reason, and not on the question of merit of the particular case of the Mulkear, I strongly urge the Parliamentary Secretary and the House not to accept that principle, and that the judge appointed by the Act of 1925 on which the Limerick County Council started the litigation should be allowed to consider the litigation commenced by them some time ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was in Committee and I spoke on the matter at that time I had not access to the pleadings or the judgment of Mr. Justice Overend or the order made on foot of that judgment.  The Parliamentary Secretary has kindly placed these documents at the disposal of Senators and I have taken advantage of them to glean for myself some of the facts of this litigation.  I could not obtain from <Col N="1130" /> them any information as to the merits of the engineering scheme itself but I am satisfied that the order made by Mr. Justice Overend was that the draft award was premature, that the public inquiry on foot of the draft award was premature and was not a public inquiry for the purposes of the draft award, and that the final award made was a nullity because it was not made in accordance with the provision of the draft award.  Mr. Justice Overend awarded costs of the action to Limerick County Council.  I presume that they have been paid or are about to be paid when they have been taxed in the proper way and on the proper scale.</P>
      <P>There is no question of taking from the Limerick County Council the costs that have been awarded in the action. The result is that at the present time everything is open.  It is as if the draft award had never been made or the draft award inquiry had never been held.  What is to be done in these circumstances? The 1925 Act is there and the Commissioners of Public Works would be entitled to make a new draft award and hold a new public inquiry on foot of that draft award and then make the final award.  Of course, there may be slight legal difficulties in carrying out that scheme.  It seems quite simple, but there may be difficulties which are not yet apparent.  At all events that would be the normal position in a normal time, that is, if the law should take its course.  In this case, however, the Commissioners of Public Works feel that the time has come when the final award must be made in respect of this drainage scheme, so that as a result of the final award the scheme may be handed over to Limerick County Council for maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to the present the drainage scheme has been in the air.  It has been in the hands of the commissioners for a number of years, due probably to the long litigation extending over six years, almost as long as the drainage scheme itself.  Commonsense would require that this matter should be brought to an end here and now. While the strict legal right of the county council would be to have this process all over again&mdash;the draft award, the inquiry and a final award, <Col N="1131" /> and perhaps another action to last seven or eight years&mdash;while that may be their legal right, it is I think contrary to commonsense and good business.  After a war peace is made.  Limerick County Council and the commissioners have, to my mind, waged a foolish war for the last eight years.  There have been deputations at intervals from Limerick County Council to the Commissioners of Public Works.  Personally, I am opposed to these unwieldy deputations from local bodies which come to see heads of Government Departments, because there is a certainty that among these deputations there is a number of tactless individuals who immediately upset the applecart of negotiation once they enter Government Buildings.  I have the firm belief that we would not be discussing this section here to-day if there had been tact and commonsense on one side or both sides in this case.</P>
    <P>I have here an Act which was passed in 1943, the District of Fergus Drainage Act.  It was passed in pursuance of an agreement between the County Councils of Galway and Clare and the Commissioners of Public Works.  If Limerick County Council and the Commissioners of Public Works had agreed that it was time to bring this Mulkear Drainage Scheme to an end it would have been ratified without question by legislation. In this case, however, a different course has been taken.  We have heard a great deal about retrospective and retroactive legislation, but this is not, in my opinion, retrospective legislation. It is <i>ad hoc</i> legislation, which is worse than retrospective legislation because we are legislating against an individual.  It may be a county council but we can call a county council an individual and we can take the riparian owners to be an individual.  The position then is that a Parliamentary majority can at any time pass legislation to oppress an individual.  I think that is wrong and personally I would fight against it to the end.</P>
    <P>Now, if we accept the principle that <i>ad hoc</i> legislation is wrong&mdash;it may be necessary in certain events, but it is unnecessary, I say, in this case&mdash;then, <Col N="1132" /> we must soften the hardship of <i>ad hoc</i> legislation as best we can.  The Commissioners of Public Works rightly feel that they have had hard luck in this matter.  They worked hard on that scheme; they did good work, and I, personally, am satisfied, that the engineers in charge of the drainage schemes under the Board of Works are thoroughly competent to do their work. Personally, I can say that I have always found them obliging and helpful; and I believe that if in this case they had been taken in the right way we would never have been troubled about this matter.  However, all human beings are not built in the same way and, unfortunately, by reason of certain things which do not appear on the surface here, we have come to debate this very important matter.</P>
    <P>The members of Limerick County Council are people of good standing. They have always honoured their commitments, and they have merits on their side&mdash;so, of course, have the Commissioners of Public Works.  I think that the proper solution of this problem is this: that the time has come to make a final award.  It would not be good policy&mdash;it would not be, as I say, a practical proposition&mdash;from the point of view of the drainage scheme itself, that we should return to these endless controversies that would inevitably arise from another public inquiry.  I, myself, think that the members of the Limerick County Council are not adamant on the question of a public inquiry, and that although, no doubt, they may feel that the work is not fully completed, they may be advised that it is better to accept it as it is, but they certainly feel that they got a raw deal from the Government or the Parliamentary Secretary in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>Now, the final award was set aside by Mr. Justice Overend and, in connection with Section 58 of this Bill &mdash;but it would appear that that final award is again set up for the amount which was set aside by Mr. Justice Overend.  The members of the Limerick County Council are what I might call realists: they are not idealists, like Senator Sweetman, who is concerned with a principle which could be discussed <Col N="1133" /> in an objective way.  The members of the Limerick County Council are very much subjective in regard to this matter.  They are very much concerned with the question of pounds, shillings and pence, which they have to collect from the ratepayers and riparian owners in County Limerick, and their objection is that the Parliamentary Secretary, in effect, asks them to hand him over a blank cheque, that he may fill in the amount they are to pay, and in this case he has filled in the blank cheque to the amount of something over £13,000.  They object to paying that amount over for these works.  They say that the sub-sections which the Parliamentary Secretary has inserted here are not very accommodating to the Limerick County Council, since the only power given to them is the power to borrow money in order to pay him.</P>
    <P>So far as the Limerick County Council are concerned, it is a matter of pounds, shillings and pence, and so far as the Parliamentary Secretary is concerned it is a matter of getting rid of this old scheme, which has been on the hands of the commissioners for a number of years.  The Parliamentary Secretary wants to get rid of it for the purpose of winding up the 1925 Act, so as to get this new legislation put through.  Why cannot there be a reconciliation between the Parliamentary Secretary and the Limerick County Council?  It may be said that the Parliamentary Secretary is not a man who can compromise.  I do not agree with that, because we had an example in this case where, on Section 10 of the Bill, he did compromise with the Minister for Agriculture.  Whether that compromise was a surrender or not, I cannot say, but the Parliamentary Secretary called it a compromise section, and I see no reason why there should not be another compromise section in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has drafted this section with a cut-and-dried demand on the Limerick County Council for a sum of over £5,000 beyond that which the county council originally agreed to pay.  The Limerick County Council say: &ldquo;We are not getting value for our money&rdquo;; and the <Col N="1134" /> Parliamentary Secretary says: &ldquo;You are&rdquo;.  In my submission, the Limerick County Council are entitled to get a reduction for cash from the Parliamentary Secretary, for the following reasons: first of all, in the amount of the total award of £36,000 odd, there is included the cost of the first inquiry. Mr. Justice Overend had held that it was not an inquiry for the purpose of the Act and that therefore the draft award was a nullity.  Accordingly, the Parliamentary Secretary is not entitled to regard an inquiry, which was not actually an inquiry in that sense, as part of the scheme, and to saddle part of the cost of the inquiry on the Limerick County Council.  Secondly, Mr. Justice Overend said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is clear upon the evidence that the works which had been done have resulted in very substantial benefit, though not perhaps commensurate with their ultimate cost.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I am not going into the merits of the case&mdash;I am only taking this extract from his judgment&mdash;but he held that the works were not commensurate with their ultimate cost, and, therefore, not worth what was spent on them.  The money was spent by the Commissioners of Public Works, and the Limerick County Council had no jurisdiction in that matter, and if the commissioners spent more than they should have spent, then I think that the Limerick County Council should not be saddled with that extra expense. Accordingly, I say that there is scope here for a compromise.  That is a matter for agreement between the Limerick County Council and the Commissioners of Public Works, supported by the Minister for Finance, and I hold that the contribution of the Limerick County Council should be £1,000, £2,000, £3,500, or whatever it may be, less than what is provided for actually in the Bill.  However, that is a matter that we cannot deal with in this House.</P>
    <P>Senator Madden made a bold effort to bring about a settlement along those lines.  I think that he went a little bit too far, but in this case the Parliamentary Secretary does not require to have his Bill until 31st March, or some time in March, and it appears <Col N="1135" /> to me that there is ample time for the Parliamentary Secretary to go back to the other House and obtain the consent of that House to some modification of the financial provisions in this section, and then to come back here with such modification, if it is agreed to.  If he were to do that, I think I can assure him that this Bill will go through without a blot on it. It is unfortunate&mdash;unfortunate, indeed &mdash;that this dispute between the Limerick County Council and the Commissioners of Public Works should have marred a great measure such as this Bill undoubtedly is.  This unfortunate controversy has dominated this Bill from the first moment the Parliamentary Secretary introduced his amendment in the other House until the present time.  The Parliamentary Secretary would be well advised, for the sake of the success of the Bill, to start off with the good-will and good wishes of every local authority, because the Commissioners of Public Works, as the drainage authority, and the county councils must work together to make this measure a success.  It would be unfortunate if this Bill were to get a bad start because of this trifling dispute between Limerick County Council and the Commissioners of Public Works.  Blood is thicker than water, and we know that a number of other county councils are in sympathy with Limerick County Council.</P>
    <P>Therefore I suggest that the commonsense way of dealing with this situation is to wind up the Limerick scheme on terms satisfactory to Limerick County Council and to the Commissioners of Public Works.  I agree that the Minister for Finance has contributed, and is contributing, a large sum to the scheme, and it would be a question of only about £2,000 to settle this matter completely.  Limerick County Council would, I think, accept that position and I am sure the other House would also agree.</P>
    <P>It is significant that Deputies of all Parties from County Limerick were united in urging the Parliamentary Secretary not to proceed with this section. The residents of County Limerick feel very strongly about it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> Although I am a native of County Limerick, I am not a resident and, therefore, my temperature is lower than that of the representatives of County Limerick.  Having considered the matter in as detached a manner as I could, I think that neither side should seek its pound of flesh.  If we are to pass <i>ad hoc</i> legislation&mdash;legislation to deal with the case of an individual or a council&mdash;we should be most careful to do so only with the consent of the individual or council concerned.  It would be the worst form of tyranny&mdash;tyranny in the name of democracy&mdash;that a Parliamentary majority should be used to impose an obligation upon an individual or upon one council.  It would be the end of parliamentary government if that were to become a practice.  Such legislation should never be invoked except for the benefit, or with the consent, of the individual or body.  Everybody who has knowledge of the strength of the Executive as against the individual realises that the Executive has the advantage every time.  The Executive found that the Gárda Síochána Compensation Act, 1941, did not carry out its intentions and to-day we had an amending Bill before us.  If it should so happen that the individual failed to get what he expected out of the 1941 Act and if he succeeded in getting a Private Members' Bill introduced, it would be soon defeated if it were not acceptable to the Government.  Therefore, where the Government has a Parliamentary majority, it has a great responsibility to the individual and it should use its power only for the public good and not to impose a penalty or liability upon an individual.  In this case, it appears to me that the Commissioners of Public Works, having considered the judgment of Mr. Justice Overend, said to themselves in so many words: &ldquo;We shall mark &lsquo;paid&rsquo; to the account of Limerick County Council. We shall introduce this section and carry it through the Oireachtas and let those people see that they cannot trifle with a mighty Government Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Whether retrospective legislation is good or bad is not in question here. Retrospective legislation may be good. The retrospective legislation contained <Col N="1137" /> in the Gárda Síochána Compensation (Amendment) Bill which this House passed to-day is good.  Legislation is not good or bad because it is retrospective. So, <i>ad hoc</i> legislation may be either good or bad.  It is good when it is for the benefit of the individual or council or with their consent, but it is thoroughly bad when it is introduced and passed by a Parliamentary majority in the teeth of the opposition of the parties concerned and in disregard of their rights under existing law.  While Senator Sweetman has brought forward this amendment, to provoke discussion on this subject, I think that the better solution would be that which I have mentioned.  If carried, Senator Sweetman's amendment would bring back the old trouble.  I do not know whether the amendment would be effective or not, because the passing of a resolution by Limerick County Council does not appear to be a reserved function under the County Management Act, 1940.  This amendment might require some revision to make that clear.  After the heat and burden of the day, the Parliamentary Secretary and Limerick County Council should realise that there is an easy way out.  The easy way out is for the Parliamentary Secretary to concede that he cannot get his full demand and for Limerick County Council to agree to accept less than they claim to be their rights.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the amendment which has been proposed by Senator Sweetman would not get the parties anywhere and that the Parliamentary Secretary should at all events promise the House that he will consider this matter in conjunction with the Minister for Finance for the purpose of seeking an agreed solution.  If, however, the Parliamentary Secretary should take what we shall call an intransigeant attitude, then I am sorry for him, I am sorry for the Limerick County Council, I am sorry for the Oireachtas with its Parliamentary majority which would impose such an injustice upon a county like Limerick, always ready to honour its commitments provided it gets fair play, and I am sorry for the country as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>We have listened to two very able and, I think, extremely interesting and illuminating speeches on the amendment.  If there was no other case to be made for the amendment than that it evoked these speeches, then, I think, it would have been justified.  But it has also served the purpose, I think, of making it clear to the House, and I hope to the Parliamentary Secretary, that a good deal of the discussion which arose in connection with Section 58 on the last occasion was due to a misunderstanding.  I did not fully realise the extent to which there was a misunderstanding between some of us who spoke and the Parliamentary Secretary, until I read the report of the last speech he made in the debate, and it became perfectly clear that he was under the impression that a number of members of this House wished to take the side specially and definitely of the Limerick County Council as against him, and that that was their sole interest in the matter.  He accused them of endeavouring to obtain for one council an unfair advantage over the others.  It may not have been easy to make it clear to him, but nothing of the kind was in our minds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan has made one thing, I think, perfectly clear, and that is the sole matter with which I am personally concerned&mdash;that it will be bad for the whole future of legislation and will lessen respect for the Legislature and respect for the courts if Parliament intervenes with legislation which deals <i>ad hoc</i> with the case of an individual or a public body and which has the effect of reversing what was the decision of a court in his or its favour.  I have heard again and again of individuals who have gone to Government Departments, and who have been told, no doubt in perfectly good faith, that the opinion of the officials there was that such-and-such was the law.  I think you may safely say that the opinions of officials in a Department is far more likely to be right in nine cases out of ten than the opinions of anybody else, but it does happen from time to time that the view taken by the officials is really the view to which it was intended to give effect <Col N="1139" /> when the legislation was passed, but which as we all know is not necessarily the law.  I have heard it said again and again that although you have first-class legal opinion that the official view is wrong, it would be utterly futile for you to go to the court because you would gain nothing, and you would take the risk of spending a good deal of money.  If you win, it is said, you will only get your costs, and the decision may be upset afterwards by legislation.  I have repeatedly said that is a fundamentally wrong view to take because I did not believe that any Government would adopt the practice of trying to upset decisions which had been given against it.</P>
    <P>I am not very much interested in drainage as I have not got a first-class knowledge of the subject.  Practically everybody in the House supported the Bill but the reason so much time was spent on this section recently was that we wanted to show the Parliamentary Secretary that the principle underlying this section is in our opinion definitely wrong.  It is a principle that may be far more important in future than anything else in the Bill.  For that reason I would urge the House to make it clear that we are not prepared to accept that principle.  We do not want to take the side of Limerick in this dispute, but we would prefer that Limerick should gain a small advantage than that principle should be established in the Bill.  Senator Ryan has made some very interesting suggestions. I am not competent to follow him fully and I certainly am not competent to say whether the lines he suggested on which there might be a compromise are good or wise.  Instinctively I am entirely with him when he suggests that it would be very much better if an agreed section were introduced to amend the Bill.  He points out that the principle against which we are contending would not be violated if there was such an agreement.  I think, however, he is quite wrong in the lines which he proposed to adopt. He says&mdash;he may be right; he is a lawyer and I am not&mdash;that if Senator Sweetman's amendment were passed it would be virtually leaving the matter <Col N="1140" /> as it is and the Limerick County Council would be in a position to gain its whole point.  That may be but I think the object of the amendment and the effect of the amendment would be to leave the question open.  I would reply to Senator Ryan that if you reject this amendment you leave the Parliamentary Secretary with this whole Bill and, what is much more important, you leave no way by which that compromise which Senator Ryan suggests can be brought about.  I think I am correct in saying that this being the Report Stage the matter cannot come before the House again unless we insert the amendment now.  If we insert an amendment on the Report Stage the Parliamentary Secretary is not at all obliged to recommend the Dáil to pass that amendment and it would be open to him to suggest a different amendment which would come back to us.  On the other hand, if we reject this amendment now, Section 58 stands and there will be no other opportunity for compromise, and the principle will have been introduced in the Bill, a principle which as Senator Ryan says was much worse than any question of retrospective legislation.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Senator Ryan made a very clear distinction between different types of retrospective legislation. Just before he got up, I was saying to Senator Sweetman that the term &ldquo;retrospective legislation&rdquo; might be completely misleading.  Retrospective legislation of itself is not something which is fundamentally evil, but what is wrong, and may be disastrous, is to create the feeling that if people go to the courts and get a decision in their favour Parliament will afterwards use its power to upset that decision.  If that were to become the practice you would not have the least respect for the courts.  An individual who in a matter in which the public interest is concerned, although he may have selfish motives, goes to the courts is not doing something anti-public.  He is doing something in the public interest in seeking a decision on a matter in which it is desirable that the law should be made clear.  If nobody were to bring a test case before the courts, we might go on for years before really knowing <Col N="1141" /> what the law on the matter was.  I think action of that kind should be welcomed by a Government Department. I suppose you could not get a dozen lawyers to agree on the meaning of a particular Act until it has gone before the courts and they have certain precedents before them to enable them to interpret it.  It is therefore desirable that these test cases should be brought.</P>
    <P>The real point to my mind is that Parliament should not use its power by bringing forward retrospective legislation to upset what Senator Ryan describes as the right of the individual. That applies equally whether it is a public body, an individual or a group of persons that is concerned.  I think the most practical solution, having regard to all the circumstances, particularly if Senator Ryan's eloquent appeal is going to be considered carefully by the Parliamentary Secretary, would be to pass the amendment proposed by Senator Sweetman.  If it is rejected by the Dáil it may only mean a matter of a saving of time, but during that time an agreement may be arrived at on the lines suggested by Senator Ryan.  I for one would very much hope that that may be so.</P>

      <P>I had not an opportunity of seeing the pleadings before I spoke on the last occasion.  I have seen them since.  The fact of legislation being retrospective is not an evil in itself.  This very day we passed a Gárda Síochána Bill which is not alone retrospective but which empowers decisions that have already been given to be reopened and dealt with in a different manner.  Retrospective legislation, therefore, is not in itself an evil.  What we have to consider in this case is whether we are depriving Limerick County Council of a right.  Now it may be a right that it would be disastrous for then to avail of.  Is it a right that they have?  If it is, I think we ought not to deprive them of their right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand the position, the 1925 Act provided for a draft award that would be made when it was ascertained how much money was spent on this scheme, and how much improvement was made in the land.  This award <Col N="1142" /> would not be made until the scheme was completed.  The draft award was made before that date and a final award, based on the draft award, was made after that date.  The Limerick County Council contended at the inquiry to consider the draft award that it was premature and that it should not have been made, and that they were not bound to go into the merits as to whether the amounts ascertained were right or not.  Eventually, they withdrew from the inquiry but, notwithstanding that, the draft award was made absolute, and a second award was made in the year 1942.</P>
    <P>Section 58 says that we do not hold the 1942 award was right, but that we are holding that all other final awards, if any, were correct.  We are not saying this was correct but, apparently, it takes the figures, if I am right, from the award of 1942 and puts them into the Bill as the amount to be paid by the Limerick County Council.  I do not know whether I am right or not in that, but I regard this matter as depending on the answer.  If the amount mentioned in the draft award is wrong, then I have no objection as it stands, but if the figure of £13,000 mentioned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think it has great bearing on it.  Here then, instead of allowing Limerick County Council to go back to an inquiry and question the draft award and the figures in the draft award, we are precluding them from doing it.  We are saying to them that they must take these figures whether they like them or not, and that is the objection I have to it.  We are depriving them of a right that they otherwise would have.  Senator Ryan seems to think that a very small figure would settle that matter.  I think he mentioned a couple of thousand pounds.  I wish to heavens it were settled for £2,000 or £3,000 and let the section go through as it is.  If it is not settled, I think the Parliamentary Secretary ought to accept the amendment, and I do not think it will do much harm to accept it.  Senator Sweetman wants Limerick to have the <Col N="1143" /> right to ask for an inquiry.  They may not say, within a month, that they want an inquiry, because they may be under the impression that if they go back to an inquiry they will be saddled with more than is mentioned in the award of 1942 after this Bill because, I understand, more work has been done since then.  The cost of that would be added to the sum in the award and, therefore, I think it would be a dangerous privilege for Limerick to avail themselves of the right to ask for an inquiry.  Probably they will not avail themselves of it, but it will do away with their right to say that they are deprived of a right.  It would be no harm, I argue, to accept this amendment and to say &ldquo;we are putting down a certain figure, and we allow you the opportunity to question it.&rdquo; That is the way I look at it.</P>

      <P>When I was listening to Senator M.J. Ryan for a while I was at a loss to know whether I was listening to Senator M.J. Ryan, a former Limerick man living outside the county, or Senator M.J. Ryan, the lawyer.  During the course of the discussion on this matter during the Committee Stage, a request was made to me here for the pleadings and the judgment.  That request was sprung upon me and I naturally could not fully see its implications.  I took the course that was safest, of refusing, with the intention at the back of my mind that if I could do better than that, I should do it.  But against the arguments that were advanced whether my line at the time was reasonable, I safeguarded myself fairly well, I think, in what I said to the members of the Seanad.  There are only two or three lawyers here&mdash;the rest of us are lay people.</P>

      <P>I said that after you have given those gentlemen the pleadings you will find when the time comes that you will get not an opinion, but opinions, and you will find yourself in the same position as you were of having to make up your own mind as to what you thought <Col N="1144" /> of the arguments.  Senator Ryan and Senator Sweetman have, I suggest, avoided on this occasion the real issue that is here.  Senator Sweetman has gone part of the way.  He has admitted that the advice which I secured was right as to the interpretation of the judge's decision, which was that we could have proceeded to hold a draft award inquiry the following day, and that following that draft award inquiry we could have issued our final award.  But neither Senator Ryan nor Senator Sweetman has told us what matters could be raised or what advantages could be secured by the holding of a draft award inquiry.</P>
      <P>I should have liked to hear Senator O'Dea, or Senator Ryan, or Senator Sweetman, say what are the advantages to be derived from the holding of a draft award inquiry, in view of the judge's decision that not a penny piece could be spent on the works after the holding of that draft award inquiry until the making of the final award. I should have liked to have had, not Senator Ryan's pro-Limerick opinion, but his legal opinion, as to how the basis of those schemes under the 1925 Act&mdash;the basis of the three contracting parties, the State, giving a 50 per cent. contribution, the local authority, and the riparian owners the other 50 per cent.&mdash;could have been raised, and as to what further, if any, adjustments could have been made as a result of the holding of this draft award inquiry about which he is now so much enamoured.  As I say, if we went out of our way to place at the disposal of those legal gentlemen facilities which in the normal way are not expected from us, we should then get from those gentlemen an opinion as to what they thought of those technical matters, rather than an hour's contribution telling us of the wisdom of compromise as between a State Department and a local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Dea has made a peculiar point, a point which I cannot understand, as to the significance of the figure of the final award which was upset being reproduced here in this section.  If we could, as I contend, on the judgment about which we have <Col N="1145" /> heard so much, have held the following day a draft award inquiry, followed by a final award which would show exactly the same figure which was shown in the original, and which is now here in this section, why then should there be any objection to it, or in what way does it interfere with the principles which apparently Senator O'Dea is anxious to preserve?</P>

      <P>I am making a case that the lawyers have not met.  They have gone a certain distance with me.  They have agreed that my interpretation, up to the point of the judge's decision, is correct.  I have placed at their disposal facilities which would enable them to go further, and, to the extent that they have spoken here this evening, they have not gone further.  I am entitled to complain, as a result of their failure, and I am entitled to draw the attention of the Seanad to the fact that when I was asked for those facilities during the Committee Stage I did say here that even if it were possible to make them available to you we would find that you would come back here and we would get one opinion from one of you and another opinion from another, and we would have to weigh off the arguments <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> and make our own decision. I am not going to go into this matter again.  I know that Senator Douglas and Senator Sweetman are trying to break the fall.  I started them on the retreat during the course of our discussion on the Committee Stage.  They did not like to go the whole way.  They did not like to desert Senator Madden.  Naturally, they wanted to stay with him as long as they could.  I would do that myself. <Col N="1146" /> There is that feeling of loyalty for one's colleague.  Even though you feel that he is on rather doubtful ground, you huddle around him as long as you can.  Of course, to the extent that you can see any possibilities of securing for any modified course any little support from outside sources, naturally you play towards that additional support as best you can.  I understand that attitude thoroughly and I can see it fully in operation here in this House. But I do want to say this, that there is no question of asking a parliamentary majority to do something wrong or unjust.  What are parliamentary majorities for?  What are governments for?  Parliament can only do business on the basis of a Government securing a majority in the Houses of Parliament for the policy and the schemes that it formulates. If in the other House we have got a majority for the proposals which are contained in this particular section, then you may be satisfied that the House there, having heard the arguments for this section, having heard the entire case from beginning to end, was satisfied that the merit was on the side of those who stood for the inclusion of those proposals here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can only say again that this invitation which is now extended to me to compromise with Limerick makes no impression upon me whatever.  If we are now to desert the whole legal basis of all the arguments that have been advanced, and if we are now to retreat to this negotiating position of trying to get some monetary advantage for the people of Limerick as a result of all this campaign, then I say in the most deliberate fashion that, no matter from what angle you examine this whole problem, Limerick is not entitled to any advantages of the type mentioned in the statement to which we have listened from Senator M. J. Ryan.  I must persist in the attitude which I have taken up.  I must persist in asking the Seanad here to ensure that Limerick will do as other counties have done.  As I said on the previous occasion, Limerick has no more right to ask for relief than the counties of Cavan, Mayo, Leitrim, Sligo, or any of the other poor counties in which <Col N="1147" /> schemes have been carried out and in which costs have been incurred far in excess of the original estimate.  I say that in asking me to compromise and to ask the Minister for Finance to throw a few thousand pounds to the ratepayers of Limerick you have retreated from the legal position.  You have admitted that you have no leg to stand upon legally.</P>
    <P>Coming down to the point that we would be better if the State and local authorities approached these matters with a different spirit, I agree with Senator Ryan when he says that litigation as between a local authority and the State is a most foolish business. That was what I said in the alleged lecture to the deputation.  I said that it was too bad to have this litigation and that it was something with the sense of which I could never agree.  I said that a local authority is a little parliament which has power to strike and to collect the rates just as the Parliament has the power to impose and collect taxes, that both do public work and that I could not see any sense in litigation between them.  That litigation has taken place, I would say, unreasonably, and I am now asked to abandon all the legal arguments that have been hurled about in the other House and in this House during the discussions.  The plea is made to me that we should blot out all this and get the Minister for Finance to write a cheque for £5,000 or £6,000 for Limerick Council, and then the whole thing would be settled.  After the trouble to which we have gone in the matter of providing the legal facilities to which I referred, I did not expect that that was the kind of contribution that I was going to get.  No matter whether it comes from legal gentlemen or from other members of this House, I must say it is not reasonable, and I must resist it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is really very difficult to know what to say or what argument to put to the Parliamentary Secretary, because apparently quite sincerely he does not seem to understand the point that is being made. One of the things he said is that the <Col N="1148" /> Dáil has decided this thing on its merits.  The Parliamentary Secretary ignores the fact that some of us know the Dáil well and know what Parliamentary majorities mean, but if the Parliamentary Secretary is using the English language and using words in their ordinary meaning, what he says is that the Dáil has heard his arguments and decided this question on its merits.  Apparently we are standing behind Senator Madden because of some connection we have with him.</P>
      <P>That is manifestly foolish.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary should examine his conscience, and if I may say so without offence, his predominantly Party conscience, and ask himself, if this point has united Senator Sweetman, Senator Ryan, Senator Douglas and Senator L. O'Dea must there not be something in it, something besides mere partisanship?  Surely Senator O'Dea is not standing with Senator Madden for the same reason as Senator Ryan and Senator Sweetman?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary has some advertence to the position of this House.  We are not concerned, as Senator Sweetman and Senator Ryan made clear, with the merits of this drainage scheme.  Quite frankly I do not know anything about it.  I am not prepared to agree with all even Senator Madden says.  Neither am I prepared to adopt the Parliamentary Secretary's point of view which is put into Section 58 with extreme care and detail.  What the Parliamentary Secretary is doing is saying to Limerick County Council: &ldquo;You have the right to go and secure a judgment but I am having that right taken from you; I am going to keep you from exercising that right.&rdquo;  On that there can be no doubt whatever.  The case made in court against the board was that it had ignored its own procedure.  A great many points about the merits were raised but the net point before the court and the point which the judge decided on was that the procedure under the 1925 Act had not been followed. That was a victory for Limerick County Council.  The County Council may be, as the Parliamentary Secretary thinks, very foolish to go to law.  Certainly people very frequently <Col N="1149" /> go to law and nobody knows better than Senator Ryan that they are very foolish to go to law and incur costs. We are working a system which makes a very clear distinction between the functions of Parliament and of the courts.  We pass the law or take it over as we did in 1922 from the British, but this is the case of an Irish Act.  The judges decide what is meant.  When they have so decided, a successful litigant has acquired a right and no Parliamentary majority has any title to take that right from him.</P>
    <P>As Senator Ryan says, Parliament can do it, but if they proceed to do it and if they make a practice of doing it then you have brought Parliamentary government into disrepute.  That is the point at issue, and that is the point I want to try to explain to the Parliamentary Secretary.  When he says that what he is doing is the best for Limerick County Council, that has nothing to do with the case.  If he proceeded to prove that what he was going to do was the best for Michael Hayes and for Michael Hayes's children, he might think he was right, but we are not asking for a position in which we would be governed for our own good by the Commissioners of Public Works or by the Parliamentary Secretary.  That is the old argument that good British rule was better than bad Irish rule.  A great many of us thought, and a good many of us still think, that any Irish rule is better than British rule, and in the same way we think that our legal rights are very important.  The position here is that the judge found that the commissioners had not followed the procedure laid down under the Act of 1925, and, having found that, gave the county council the right to an inquiry.  It is quite possible that the county council would be foolish to pursue their rights, but what is being done in this section is that very elaborate steps are taken to see that whatever rights the county council have they can no longer have them when this Bill becomes an Act. Figures are put in very carefully to ensure that what the commissioners want will be done, and that these matters will no longer be justiciable as between the county council and the commissioners, that no judge can intervene. <Col N="1150" /> That is injustice and malpractice, something that the Parliamentary Secretary ought not to do.  I know that Parliament can do it, but I would like to put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that it is a very remarkable thing that Senator Ryan and Senator O'Dea, who cannot be accused of being political enemies of his, did not think that Parliament ought to do it.</P>
    <P>I am not interested in this because the Parliamentary Secretary belongs to a political party.  I am interested in the question of principle involved on which I think it would be better for the State to sacrifice some money rather than violate this particular principle.  Senator Ryan said that we could compromise.  I agree that it would be better for the county council, the commissioners and the Parliamentary Secretary to come to an agreement, but I will go a step further.  It is not because I want to benefit the County Council of Limerick as distinct from the Council of Leitrim.</P>
    <P>I say that because I think that when the Government lost a case in the courts they should not have used a Parliamentary majority in order to win their case in this or the other House. Having lost their case in the courts, I hold that they should not come here, either to the Dáil or the Seanad, in order to win their case by overriding the decision of the court.  I am not saying this because I want to benefit Limerick at all, or because I think that they should be paid something to which, perhaps, they are not entitled&mdash; I do not care what they would be entitled to&mdash;but I do suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Government that, from the point of view of the taxpayers, the ordinary voters of this State, and of the State itself, it would be better that some money should be lost by the Department of Finance rather than that there should be an accusation&mdash;apparently, justly founded&mdash;that there is an effort on the part of the Minister for Finance to deprive a litigant of his ordinary rights under the law.  Even if the award given to the litigant might not appear to be quite right, still he should be allowed to pursue his claim under the law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1151" /> The Parliamentary Secretary's point: that he is doing the best he can so far as Limerick County Council is concerned, is, in my opinion, atrociously irrelevant and wrong, since it has nothing to do with the particular principle involved here.  The Parliamentary Secretary may be the best god-father who ever walked into Stephen's Green to take charge of the activities of the Board of Works, but if Limerick County Council do not think that he is the best god-father who ever had charge of these schemes, and if they have gone into court and got a decision, I think they should be entitled to reap the benefit of that decision.  In this connection, I may say that I am glad that Senator Ryan said that retrospective legislation, in itself, is not bad.  For instance, we have had a case to-day in this House in regard to the Gárda Síochána Bill, where it would appear that certain powers that had been taken originally were not as wide as they had been thought by the Government and others, and that the Act might be amended in that respect, and, accordingly, it was amended.</P>
    <P>According to that amendment, no person who was given an award under the 1934 Act can be damnified, and the award cannot be reduced.  This, however, is a different matter.  This particular section of this Bill&mdash;Section 58&mdash;takes away certain rights and I think that Senator Ryan was right when he referred to this type of legislation as legislation <i>ad hoc:</i> legislation which deals with a particular case and which, as he says, takes up, in effect, a big Parliamentary stick and says: &ldquo;You must adopt this position, no matter what your legal rights may be.&rdquo;  The principle we want to advocate is that once the Limerick County Council started legislation under the 1925 Act they should have been allowed to carry it on, and that, no matter what general legislation the Parliamentary Secretary may bring in, the particular litigant concerned should be allowed to get his whack, whatever it might be. Now, the Government and, particularly, the Parliamentary Secretary, in this case are bringing in a new legislative principle.  It has been said <Col N="1152" /> that Senator Sweetman avoided this particular amendment and did not attempt to explain it, but I think that the amendment in itself is quite clear. It was put down, in the first place, explicitly, for the purpose of making this particular point clear as to the judgment of the court, and also for the purpose of avoiding, if at all possible, a renewal of the discussion as to the merits of the scheme and the dispute between the engineers of the Limerick County Council and the engineers of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>This amendment is put down with a view to leaving the engineers of the Limerick County Council in the same position that they had when leaving the court, and also leaving the same rights to the Parliamentary Secretary and the Commissioners of Public Works.  If this amendment were put into the Bill, I suggest that several things might happen.  First and foremost, if the Parliamentary Secretary were to accept the principle of the amendment now, he could recommend it to the Dáil and leave it to the county council to decide for themselves whether to go over this or not.  There is only something over a month to go in regard to this matter, and if the county council did nothing the Parliamentary Secretary could get all he wants under Section 58.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, they decided to move, then they would be within their rights.  Now, I am not concerned so much with their actions I am only concerned with the principle that is involved here, and I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should adopt Senator Ryan's suggestion.  This is an amendment which is concerned with a dispute between the Commissioners of Public Works and the Limerick County Council, and I think I am right in saying that the Parliamentary Secretary could move in the Dáil to have this or a similar amendment inserted in the Bill, which might settle this dispute.  I think that that is all Senator Ryan wants.  It is not a question of anybody wanting to score a victory over the Parliamentary Secretary, or of wanting to give the Limerick County Council more money than they are entitled to.  That is not <Col N="1153" /> what is at issue at all.  The Parliamentary Secretary may not know us.</P>

      <P>Well, then, the knowledge is mutual.  I have seen the Parliamentary Secretary progress from being a rather wild man into being a rather good Parliamentary speaker.  I admit that he has made considerable progress, and I have endeavoured to bring him along that path and teach him a little more.  I should like to point out to him, however, that he would find that, in spite of the fantastic method of election to this House, which was devised by his Party, it is still true that we, in this House, generally have taken a different outlook on various matters from that of the Dáil, and that we discuss these matters from a different point of view.  I think it can be said, that in this House we discuss matters from a more impartial point of view, and that is what we are endeavouring to do now.  The Parliamentary Secretary has had an opportunity of hearing people discussing these matters in this House&mdash;people who could not be accused, even by the most partisan type of persons, of discussing these things from a Party point of view.  In that connection I may say that, unlike Senator Ryan, I have no particular concern with the affairs of Limerick County Council.  I am not even a Limerick man at all&mdash;which seems to be a very bad thing from the Parliamentary Secretary's point of view&mdash;and I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that it would have been better if we had not had any legislation or trouble about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, however, does not mean that we should deprive people of the rights that they have been given under a particular Act and as a result of a particular judgment given in the courts. For that reason, I think that the Parliamentary Secretary should accept this amendment, so as to get this matter settled definitely, without leaving Limerick County Council to believe that they have been deprived of certain legal rights and that the big stick of a Parliamentary majority has been used against them, and, still more important, <Col N="1154" /> without leaving people like Senators Sweetman, Douglas, Ryan and O'Dea under the impression that, from the purely legal or constitutional point of view, a very bad principle has been inserted in our legislation.</P>
    <P>I think that the Parliamentary Secretary would be very well advised to adopt a different line.  When I suggested on the Committee Stage of this Bill, on the last occasion we met, that this matter should be narrowed down, I was particularly concerned that the matter should be discussed, as we have had it discussed to-day, on a particular constitutional basis, but I merely want to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that he could easily adopt the principle of this amendment and that, within a certain time, until the 31st March, which is only about six weeks from now, the whole matter could be settled satisfactorily; so that there would not be a blot upon our legislation. I say that because I agree with Senator Ryan that it is a blot upon a good Bill&mdash;a blot which could be easily removed&mdash;and that if that blot upon our legislation were removed, a bone of contention, which concerns State and constitutional matters, and not partisan matters, would be satisfactorily settled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point to which I should like to make reference. I am afraid that the question of affording relief is a bit overstated. Limerick County Council has been represented as a kind of mendicant looking for relief.  There is a more serious aspect of the matter than that.  If this Bill passes in its entirety, we shall get a scheme which, in one respect, will be defective.  Hundreds of acres have been under water for the past three months, as I was informed last Saturday.  I have unmistakable evidence here that, at Dromalta, 46 acres have been under water for two months.  Land that was never known before to be subject to continuous flooding has been under water since a scheme on which £37,000 was spent was carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, in reply to Senator Ryan, said that after the judgment of Mr. Justice Overend, <Col N="1155" /> they could, on the following morning, have held an inquiry for a draft award. That is the very thing that Limerick County Council wants&mdash;to have a proper inquiry.  At that inquiry, and at no other place, can Limerick County Council question the unreasonable over-expenditure and point out the very serious defect in the scheme.  If this Bill passes in its entirety, an inspector from the Board of Works can visit Mulkear and Cappamore and, having satisfied himself, send a demand to the county council stating that, because of neglect by that council, a sum of £3,000 must be expended by the council to make good certain defects in the scheme.  The defects are there now, as I showed the last day.</P>
    <P>Here is a map by a very eminent engineer who has never been employed by the county council but who has been employed by the present Government in another capacity.  Here are his map and certificate showing the condition of a certain drain called the Eyon, which is responsible for keeping in productivity 1,300 acres. Here is his map, which is confirmed by maps and levels taken by the county surveyor and assistant county surveyors and confirmed by a consultant engineer who held a very honourable and distinguished position in Dublin under the old and present Government. At the inquiry, we could point out to the Board of Works that they were asking Limerick County Council not only to pay £12,000 a year for 35 years but to take over a defective scheme and maintain it.  What will be the outcome if this legislation is superimposed upon us?  What will be the answer of farmers in that area of 1,300 acres whose land has been under water for two months?  My authority for that is the former chairman of the county council.  Cattle driven out two months ago could not go back.  These farmers can bring the county council into the courts and get continuing judgment against them because of this defective scheme handed over by the Board of Works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am beginning to think that Cappamore and Mulkear <Col N="1156" /> rivers must be very long&mdash;longer than the River Shannon, which rises in County Cavan and goes down, ultimately, to County Limerick, and longer than the Erne in which Senator Baxter and I were interested.  I think that we are being confused in this matter.  I have no doubt that, when the final award was set aside in the courts, the Board of Works could have proceeded to have an inquiry and establish another final award.  But that would be far more costly on Limerick County Council.  It might, however, afford certain scope for their lawyers and engineers.  They seem to have a monopoly of legal advice in this House. When Senator Baxter and I were trying to hammer out an improvement in regard to a much more important matter than the Cappamore and Mulkear scheme, we got no legal assistance whatever.  With regard to the final award, I am satisfied that the Board of Works could have proceeded as I suggest.  But who initiated this scheme?  I suggest that it was Limerick County Council.  Prior to the scheme being carried out, these drainage works were being maintained by a drainage board or trustees.  Because of the failure of that body to maintain the scheme, those people were anxious to get the Board of Works to carry out reconstruction.  The Board of Works might not have regarded it as a very economic scheme.  The economic value of the scheme had to be examined under the 1925 Act and the Minister for Finance sanctioned it.  If it turned out much more costly than expected, surely everybody with commonsense will agree that engineers, when they prepare an estimate of a drainage scheme, can be very wide of the mark. I think that it was for that reason the Parliamentary Secretary did not include the estimated cost of the schemes in this Bill.  I voted for the amendment proposed by Senator Baxter to have that principle established in the measure, but I agree that it is very hard to estimate what a drainage scheme will cost.  The value of lands improved will never equal the cost of the scheme.  With regard to this question of retrospective legislation, about which we have heard so much, I may not exactly understand <Col N="1157" /> what it means but, surely, when that scheme was carried out, the people who benefited by it should pay something. Even though it turned out more costly than anticipated, they should pay their share of the cost because the other portion has been borne by the taxpayer.  For that reason, they should not ask for remission of some of the cost, particularly in a county like Limerick, where 1d. in the £ would, I suppose, produce £1,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If there is a principle of retrospective legislation in this section I see no reason for arguing, when it is in the public interest or the common good, that legislation should not be retrospective. It has been pointed out that retrospective legislation, such as we had here earlier to-day, in so far as it affected compensation for the Gárdaí, was wise and good.  I would also suggest that if there is an element of retrospective legislation in this section, it is intended to give even-handed justice to the Limerick County Council having regard to their commitments in the matter as well as to safeguard the interests of people in other counties who have been compelled to contribute through taxation and by county-at-large charges to drainage generally.  I cannot understand why there has been such a long debate on this section because, in my opinion, it is not nearly so important as the section dealing with drainage areas which are partly inside and partly outside the State.</P>

      <P>I have a very distinct sympathy with Senator O'Reilly, on the one hand, in considering that Leitrim is more important than any other county and, on the other hand, with Senator Madden, who thinks that the merits of his belief are all-important. I would suggest to both Senators and to the House in general that in actual fact their sympathies and the case they put forward had nothing whatever to do with the amendment on the Order Paper.  The Parliamentary Secretary, <Col N="1158" /> I am afraid&mdash;no doubt the fault was mine, both to-day and on the previous occasion on which I put it before him&mdash; completely missed the point of the principle behind this amendment.  He rode off on the plea that we ought to have had more appreciation of the fact that he had placed certain information at our disposal by putting the pleadings in the Library.  I acknowledge the fact that he did make the pleadings available to us but I acknowledge it as an act of courtesy in that he fulfilled a duty which he owed to the House.  The House must demand it as a right that we all get information in the possession of any Government Department to enable us to come to a decision on any matter before the House.  The Parliamentary Secretary should not try to get away on that angle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question before the House is perfectly clear.  It is whether the House is going to stand for the rights of the individual as against the Executive or whether the House is going to tip the balance as against the individual and in favour of the Executive. The position is that after the decision of Judge Overend, Limerick County Council walked out of court with a judgment in their pockets which enabled them next morning to have an inquiry set up if they wished, and it is not for this House or for the Parliamentary Secretary to decide what would be the result of that inquiry. The Limerick County Council, as we heard from Senator Madden, maintained in good faith that the result of the inquiry would show that the additions made to the scheme and the manner in which the scheme was carried out were not reasonable and that in consequence the cost of these matters should not be included in the final award.  I do not know whether the County Council is right or wrong in that respect.  I am certainly not going to say that the Commissioners of Public Works did not understand their functions without having a good deal more evidence before me; equally I am not going to take up the position that the other party to the litigation was wrong and that the belief they held was not a <i>bona fide</i> belief or a belief that they should not be allowed to <Col N="1159" /> uphold.  All I am asking is that Limerick County Council should be put in the position that if they wanted to go on as they left the court, they should have the right to do so.  If Limerick County Council decided, as Senator O'Dea put it, that the rights they had when they left the court were dangerous rights but that they were going on with them, then that is Limerick's funeral.  I want it clearly established that they have got that option to decide.  If Parliament should deprive them of that right now, I say that in future in any case of an individual versus a Government Department, there will be a complete and absolute precedent for weighting the scales against the individual.  In consequence no individual can ever hold up his head against a Government Department, and we shall have, not legislation by the Oireachtas, but legislation by the interpretation of each and every Government Department.  At any time that would be dangerous; at any time that would mean that the powers, duties and responsibilities of the Oireachtas would be brought into jeopardy, and might be brought into disrepute as well as the powers and functions of the courts.</P>
    <P>But particularly the present moment, when we have the most stringent and overwhelming power placed in the hands of the Executive under the Emergency Powers legislation, is the one time that we should above all determine and provide that the individual <Col N="1160" /> will be safeguarded as against the Executive. If you pass this amendment it is up to the Parliamentary Secretary to go to the other House, and if he does not like the wording of it to suggest some other form of words by which the principle which we wish to see preserved will be safeguarded.  I am interested in the principle only.  It is up to him to do it.  If you reject this amendment you have enshrined in the Arterial Drainage Bill a vicious principle that will one day recoil on our heads.  One day we will be in the position of being able to say that we started the ball rolling, that we set out to help the Executive to override the individual and to destroy the rights he was given by the Constitution.  That, and that alone, is the issue.  That, and that alone, is the proposal upon which you are going to be asked to make up your minds&mdash;not on whether the Parliamentary Secretary is right about the merits of the scheme, or whether Limerick matters more than Cavan, or whether Meath matters more than Mayo.  It is a question of protecting the rights of the individual against the inroads of a Government Department, and everyone must face that problem.  Everyone knows that individual rights are going more and more day by day, and if you pass that section you have completely put &ldquo;paid&rdquo; to the account of anyone who ever wants to challenge whether or not a Government Department is right in a particular line of country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>In submitting this Bill to the House I avail myself of the occasion to give Senators some information on the general position throughout the country regarding tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>For some time, largely by reason of the changing attitude of the medical profession to tuberculosis, and to a lesser extent due to epidemiological changes in the disease, it has been clear to me that a change in our methods of tuberculosis control, involving radical alteration in the local authority services, was necessary.  For example, reports received from county medical officers of health in response to my inquiry, showed that a great. proportion of the cases referred to the tuberculosis service of the local authority were in an advanced stage of the disease when they sought assistance. Such experience is common elsewhere and has brought about a natural reaction on the part of the medical profession, and it is now universally agreed that the first essential in any campaign against the disease is a successful search for, and detection of cases in an early and curable stage.</P>
      <P>It is unnecessary to point out that to secure early detection we shall require co-ordination of effort between not only the various branches of the profession, tuberculosis experts, general practitioners, public health officers and surgeons, but also the general public, all of whom would need to co-operate in a national endeavour to deal with the disease in a manner that would be calculated to achieve success.</P>
      <P>The development of this aspect of the tuberculosis services maintained by local authorities is at present being actively pursued.  As can be understood, great difficulties confront us, difficulties occasioned by the times in which we live, by the necessity to preserve the rights of the individual and yet safeguard the community, difficulties both expected and unexpected. But of all these difficulties the greatest is the lack of bed accommodation in sanatoria not only for the cases of which we are already aware, but for those which exist below the surface, and which without sign or indication, even to the unfortunate victim, progress towards a fatal stage and infect many others before detection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is futile to develop a full case-finding service until accommodation <Col N="1163" /> is available for the cases found.  It is idle to hope that finding cases will be of much advantage unless the accommodation in our institutions is of a nature sufficiently attractive to the cases found to ensure that they will cheerfully avail of it, and it is clear that provision for the reasonable maintenance of the dependants of a breadwinner who contracts the disease must find a place in our completed plans.  It is probably unnecessary for me to elaborate arguments in favour of the provision of increased sanatorium accommodation.  Apart from the expected demands resulting from case-finding campaigns, Senators are aware that for some time past there has been an acute shortage of beds for tuberculous persons.  In each county there are lengthy waiting lists, and prolonged delays have occurred between the date of diagnosis of the disease and the date of admission of the patient to a sanatorium.</P>
    <P>The number of deaths from tuberculosis in the year 1904 was 8,798, whereas for the year 1938 the figure was 3,216, the lowest ever recorded in the country. For over 30 years it had shown a continuous and pleasing fall.  Since 1938, however, there has been a rather sharp upward trend in mortality, and in the year 1942 the number had increased to 4,347.  In 1943 a decrease to 4,306 took place.  During that year, 24,580 persons received treatment under tuberculosis schemes administered by local authorities, and of that number approximately 8,000 received institutional treatment.</P>
    <P>Reports received from medical superintendent officers of health and county medical officers of health indicate that many factors may have contributed to the rise in the death-rate.  Housing conditions, malnutrition, return from outside the State of workers broken down in health, physical strain of training in the Defence Forces, increase in dancing facilities, movement from rural to urban areas, have all been cited as causes.  It is possible that all or any of these factors may have had some influence, but it is not possible to dogmatise as to the actual cause or causes.  I have fully examined <Col N="1164" /> the position and I am satisfied that some new factor affecting all sections of the community has exercised an influence. There is evidence to suggest that during the emergency we have been suffering from calcium deficiency and that a deficiency in blood calcium may have rendered us particularly vulnerable. This aspect of the problem is under investigation, as are also other aspects, such as housing conditions and malnutrition.</P>
    <P>Considerable public interest has been taken in the spread of the disease in recent years.  The Tuberculosis Subcommittee appointed by the Royal Irish Academy of Medicine made a special report in 1942.  The Hospitals Commission has dealt exhaustively with the question and has recommended the establishment of regional sanatoria in Dublin, Cork, and in the West.  The commission considered that the provision of out-door pavilions in the grounds of existing hospitals would not provide a solution and urged the earliest possible realisation of the projected sanatoria.</P>
    <P>The Anti-tuberculosis Section of the Irish Red Cross Society has rendered valuable assistance, and in December, 1943, it presented to me a report on the outlines of a long-term tuberculosis policy.  They adopted two principles:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  That the standard set up by the National Tuberculosis Association of the United States of America of two beds per death should be adopted in Ireland.</P>
    <P>(2)  That the patients should not be classified as early, moderate, and advanced with a view to treatment in separate self-contained institutions, but that all types of pulmonary tuberculosis should be treated in the same institution with separate accommodation for sputum positive and sputum negative cases.</P>
    <P>The society also favoured the establishment of regional sanatoria and advised that five such sanatoria should be provided.</P>
    <P>The elements of a satisfactory tuberculosis scheme are:&mdash; effective and modern methods of diagnosis which will enable the disease to be detected in the early stages, not only in the <Col N="1165" /> case of persons who contract it but also in unsuspected persons who may be sources of infection; segregation of pulmonary sputum positive cases with a view to the limitation of the spread of the disease; provision of the most efficient and up-to-date sanatorium treatment; medical observation, advice, nutritional and other assistance as required, for persons most liable to contract the disease by reason of their exposure to infection; organisation of assistance measures so that those who require institutional treatment will not be prevented by economic causes from taking advantage of treatment; and, lastly, a campaign of education in the true facts of the disease so that the prejudices which prevent our services operating successfully will be overcome.</P>
    <P>It is apparent to me that of all these factors the last is of supreme importance. All these essential features will be contained in the services of the local authorities following their reorganisation. But they all are pivoted on or are entirely dependent on the sanatorium &mdash; without the sanatorium it is almost useless to find cases.  Welfare work is only fully successful when organised in relation to the sanatorium. Education and propaganda fall down unless there is a record of good results and cures &mdash; tangible evidence of the value of treatment-to show to people.</P>
    <P>The isolation of known open cases is, undoubtedly, the objective of greatest urgency.  The prevalence of tuberculosis infection can only be reduced by this means.  Isolation is the measure which, applied to the smaller number of persons, gives the maximum of protection to the community.  From the knowledge of the disease available not only from sources outside the State but from the experience of our own medical observers we know that if is in the household associates, and those living in close proximity, that the search for the new or unknown cases should begin.  Such a search will reveal&mdash;of a certainty&mdash;many persons hitherto unsuspected who had fallen victims to the disease.  The desirable degree of isolation is not possible unless there are institutions in which persons <Col N="1166" /> can be accommodated.  It is impossible to segregate satisfactorily in their own homes persons who are in an infectious stage.  Failure to isolate such persons or to provide them with the means of removal from their families and from the general community is responsible for the spread of the disease.</P>
    <P>It has always been found that during wars the number of deaths due to tuberculosis increases.  As I explained earlier, it is not always possible to determine the cause of this increase, but this feature has a relationship to the sanatoria project, because a rise in the death rate always is accompanied by an increase in the number infected.</P>
    <P>The principal weapon in the fight against tuberculosis is the approved tuberculosis scheme operated by each local authority.  The medical superintendent officer of health and county medical officer of health of each county as the case may be is the authority co-ordinating the various elements of the scheme in each area.  Under his direction there are assistant medical officers of health with special experience of tuberculosis work, or whole time tuberculosis officers.  I propose in the course of my re-organisation to equip, re-group, and by means of intensive training bring the local authority services up to the highest standard.</P>
    <P>The tuberculosis dispensary is an important element in the scheme, and the successful reorganisation of this service will, I believe, reflect itself in the results of our efforts.  Such centres exist and are necessary for the operation of the tuberculosis specialist services in each area.  It is my intention to develop and equip them, to the greatest possible extent, so that they will be in future the principal diagnostic centres.  They will be equipped so that each centre will provide facilities for the fullest and most comprehensive investigation of the disease.  It is unnecessary to go into details of the development in mass-radiography, tuberculin testing, post-graduate education of personnel, recruitment of staff, equipment and all the multifarious activities contained in the project on which I have engaged, but as soon as supply conditions permit I propose to <Col N="1167" /> lose no time in providing the essential equipment that cannot at the moment be made available, and in the meantime the things that can be done to improve the service will be done.</P>
    <P>The number of beds required has been carefully considered.  It has been decided that we need at least 4,300. There are available at present approximately 2,200, so that 2,100 additional beds will be needed.</P>
    <P>Under present conditions it would be impossible to provide these additional beds without radically changing established procedure.  It has, therefore, been decided to set up a special organisation within my Department to provide and equip sanatoria on a regional basis.  While the Bill proposes to confer the necessary power on the Minister for Local Government and Public Health the powers of local bodies in this respect are not being interfered with, and their responsibility for the provision of measures to combat tuberculosis are not being in any way lessened.  It is intended that the administration of schemes for the treatment of tuberculosis shall continue to be the responsibility of the local authorities.  In fact, the main object of this Bill is to provide these bodies with the institutions which are required to enable them, in partnership with the State, to intensify their efforts in the eradication of the disease.</P>
    <P>In this connection the provision of accommodation for the advanced case has presented many difficulties.  The disease is generally very infectious at this stage and consequently institutional care is imperative.  Where treatment is afforded in small local institutions it is difficult if the institution is utilised solely for advanced cases to prevent the institution becoming associated with such cases only, eventually meaning that early cases, or cases which consider themselves early, refuse to enter.  On the other hand it is not always possible to provide in such local sanatoria satisfactory segregated accommodation for persons in different stages of the disease.  In the new institutions, which it is proposed to establish, separate units can be provided <Col N="1168" /> within each institution for cases in all stages of the disease.</P>
    <P>I propose to establish three new regional institutions: (1) An institution containing 1,000 beds to serve the needs of Dublin City and County; (2) an institution containing 680 beds to be located in Cork to serve the Counties of Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Clare, Kerry and Tipperary (N.R.) and (S.R.) together with county boroughs of Cork, Limerick and Waterford; (3) an institution containing 400 beds to be located in Galway and to serve Counties of Galway, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo, Donegal and Leitrim.</P>
    <P>The eastern region consisting of Counties Carlow, Cavan, Kildare.  Kilkenny, Laoighis, Longford, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Offaly, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow will be served by the institutions at Peamount and Newcastle and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Dun Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>Under present conditions the provision of regional sanatoria of the size contemplated presents many difficulties. The successful completion of such a large building project requires a complete team of advisers, professional and technical, whose work can be co-ordinated under one organisation. The work must be directed and co-ordinated from the earliest stage of planning to the actual completion and equipping of the buildings.  The successful provision of modern hospital buildings requiring highly technical equipment depends not only upon the architects but also upon the various branches of engineering, such as civil, structural and mechanical.  Architects and engineers must work in close harmony as a team and, moreover, they must have available to them throughout the whole course of the work, but particularly in the early planning stages, administrative and medical advisers for consultation in connection with the patients' accommodation, staffing, services, and equipment.  The local authorities would not themselves have that complete team at their disposal. Moreover, their proposals would require examination at the various stages of planning as the work <Col N="1169" /> progressed, while difficulties would likely arise during the construction period calling for decisions on the spot as to alterations in the plans, or the substitution of materials for others not readily available.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that with the best will in the world the local authorities would be badly handicapped, and even with the closest possible liaison with my Department they would be unable to obtain the same co-ordination and speed that would be achieved by a single organisation working together in the same building under one direction. It is proposed, therefore, that the establishment of the sanatoria shall be carried out under the direction of the chief engineering adviser of the Department and his staff, who will have the Department's administrative and medical advisers available for consultation.</P>
    <P>In this manner the work will achieve that necessary co-ordination and direction which is essential.  The institutions will be of a simple character but will, at the same time, provide all the essentials for the modern treatment and comfort of the patients.  Owing to the difficulty of obtaining materials there will be many departures from standard practice.  The building will be designed to have all the normal amenities but some of these amenities may have to be provided later as the necessary materials become available.</P>
    <P>The cost of establishing the sanatoria is provisionally estimated at £1,500,000 and will be provided from the Hospitals Trust Fund. The sanatoria will be transferred to, and will vest in, the local authority when they have been established. The local authorities concerned may be called upon to repay to the Hospitals Trust Board such amount as is considered reasonable, but the amount shall not exceed one-third of the total cost.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill empowers the Minister to direct the Hospitals Trust Board to make payments out of the Hospitals Trust Fund for the purpose of defraying the expenses of the establishment and equipment of a sanatorium, and Section 6 authorises the transfer to a county or county borough <Col N="1170" /> council or councils of a sanatorium when established and equipped.  The local authority or authorities to which the sanatorium is transferred will be responsible for the upkeep and management of the sanatorium.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill sets out the procedure to be followed where land is to be acquired compulsorily.  The various steps to be taken, firstly, by preliminary order and, secondly, by vesting order are defined in Sections 9 and 10.  The remaining sections are concerned with procedure in relation to registration, compensation and deducing of title.</P>
    <P>In bringing this Bill to the Seanad I am confident it will have the approbation of the House.  By this step we are making an advance at a time when the results to be obtained will be greater than might be achieved at any other time.</P>
    <P>I wish the Seanad to regard the provision of additional bed accommodation not only as the most urgent immediate requirement upon which our further progress will depend&mdash;but also as a part of the general plan I have outlined, and which I hope to bring to maturity.</P>
    <P>Given the full co-operation of all good citizens, and the financial resources necessary, I believe the 1942 death rate could be reduced by 50 per cent. within ten years.  Such a possible achievement is worth working for, and if we can convince all concerned that it is worth paying for, one of the obstacles between us and real progress will have disappeared.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, I think, had a great welcome in the other House.  As a matter of fact, I do not know if there was any dissenting voice at all in the other House, and it certainly is a step forward towards tackling the problem of tuberculosis in this country.  The main purpose of the Bill, as the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out, is the establishment of new sanatoria, and that is only one of the steps to be taken before this disease can be properly tackled.  The Bill makes certain definite provisions in regard to the use of the Hospitals Trust Fund towards the relief of <Col N="1171" /> rates, and I rather gather, from what the Parliamentary Secretary said in the other House, that that is a very popular step.  I am not prepared to say whether it is a proper thing to be done, but the fact is that it is there, and let us hope that it is a good thing. In that connection, however, I think that something should be done for the voluntary hospitals because I think that that was the principal object in the minds of the original promoters of the scheme.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out also that this Bill provides an example of centralisation &mdash; of more and more centralised control.  Not only that, but the Parliamentary Secretary was able to give us some very sound arguments in favour of centralised control.  Now, while I realise the soundness of some arguments in favour of centralised control, I cannot help feeling that much of our legislation, aiming at centralisation, is leading more and more towards dictatorship.  Perhaps I should not use the word &ldquo;dictatorship,&rdquo; but I do feel that while centralisation may lead to a great deal of efficiency, in the long run it may not lead to the best type of efficiency.  Of course, I am not an expert or a specialist in these matters.  I cannot claim to be a specialist on medical matters, but I do hear a lot of specialists talking about this matter, and it seems to me that the first thing to be done is to convince our people that tuberculosis is a curable disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tendency amongst a lot of our people up to the present has been to conceal the presence of the disease in their families, as something to be ashamed of, and the man or woman concerned tries to remain on at work as long as he or she can, with the result that when the doctors get the case, the patient is almost beyond cure. I think it will take a lot of educational work or propaganda to convince our people that this is not a disease to be ashamed of, and that, on the other hand, it is a disease that, if taken in time, can be cured.  I understand that in one of the Scandinavian countries &mdash;Sweden, I think&mdash;drastic measures were taken after the last war to combat this disease, that a great many sanatoria <Col N="1172" /> were built to deal with the disease, and that after about 20 or 25 years they were able to devote those buildings to other purposes.  That would indicate, in my opinion, that if this disease were tackled by the provision of additional sanatoria and by other measures, it could be eradicated within the space of a few years.  It appears to me that one of the great difficulties in this country in regard to tackling that disease is the convincing of our people that that is so.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary when he says that of all the things recommended to him by the Red Cross Society, perhaps the most important is educational work of that kind.  I think we also need education or propaganda with regard to effecting certain changes in the diet of our people&mdash; changes in diet which would not involve substantially increased costs. There is, certainly, a tendency, even in connection with the better type of houses which are available now, for people to use kinds of food which are not the best protection against tuberculosis. Whether or not anything can be done to change that habit of mind, I am not so sure.  It is not difficult to pass legislation or to give powers to the Minister but it is very difficult, indeed, to change the habits of a people.  One of the things that fall to be done in any tuberculosis campaign, if this money is eventually to be put to the best use and to bear the greatest fruit, is to convince the people that the disease is curable so as to effect certain changes.  There are people much more qualified to speak on this matter than I am.  I think that certain steps have already been taken to give teachers in vocational education schools some training in dietetics. In that matter, I think that a beginning is only being made although we have in this country and, I understand, in both our universities in this city, people highly qualified in that subject.</P>
    <P>Another point that strikes one about sanatoria is this &mdash; it is a point which has come within my experience &mdash; it is one thing to treat the patient's body, but in the case of a patient suffering <Col N="1173" /> from tuberculosis, ease of mind is almost more important than ease of body.  That is a thing which is much more difficult, and, perhaps, much more expensive to give.  I have known quite a number of cases where the head of a family, told that a certain period of rest was necessary in order to have the disease eradicated, simply could not give the time, or, if he was compelled to give the time, was compelled only by the disease, which was a very bad time for the compulsion to come.  If a man is removed to a sanatorium, and if his wife and family simply get the benefits available under the National Health Insurance Acts and other such schemes, at a time when he requires rather more than he had been able to earn, that interferes with the efficacy of our sanatorium schemes, and will continue to do so.  Another matter which runs hand-in-hand with that is the finding of suitable work for people who are affected, but who are able to work, or who have been cured and are unable to return to the type of work which they did before they were affected by the disease.  Certain steps were taken in places like Peamount to provide work of that kind, but they were not continued.  That should be an essential feature of any scheme devised for the cure of this disease.  Unless, accompanying the sanatorium treatment and the erection of these sanatoria, you have measures of that kind, there is grave danger that the money will be wasted.</P>
    <P>The sum of £1,500,000 seems to be a very large sum, and there is a natural tendency to feel satisfied with the knowledge that we are to spend £1,500,000, and put up three magnificent buildings.  The erection of these buildings is an indispensable part of the scheme to effect a cure, but it needs to be supplemented by other schemes. The expense is well worth while, be cause the loss by tuberculosis is very great, and, as I have said, it has been proven in other countries that the disease can be eradicated.  Whether the situation would be the same in our climate as it is in other countries, I am not in a position to say.  I do not want to go into a general discussion of tuberculosis.  This Bill merely gives power to erect sanatoria and puts the <Col N="1174" /> matter completely in the hands of the Department of Local Government.  Indeed, in effect, it puts the whole matter into the hands of the Parliamentary Secretary.  It was a step in advance that public health matters were segregated, and put into a separate subdepartment.</P>
    <P>That is all to the good.  We have to welcome the proposal that sanatoria be erected but we shall, certainly, have to take other steps to relieve the economic troubles which arise from tuberculosis, as well as other illnesses. There is an immense difference in the position of a man who falls ill from tuberculosis and who receives from his firm pay for a year or sanatorium treatment with pay, provided by the firm, and the position of the man who goes out of his employment and knows that, under the various schemes of which he will have to avail himself, his income will be substantially reduced-and that at a time when he needs more money and when his anxieties are greater.  It is only fair to say that we should not put the responsibility for all these things at the same time on the Parliamentary Secretary, but they are things which are important if a cure is to be effected.  We have learned a great deal recently in connection with this matter.  Bad housing was for a long time regarded as an important cause of tuberculosis, but it appears now that plenty of food in a bad house is much better than scarcity of food in a good house.  Food seems to be the fundamental thing &mdash; which is part of what I have been saying.  I think that we all ought to welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suppose that anybody in the House regards this Bill as controversial.  I feel that it is a pity it is not part of a general scheme for the reorganisation of our medical services.  The Parliamentary Secretary may remember that, some months ago, I proposed that a commission be appointed to survey the whole field of medical services and to put up considered recommendations.  I am afraid that I did not get much sympathy from the Parliamentary Secretary.  I do not know whether or not he was serious when he told me that we had a commission <Col N="1175" /> already &mdash; the Hospitals Commission. Of course, that was not the class of body I contemplated.  I do feel that, if a competent commission were to survey the medical field, it would probably put first in its recommendations efficient sanatorium treatment. To that extent, I welcome this Bill, but I feel that we must have regard to a number of other matters bearing upon this proposal.  I come first to the effect the finances of this Bill are likely to have on our voluntary hospitals.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will deal with this point in his reply.  There is at present £8,000,000, in capital, in the Hospitals Fund.  The income from this sum, I understand, is just about adequate to meet the deficits of the voluntary hospitals.  If £2,000,000 of that sum be diverted to the building of sanatoria, there will not be sufficient income in the Hospitals Fund to meet the deficits.  How is that situation to be dealt with?  Is the Minister likely in the near future to bring forward a scheme to deal with that problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which I feel has a close bearing on this question of medical services, including tuberculosis, is the totally inadequate dispensary system in the City of Dublin and, perhaps, in other cities as well. In Dublin the dispensaries are totally inadequate to deal with the very large number of the sick poor in each district, with the result that they flock into the out-patients' departments of the voluntary hospitals.  If we had the system that prevails in the country in operation in Dublin things would be much simpler.  In the country the sick poor attend the dispensary and the sick who cannot be dealt with locally find their way through the board of health, and on payment, to the specialist hospitals in the cities.  I feel that that should operate also in Dublin.  It would add greatly to the convenience of the voluntary hospitals. At present the matter is in a state of unregulated chaos.  I know one hospital which is faced by a dispensary which is entirely unsuitable and in which, with the best will in the world, the medical officer would be unable to deal with the large number <Col N="1176" /> of sick in that area.  The result is that a large number of sick who are never seen about the dispensary flock into the voluntary hospital and take up the time of the specialist staff.  That is altogether wrong and is a system that needs to be regulated in future.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary also to tell the House how these sanatoria are going to be maintained. I see no difficulty in time in collecting together an adequate staff, but I hope generally speaking that the standard of staffing will be infinitely better than that which prevails at present in the county hospitals.  Having got that staff, is the cost of upkeep going to be on the rates?  That would appear to be unjust.  I do not say that the rates should not bear a proportion, but I think the local ratepayers would have a strong claim on the Central Fund for a large portion of the cost of maintaining these sanatoria.</P>
    <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary say what he or his advisers have in mind in regard to those who refuse to go to sanatoria?  I know, and the Parliamentary Secretary knows better than I do, of a very large number of old people living in small inadequate homes who are a constant source of infection to the younger generation.</P>
    <P>They have no knowledge of the danger they are in.  They are spitting all over the place; the young people are surrounded by infection, day in, day out.  Is it possible to evolve any scheme whereby if these sources of infection are not compelled, at least strong pressure will be brought to bear upon them, to leave these houses and so avoid infection of the younger people?</P>
    <P>Again, has the Parliamentary Secretary any considered plan for health education?  I should regard health education in general, not merely in regard to tuberculosis, as very important. I feel that it would be possible, in co-operation with the Department of Education, the Red Cross and other bodies, to take some step in advance in this matter of systematic health education.  I do not like making comparisons, but of course a great deal in this matter has been done in England.  In certain respects what has <Col N="1177" /> been done in England is definitely prohibited here, but I do not want to get on that controversial ground.  I do feel that we require a systematic approach through the schools and the various organisations to this question of health education.  When you come to the question of priorities, I think the Parliamentary Secretary is right in putting sanatoria in front, but only a little in front, of health education, and not far removed from the question of health education is the question of better housing.  Bracketed in close conjunction with these matters is the question of how we are going to compel people who are a constant source of infection to leave places where they are likely to contaminate younger people.</P>
    <P>I think the method the Parliamentary Secretary has in view to build these hospitals is best.  Much as I believe in the freedom of local authorities, I do not think they are the best suited to build sanatoria, especially as there is only a limited number to be provided.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary is going to seek the free and ready co-operation of ordinary medical practitioners and that he is not going to be guided solely by the advice of his official staff.  I do feel that there should be actively associated with those who are carrying out this work a small and vital body of working, active, private medical practitioners. To these few remarks, stressing especially the financial effect of these proposals on the future of the voluntary hospitals, I just desire to add that the Bill is one that should commend itself to this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>Great minds sometimes think alike and I was rather struck by the truth of that saying when I heard Senator Hayes speak of the habits of people and Senator Sir John Keane speak of a system of educating our people.  For quite a long time I have been listening to the Parliamentary Secretary's Department pressing upon us in County Louth the necessity of appointing an assistant county medical officer.  While admitting that these medical officers do a certain amount of good, some of us felt dissatisfied with <Col N="1178" /> the existing system in regard to tuberculosis medical officers.  We think that a better arrangement could be come to.  We are not satisfied that one medical officer of health living far away from a district and visiting a dispensary once a week is best.  We think it an elaborate luxury and we sometimes think that the appointment of two such medical officers was perhaps an imposition.  Many of us believe that far better results could be obtained if the Minister were more in consultation with the local dispensary doctor.  Some of us would go so far as to suggest the elimination of these glorified gentlemen, the tuberculosis medical officer and his assistant, and the establishment of a number of fully qualified dispensary doctors to deal with every form of health service.  The money spent on the present tuberculosis medical officers, amounting to some £2,000 in my county, could well be devoted to multiplying the number of dispensary doctors so that perhaps we could have one in every chapel area.</P>
      <P>The inspection of schools is a subject that has gained our approval and if in future the Parliamentary Secretary seeks to develop that it would become, under the present system, very expensive. A good deal of expense would be avoided if there were a dispensary doctor in every parish.  He would make contact with the homes of the people &mdash;meeting them day in, day out.  If he were visiting the schools he would be in a position to visit the homes of the parents also and see them in their everyday health.  Two or three years ago some of us appealed to the Minister for Supplies to give more petrol to dispensary doctors.  I think it would be a great asset to us to have three dispensary doctors for every two we possess now, so that all the services could be conveniently done on a bicycle. At present it is quite common for a doctor to be called five or six or seven miles, on a red ticket, to a working man's home, and when the labourer comes in after his work he has to travel an equal distance to procure medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane mentioned something about the shortage of dispensary doctors.  In my opinion, we have many remote rural areas in which <Col N="1179" /> the presence of a dispensary doctor is highly desirable.  Our dispensary doctor should be fully experienced in the treatment of tuberculosis &mdash; heaven knows we have universities enough and doctors enough turned out each year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>But not paid enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>They may not, and when they motor ten miles or cycle, or even take a horse, they have to spend a certain amount of money in the effort, not to mention time.  A greater number of dispensary doctors would enable the public to be better informed as to the best methods of combating tuberculosis. The people have not taken kindly to the tuberculosis officers. They do not like the idea of being associated with them as distinct from other forms of illness.  If a common platform were found from which the doctor could dispense his various services, I feel that it would lead to much better results.  The services would be more readily used, and people would be more inclined to look to their nearest doctor in their illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some attention has been given to the sanatoria problem.  Medical practitioners are in favour of big sanatoria rather than a number of smaller ones.  The tuberculosis medical officer issues his report every year, and I am sure he is fully in earnest about it when he calls for an assistant, but I am still not satisfied that he is getting at the root of the problem.  No doubt, he is doing his best, but he has not got a grip of the people sufficiently well to make them come forward in the earlier stages of this disease.  I noticed a remark of the Parliamentary Secretary in the other House &mdash; such things always attract my attention&mdash;&ldquo;I think we have to appeal to the local services and I think it is right.&rdquo; Of course nobody said &ldquo;boo&rdquo; to that &mdash;it was all right, but when I remember the doctor in County Monaghan, he was not much in favour of striking rates; he wanted to get off as lightly as he could.  As we all know, more and more services are falling on the rates, so many that we are hard pressed to collect them.  In our county, <Col N="1180" /> fortunately, they have gone up only 11 per cent. during the last three years, but some of us had to fight very hard to keep them at that level, and although we must view the future with concern, we wish every success to the efforts to combat this terrible disease which, I am sure, is only temporary. In fact, if it is properly tackled, 20 years may see the end of it.</P>

      <P>It is pretty difficult to say anything new on this Bill. If we confine ourselves to the subject matter, it is mainly a question of providing speedily new institutions to accommodate tuberculous patients.  For portions of this week we have been discussing a similar scheme in respect of drainage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. S. O'Donovan Mr. S. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are retro-active so far as the diagnosis of tuberculosis is concerned, because it is a chronic disease.  It is not spectacular in its incidence like the other virulent diseases such as diphtheria, scarlatina and many others.  The unfortunate thing in the disease is that it is of slow development and that, possibly, through deterioration in nutrition, or in housing or clothing, a patient gets a common cold as it is called, and it ultimately becomes a neglected cold. The neglected cold, as it is described in the country, is very often the case of tuberculosis, which is creeping insidiously for ten or 15 years after the tuberculosis bacillus has gained access to the patient's lungs or other organs of the body.  If we had to deal with a disease more spectacular in its effects we would have made far more progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned, the scheme we are adopting is similar to that adopted in regard to drainage.  The State is not taking dictatorial duties.  It is providing institutions and handing them over to the local authorities for maintenance and for the repayment of one-third of their cost.  It seems to me to be simply a matter of the speedy production of finished institutions so that patients could be accommodated as <Col N="1181" /> quickly as possible.  I presume there is a considerable amount of equipment available in the country and once the institution is provided more equipment would become available.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the suggestion is new or not, but the only new thing that occurs to me in connection with tuberculosis eradication is its early diagnosis in the young patient. As far as diagnosing the disease in aged persons is concerned, we are up against the problem of maintaining the dependents of those persons while they are in sanatoria.  The State must necessarily care for the older people who are affected, and looking at it as a long-term policy, what we should endeavour to do is to diagnose the disease in the younger members of the community.  We would then quickly reach a stage where no adults with dependents would be affected.  We would be treating the younger people at the initial stages of the disease, and they would not have any dependents. That should be our long-term policy.  I grant that at present we have adults badly affected.  They will have to get treatment in sanatoria, and, whether by voluntary organisation or by some other means, their dependents must be provided for, and provided for satisfactorily, because otherwise there would always be a tendency to conceal the existence of the disease.  If it were an acute disease, causing death quickly, there could be no attempt at concealment, but as it is a chronic type of disease its existence would be kept from the public as long as possible.  We should deal with early diagnosis, especially in the young patient, until we arrive at a position in which we will have obviated the necessity of having to provide for dependents.  One and a half million pounds is certainly a large sum, and it is devoted practically entirely towards the provision of buildings.  It will be money well spent if we achieve our object. Whether it is original or not, that is the only constructive suggestion I have to put forward in dealing with the long-term policy of tuberculosis eradication.</P>
    <P>There is one other point which I must mention, and that is the question <Col N="1182" /> of human tuberculosis of animal origin, mainly of bovine origin.  Tuberculosis of bovine origin is practically entirely tuberculosis contracted through the consumption of tuberculous milk.  There are people and there are doctors who say that there is no danger to the human subject through tuberculous milk.  I could bring into this House to-morrow a sample of tuberculous milk, and I challenge anybody in this House to drink it.  They could not drink worse poison than milk from a tuberculous cow.  I do not want anybody to consider that that is a danger meeting everybody every day.  It is not, but it is meeting somebody every day.  Numerous children are getting milk from tuberculous cows, so there is and there must be a large percentage of young people affected by tuberculosis of bovine origin.  In this country we have no definite statistics in this regard.  A person might say to me: &ldquo;How many cases are there of such a nature?&rdquo; I cannot say, because there is very little confirmatory work done in this country relative to the comparative incidence of bovine tuberculosis and human tuberculosis in children or even in adults.  But we know it is there.  We know it is a very big danger, and the attack on tuberculosis generally in the human subject should at the same time be an attack with a view to reducing human tuberculosis of bovine origin.  The Parliamentary Secretary might say that quite recently in this House we recommended the appointment of a tribunal.  I only ask that that tribunal should be set up as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I think everybody is agreed that the Bill is a necessary one.  I hope that by giving it a speedy passage here we will be helping toward the speedy establishment of the three institutions which the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned.  I hope the Bill will be speedily enacted and enforced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this measure as evidence of a further awakening on the part of the Ministry to the necessity for better health in the country.  I confess that my point of view on this matter is largely that of Senator Sir John Keane.  I am not a medical man, nor am I a veterinary man, but as a layman I wonder how it is possible to <Col N="1183" /> discuss this problem of tuberculosis and sanatoria separated from other problems of health.  It does not seem possible to me.  Confining the discussion to the matter dealt with in the Bill makes one feel that the problem of tuberculosis is something which is narrow in its limits from the points of view of cause, method of treatment and so on.  The Parliamentary Secretary gave a rather long list of what might be contributory causes.  I was rather struck by a reply which came from his Department.  I am not quite certain whether it was a reply to a question in the Dáil or whether it was a communication sent down the country to some local authority, but in any case it pointed out a number of causes which it might be believed brought about this disease, and added something to the effect that the Department was not satisfied that anyone of those was really responsible.  Of course, the truth probably is that no one factor brings about tuberculosis in any particular person.  Probably bad housing alone will not do it.  It is probable that malnutrition alone will not bring it about, without perhaps bad housing, poor clothing and a number of other contributory causes.  But, while the Parliamentary Secretary, under this Bill, is going to make provision for the erection of sanatoria in a number of places in the country, I do not think that we will be tackling this problem really seriously, or have any hope of bringing about the desired results, until we give wider consideration to the whole problem of our public health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have repeatedly said in this House that too little consideration is given to the problem of good health.  The Parliamentary Secretary spoke of propaganda. He would not be a bad propagandist in certain respects, but I put it to him that the Minister for Agriculture has much more to say about the necessity of a balanced ration for animals than the Parliamentary Secretary or anybody else in his Department has to say about a balanced ration for human beings.  There is no doubt in the world about that.  Anybody who has any experience of tuberculosis, and <Col N="1184" /> many of us have, would definitely have to come to the conclusion that if there is one factor responsible it is malnutrition. Malnutrition is by far the greatest factor, as well as lack of sufficient food to enable people to do the work which they have got to do, to overcome worry and enable children to attend school.  On a previous occasion I brought to the notice of the House certain information that reached me.  I do not know what the situation may be elsewhere, but I understand that in Cavan as a result of inspection of school children over the first year there was definite evidence of an improvement in their physique. That went on for a few years, and then changes came about in the economic situation.  Instead of an improvement I think the tendency has since been the other way.  I presume the Parliamentary Secretary has information on that.  When talking of calcium, malnutrition and lack of housing as contributory causes, we have got to get to the root of things and ask how do children become ill, and to what diseases they fall victims?</P>
    <P>There is a national school to which some of my own children went.  The medical inspection revealed a rather surprising condition of health amongst the children.  I was impressed by a point made by Senator McGee.  If a medical officer of health came a distance of 20 or 30 miles he would not know much about the history of the children, the family circumstances the income, or what sort of houses or parents they had.  If the conditions in the homes were known one could make a shrewd guess as to the health of the children.</P>
    <P>If we are going to tackle this problem we have got to get to the roots of it.  It is much wider than the problem of erecting sanatoria.  I am convinced that all sorts of physical activity are good for health, but it is important that the children should be well fed to be able to play games and well shod to play football and hurling. Senator O'Donovan referred to the condition of cattle.  I am sure the Senator could point to a number of instances of tuberculosis in cattle that had its origin in poor feeding.  We see well-fed <Col N="1185" /> bullocks weighing 20 cwt.  When they are killed it is found that they are infected, but because they were well-fed they managed to resist the attacks of the disease.  It is the same with regard to the human frame.  I am convinced that the science of nutrition in relation to the human population is not given the study it ought to be given.</P>
    <P>It is astonishing to go into homes, and not the homes of the poor only, where there is a lack of knowledge of the proteins, the calciums necessary to build up children.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to get busy and take as much interest in the question of a balanced ration for human beings as the Minister for Agriculture does for live stock.  At present there is treatment in sanatoria where patients do very well for a period, and then return to their homes, where there are mothers with three, or four or five children.  At home patients are not able to get the attention or the feeding that they got in the sanatoria.  The net result is that the improvement which has taken place does not last. Something has got to be done about that.  I do not know what is going to be done with these buildings when they are erected, whether they are to be run along the lines of institutions in England where there are settlements, but that aspect of the problem will have to be considered.  There is no point in having sanatoria, and then sending the people back into such conditions as will result in the disease taking root again.  I do not know what the Parliamentary Secretary has to say on that, but it is an aspect of the problem that arises for consideration. If it is proposed to establish settlements around these buildings, I suggest that these have considerable advantages.  I suggest that the bigger share of the problem which confronts us in tackling this disease is the providing of food.  I suggest if the people are given enough healthy food to eat, or are provided with means of getting it, the treatment of tuberculous patients in hospital will be reduced to a very low figure.</P>
    <P>This, I presume, is a means to an end: the eradication of the disease, and we have got to do this before we <Col N="1186" /> get to the other point, which is part of the solution now.  As I have suggested, the right way to solve this problem and eradicate the disease is to make sure that our people are properly clothed and well-fed, and no matter what the county medical officers of health or the Parliamentary Secretary, in his capacity, may do, or no matter what contribution is made by the Ministry to which he is attached, no amount of money spent here in this country will free our people from the plague of tuberculosis unless the problem is tackled in the way I have suggested, because, so long as people are not sufficiently well-clad or have not enough food they will always be subject to that disease.  However, I realise that this is a step that must be taken towards the eradication of the disease, and to that extent I am prepared to support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators in supporting the Bill.  The Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary has taken on himself the responsibility of endeavouring to eradicate this terrible disease.  According to the title of the Bill, its object is to try to bring about early detection and cure of the disease.  As far as we are concerned, we are quite prepared to leave that in the hands of the Parliamentary Secretary and his expert advisers.  The Parliamentary Secretary stated in the other House that he is satisfied that this disease is not hereditary, and we must accept that, coming from the Parliamentary Secretary, who has his professional advisers, but if the disease is not hereditary, there must be something hereditary about it.  It must be due to the conditions under which people live, to the very houses in which they live, because I have seen the disease cropping up, generation after generation, in members of a family who have lived in the one house for a certain number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, it must be either hereditary in the people or in the houses in which they live, and I believe that suitable steps should be taken to eradicate the disease from these houses.  I understand that in one foreign country it is the custom, when <Col N="1187" /> once the disease is detected in a house, to have that house completely gutted, or, if not entirely destroyed, reconstructed in such a way as will ensure the destruction of every possible germ of the disease that might have been concealed in the house.  The Minister has taken steps to acquire land, and so on, but I think he should also take power, in the case of a house where the disease is known to exist and where more than one generation, at least, of the family has been affected, to demolish that house or reconstruct it to the extent that the disease could no longer exist there.</P>
    <P>So much for the treatment and cure of the disease, but very little has been said about its prevention, and I suppose that that is really more important, in a way, from the point of view of future generations, than the question of its cure.  Now, as all knowledge starts in the primary schools, I think it would be a good idea to focus our attention on these schools.  I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary would have the entire co-operation of the Minister for Education on the matter.  I do not know what amount of co-operation he would require, but I feel certain that he would require plenty.  For instance, very primitive methods still obtain in country schools in the matter of sanitation, and I think it would be a good thing to have a couple of lessons a week on hygienic conditions delivered in these schools.  The results of these lessons would be brought by the children to their homes and, in that way, people all over the country would get some knowledge or even some elementary ideas with regard to hygiene.  That, to my mind, is very important.  Of course, there is quite a number of bad schools and there always will be, but they will be got at after a time.  I think it was Senator Baxter who was referring to opportunities being given for exercise in the schools when the Leas-Chathaoirleach, I think, intervened.  In most primary schools they have no places for exercise at all except in the small yard attached to the school or on the main <Col N="1188" /> roads, and you have children playing up and down along the main roads. Some playground should be attached to every primary school so as to enable the boys and girls to have proper physical exercise, play games, and so on, and if that were done I think it would go a long way towards the prevention of this disease.</P>
    <P>There is not very much use in speaking about housing now, but that is also a very important factor, and the ignorance of some people in that respect is extraordinary.  I remember that we had a clearance area in our town where there were some frightful hovels, and yet, when we built fine new houses for these people and tried to get them out of the wretched hovels in which they lived, we had to apply for the services of the local Gárdaí to get them out of their hovels and into good, sanitary houses.  That will give an idea of the necessity for the education of some of our people in this respect. I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government will do everything in their power to get the necessary material to start the building or reconstruction of houses as soon as possible.  Some houses, of course, are in a worse condition than others.  I happen to live in a town which is very badly off in the matter of housing, but if we had those houses, and if we had an opportunity of improvement and of education in elementary hygiene, taught in the schools and brought from the schools to the home, that would be a considerable help, in a general way, towards the eradication of the disease, and would make for the welfare of future generations in this country.</P>

      <P>I have been a member of a tuberculosis committee for a number of years and during that period I heard this question of the causes and cure of tuberculosis being discussed from various points of view. At one time we were very keen on building small shelters which could be erected in, say, the garden of the house in which persons suffering from this disease lived.  For one reason or another, that was abandoned, and we had regional schemes, such as those <Col N="1189" /> mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary. I personally feel that it is rather a mistake to concentrate, as has been suggested, on a few large buildings. I should prefer to see one building of a smaller type erected in each county.  Of course, I admit at once that the Parliamentary Secretary must have the results of world experience at his disposal, that his officials have not been asleep and have probably told him that those institutions are best, but I think it will be found that where those large institutions exist in other countries the population is greater and more condensed than in this country.  In such cases the big institution might be admirable and, perhaps, more efficient, but at the same time I feel <Col N="1190" /> that there is a good deal in what Senator McGee and other Senators have said: that there is something wanting in connection with the county medical officer of health.  I suggest that what is wanting is an institution that would be under his direct control, an institution that, perhaps; would be specially fitted to deal with this disease. The county medical officer of health, of course, has to deal with all kinds of disease, but, so far as my experience goes, he concentrates a lot on this disease of tuberculosis.  I now move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
