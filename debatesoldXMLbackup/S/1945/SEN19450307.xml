      <P>In the debate on censorship in the House last week, I quoted a passage from a speech made by Senator Douglas, and commented that the quoted remarks showed a certain sympathy with Fascism and Nazism.  I have since read the whole of the speech, and it is clear to me now that the passage I quoted was not fully <Col N="1462" /> indicative of Senator Douglas's views, for at a later stage Senator Douglas said: &ldquo;They&rdquo;&mdash;that is Fascism and Nazism&mdash;&ldquo;claim an allegiance to the State which I, for one, am only prepared to give to God&rdquo;.  I apologise to the Senator, and regret if my unintentional misrepresentation has given him reason for offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I very much appreciate the action which has been taken by Senator Hearne, and I accept without reservation the apology which he has been good enough to make.  By drawing the attention of the House to this matter, I think he has played his part in maintaining the good feeling which exists amongst all the members of the House, even though we may disagree on various matters.  At the same time, lest there might be any possible misunderstanding, I should like, with your permission, to read the whole paragraph &mdash;it is not very long&mdash;in my speech from which the extract was taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to inflict the whole speech on the House, but I should like to read just this paragraph. The speech was in 1934, and the paragraph is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dictatorships have grown out of mass movements of the people, and the shirt or badge has only been the symbol, not the cause of the success of the movement.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Senator Hearne read the first portion of that sentence.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They have grown out of dissatisfaction with Governments and with political conditions, coupled with the desire of young people to do something for their country.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the portion at which Senator Hearne resumed his reading:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There has been a great deal in these shirt or Fascist movements which cannot be criticised.  There have been discipline, good-fellowship, readiness to sacrifice and the desire to reform, which are excellent things, and these have given the <Col N="1463" /> movements a wonderful appeal to the best of young men and women after the demoralisation of the war.  I challenge anyone to deny that a great deal of good has been achieved in both Italy and Germany as a result of the Nazi and Fascist movements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Hearne stopped there.  The rest of the paragraph is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But for my part, that good has been achieved at the cost of individual political freedom, and it is a price which I, for one, am not prepared to pay in this country if I can help it.  What I most object to in Fascism and Nazism is the assertion of the absolute supremacy of the State over the individual.  They claim an allegiance to the State which I, for one, am only prepared to give to God.  Little or no recognition is given to individual conscience, minorities have no right to organise, and even the expression of individual opinion against the Government is treasonable.  Persons who do not share the opinions of the majority are dubbed anti-national&mdash; traitors, undesirable people, who may perhaps be tolerated if they keep their opinions to themselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, Sir, was the paragraph.  May I just add that a very large portion of my speech was devoted to showing the reasons why I disapproved of the Fascist and Nazi movements?  I pointed out that ordered democracy requires the type of mind which listens to every point of view and then forms its opinions freely.  I also said that to my mind the spirit which leads to the suppression of opinion creates the very condition in which the idea of the dictatorial State thrives.  I do not want to take up the time of the House by reading any more, but if, by any chance, there are any other Senators who are interested in what I thought in 1934, I would respectfully ask them to read the whole speech.  Again, I thank Senator Hearne for what I think was a handsome action on his part.</P>

    <Title>Electoral (Dáil Eireann and Local Authorities) Bill, 1945&mdash;Committee.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="1464" /> Sections 1 and 2 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Delete all words from and including the word &ldquo;that&rdquo; in line 29 to the end of the section and substitute the words:&mdash;&ldquo;the age that person will be, if living, on the 15th day of April next after the qualifying date&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment does not require very much explanation, but I should like to give my reasons for putting it down, and to point out that it is provided in the Constitution that every citizen, without distinction of sex, who has reached the age of 21 years who is not disqualified by law, and complies with the provisions of the law relating to the election of members of Dáil Éireann, shall have the right to vote at an election of members of Dáil Éireann.  The Act of 1923, which this Bill seeks to amend, disqualified all persons of 21 years of age from ever being able legally to vote in elections for Dáil Éireann.  That seems to me to be unconstitutional&mdash;not strictly, of course, because the Constitution provides for disqualification&mdash;but it is clearly outside the spirit of it, and there has been no suitable opportunity of drawing attention to what has seemed to me to be a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the law stands, a person must be 21 years and six months before he can vote, and in many cases he will have to be 22 and almost six months.  The period is slightly lengthened by the Bill as it stands, because the period from what is called the qualifying date to the date on which the new register comes into force is slightly lengthened. It has always seemed to me that when a householder is filling in a form for the 15th November&mdash;now it is to be the 15th September&mdash;they could fill in the actual age, and when the register is prepared a vote could be given to those who are 21, if still living on the date on which the register comes into effect. I know that if this amendment is accepted it may mean some consequential <Col N="1465" /> amendments in other parts of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Government will be unable to accept this amendment, because this Bill is to a large degree, if not almost wholly, a machinery Bill, and it is felt that this is a constitutional issue.  As Senator Douglas pointed out, the Constitution does say that a person who is 21 may vote provided he conforms with the law, and the Electoral Act of 1923 is the Act upon which this present measure is based.  I think that we could not discuss this problem on this particular Bill.  There is nothing more I can say about it except that this Bill deals with machinery, and not with the principle, in regard to those who are qualified to vote from a fundamental point of view.  On this occasion we could not consider it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, the position is this&mdash;that people who are 21 have the right to vote?  The machinery devised for preparing the register in 1923 actually had the effect of depriving them of that right for a certain number of months, sometimes for nearly a year, and seeing that they were deprived of the right, if one might say, by machinery&mdash;and there can be no doubt that the right existed, and that there is nothing unconstitutional in the amendment&mdash;I can see no reason why we should not in this machinery Bill rectify the defect which occurred in an early machinery Bill.  We are not asking for an amendment of the Constitution. We are asking that the machinery may be so adjusted that people will attain their right to vote at an earlier stage.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary is right in his <Col N="1466" /> argument that this is a constitutional matter.  It is a machinery matter, just as this Bill is a machinery Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with what Senator Hayes has said, but if we started to think about the electoral law in general, we might find a number of miscellaneous matters we could discuss which might need reform.  It is simply a matter of where we should draw the line.  It is a matter of opinion.  We feel that we must draw a line between machinery and constitutional matters, and that the question of the proposed alteration is constitutional, rather than mechanical.  One could continue the argument for a long time, but all I have to say is that the Government cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that he had sympathy with Senator Hayes.  I have sympathy with the Parliamentary Secretary in having to make a bad case.  In fact or in law, how on earth is this House going to draw attention to this defect in the machinery of 1923, if it is not done in a Bill altering that machinery?  It is not practical politics to argue that it cannot be done in this Bill, unless the Parliamentary Secretary would undertake to bring in a simple Bill for the purpose of doing it in a different way.  In that case I would be satisfied.  What he tells us is that he is not seeing his way to do it in this Bill, and, therefore, it will not be done in this Bill.  If he had argued that the people should not have votes until they were 22 or 22½ there might be something to be said for it, but I have never been able to see why they should provide votes in the Constitution for all persons at the age of 21, and provide by law that they will never be able to exercise them at that age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have children of my own and I have some experience of filling in the forms. My children could not understand why they had to wait a year.  In cases where a person became 21 just before the qualifying day he had to wait a year and a half after.  This Bill makes the period a year and 7½ months, therefore this Bill is definitely altering the position.  Despite their fear of interfering <Col N="1467" /> with the Constitution, they did not hesitate to make the period longer for the purpose of machinery.  I am going to press this so that we may have an expression of opinion on it.  I do not think we will fight with the Dáil, but we might send a message back to the Dáil, intimating that an amendment could be made to this Bill to enable people to vote at the age of 21. It is not a Party issue.  I have not the remotest idea whether persons of 21 are Fianna Fáil, Labour, or Fine Gael.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>They are no more misguided than older people.  Therefore I cannot see any political gain.  It is always the same anomaly which I have been up against.  This is something upon which we may express an opinion. If we were to send this back to the Dáil it might lead to the Government taking action in some other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it there is no difficulty of any kind in inserting this amendment, except the well-known one which we all understand, that when a Department has settled on doing a thing in a particular way it does not want to do it in any other way.  I suggest that that is the difficulty.  I thought that the Parliamentary Secretary would take the line that certain difficulties would arise.  I do not think any will.  Seeing that no difficulties will arise, I think the Parliamentary Secretary might take a chance and accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is an extravagant thing to say.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because if the Title of the Bill is read it will be seen that this Bill is &ldquo;An Act to amend the Electoral Act, 1923, and the Local Government (Extension of Franchise) Act, 1935, by substituting the 15th day of September for the 15th day of November as the qualifying date for Dáil electors and local government electors, respectively, and to provide for certain other matters consequential upon the said amendments&rdquo;.  The amendment opens up a very big question. I quite agree that under the Constitution every person, without distinction of sex, who has attained the age of 21 years is entitled to vote in an election for members of the Dáil.  How that can be carried into effect is a matter which would require a good deal of consideration.  We must remember that this is a Bill to amend the Electoral Act, 1923, and the Local Government (Extension of Franchise) Act, 1935, merely in the manner mentioned in the Title.  I have not the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann before me, and I am not quite certain whether that Constitution provided expressly as the present Constitution provides expressly that every citizen who has attained the age of 21 years should have the right to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that it is the same, I suggest that the matter of giving effect to the Constitution would require more serious consideration than we could give it at the present time. I think that consequential machinery would be required to carry this amendment into effect.  I suggest that this matter should be deferred but should not be forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much surprised at the last speech.  In the first place, you, Sir, always put the Title of a Bill to the House, which means that we can amend it.  Therefore, that point is gone.  It is put last so that if it be necessary to amend it as a result of any action taken by the House it can be so amended.  If that were not so it would completely stultify the House as a revising Chamber.  I do not think this <Col N="1469" /> is a constitutional matter, because the Constitution makes it clear that citizens can be deprived of the right by law.  The Act of 1923 set up machinery and this is an Act to amend that machinery.  We can do so, if we like. I also profoundly disagree with the last point made by Senator Ryan.  The Senator said that we could not give the matter proper consideration.</P>
      <P>If Senators did not read the amendment there might be difficulty, but it is perfectly clear.  It does not mean that because the amendment is passed on the Committee Stage that that is its final form.  Sometimes the only way we can get a thing properly considered by the Government is to send it back to the Dáil.  Lately we have got out of that habit, although we used to do so. On the last occasion the Minister was not pleased, but after a while he decided that it was a good idea and accepted it.  That might happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Take my own case.  All I am asked to do is to write down my son's age on the 15th April instead of the 15th September.  I fill up the age on the 15th April, 1946, instead of the 15th September, 1945.  I take it Senator Ryan will not say that any constitutional <Col N="1470" /> issue arises in that.  It is merely a matter of date, a matter of machinery, that is to say entirely relevant to this Bill.  It can be done without difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say in reference to Senator Hayes' statement that I do not think it is quite as simple as he thinks.  I made considerable study of the electoral code in connection with this Bill, and this might involve more complication than can be seen by mere examination of the amendment.  I did not want to make that point, because the Government is quite genuine in its insistence that the Bill deals with another aspect entirely. I do not think it is quite so simple. The Government is not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

I am not doubting what the Parliamentary Secretary says, but we all know from personal experience that it does not always get done, and we should like to know whether any action can be taken to draw attention to this matter and to see that proper steps are taken in regard to it.</P>

As I understand the matter, in the case of the officers concerned, the practice to which he refers does not take place and, if any person's name is left on the register&mdash; that is, in the case of a person who is presumed to have died in the meantime &mdash;the revising officers themselves can act as objectors.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), page 2, to delete the figures &ldquo;15th&rdquo; in line 37 and substitute instead the word &ldquo;first&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1473" /> This amendment is not of tremendous importance, but I think it is of some importance.  Hitherto, when the qualifying date was the 15th November, the new register came into force on the 1st June following; that is to say, there is an interval of six and a half months for the preparation of the register. Under Section 4 of the Bill, that interval is extended to seven months, and, personally, I cannot see why that should be so.  I cannot see the need of extending the interval between the qualifying date and that on which the register comes into force.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the purpose of my amendment is to maintain the interval which has hitherto existed.  Apart from that, I think it is more convenient for everybody that the register should come into force on the first day of the month than at any other day in the month.  One can understand that the old register goes out of account on, say, 31st March, but if there were an election on the 1st April, or the 10th or 15th April, that election would be held on the new register, and I think it would be more convenient for everybody, and particularly for those concerned with making preparations for the elections, if the new register were to be enforced on the 1st of the month instead of the 15th.  The purpose of the amendment is to secure that the new register would come in on the 1st of the month instead of the 15th.  I do not see how the Parliamentary Secretary can object to this proposal. After all, he is given quite a long period&mdash;6½ months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am beginning to think, Sir, that there is something rather significant in the date&mdash;the 1st April&mdash;suggested by Senator Duffy. <Col N="1474" /> While, I suppose, from the point of view of ideal theory, it would be best to maintain an exact interval, as was the case before this Bill was introduced, the extra fortnight has been allowed deliberately in order to give the officers concerned, and also the printers, more time to complete the revision of the register.  That has been decided by the Government, on the basis of statements put forward by local authorities, that they would like to have two weeks more, both for the printing of the register and also for the purpose of final revision, in order that any claims that might be put forward may be heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think that the particular printing that the Senator is referring to is what is known as the long list; that is, the first, preliminary printing that is put in a public place so as to enable people to make claims.  The final list is not printed until later on, and I think that if the Senator will look at a later section in the Bill he will find that the final date is the 31st January, and that in the case of any claims after that the registrar sits in an appointed place to hear objections, and then the final list is prepared so as to enable it to be printed by the 1st April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I may tell the Parliamentary Secretary that I have frequently seen those long lists and have subsequently compared them with the final list, and that I have found that the number of corrections in the final list is infinitesimal.  The number of objections, after the publication of the first list, is very small.  That has been my experience.  Nowadays, there are not many of these objections because everybody who is 21 years of age is entitled to register.  It is not like the old days where voters had to have a large number of qualifications, each of which had to be examined.  Nowadays the only question that arises is whether a person is 21 years of age and resides in a particular place on the <Col N="1475" /> qualifying date.  Once these two points are established, there is no ground for objection, and I cannot see the case that is being made for extending the period between the qualifying date and the date on which the register comes into force.  We have had a similar discussion earlier on this Bill.  A person as the Bill came to us, might be 21 years of age on the 15th September, and the proposal is that he cannot have a vote until the 15th April following. I am endeavouring to bring that date forward by two weeks, and I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that there should be no real difficulty in doing that, because the big problem is to get the first compilation printed and the intervals previously allowed for the different operations which follow should be quite sufficient.</P>

      <P>I can only say that, as I understand it, the scrutiny is anything but slight.  Every single name is very carefully gone through, and when we ask for this extra period of two weeks, we do so because of very specific requests made to us.  It is in no idle mood that we make this suggestion for an extra period of two weeks.  We have very definite information on the matter.  We have received representations from local authorities requesting the extra period.  There is a very definite and a very long scrutiny of the names and the extra period is required for the purpose of carrying out that scrutiny.</P>

They are anything but that.  I know that in my own constituency the list of those who qualify in the intervening period and of those who are no longer qualified is pretty long.  I know that in my own county at different times there has been a great number of complaints as to the inadequacy of the time allowed, and in view of my own experience I think that the proposal of Senator Duffy to shorten the period allowed for printing is altogether wrong.  I know <Col N="1476" /> that the general feeling was that the period allowed for compilation and printing should be lengthened rather than reduced.</P>

      <P>One of the effects of this section is to reduce the time available in the City of Dublin for the preparation of the register.  I wonder whether the city authorities were consulted before these particular dates were inserted and whether they are satisfied with them now because the effect of the section is to increase the period of time all over the country and to decrease the amount of time allowed to the Town Clerk of Dublin for the performance of these duties. Seeing that Dublin has the biggest electoral roll in the State, that seems to be rather unfortunate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to continue in operation the Seeds and Fertilisers Supply Act, 1942, for the period from 1st August, 1944, to 31st July, 1947.  We have had a Seeds and Fertilisers Supply Act ever since 1940.  Facilities have been available since 1940 for small cultivators to obtain loans from the county councils in order to provide themselves with seeds and fertilisers.  The Bill validates the schemes which have taken <Col N="1479" /> place since the last Act expired.  The Bill is a permissive one.  It gives to county councils the power to take advantage of the Act if they so desire.  It is in no sense an agricultural credit Bill.  It is really a minor social service to help necessitous cultivators, agricultural labourers and very small farmers to obtain credit by means of which they can produce food for themselves, and it is regarded as having great importance during the present crisis.  We propose on this occasion to enable this measure to continue in operation for three years, in order to save the time of the Oireachtas in passing an Act each year.  The Government believes that both during the emergency and in the period subsequent to the emergency, and possibly more or less permanently, we shall need a measure of this kind.</P>
      <P>The House may like to hear a few figures in regard to the operation of the Act up to now.  In the year 1939-40, 3,157 persons took part in the scheme. In 1940-41, we had the record number of 9,269.  In 1941-42, we had 5,509; in 1942-43, 5,465; in 1943-44, 5,453.  The actual cost, or shall I say, the turnover in loans, for 1943-44 was £55,169.  The average amount borrowed is £10 per borrower, and the State has not yet been asked to pay to the county authorities the 50 per cent. which they are bound to pay in the case of irrecoverable loans.  In actual fact, the amount of money which has been found to be irrecoverable is very small indeed.  No application has been made to the Department of Local Government for the recovery of these sums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to give the House an indication of the financing of the scheme, I might mention that, in regard to the year 1941-42, when there were 5,509 borrowers, the amount still outstanding in July, 1943, was £3,449.  By the next year, July, 1944, the amount still outstanding in respect of the 1941-42 scheme was £1,267.  These amounts are progressively reduced each year. Again, to indicate in general how well the scheme is administered, in 1942-43 there were 5,463 loans, and 4,755 were <Col N="1480" /> fully repaid.  Payments on account were made by 305 persons, while 403 persons had made no payment whatever. Of these, 250 came from three counties, and steps have been taken to insist on proper collection.  The interest charged, which is in aid of the ordinary administrative expenses of the county council, varies.  In some cases it is 2½ per cent.; the average is about 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The only county authority which is not taking part in the scheme at present is County Kerry, where there was a very large number of defaulters and the county council decided not to take part in the scheme in the last year. We have done our best to popularise this measure.  Recently we wrote to all the county authorities giving them indications as to how they could be as reasonable as possible in the application of the scheme.  I have no explanation for the House as to why there has been a reduction from 9,000, in the peak year 1940-41, to 5,000, which seems to be the average number of loans made.</P>
    <P>As I said before, this is not an agricultural credit measure of great importance. It has nothing to do with the general principle of agricultural credit.  It is simply a very valuable minor social service.  Evidently, every year there are 4,000 or 5,000 people, probably representing families totalling nearly 30,000, who are not able to obtain credit in the shops, who have not got the spare cash, who find it very useful to be given credit by the county authority, and who, in the vast majority of cases, repay the sums satisfactorily and properly.  I would recommend this Bill to the Seanad.  As I said, it is a useful minor measure. We have no idea how long the emergency will continue, but at least for the next three years we wish to give every encouragement to small cultivators and to provide them with every facility for producing essential food for themselves and their families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure meets with general approval, and the information which the Parliamentary Secretary has given us is very welcome. Perhaps, at a later stage, he would go a little further and give us, county by <Col N="1481" /> county, the exact result of the administration of the measure.  It is interesting to discover, for instance, that Kerry has discontinued participation in the scheme.  I should like to know what the total deficit is in the country as a whole.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the drop in the number of applications from over 9,000 to approximately 5,000.</P>
      <P>The probabilities are, of course, that a number of county councils have discovered that they had as applicants people who wanted to borrow, but did not mean to repay.  What strikes me about the Bill on this occasion is that it is more necessary this year than probably ever it was.  I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary if, in addition to giving the county councils power to give credit, this Bill enables any other action to be taken by his Department, or the Department of Agriculture, to ensure that if credit is given to county councils to enable small cultivators, as he styles them, to get credit in turn to purchase seeds, that the seeds will be available.  I think it is true that in a great many areas throughout the country seeds of the right quality, both potato and grain, will be hard to obtain.  In many districts, the quality of oats is low and the price is expensive.  The same may be said of the potato crop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how far the administration of the scheme has gone in the counties, or whether any action has been taken at all.  In my own county, I think there was an advertisement in the local paper, but I do not know how far the scheme has progressed.  I would like to emphasise that it is important that the people who are going to buy should have an early opportunity of doing it, so that they will not be rushing at the last minute, when everybody else, including people who have the money, is there too.  The net result, in a case like that, is usually that the price of the seeds is considerably inflated, with results that are not satisfactory to the poorer sections of the community.  I have no knowledge of any action being taken by the Government to ensure that in certain areas quantities of imported seeds will be made available, but my opinion is <Col N="1482" /> that it will be necessary in many of the poorer areas.</P>
    <P>Potato and grain crops can be reconstituted only by the importation of fresh seeds from areas in which they can be procured, and where they are of vigorous and healthy stock.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that that aspect of the problem is even more important than the provision of credit.  There is nothing so futile as to give people credit to spend on root and grain seeds that are not capable of producing a healthy crop.  Time and money will be wasted unless that aspect of the matter receives attention. I am not going into a discussion on technical points with the Parliamentary Secretary, because it is not his <i>forte.</i> Nevertheless, it cannot be left out of the reckoning.</P>
    <P>In my own county I know there are areas where the potato stocks and the grain stocks are not at all up to the standard necessary to give us the results we require.  I have no knowledge of any action being taken to bring imported seeds to these areas, and I suggest that that is something which must be given attention.  I presume that the same would apply to many districts in the west, but I may not be quite correct there.  Perhaps their crops were better than ours, but unless they were very much better it is important not only to give the county councils authority to give the money, or to provide credit for the purchase of seeds, but to ensure that the seed they buy will be such as will yield good fruit.  I press that very strongly on the Parliamentary Secretary. I know that many people, in addition to what he termed smallholders, will have to go into the market this year, and my view is that it is probably something that wants to be tackled on a scale we have not attempted for a number of years.</P>
    <P>I think it is important to get a proper return prepared of the requirements of the district in many of the counties which will require imported seed.  Rather than have an unbalanced situation in the market&mdash;very high prices in one area and low prices in another&mdash;it would be much better to <Col N="1483" /> have a levelling out by having proper distribution and by easing the difficulties of transport.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill which extends for three years the powers county councils have already of giving loans to smallholders for the purpose of purchasing seeds, and I can speak with some experience of my own county.  I can say that it has enabled a great deal of food to be produced by smallholders when the production of that food was vitally necessary to the country.  There is a second reason for the Bill which appeals very strongly to me&mdash;that is, the repayment of the loans that my county council gave to smallholders. The manner in which they were repaid was most satisfactory and, indeed, I might say very, very satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The repayments have been much more satisfactory under this heading than the repayment of loans of any other type I know.  I am old enough to be getting more and more cynical, but it is a relief to find that despite the suggestion that our people may be very slow regarding the payment of their just debts, this is an indication, and a very reassuring indication, that our people are coming to realise that when they incur liabilities they should ensure, as far as they can, that these liabilities, will be met when the time comes.  That is a very gratifying feature of it to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned, in giving figures for one year, that there was only £1,200 outstanding in respect of the loans that had been issued two years previously.  I know that in my own county the amount outstanding under the Seeds and Fertilisers Act is infinitesimal, and it has enabled councils to provide, the means for smallholders to grow food that otherwise they might not be able to grow and they are in the same position <Col N="1484" /> as the wealthy man, because everybody knows that the vouchers they receive can be cashed just as readily as bank-notes.  I do not think Senator Baxter meant to imply that they were in a less favourable position as regards purchasing.  Certainly it is not so in my own county that they are in a less favourable position than the man who is able to pay cash down.</P>
    <P>I think, however, that there might be a tightening up as to the purchase of seeds under this Bill and a better relationship between it and the services made available by the county committees of agriculture.  I think a definite flaw at present&mdash;Senator Baxter adverted to it slightly&mdash;is that the quality of some of the seeds that these people purchase is not all that one would desire, and I think, even though it is public money that is used in purchasing, the people are entitled to get the very best seeds going.</P>
    <P>Otherwise the money might largely be wasted.  I admit freely the difficulty of devising the scheme, but if there could be some way whereby the offices of the agricultural committee could get the seeds and would be authorised to take these seeds or samples of these seeds and have them tested, a very definite improvement of the crops grown from these seeds would be effected.</P>

      <P>Ar nós Seanadóirí eile, is maith liom an Bille seo fheiscint ag teacht ar ais chugainn.  Is Bille é atá ionmholta in gach slí. Like Senator Baxter I should like some explanation as to the reason for the falling off in the number of applicants for loans under this scheme.  I am not inclined to be over-worried about it because I do not think it is actually because the applicants find any difficulty in getting loans or because the county councils in general are inclined to drop the scheme.  The explanation is, I think, that many smallholders are so much better off now than they were in the past that they are to an extent independent of the local authority and can provide these seeds out of their own resources.  A point that interested me was that mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary, when he said that the <Col N="1485" /> average rate of interest on these loans was 5 per cent.  He mentioned that it went as low as 2½ per cent.  It seems that a considerable amount of the loans must have gone very much over 5 per cent. if the average is 5 per cent. These are cases where if anything can be done to help the applicants in the matter of reducing costs, it should be done.  Whoever may bear the burden it should not be imposed upon the type of people who happen to be applicants under the scheme.  Senator Hearne referred to the quality of the seeds, and to the necessity for having some steps taken to see that they are adequately tested.  This is a proper opportunity to express our appreciation of what is being done under the Vocational Education schemes in connection with this question. The House is aware from information given by the Minister for Agriculture on several occasions that the great amount of work done by vocational schools in regard to testing seeds is of tremendous importance.  What is necessary is that we should let people know the extent to which facilities are already available for seed testing.  The facilities are there for testing the seeds, and it only remains to bring to the notice of those concerned that such facilities are available.  I take this opportunity to place on record our appreciation of the very valuable work that is being done in regard to seed testing under the vocational education system and of pleading that everybody interested should make known to a much greater extent the existence of such facilities.  By doing so we would be serving not only the people concerned but the country as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMacCabe" hpid="Mr. McCabe Mr. McCabe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCabe</NameTxt>
      <P>A question arose here in connection with the quality of the seeds supplied under this scheme.  I think that those who participate have the same facilities as large farmers because my experience of seed testing is that the inspector or county agricultural committees will make sure that no seeds will be allowed out until they are satisfied that it will stand up to the test of purity.  The county councils did remarkably well.  They sponsored this scheme, believing that <Col N="1486" /> it was in the best interests of the country.  I am sorry to say that some people to whom loans were advanced did not repay them, and did not give credit to the county councils of the Twenty-Six Counties for what they did.  I was challenged here some years ago when I made that statement.  I know of several cases where seeds and manures were supplied and loans given but the applicants did not take the trouble to till their little gardens. That did not help food production. The fault did not lie with the county councils.  People got loans but they let the gardens go wild.  That happened in 1939 and 1940.  Some of these gardens were wild last year.  I suggest that in giving seeds to people who apply for them there should be an inspection of plots and small farms, and if they did not till them they should be in the same category as farmers who fail to till a certain area of land. In the vicinity of many towns it is regrettable to see gardens growing all weeds.  The seeds supplied under this scheme are just as good as seeds farmers get.  The scheme is workable and a good one, and the people who could benefit by it should utilise it.</P>

      <P>Arising out of Senator Hearne's remarks on the quality of the seeds, I should like to see a safeguard in regard to the quality of fertilisers.  There is a great deal of fuss, and rightly so, about the nutrition of our people and of our live stock, but sometimes we forget about the nutrition of the soil.  I feel that we should keep a closer watch on the quality of fertilisers, especially when the present emergency is past, as I suspect a good many fertilisers of somewhat different composition are going to come into this country.  A minimum composition of the ingredients should be specified and unless fertilisers conform to that minimum they should not be accepted or circulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I do feel that there is a sort of superstitious faith in fertilisers on the part of many of our farmers.  They think that if they merely get a bag of fertiliser and sprinkle it about, things will happen.  Many farmers whom I have encountered do <Col N="1487" /> not seem to know how to use fertilisers properly.  More exact instruction might be given on that point.  In connection with this fertiliser question, importance is being attached in recent years to the smaller constituents such as barium and iodine.  It is unnecessary to go into technical questions like that but we should endeavour to secure that the fertiliser we get is uniform in nature and we should see to the education of the people who use it.  After all, we spring from the soil and we ought to respect what is supporting us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to agree with Senator Hearne regarding the need for some inspection as to the quality of the seed.  I should also like to thank Senator O Buachalla for the remarks he made regarding the work done by vocational education committees in connection with seed testing. I disagree with Senator McCabe that the seeds are in all cases good and that there is no need to bother about them.  We had a remarkable case in Tipperary some time ago.  Quite accidentally, we discovered that a great deal of the seed being supplied to allotment holders was perfectly useless. There was general complaint by the allotment holders.  It was arranged that an instructor should inspect the seeds.  He took it upon himself to call on the merchant who was in the habit of supplying the seeds.  Strictly speaking, I do not think that he had any authority to do so.  However, there were no ill-effects from his action.  As a result of it, a better quality of seeds was supplied and allotment holders commenced to take a greater interest in the scheme, generally.  If the services of vocational instructors are required, I suggest that the local authority concerned&mdash;the county council, in the case of a county area, and the corporation or urban council in the case of an urban area&mdash;should ask for the services of these officials from the vocational education committees.  If that be done, the instructors will feel that they are entitled to go into the places where the seeds are to be distributed. I think that I can safely assure the House that the committees will co-operate to the fullest extent in giving the services of their officers.</P>

      <P>That is not the case in some areas.  I was proceeding to say that the number of officers at the disposal of the county committee of agriculture is very small.  There is a tendency of late to increase the number. At best, there would be in a county the chief officer and two assistants. If a county is fairly large, it is difficult for a small number of officers to deal with the supply of seeds. Therefore, I suggest that the vocational education committees be asked by the local authorities to co-operate in this matter, as they have been asked to do in connection with similar activities. I should like to express my appreciation of the remarks of Senator O Buachalla and to assure the House that vocational education committees will do everything possible in the way of co-operation in this important matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Seeds and Fertilisers Act is a permissive Act.  The Department is not responsible for the local administration of the scheme save in so far as the Act defines the terms on which loans may be made. So far as the quality of the seeds is concerned, all but three county councils in the past year made it a condition that they would not pay the merchant for the seed unless it had been tested in a vocational school or by some other approved means.  The counties which took no action were Clare, Cavan and Meath.  There is no objection whatever to county councils making that regulation.  Indeed, I suggest that Senator Baxter is right when he says that the county committees of agriculture should take up the matter. With regard to fertilisers, I have no <Col N="1489" /> information that county councils made special efforts to see that fertilisers were of good quality but, as I think the House knows, a number of the fertilisers are of a standard type under the control of the Minister.  All I can say on that point is that county committees of agriculture should recommend that steps be taken to ensure that fertilisers given out under the scheme are of the best quality possible, having regard to the emergency.</P>
      <P>Senator O Buachalla spoke of the interest rate and I made a mistake in my previous remarks.  The general rate of interest&mdash;not the average rate&mdash;is 5 per cent.  Therefore, he need have no fear that a rate above 5 per cent. is charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the expense of administration and the amount outstanding, I think it could be considered fairly reasonable, generally speaking.  That is also a permissive matter.  If a council chooses to charge a lower rate of interest, it can do so.  There is no obligation upon it to charge a high rate.  It rests with the county committee of agriculture to recommend to the county council what the figure should be.  I have seen no complaints within the past 12 months with regard to the quality of fertilisers or seeds.  Any complaints there have been, must have been local in character.  They did not reach the Department.  In November, 1943, the Department wrote to the secretaries of county councils drawing their attention to the desirability of ensuring that seeds be of good quality.  I hope that the three defaulting county councils, who have not made the condition to which I referred, in connection with the purchase of seeds, will do so at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme proceeds continuously and the county councils arrange, through their secretaries, for publication of advertisements giving a full description of the scheme.  That is a matter on which the county councils have to use their initiative.  There is nothing in the Bill to compel the advertising of the scheme.  We assume <Col N="1490" /> that county councils will interest themselves in the matter and that they will bring the scheme to the knowledge of everybody concerned.  We take it that the utmost will be done to increase the number of persons taking advantage of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter asked for figures with regard to the borrowers in each county.  It would take me a long time to read them all.  The figures vary very much.  In 1942-43, I think that the highest number of borrowers was in Mayo, where the figure was 762.  The number for the counties, generally, would be about 300 or 400.  Some counties had very few.  Sligo had 37, Tipperary North Riding 28, Kilkenny 22, and Carlow 21.  There does not appear to be any great connection between counties where there are large or small numbers of borrowers. Some of the richer counties have quite a large number whereas, in the case of some of the poorer counties, very few are taking advantage of the scheme.</P>

As I have already said, the scheme is permissive, and I should imagine that most of the observations that have been made by Senators could well be taken advantage of by the county councils, since the scheme must be activated by these county councils, and it is up to them to see that the scheme is properly worked.  So far as the availability of seeds is concerned, that is a matter for the Ministry of Agriculture, and is not concerned with this Bill at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I understand the Parliamentary Secretary aright when he says that this Bill is permissive: that it is giving the county councils machinery which enables them to provide a certain number of needy persons with credit in order to enable them to procure seeds, but that the question of whether these seeds are available or not is a matter for the Ministry of Agriculture, that once the credit is provided by the Parliamentary Secretary's Department, his responsibility ends there and that it is entirely a matter for the Ministry of Agriculture to provide the necessary seeds? Am I to take it that there is no connection, in regard to this matter, between the Ministry of Local Government and Public Health and the Ministry of Agriculture?  If that is the position, I must say that I am not satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other people in the House who have experience of what the position in the rural parts of this country is this spring.  Definitely, we are going to have difficulty in providing ample supplies of the right sort of seeds.  I would have thought that, at any rate, the Parliamentary Secretary's Department would have had information from the Department of Agriculture as to what the position is.  We may have a greatly increased demand for the utilisation of the provisions of this measure this year.  I do not know, but I think it is quite possible that we may; because there are many parts of the country where the potato crop was a failure last year and where stocks are very low, although I understand that in other parts of the country yields were very high.  I should like to know whether or not there is to be proper co-operation between the two Departments in this matter, and whether seeds will be available for purchase, because there is no use in providing <Col N="1492" /> money or credit for people to buy seeds, if the seeds are not available. For that reason, I think, it is essential that there should be co-operation between the two Departments.</P>
    <P>There was one other point on which I think I was misunderstood.  I said that had this measure been employed earlier in the year, it would have facilitated a number of poor people, because they could have gone into the open market and bought their requirements. For instance, I was in the market in Cavan on Monday, and there was a number of farmers looking for seed oats, but they were not to be had in the market.  The seed oats were not there, although the farmers concerned had the money to buy them.  Now, along with that, you are adding, perhaps, a considerable number of other people who, when they get their dockets, will go out and try to get what they want.  Unfortunately, when these people go into the market, they are inclined to take whatever is there, no matter how bad it is.  They put their hands into a sack of oats and look at it, but it is a question of &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo;.  The farmer must take that grain or leave his field unsown.  Therefore, I say that this matter of co-ordination between the Parliamentary Secretary's Department and the Department of Agriculture is of the utmost importance in connection with this matter.  It is absolutely necessary that there should be a co-ordinated effort between the two Departments so that the best can be got out of the land.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong, but I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say that his responsibility ends in this matter of providing the necessary credit, and that it is then for the Minister for Agriculture to see whether the seeds are there or not.  I do not think that that is satisfactory.  I think it would be better to have more co-ordination between the two Departments, and if you are providing credit, then there ought to be some guarantee from the Ministry of Agriculture that the seeds will be available and that they will be the right quality of seeds.</P>
    <P>I have no information as to whether or not seed potatoes are available in the Athlone area or other areas from which they used to be brought.  So far <Col N="1493" /> as my part of the country is concerned, they are not there, and I do not know if they will be available.  Possibly, the Minister for Agriculture knows whether or not they will be available, but the country, as a whole, does not know it. This is a matter of considerable importance, and any farmer who has had experience of the difficulty connected with the sowing of good and bad seeds, such as myself or the Leas-Chathaoirleach, or people like that, would not dream of buying seeds unless they could get the very best and also be able to change the seed every year, because that is essential to good farming. I do not know if we have any machinery in this country by means of which we could get such information, and, accordingly, I join issue with the Parliamentary Secretary when he says, as I understood him to say, that the responsibility of his Department ends with the provision of credit, and that it is up to the Department of Agriculture to provide the seeds.  I wish that the Parliamentary Secretary would take up that matter.  I may be unduly alarmed about this thing.  Perhaps people from County Galway or County Kerry could tell us what the position is, but I think that there will be no surplus of either grain or root crops in this country this year, and, therefore, this matter of the provision of seeds is very important, and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will consider that this matter is worthy of consideration by his Department.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable people, who have not ready cash, to procure seeds which they have not been able to procure last year or even during the last few years.  I may say that seeds have been issued by the Cork County Council, and the Minister for Agriculture stated in the other House that there would be enough spring wheat.  As regards oats, seed must be fairly hard to get now, but it can be got, and not so very far away from Senator Baxter's county, because I have noticed such seed oats fairly close to my own part of the country, and as near as West Cork.</P>

      <P>There is no possibility of getting it from outside during the emergency.  I do not see where we could get a change unless we got it from areas close to Senator Baxter's county, and we have been doing that for a number of years.  We got seeds from Donegal, but I do not know if we ever sent any up there.  This is a very useful Bill, and the scheme which it operates has worked well in County Cork since it was initiated.  The reason that the number of people availing of the loan is falling is, I believe, due to the fact that people are able to get enough of their own seed, or are in a position to purchase in the open market.  Under this scheme anybody who wants to procure seeds or fertilisers does not go to the market to buy from the farmers.  He buys from the merchants, and he gets the same seeds from the merchants as the man who has ready cash.  Of course, if seeds were very scarce, human nature being what it is, the man with the money would probably get the preference, but I have never known of anybody to go short under this scheme, and I have no great fears that there is likely to be any shortage this year.</P>

      <P>I think the term &ldquo;salaried&rdquo; refers both to an officer and an employee.  These would be staffs that would have long-term contracts with the dissolved company. The position of the wage staff would be different.  I presume they are engaged on a daily or weekly basis.</P>

      <P>But the purpose of the section is to preserve the contract of service irrespective of its character, whether daily or weekly, and reference is made to an employee as well as to a salaried officer.

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On this balance sheet question, I want to come back to a point which I raised on the Second Reading.  On the last occasion I got a broadside in the rear&mdash;if one can get a broadside in the rear&mdash;from Senator Duffy, so I had better make myself clear at the beginning.  I am not at all making the case that the money which was spent on these companies was not well spent.  The only point I am making is that the manner in which it is being spent should be known.  I think there should be something in the nature of a trading account available, showing the various branches of the company, so that both Houses could get an idea of the amount that is being spent on pyrites in Wicklow, on coal in Slievardagh, and so on&mdash;a trading account segregating so far as possible the expenditure under the different paragraphs of the report as it is laid on the Table at present.  There is a certain amount of anxiety to know how <Col N="1498" /> exactly the money is being spent.  I think that could be done without in any way impairing the efficiency of the companies concerned, or in any way affecting the actual spending of the money.</P>
      <P>I mentioned on the last occasion the case of another company, where there was evidence given in court which did, in the minds of those who were present in court, give rise to a presumption which I think should be rebutted in some shape or form&mdash;where the Turf Development Board gave a contract to a man, and on his own evidence he had earned £12,000 out of that contract. It would be very undesirable, because sufficient publicity was not given to trading accounts, that there should be a suspicion that something was wrong. I think, if trading accounts were made available to both Houses&mdash;I do not want to draw the Minister again on the subject of the Vocational Commission's Report&mdash;there would not be any possibility of such suggestions being made.  I think the Minister will agree with me that the more publicity that is given to the manner in which public funds are spent the better for all concerned. The trading account is by far the best way of giving that publicity, and it would satisfy everybody so far as those companies are concerned.  It does not matter, of course, in the case of the dying company, but it would be a wise course for the Minister to adopt in the case of the continuing company, and in the case of other companies so far as he can.  As I mentioned the example which I gave on the last occasion, I do sincerely hope that at some stage or other, when the affairs of that particular company come before the House, the Minister will be able to deny that the facts are as stated. I do not believe the Minister thinks they are, and it would be bad if the matter were left at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal obligation on those companies was to produce a profit and loss account and balance sheet, which, with the auditors' comments thereon, were laid on the Table of the Oireachtas.  This new company, which will be taking over the activities of the two previously existing companies, will be engaged in a number <Col N="1499" /> of mining activities.  I do not think it would be reasonable to ask them to segregate their central expenditure, either expenditure on the head office or on the services of technical staff, as between the various activities on which they are engaged.  The accounts as published do show the amount devoted to the development of each particular deposit in which they are now interested. In the profit and loss account of the coal-mining company, there is a heading for the Slievardagh development account, and, in the Minerals Development Company, two headings, one showing the amount expended in respect of the Avoca deposit and the other in respect of the Clare deposit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to the Minister, the profit and loss account starts off with a balance from the trading account.  I think the Minister possibly may see the trading account, but the profit and loss account shows of course the Slievardagh and the general company.  The profit and loss account does not segregate the development of a mine in Clare from that of a mine in Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it shows the amount expended on development.  Of course, development is a form of capital expenditure, which must be recovered eventually out of profits on sales, if there are profits on sales.  In every mining undertaking there is that preliminary expenditure which must be incurred before profitable working becomes possible.  One of the reasons why those companies have been amalgamated is to secure certain measures of economy, and I think we would interfere with the operations of the company if we were to require the presentation to the Oireachtas of accounts which showed precisely the expenditure incurred on the working of each deposit.  A great part of the equipment which the company will be utilising, as well as the services of a large number of staff, will be transferable as required from one particular development to the other.  I think it would be unnecessary to require the company to keep that elaborate system of costing which would be <Col N="1500" /> undertaken by a Government Department&mdash;in any event, it would be only a matter of estimation&mdash;and which would be designed to show the extent to which the salaries of staff or the cost of equipment were to be charged to one particular development as against another.  This new company will have the same statutory obligations as the old companies had, and I do not think there has been any case of a company operating under statute where more elaborate accounts were required to be submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine that the Minister himself, or his Department, gets information from the company showing what they have spent in Sligo and what they have spent in Clare.  I am not particular as to whether it is done in the form of an account or whether it is incorporated in a paragraph in the report&mdash;when the report is dealing in a particular paragraph with something that is done in Sligo&mdash; if there is a rough figure showing that, of the trading profit, so much is estimated to be attributable to Sligo.  I do not want any involved system of accounting in which the central expenditure is to be split up.  That would be quite unnecessary.  I think the information is already in the Minister's Department, and all I am suggesting is that, when the papers are tabled, they should include some of the information &mdash;if necessary as an approximation&mdash; which the Minister himself has got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another consideration which I will put to the Senator.  This company, so far as it is a producer of coal, is only one of a number of producers of coal, and should not be put under any obligation to publish information regarding its operations which another coal producer is not obliged to disclose.  In so far as the Avoca deposits are concerned, I told the Seanad on the last occasion, if we adopt the report of the experts who are advising us, large-scale development will be undertaken, development which would be impossible under present circumstances, and which cannot take place until it is possible to have a large export trade in ores.  There may also be the question <Col N="1501" /> of commercial prudence which might direct us to avoid going into too great detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Too great detail? But, surely the Minister agrees that if the Oireachtas is asked to grant another £160,000, the Oireachtas should be told how much of that £160,000 is going to be advanced in a particular area?  Of course, you are not advancing it in this Bill, but it is going to be advanced, and when it has been advanced, the Oireachtas should be told that its advances had been used, for example, as to 20 per cent. to Sligo and 10 per cent. to Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But I cannot find anything like that being done at the present time.  I agree with the Minister that no commercial secrets should be publicised, but I think it could be done quite easily by a small sentence at the end of each of the 11 paragraphs in the existing report saying: &ldquo;It is estimated that this has produced this&rdquo; and that &ldquo;This sub-section of the work has produced a profit of £2,000&rdquo;, that &ldquo;That sub-section has produced a loss of £1,000&rdquo;, and &ldquo;The third sub-section has had development costs of £10,000 expended, from which we hope to get a return in another year&rdquo;, All I ask is that we should say something like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator understands that the legislation fixes the limit of the capital advances which can be made, and that that limit cannot be exceeded without fresh legislation. When that fresh legislation is submitted to the Oireachtas for approval, I would regard it as reasonable for any member of either House to demand information as to what new capital has been expended upon the works, and how the concern has been progressing. I gave that information, so far as it is available in present circumstances, when introducing the Bill.  I stated that the purpose for which the new capital was required was to complete the mechanisation of the Slievardagh colliery, and the installation of the necessary concentration plant at Avoca, apart altogether from the fact that recurring <Col N="1502" /> advances have been necessary to both companies during the emergency to meet losses.  The company is trading at a loss in respect of all its undertakings at the present time, and certainly that loss will continue as long as the emergency continues, or until the company is allowed by the Government to charge prices which are related to the cost of production.  The further development of Avoca which I mentioned would involve a new capital advance, and, therefore, would necessitate fresh legislation, and if such legislation were produced, I would say that the Oireachtas would be entitled to get full particulars of the development plans intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Minister's own words, I would be entitled to ask him what portion of the £240,000 had already been spent on the Wicklow works at Avoca, what portion had been spent in Clare, and what portion in Slievardagh&mdash;Slievardagh was separate &mdash;and to take each one of the paragraphs. I think if I did that the Minister would not be quite so anxious to trot out all the details.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a point there, and if I grasp the significance of it, it is an interesting point of view for him to express.  He said that inasmuch as the Slievardagh concern is mining coal, and because it is in competition with other private interests, who are under no obligation to disclose their profits or the results of their working, enterprises like this semi-State enterprise should be in the <Col N="1503" /> same position.  I think that is rather an extraordinary point of view.  Private interests have a perfect right to exist and their operators will be in a very peculiar position if they are to be in competition with a semi-State enterprise that can be run at a loss and not under any obligation to disclose how its business is being managed.  If the Minister is taking a stand on that and barring any note of interrogation it is a point of view that the Oireachtas could hardly accept.  We accept that the conditions are such that this Bill is necessary.  What the Minister wants to do is unanimously supported.  I am all for spending money, and losing money, on works of exploitation like this to prove things, but while I am prepared to do that, I see no reason in an effort like this, where it is a matter of internal development, and where you are not going to sell something to outsiders, why the Minister or a department or a company operating like this should not be under the obligation to disclose the results of its labours.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister has to take a stand, that this sort of exploitation is going to require money in order that we can prove something.  If you accept that, you are under an obligation to publish the results of your labours, and I do not think you ought to shelter behind the fact that private interests are going to get information.  That is a stand you can hardly take, and I think that if private interests are to be up against that sort of competition, they have a perfect right to resent the Oireachtas financing businesses like this with which they are in competition. The State has means of discovering the results of the trading of the various companies, but these companies have not the facilities to discover what the State is doing, and they would have a very considerable grievance on that account.  I do not think the Minister ought to try to maintain that defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is straining the meaning of words to describe this company as in competition with other companies in coal mining, seeing that all the coal mines in the country cannot <Col N="1504" /> produce a fraction of the coal we require. Ordinarily the State would not engage in this enterprise at all, either directly or through a subsidiary, if private enterprise could do the work itself.  In the case of Slievardagh, there were certain circumstances relating to the ownership of the deposits and other circumstances which made it necessary to undertake the working of the deposits by the State during an emergency, because only the State would be prepared to incur the substantial losses that were involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned on the last occasion that the idea of the company disposing of its interests in the Slievardagh collieries to a private concern could be entertained, and a time may arise in which it could be regarded, not merely as good policy but as good business, for the company to part with its interests in that colliery to some private company.  Even, however, if that is to be the outcome of its work in Slievardagh, we should have regard to ordinary business practice, and give this company whatever right to withhold from publication details of its costs or operations which any other private company has.  There is no question of withholding from the Oireachtas, or the public, information as to results.  The accounts that are required to be published under the statute will give ample opportunity to members of the Oireachtas, and the public generally, to know whether there is a profit or a loss, and precisely how much profit or loss there is, and what the various charges on the company's revenue may be from time to time.  The point that was raised here was whether the information which was required by statute to be published should not be amplified.  I was arguing against that.  I do not think there is any case for arguing that a company in which the State is interested is required to do more than companies are required to do under the Companies Act.  These companies are, in fact, constituted under the Companies Act.  The statute merely empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce to take measures to secure the formation and registration of these companies under the Companies Act.  The effect of the Bill is <Col N="1505" /> merely to ensure that these companies registered under the Companies Act will be amalgamated, with the changes and constitution which this Bill proposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware the Electricity Supply Board is financed by advances from the Exchequer authorised from time to time by legislation.  One of the principal purposes of this Bill is to raise by £7,500,000 the limit of advances which may, under existing legislation, be made to the board.  That £7,500,000 is a token vote intended to cover certain expenditure of a capital nature which the board proposes to undertake as soon as may be.  I do not think that the sum will cover the whole of the capital expenditure to which the board will be committed by reason of these developments.  The developments contemplated are&mdash;firstly, the construction of works on the River Erne for the generation of electricity; secondly, the construction of a steam station at Clonsast in Laoighis, at which turf will be the fuel burned, and certain other purposes which are properly described as normal developments of the board's activities.  Of the total amount contemplated to be expended in the near future&mdash;roughly £3,500,000 would be required for the River Erne, and £1,500,000 for the Clonsast station. Some £2,500,000 would be required for the development of the board's distribution service and about £800,000 for various contingencies, including manufacturing operations by the board. There are minor items to which I need not refer in any detail, and a subsequent small additional development of the River Liffey, certain things which the board requires for its work, expenditure on the protection of fisheries and the projection of future developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total capital cost of the programme which the board has prepared, and for which it asks these advances is estimated at £10,000,000 at pre-war <Col N="1507" /> values.  It is impossible to give any precise estimate of what the cost will be until orders for the plant and equipment have been placed.  It is not yet possible to place these orders, and consequently no very precise estimate of the actual cost of the works can be given.  The Bill proposes to permit the board to undertake development of rivers for power purposes without the obligation of securing specific legislative sanction for each such development. The position of the board at present is that it has under existing Acts full powers to undertake development of steam stations, subject only to the capital being made available by the Exchequer, but it has no such power in relation to water power stations. The only water power stations constructed, that at the Shannon and those on the Liffey, were each authorised by specific Acts.  In view of the intention to proceed with the Erne development and with a number of other smaller developments on various rivers it is considered that a time has been reached at which the power of the board to undertake water power development can be established by legislation. The proposal in the Bill is that the board, having prepared plans, will submit them to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and subject to his approval the works may be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>Whatever reason there may have been in the past for retaining to the Oireachtas the power to authorise each specific and separate water-power development, in my opinion, no longer exists.  The Electricity Supply Board has now been established for a number of years.  It has built up a competent staff able to undertake the planning of this development and we can, I think, with confidence, entrust them with the task of preparing these plans and carrying them through without any of the safeguards which were considered necessary in the early stage of the board's existence.  I presume the House will agree as to the necessity for making ample and speedy provision for the installation of new capacity by the board.  It may be that the works now contemplated&mdash;the water-power <Col N="1508" /> works and the steam generating stations&mdash;will not be possible of completion until some time after the conclusion of hostilities, when the necessary plant and equipment can be procured abroad.  However, it was decided that all the necessary preliminary steps should be taken, that the legislation should be enacted, plans prepared, sites acquired and whatever construction is possible under present circumstances completed as soon as possible, so that, when the equipment becomes available, there will be no avoidable delay in getting it into use.</P>
    <P>We shall have after the war a situation in which, for a number of years, the demand for electricity will be substantially in excess of the board's capacity to supply.  Before the war, the demand for electricity was increasing at the rate of, approximately, 30,000,000 units per year.  It will help the House to understand what precisely is involved in an increase at that rate when I mention that the capacity of the Liffey power station is 30,000,000 units.  At the rate at which the demand was growing before the war, we should have required a new station of that capacity every year. The installation of new capacity during the war was not possible and there has been, therefore, a damming up of demand which will become effective immediately normal conditions are restored in trade and industry.  If we assume that the demand would have grown during those five war years at the same rate as before the war and that the whole of that new demand will be effective after the war, then the contemplated station on the Erne will be merely sufficient to make good the arrears which have been occasioned by the war, and the continuing growth in the demand after the war, which is estimated by the board at about 40,000,000 units per year, will involve the planning of further stations sufficient to enable that demand to be met.  It is my opinion that we should, at least, plan upon the basis of being able to meet any increase in the demand which may arise&mdash;that, in other words, we should plan for surplus capacity rather than for a continuing deficiency.  The possible growth in the <Col N="1509" /> demand for electricity here is difficult to estimate.</P>
    <P>We are at present consuming electricity per head of population to a much lesser extent than practically any other European country&mdash;certainly any other European country with conditions comparable with ours.  I gave certain statistics in that regard in the Dáil which, I think, amply illustrate the scope there is for electricity development here.  In 1938&mdash;that year was taken because it is the last for which figures are available for a number of, European countries&mdash;the number of units per head of population generated by the Electricity Supply Board was 114.  In the same year, the figure for Denmark was 316; Holland, 333; Italy, 345; France, 452; Belgium, 620; and Finland, 779.  These countries are all somewhat like our own, inasmuch as agriculture constitutes a very large part of their industry, and is a primary source of wealth and of employment. Owing to exceptional circumstances in the case of Norway, Switzerland and Sweden, a comparison may not be very useful.  Against our 114 units per head of population in 1938, Sweden had a production of 1,294 units, Switzerland, 1,679, and Norway, 3,417. These figures show that we can contemplate a very considerable increase in the consumption of electricity for industrial and domestic purposes, and that we must plan our future generation programme on a basis which will enable us, at least, to reach the position which was attained before the war by such countries as Denmark, Holland and Belgium, which had no conditions dissimilar from our own other than a more intensive industrial development.</P>
    <P>The plan for the development of the Erne contemplates the utilisation of the falls of Assaroe where the river enters the sea at Ballyshannon.  It is proposed to develop these falls in two steps by the construction of two dams across the existing river valley and the erection at each dam of a power station. The lower or first step will utilise about 72 per cent. of the fall, and the station will be located at a distance of, approximately, three-quarters of a mile up-stream from the road bridge across the Erne in the <Col N="1510" /> town of Ballyshannon.  The upper or second step will utilise about 28 per cent. of the fall, and the station will be located approximately three miles up-stream from the lower step.  The stations on the Erne will, it is estimated, produce about 200,000,000 units per year at the first stage of development. There will, possibly, be further development which will increase the output to 250,000,000 units per year.</P>
    <P>These are, of course, no more than estimates at the present time because, as the works proceed, some variation of the plans may become necessary.  It is expected that from 1,500 to 2,000 men will be employed upon the works for a period of three years.  The commencement of the constructional activities is intended for the spring of the present year.  How far it will be possible to continue them will depend on the availability of certain equipment which will be required when the construction will have proceeded to a certain stage.</P>
    <P>As Senators who have read the reports by the Electricity Supply Board will have noted, the board is carrying out investigations of the water-flow in certain other rivers with a view to the preparation of plans for their development at a later stage.  The Erne is, however, the second largest river in the country and has a much greater potential power output than any of the remaining rivers.  Any further water-power stations will, therefore, be of substantially smaller capacity than those of the Erne, but it is considered not undesirable that there should be a number of smaller stations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As I informed the Dáil, the intention is that the electricity required in the future should be produced entirely from native resources, either by the use of water-power or turf as fuel.  There are no technical difficulties in the utilisation of turf for steam-raising purposes, and the only problem that remains to be solved in that connection is the measures that may have to be adopted to permit of turf production, by mechanised methods on an adequate scale, being made adaptable to the requirements of a stand-by station. <Col N="1511" /> The new stations to which I have referred&mdash;those on the Erne and at Clonsast&mdash;will be base-load stations, and the estimates of production from the Erne are, of course, based upon the flow of water in an average year. As everybody knows, the flow of water in any river varies from year to year, and on that account water-power stations have to be supplemented by stand-by stations utilising power of another kind so that, in a particularly dry year, the output of electricity can be maintained.  The Pigeon House station&mdash;a stand-by station in the Electricity Supply Board scheme&mdash;has, for a number of years past, been carrying a substantial part of the base load.  In fact, in recent years, it would be true to say that the output from the Pigeon House station has exceeded the output from the Shannon works, but I think it is desirable to get back, as quickly as possible, to the stage in which the Pigeon House would only have a stand-by part, and that the whole of the output should be taken by the turf-burning stations or water-power stations.</P>
    <P>The problem of utilising turf for the purposes of stand-by stations is not a technical problem associated with the generation of electricity; but a technical problem in connection with the production and marketing of turf, and the Turf Development Board which is associated with the Electricity Supply Board, in regard to these matters, is giving its attention to that problem.</P>
    <P>Another part of this measure relates to the rural electrification scheme, details of which were published in a report prepared by the board at my request and made available to the public some months ago.  I am sure that members of the House have studied that report and that it is not necessary at this stage to give, in any great detail, particulars of the scheme adopted by the board.  The intention, however, is that electricity should be supplied in the rural areas at a charge which will not exceed the present rural tariff of the Electricity Supply Board. It is not possible to provide electricity at that price in the rural areas without subsidising the capital cost of the network required to bring the supply to <Col N="1512" /> those areas.  While the estimates of the cost prepared by the Board have had to be based upon various assumptions that may or may not be correct, it is nevertheless clear that if the intention of the Government to provide current in the rural areas at the present rural tariff rates is to be carried out, the board must receive some proportion of the total capital cost involved, by way of free grant.  The calculations made indicate that, roughly, one-half of the capital cost of the network must be met by way of grant, but that is by no means clear.  The assumptions arrived at by the board may not prove to be correct and, in fact, it is hoped that experience will show that a somewhat smaller proportion of the total capital cost, by way of grant, will permit of the sale of current at the rates contemplated.  The total capital cost involved is estimated at £17,500,000 on a pre-war basis, but what the eventual cost will be, after the war, will have to be ascertained as the work proceeds.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for making available to the board a sum of £5,000,000 which will permit of the board commencing operations.  That device of authorising under this Bill only a proportion of the total capital cost contemplated was adopted because we considered it desirable that at an early stage the experience of the board in the operation of the scheme, as well as in the purchase of materials, should be reviewed and a decision made as to whether it is necessary to provide 50 per cent., or a somewhat lesser percentage of the total capital cost by way of grant.  The limitation of the amount which may be made available to the board, as contemplated in this Bill, ensures that this review, to which I have referred, takes place at a comparatively early stage.  It will be understood, of course, that the constructional work in providing the necessary network in rural areas will be a long-term operation.  As Senators will have seen from the report, some 75,000 miles of 10,000-volt lines must be constructed, and the total length of the lines constructed up to date is 3,840 miles.  A comparison of those two figures will give an indication of the magnitude of the task which has been <Col N="1513" /> given to the Electricity Supply Board. A further indication is given by the fact that the scheme will involve the erection of 100,000 transformers, as against 1,232 transformers at present in use.  If that network is to be completed within ten years after supplies become available for that purpose, it will involve the construction of network at the rate of 7,500 miles per year.  Now, the maximum rate of construction achieved by the Shannon scheme contractors was 650 miles per year, and the maximum achieved by the Electricity Supply Board was 330 miles per year.  It will be obvious, therefore, that a very great amount of organisation will be required on the part of the Electricity Supply Board in order to ensure that it will have the personnel and the machinery to enable it to carry through the whole of the rural electrification scheme within a period of ten years.  There are, in fact, some experts of the board who think that it is not practicable to complete the construction of the network in ten years, but it is obviously desirable that it should be done as quickly as possible, and the board is being pressed to prepare its plans upon the basis of completing it in that period.</P>
    <P>There are some other provisions in the Bill to which perhaps it is desirable to refer.  One of these removes the need for a certificate to be given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the Minister for Finance that the sums to be advanced to the board out of the Central Fund are reasonably and properly required by the board for any purpose arising out of the performance of its functions under the Electricity Acts.  Some members of the House will remember that when the Electricity Supply Board was established circumstances arose which made it desirable, in the opinion of my predecessor as Minister for Industry and Commerce, to amend the legislation so as to secure for the Minister for Industry and Commerce certain powers over the financial activities of the Board. These powers were obtained by the Electricity Supply (Amendment) Act of 1931.  Conditions have, however, very much altered in recent years and the need for the certificate contemplated by the 1931 Act no longer exists.  It is <Col N="1514" /> considered sufficient that the advances applied for by the board should be made by the Minister for Finance on the recommendation of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That simple procedure gives ample power to ensure that the capital outlay is kept within the statutory limit and that is, I think, the sole function which the Minister for Industry and Commerce needs now to exercise in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is intended that, to the maximum extent that may be possible, electrical apparatus, equipment and machinery which will be required either by the board as distributors, or by the people of the country as consumers, should be manufactured here.  There are various classes of electrical apparatus manufactured here at the present time.  A large number of firms have shown an interest in the possibility of establishing new industries for the production of electrical equipment of one class or another in the post-war period.  It is, however, contemplated that there may be circumstances in which it would be desirable that the board itself should have power to undertake the manufacture of equipment or power to promote the establishment of subsidiary companies for that purpose.  There will be many classes of equipment produced by private enterprise in other countries for which in this country the board will be the only possible customer, and private enterprise might not be interested in undertaking manufacture here in such circumstances without some liaison with the board or some association on the part of the board with the work.  It is, therefore, proposed to give the board power to manufacture or to arrange for the manufacture of apparatus on authority from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Provisions are inserted in the appropriate section which are designed to ensure that the authority of the Minister will not be given where private enterprise is in a position to do the work satisfactorily.  I would ordinarily regard it as desirable that industrial development of that kind should be sponsored by private enterprise. It is because of the special circumstances relating to the type of apparatus <Col N="1515" /> and machinery involved here that it is considered necessary to have for the board power to do the work if it is obvious that the work would not be done otherwise.  Discussions have begun with the Electricity Supply Board and with a number of private firms interested in developments of that nature with a view to the preparation of a programme of manufacture. It is hoped that a very high proportion of the equipment required by the board for these development purposes and of the various classes of electrical apparatus which private citizens will require after the war will in fact be manufactured here at quite an early stage.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is any other aspect of the Bill to which I need refer in detail at this stage.  The main purposes of the Bill are, as I have mentioned, to authorise an increase in the limit of advances to the board, for the purpose of enabling the new generating stations which I have mentioned to be constructed; to authorise the board to undertake the construction of hydro-generating stations without the necessity for new legislation on the occasion of each such development, but solely on the certificate of approval of the Minister for Industry and Commerce; to make certain provisions which are required to facilitate the rural electrification scheme and to authorise the board, as I mentioned towards the close of my remarks, in certain circumstances to undertake and arrange for the manufacture of equipment and apparatus.  If there are any matters of detail to which Senators wish to refer, they can perhaps be more conveniently discussed in Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Four or five minutes will suffice to say all I desire to say on this Bill.  It is a Bill, as the Minister has indicated, the provisions of which can be more suitably discussed in Committee rather than in a general discussion now.  Every member of the House will support the Government in its effort to secure the objects of the Bill.  As I was listening to the Minister I could not help running my mind back to the occasion 20 years ago when his predecessor in office was introducing <Col N="1516" /> the Shannon Scheme Bill.  Remembering the scepticism which he had then to meet both inside and outside the House, I could not help reflecting how very lucky the present Minister is that everyone now accepts the need for speed in the preparation of schemes for the production of more electricity.  If anybody had made such a statement 20 years ago he would have been almost laughed at.  That shows that, at any rate, we have made progress.</P>
      <P>I entirely agree that every possible effort should be made to speed up this scheme and if I have any quarrel at all with the Minister's plans, it is that the scheme may not be carried through quickly enough.  I take it that the Minister intends to leave the initiative to the board, that they will obtain estimates and accept them.  I think that speed may easily be a very important factor, even more than the question of cost, because I am convinced that if anything his estimate of the figures of demand are on the low rather than on the high side.  There is just the danger &mdash;it sometimes happens particularly when you have the Minister for Finance concerned&mdash;that a cheaper and a slower scheme may take the place of a possibly more expensive scheme whereas in the long run the costlier scheme might be the more advantageous.</P>
      <P>I have personally great confidence in the Electricity Supply Board as an organisation, and I think it enjoys the confidence of the public also.  It is one of the best organisations we have ever had in the country, and it has on its staff quite a number of very able and energetic young men.  I think we may very well have confidence that as time goes on the board will attract to its service a number of other young men of ideas.  As far as I am concerned I am entirely behind the principles of the Bill and I welcome it.  I am not sure as to the wisdom of the provisions of the Bill regarding the manufacture of apparatus, but that is a matter which can be dealt with more suitably on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we can all feel grateful to the Minister for the very exhaustive review which he gave to the House on the Second Reading of this Bill.  He went into great detail, and explained the position in a very satisfactory manner.  He made it possible for us all to understand the Bill&mdash; whether or not some of us understood it before his speech.  In that connection too, I think we ought to express appreciation of the manner in which the Electricity Supply Board prepared what I suppose would be described as a White Paper on this subject.  It is fashionable nowadays to have White Papers about all kinds of subjects. Not all of them are very informative. Some of them are based more on wishful thinking than on reality.  Certainly, that cannot be said of the report published by the Electricity Supply Board some time ago on rural electrification. I understand that it was prepared on the instructions or at the request of the Minister.  I am sure members of the House have read that report in relation to this Bill, and the scope of the Bill must be clear to those who have done so.  Roughly speaking, what we are endeavouring to do here, as I understand it, is to provide machinery mainly to give a supply of current to the rural areas.  In the towns and cities, of course, a supply is available for 95 or 96 per cent. of the people who live there, but about 60 per cent of the total population live in the rural areas, and not one in every 100 of those people has a supply of electricity available to him.  That means, of course, that the scheme which will be based on this Bill will be a relatively costly one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is going to be much more expensive to carry electricity to the isolated farmhouse and to the outhouse on the farm than it is to provide electricity for town dwellers who live in closely inhabited communities.  I take it that the network, particularly, will be an expensive undertaking.  The Minister fixed a figure of £17,000,000, based I think, on 1939 costs, but nobody can hope that when this scheme is carried into effect, costs will have <Col N="1518" /> remained where they were in 1939. The Minister mentioned elsewhere the likelihood of an increase of probably two-thirds on the 1939 figure, so that one may regard the scheme visualised here as an enterprise which will cost £27,000,000 to £30,000,000.</P>
    <P>Everybody welcomes the Bill, everybody is urging that the work provided for in the Bill will be carried through expeditiously, but I have heard very little reference made to what this involves in costings to the community, costings in relation to domestic current, and costings in relation to the use of current in so far as current will be used for domestic purposes in the rural areas.  In the report on rural electrification prepared by the Electricity Supply Board, a good deal of information is given concerning the use of electricity elsewhere in various farm operations.  If, as I hope, we are to use electricity in this country on a large scale on the farm, in the byre, and in the dairy, we have to consider what is likely to be the cost to the consumer, and that will depend, very largely, in fact almost entirely, on the manner in which this scheme is financed.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Electricity Supply Board, in their report, estimate the capital cost per dwelling at £34 10s. for Louth&mdash;the lowest figure they have given&mdash;and at £49 for Wicklow, which, I think, is the highest figure.  This is based on an analysis given in the report which represents a charge of 12 per cent. on the capital provided by the Bill&mdash;that is to say, the Electricity Supply Board in their report make an allowance of 5 per cent. for interest on capital, 2.5 per cent. for depreciation, 1/2 of 1 per cent. for sinking fund, and 4 per cent. for costs.  But the output of the scheme is calculated at 200,000,000 units per annum, and if my calculation is right, the interest charges on capital, the sinking fund, the depreciation, and the other costs represent 2.448d. per unit, to which will have to be added running costs and other charges, so that if money is to be borrowed by the State and advanced to the Electricity Supply Board at 5 per cent., as the report contemplates, either we must charge a very high price to the rural consumer <Col N="1519" /> for his electric current, or we must find a large sum for subsidisation.</P>
    <P>It does not matter very much which course is adopted, the person who pays the bill will eventually be the Irish taxpayer.  If he pays as a consumer, he probably will not pay as a taxpayer. If he does not pay as a consumer, he will be paying as a taxpayer.  I do not know whether it is necessary that we should always be getting banks and the stock exchange to lend the nation's credit to national institutions in order that we should go on indefinitely providing interest for money lenders whenever there is a scheme of this kind in contemplation.</P>
    <P>If ever there was an instance in which the State should utilise its power, its authority as a Government, to provide credit for an undertaking of such magnitude, it is in a case of this kind, where we are providing a public utility, a national asset for the people of the community, an asset that will show a dividend, and an asset that will assuredly return to the State any money advanced for the purpose of its promotion.  So far, of course, we have heard nothing in these discussions as to the manner in which the scheme's to be financed.  The board, however, seems to visualise that the money should be advanced to them at 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is sacrosanct about 5 per cent.  Money is not costing the Government 5 per cent.  Irish money is invested in Britain to-day at less than 1 per cent.  Irish money is invested in England by the Irish banks at as low as 17/6 per cent.  I do not say that these are long-term advances, but the British Government is borrowing on long-term at 2½ to 3 per cent., and we have here at our disposal large sums of money, the savings of the people, invested in savings banks, in savings certificates and in the Post Office Savings Bank at less than 3 per cent., and I do not think the Department of Finance is entitled, in advancing these sums under its control, for the purpose of a scheme like this, to make a profit at a cost to the community.</P>
    <P>A certain small margin is required <Col N="1520" /> for operating costs.  It was calculated in Birmingham years ago when a municipal bank was established there that the cost of handling the funds of the bank was 1/2 per cent.  The bank which was established in 1919 under a special Act in Britain, accepted deposits from the citizens of Birmingham.  They lent these deposits almost exclusively to the corporation at 1/2 per cent. more than they paid the depositors, and they calculated that that was ample as an operating cost.  Why the Department of Finance should borrow money in the form of Post Office sales at, say, 2½ per cent. and charge the Electricity Supply Board for a project of this kind 5 per cent. completely baffles me.  I do not know where the Minister stands in relation to this.  I do not know whether he has any authority to challenge the practices of the Department of Finance, but I think that this House should assure him of our fullest support in whatever efforts he thinks fit to make to ensure that a scheme of this kind will not be throttled by the exactions of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Assuming, for instance, that the money were provided at 2 per cent., it would make a tremendous difference in the cost of electric current.  Assuming again that the figure required is £17,000,000, at 5 per cent. the interest would amount to £850,000, at 2 per cent. the interest would amount to £340,000, so that if we take the estimate of 200,000,000 units, 5 per cent. means that the interest alone represents 1.02 pence per unit.  At 2 per cent. it is .408 pence per unit, a difference of .612 pence per unit, that is to say, the difference between 2 per cent. and 5 per cent. accounts for more than a halfpenny on every unit of electricity generated under this scheme.</P>
    <P>But I do not think that the cost is going to be £17,000,000.  I think it is going to be far more.  It can easily amount to £27,000,000, £28,000,000 or £30,000,000.  Assuming that it is, let us say, £27,000,000, there can be a saving of almost a penny, seven-eighths of a penny, per unit if interest charges imposed by the Department of Finance can be reduced from 5 per cent. to 2 per cent.  My own view is that it is not necessary to have either 5 per cent. or <Col N="1521" /> 2 per cent. and I recommend the Minister to look at what is done elsewhere. The example of New Zealand has been frequently mentioned in this House and elsewhere as an example of what can be done in the matter of finance to promote employment and enterprise and to keep down interest charges.  In no case can the example of New Zealand be quoted more effectively than in relation to a scheme of this kind, because it is one of the things in relation to which the New Zealand Government set aside a volume of State credit.  They set aside £5,000,000 for electrification, as one of three items for which £15,000,000 was originally provided.  The money was provided by the State without borrowing from the bank or moneylenders; flowing from the reserve bank at rates in some cases as low as 1 per cent., and in no case higher than 1¼ per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government rate charged for money provided on long-term for State electrification was 1 per cent.  There is no reason why 1 per cent. should be charged except the State thought that they should cover the operating costs and make a small provision for depreciation.  I am not suggesting a particular figure.  I am merely drawing attention to the fact that in operating the finances of this scheme the Minister can decide whether the people of rural Ireland are to be encouraged to use current and are to have it at a low price or whether they are to be discouraged.  Throughout this report of the Electricity Supply Board it is made perfectly clear that the matter is one very largely of finance.  The economic aspect of it is stressed rather than the technical aspect.  There is no technical difficulty about bringing electricity to every rural home in Ireland, and there is no reason why, if we can get rid of this burden <Col N="1522" /> of interest and money charges, everybody in Ireland should not have electricity cheaper than they can buy candles.  My interest in this matter is first and foremost to support the Minister wholeheartedly with regard to his scheme and to urge him to go forward as rapidly as he can with it, but at the same time to urge him that if this scheme is to mean anything to the homes of the people of rural Ireland, it will depend entirely on how he attacks the problem of finance.  If it is going to be based upon 5 per cent. interest then the answer is that the people of rural Ireland will do without electricity, unless it is subsidised.  If it is subsidised they will pay for it without knowing they are paying for it in indirect taxation.  That is the problem we are confronted with.  That is a problem all must face in relation to every project of this kind, whether it is electrification, drainage, houses or roads.</P>
      <P>All these big problems will come back to one of finance.  It seems to me that the only people who will gain by this scheme in the long run, if it is going to be on a 5 per cent. basis, are the moneylenders, the people who lend credit to the community.  They are going to gain.  There is one very unfortunate feature in this Bill with which I disagree and that is Section 41, where the Minister almost pledges that he will not permit the Electricity Supply Board to manufacture its own requirements in appliances if they can get moneylenders to come along and provide them.  That is a very unfortunate aspect.  Under Section 41, briefly it may be said that the Minister must be satisfied that the needs of the State are not likely to be satisfied in regard to a particular commodity before he does anything to make these appliances. In other words, if a group of people come in and establish a company out of which they feel certain they can make a profit on the manufacture of appliances they can carry on and probably get a licence to manufacture as well as an assurance that there will be no competitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is satisfied in that respect, he may authorise the board to arrange for the manufacture of equipment <Col N="1523" /> in short supply but he must publish notice of his intention to confer those powers on the board and invite and consider objections.  Before he authorises the board to proceed to manufacture any particular commodity, he must attach conditions and restrictions which will tie the Electricity Supply Board to some particular form of production or line them up with private interests which may, and probably will, throttle them eventually.</P>
    <P>That is one feature of the Bill which is objectionable.  It is a complete departure from the original conception of the scheme which established the Electricity Supply Board.  There was some discussion about this matter in connection with the original scheme. Some members of the House may remember that a question was raised as to whether or not the Electricity Supply Board should be permitted to go into trade.  That matter was fought out and the opinion of both Houses of the Oireachtas backed the Government of the day in their endeavour to ensure that the Electricity Supply Board would have freedom to go into trade.  They have gone into trade.  They have been able to go everywhere after the goods they required and buy them on the best terms.  That policy is being overthrown in Section 31 of this Bill. I do not say that it reverses previous policy but it opens the door to a new line of approach which, in time, will lead to the establishment of private monopolies as against a publicly-owned concern such as the Electricity Supply Board.  I do not desire at this stage to deal with any other aspects of the Bill but I do want to emphasise what I consider to be two important aspects, aspects which should engage the attention of members of this House and, particularly, of the Minister&mdash;the method of financing this scheme and the question of the manufacture of the Electricity Supply Board's requirements by private enterprise as against manufacture by the board itself.</P>

      <P>Ordinarily, Senator Duffy and I get on very well.  I have very considerable sympathy with his aims but, when he talks of the source <Col N="1524" /> of money being the moneylender, I rub my eyes and wonder whether I am in a world of reality.  According to Senator Duffy, everybody who puts up money for any enterprise is a moneylender. The shareholders of Guinness and the people who lend money to the Government are moneylenders.  Where does money come from?  The Senator has talked of making money available for electricity development at 1 per cent.  How is money to be got at 1 per cent.?  You may get money, repayable on demand, at 1 per cent.  But money for a purpose of this kind must be obtained by public loan.  Is Senator Duffy prepared to lend his savings to the Government for the development of electricity at 1 per cent.?</P>
      <P>Money has a market rate.  There is no getting away from that.  I should like to know more about this New Zealand finance by which long-term capital for electricity development was found at 1 per cent.  It can be found at 1 per cent. if the Government is prepared to pay the difference between that and the market rate.  The Central Bank could lend money to the Government at 1 per cent.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It could be done by amending the law, but would it be sound finance?  The ordinary method of providing money for such purposes is for the State to go out and borrow money from the citizens.  The rate at which the citizens are prepared to lend their money is the factor that runs through the whole scheme.  This business of producing rabbits out of a hat is nonsensical.  The Senator thinks that everything would be perfect if it were not for finance.  On the only occasion on which I met Mr. George Bernard Shaw, he said to me: &ldquo;My theory of life is that everybody should live at the rate of £10,000 a year.&rdquo; That is an excellent theory&mdash;except for finance.  How can you get away from the money question except by magic? The Senator wants to get away from finance but he does not tell us how we are to do it.  It can be done by the printing press.  The House knows <Col N="1525" /> what the consequences of that would be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly, there has been inflation in England and it is being kept in hand by a very generous measure of subsidies.  It is being paid for by the taxpayer.  That is the answer.  I should like to follow up this question because, from a different angle, I have certain views on this question of electricity finance. I think that the Minister will agree with me in those views.  Electricity could be financed better than it is being financed at present.  If the Electricity Supply Board were allowed to go into the market and issue its own bonds, it could, no doubt, on its reputation, raise credit at a rate in the region of 3 per cent.  I understand that it is now paying 5 per cent.  The difference of 2 per cent. represents a sum of from £200,000 to £250,000&mdash;I do not profess to give exact figures.  That sum of £200,000 or £250,000 is a tax on the consumer of electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see good reasons why the Minister for Finance should not wish the Electricity Supply Board to go into the money market in competition with the Government, but I do think that the Government should advance to the Electricity Supply Board money at no higher rate than that which they are themselves paying, with a small addition for administrative expenses.  I can see the Minister in another capacity; I can see him as an advocate for the Electricity Supply Board as against the Minister for Finance.  I have no doubt that the Minister has tried to persuade the Minister for Finance to be more accommodating in this matter. <Col N="1526" /> I can imagine the Minister for Finance arguing that he borrowed in the early days at 5 per cent., then at 4 per cent., with diminishing rates as money got cheaper down to 3 per cent., and asking how he is to disentangle electricity finance from any particular loan, or attach it to any particular loan.  That is not the right approach.  The rate should be the average of the Government's effective rates.  I have taken the trouble to find out what that average effective rate would be.  If Land Bonds were included&mdash;I mention Land Bonds, because they are partly guaranteed outside the State&mdash;the effective rate would be £4 2s. 3d. per cent.  If Land Bonds were excluded, the effective rate would be £3 18s. 7d. per cent.  Splitting the difference, let us say 4 per cent., I feel that any higher rate than 4 per cent. is in the nature of taxation on the electricity consumer.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that this is not germane to the present debate, but I do think that it is bound up with the finance of this Bill.  The Minister would have a good case in urging that the Electricity Supply Board should pay the effective rate&mdash;the rate in respect of the total of Government borrowings. Surely, it should be quite possible to make that sort of a revision periodically, and, possibly, to say now that for the next three years the rate that is going to be effective will be the present rate, which, I understand, is 5 per cent., but that at the end of that period, the position will be revised, and that the rate of interest will be changed from 5 per cent., let us say, to 4 per cent., to 3 per cent., and so on. I think that that would be fair, because it seems to me that the present rate which, I understand, is 5 per cent., is a profiteering rate&mdash;a rate by which the Government is taxing the consumers of electricity for the benefit of the Revenue.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill itself, I think it is in the interests of the country as a whole.  I hope that Senator Foran is not going to remind me that in connection with this matter of electricity supply my record is very bad; but, after all, in 25 years, one should be given credit for learning at least a little, and although the scheme that we have now before us is very <Col N="1527" /> different from the scheme that I then criticised&mdash;I am not defending myself in that connection&mdash;I think that the Electricity Supply Board is a very different department, and that it has served the country very well.  For that reason, I am all in favour of the further independence that the Government proposes to allow to that body.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying, I wish he would deal with this matter of the charge for rural electrification, because I am not quite certain if that is going to be a fixed or a pivotal charge, or whether he proposes to build everything on the fixed charge, plus this three-farthings charge, on the rest.  I do not think it would be fair to do so. I think that some position should be arrived at whereby, if the Electricity Supply Board makes a profit, that charge could be capable of reduction. That, of course, is all bound up also with the question of the subsidy.  The Minister gave us to understand that the only estimated subsidy was to be 50 per cent. of the capital cost, but he also suggested that it might be less. I do not think he suggested that it might be more, but I do think that it should be definitely fixed at 50 per cent., and that then, if it were found that on that basis of 50 per cent. a profit was made, it should be possible to make a reduction in the rural tariff.</P>
    <P>In connection with this new expenditure, I approached the matter from the point of view of two separate compartments. First of all, as regards the main supply, I do not see why the main supply of current should cost more than it does by reason of the fact that rural electrification must have, as its primary source, a supply of electricity from the Erne or from turf production. I may be wrong, but I think that the primary source should be a main factor in the cost of distribution.  That is why this 50 per cent. is necessary, and that is why, on account of that high cost of rural electrification, the production of turf is necessary; but let us put it this way: If, having given a subsidy of 50 per cent., it is then found that current can be supplied more cheaply to the rural consumer, then the consumer should get the benefit of that, and we should not drift into the <Col N="1528" /> position where the present cost of the production of turf, as reported to the Minister, would become a fixed tariff governing the whole financing of this scheme.  I hope that the Minister, when he is replying, will deal with those points.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask him&mdash; perhaps I am displaying my ignorance in putting this question&mdash;where does the differentiation lie between the rural consumer of electricity and the urban consumer?  I understand that there are certain rural consumers at the moment, and I should like to know whether there is any method, whether in respect of population or otherwise, of calculating the differentiation between rural and urban consumers. Apart from the remarks I have made, I have great pleasure in supporting this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to intrude into what might appear to be a secret conspiracy between Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Duffy on the question of providing cheap money, but, judging from Senator Sir John Keane's remarks, it would appear to be obvious that we are heading towards the position where money will be particularly cheap in future.  I was rather interested in hearing the Senator advising the Minister to issue loans as he could now get money at the rate of 3 per cent.  Coming from a man such as Senator Sir John Keane, that is a very interesting proposal, and it is rather a revelation so far as the public of this country is concerned, in view of their experience in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>May I explain to the Senator that that is the price at which I think the Electricity Supply Board could go to the public for money, and that I believe that they could get money at that rate, but that that has nothing at all to do with the banks.  It has nothing at all to do with the banks.</P>

      <P>I do not know that the public are any more foolish than the banks, but Senator Sir John Keane, apparently, now says that the banks are not prepared to give money at that price, but that the public should provide it at that price.  That appears to me to be rather extraordinary, but, in any case, whether or not Senator Sir John Keane is nervous about the points of view he has expressed, the fact is that money has been got very cheaply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>And there is no doubt whatever that if what he has suggested were done, it would probably materialise.  In the case of the last Great War the British Government had to pay a very substantial interest on loans they got&mdash;amounting to 9 and 10 per cent.&mdash;in order to finance that war, but in the case of this country they were prepared to pay only 3 per cent., or less, on loans.  Now, that shows the difference between the banks taking over control of the country's finances and the Government of the country taking over the control of the country's finances in the interests of the people as a whole.  This is too serious a matter to talk upon flippantly, and it is very easy to mislead the public on this question of finance. I do not think that people should speak lightly on such a subject.  In this country, over the last ten years, we have had various loans floated, which were not fully subscribed, and yet Senator Sir John Keane had the audacity to say, as a slur upon the Government of this country, that they had to pay 4 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>Evidently Senator Sir John Keane misunderstands what he himself said.  I think the Senator should settle his own mind on this issue and let us know, definitely, what he has to say on this matter of finance. I do hold that when we talk in this House on such a matter we should talk about it very seriously and with a full sense of responsibility.  I do not think that this matter of finance in connection with rural electrification is one that should be treated lightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a courageous scheme undertaken by the Government, a scheme which requires both financial and technical ability in order to make it a success and to give the public as a whole a satisfactory supply of electricity. Senator Duffy gave us many facts in regard to the financing of the scheme, and went into very minute details as to the cost of money and as to the different ways in which money could be obtained, but the sum total of the Senator's efforts amounted only to a saving of a halfpenny a unit for the public.  To the average consumer for lighting purposes a halfpenny per unit is a negligible consideration, but, of course, where power for industry is concerned it is a very different question. As electricity is likely to be used increasingly for power purposes and possibly for transport in future, the cost of production should be reduced to the very minimum.  I think it would be useful if the Government could ascertain what our competitors in the field of industry in other countries have to pay for similar power, so that we would be in a position to compete with them from the point of view of the cost of power, at any rate.  The cost of power is a very important factor in the <Col N="1531" /> cost of production of any commodity, and anything the Government could do to ensure the provision of cheap power for industry would help substantially towards production and enable Irish manufacturers to produce goods both for the home and foreign market at competitive prices.</P>
    <P>Now that we are reorganising our electricity supply system for the future, I hope the Government will bear in mind that it is most undesirable from a security point of view to be dependent upon one source of supply such as the Shannon.  If by any chance this country suffered invasion very probably we would be deprived of power and light within a few minutes of the first attack.  To have left us in that position was a most short-sighted policy, and I hope that steps will be taken in future to secure our position in that regard.</P>
    <P>With regard to the supply of electricity for rural areas I am satisfied that a substantial number of people in rural areas may not be in a position to make any contribution whatever towards the capital cost of wiring their houses, etc.  While they would be very anxious to enjoy the advantages of an electricity supply, they may be debarred from availing of it owing to this initial expenditure.  I think that it would be advisable for the Minister to consider the position of farmers and other people with very low valuations who would not be in a position to make any contribution towards the initial cost.  I think there should be some scheme evolved to assist people with such low valuations.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister's advisers have made a deep study of the question of tidal power.  For instance in Achill Sound, between the island and the mainland, having watched the tide on many occasions coming backwards and forwards, I know that there is a terrific flow of water there.  A power of that particular type if harnessed would have tremendous producing capacity, and I think it would cost very little to have it utilised.  I should like the Minister to give all due study to such outlying sources of power which might be adapted for many purposes.  I <Col N="1532" /> do not think that such valuable sources of power should be wasted.  In conclusion I desire to congratulate the Minister, his Department, his officials and all concerned for the very valuable proposals which they have now put forward with the object of placing the amenities of an up-to-date electricity scheme at the disposal of our farmers and the community generally.  I hope they will keep in mind the desirability of finding an alternative for the overhead system of wiring and of evolving some other system which would be much more satisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is a somewhat unusual experience for the Minister to get general applause for a measure in this House or the other House.  While saying that, one must add that the method by which he proposes to implement this measure may not give general satisfaction, and he must expect some criticism if only for the purpose of getting enlightenment. This scheme must necessarily commend itself to all.  I had the privilege of being a member of the other House when the original Electricity Supply Bill was introduced.  I have just been looking at the official debates, and I see that on a date in March, 1927, I was discussing the measure.  I think the Minister to-day was a &ldquo;mitcher&rdquo; from school then.  He may have been with the hedge schoolmaster.  Now we are getting on; he is now building on the foundations laid then.  Unlike some of my colleagues on that day in March, 1927, I found myself an enthusiastic supporter of the proposition. A number of them were definitely sceptical; they were rather inclined to be doubting Thomases.  But we have all learned since then, and the Minister has the great advantage of the experience of his predecessor in office, and of the magnificent machine which that predecessor created and passed on to him to enable him to do this job in 1945.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we have to concern ourselves with in this measure, which is mainly a measure for rural electrification, is its possibilities of success.  What I have to ask myself is: Will the Minister <Col N="1533" /> and the Electricity Supply Board be able to sell the goods when they have been manufactured?  Unfortunately, I was out of the House for portion of Senator Duffy's speech.  I heard the end of it, and I heard Senator Sir John Keane's reply.  If I am to take the Minister's speech to-day in conjunction with the report of the Electricity Supply Board as the basis on which electricity is to be manufactured and sold to the rural community, I suggest to the Minister that this scheme cannot be a success.  On his basis of costings, we will not get the rural community of this country, on their present farm incomes, to buy electricity.  That is my opinion.  While saying that, however, I do not want to be taken as questioning the wisdom of the policy adumbrated in the Bill. I do not want to be taken in any sense as questioning the wisdom or the necessity or the advisability of going forward, but I want to put in my note of interrogation.  I want the Minister and the Seanad to examine the proposition in its widest implications, to see what we are committing the country to, before we give the scheme our complete and absolute blessing.</P>
    <P>As I see it, we are going to produce and sell electricity.  What are the factors which are going to fix the price at which this commodity will be sold? First, I take it, is the price of money&mdash; the capital which will be invested in the scheme.  That is one factor. Another factor is the price of the productive fuel, the turf in the bogs. Another factor is the price of the labour employed in the constructional work, and afterwards in the administrative work.  Another factor is the price of equipment.  Taking all those factors together, we get the sum total of the cost of the commodity which is to be manufactured and sold.  I take it the Minister will not dissent from that point of view.  When we examine the price at which it is to be sold, we find, both from the Minister's speech and from the costings given by the Electricity Supply Board in their report, that the figure is approximately what we are paying for electricity to-day.  I suggest to the Minister that it will be necessary either to raise farm <Col N="1534" /> incomes very considerably above their present level, or to cut the cost of electricity very considerably, before the rural population of this country can afford to take it.  Let us examine the first factor, the price of money. Senator Duffy has been doing that.  I suffered the disadvantage of not being able to hear the case he made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>We are here discussing a measure of very great importance. Our discussion centres around money at 5 per cent.  Apparently, that is the calculation on which our plans have been based up to the present.  Then, we will be asked where we are to get money at anything less.  Money is all a matter of confidence.  If somebody says to me&mdash;whether it be Senator Sir John Keane or the Minister&mdash;that we cannot expect to get money here at much less, I put it to the House that civilisation has reached an amazing pass indeed when the British Government, and the British banks headed and advised by Lord Keynes, can organise and implement a plan whereby the British have every confidence in putting money at 1-7/8th per cent. into shells that are blowing Germany to pieces, while we are expected to pay 3 per cent. for money to build a further Shannon scheme.  I am not surprised that that is the outlook of civilisation to-day, when we see what civilisation is doing with itself, but surely to goodness we should make another approach to this whole problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister said in part of his speech that we are going to utilise our native materials to the full.  I am all with him there.  That is what we ought to do.  If we could utilise our native materials to the full 100 per cent. it would simply mean that the consumers of electricity, as one section of the community, were paying a certain price for electricity, so that high rates of interest could be paid to some people, so that high wages could be paid to others, so that high dividends, perhaps, could be paid to the manufacturers of equipment.  That is the situation that you can create&mdash;a very very inequitable situation no doubt.  When you are selling services to your own people, no matter in what form the services are being sold, you are keeping the sum total of the value of the services within your own community, but as between different sections of your own community you can create inequities in the sale of those services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is something which the Minister must keep in mind.  If you are going to give us a medium through which the homes of rural Ireland will <Col N="1536" /> be electrified, through which we will have a little more comfort in our farmhouses, and a little more case in the way we do our job of work, you must keep that fact in mind.  If Senator Sir John Keane asks whether the people who have got the money, like Senator McEllin for instance, are ready to lend it unless the rate of interest is fairly high, I say that we have got to consider also whether we are going to put an impossible burden on the poor producer on the hillside so that the man who has the money will be provided with a comfortable income. If we decide that the man who lends the money has to get his fixed, stable, comfortable income, at the expense of the poor consumer of electricity, who is also a poor producer of essentials for the community, we will be doing something which, in my opinion, is so inequitable as to stultify our great effort right from the beginning.</P>
    <P>We may have another opportunity of discussing the price of money in relation to this measure.  I am a consumer of electricity myself in a small way. After years of pleading, I have managed, although my little farm was torn to pieces with all the poles and cables that have been erected, to get a little light a little while ago and I am quite satisfied that rural Ireland will not be lighted at the price I am paying for it. I know that some people have had it installed and when they can get light again from paraffin oil, they will go back to it.  I am putting that to the House, and I know what I am talking about.</P>
    <P>We are starting our scheme on the basis of a price for money which is the price of the money changer in the temple.  That is what it is, 5 per cent. in this country, where the conditions are more stable than in any country in the world, and where the prospects for the future are much better than anywhere else.  We shall yet see a time when people who have loose money will want to come here to invest it.  When conditions are like that, enterprise and effort must not be hindered by the exactions which capital is trying to make on new development. <Col N="1537" /> I would like to know from the Minister what his view is on that point.</P>
    <P>Let us go to the report of the committee on rural electrification.  Senator Duffy quoted the case of New Zealand, but you will find&mdash;I am sure Senator Sir John Keane has read this&mdash;that with regard to the United States, the report gives us in detail the interest rates for rural electrification administration loans made in each of the fiscal years from 1936 to 1941.  These were 3 per cent., 2.77 per cent., 2.88 per cent., 2.73 per cent., 2.69 per cent. and 2.46 per cent.  The period of the loan is 25 years and the rate of interest is based on the average rate the United States pays on its obligations over ten years.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw Senator Sir John Keane's attention to these rates from 1936 to 1941.  From 1941 onwards, the rates were 2.46 per cent.</P>

      <P>I would like to hear from Senator Sir John Keane what he has to say to these figures.  I hope that the Minister does not defend his theory but I should like to have a view from somebody as to why it is necessary that a country like this, paying its way and having exported so much of its capital outside&mdash;hundreds of millions at its own choice&mdash;has had to pump a great deal of this capital across to England, where they were getting 1? per cent. Why, then, is it necessary to take the attitude that rural electrification is possible only at an interest rate at 5 per cent. if the United States are able to do it at less than 3 per cent.? I want to know what is the answer, and I am prepared to join issue with anybody who will say in relation to our resources, that conditions are not as stable in this country as they are in the United States of America and that the prospects for the investor are not just as safe as they are in the United States of America.  That is the attitude we ought to take, and if we took it we would have more stability and if we have any money that anyone will take we will have a great many other <Col N="1538" /> people trying to invest their assets with us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fundamental question.  It gets at the root of the matter.  The Minister is going to develop electricity from our bogs.  I am all for the development of bogs.  I want them replaced by trees or land, but you cannot do much with them as they are at present.  I would pay a man to take them away, and when the water is drained we would have land which we could reclaim and use for building houses.  I am all for the development of our peat resources in whatever way we can develop them. It ought to be possible to have some idea of the costs, because you cannot go forward with your scheme of planning efficiently without having calculated your costings with the requisite fuel at Clonsast.</P>
      <P>I would like to have from the Minister his calculations and estimates in regard to that scheme.  What are the costs?  At what price will he be able to turn out the material per ton?  We are told that discussions are going on between the Turf Development Board and the Electricity Supply Board.  That is a very vital factor, and when you come to it, in order to get rid of the bogs, I would be prepared, if needs be, if the fuel were somewhat expensive, to do some subsidising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of national importance as well.  There is the question of the manufacture of equipment here in the country.  We ought to be able to do something in that direction because we have a considerable amount of technical knowledge in that matter now. But, there again, if private interests go into this, and they will, rightly, be encouraged to go into it, they will be in a much more privileged position and considerable dividends may be paid on the capital invested, perhaps without ensuring that plans are laid for the <Col N="1539" /> necessary technical development to keep pace with progress in other countries.  If that is not done the consumer will not get a fair deal, and I submit it as an aspect of the matter to which particular attention must be paid.  It will be necessary to have considerable research in the laboratories to ensure that the consumers will be kept supplied with as up-to-date equipment and appliances as can be procured anywhere.  All this is necessary and essential.</P>
    <P>The other factor, the cost of labour, we are not going to quarrel about. Whatever is paid to the manufacturers the poor fellows who do the work are rarely overpaid.  We can be certain that that angle will be looked after. There is one aspect of this report which I did not hear the Minister discuss and on which I am anxious to have his viewpoint.  There is inherent in the report the idea that if you have a certain selective development you can get a certain return on capital. That is within the scope of what the board regard as a feasible plan or scheme, that by developing more densely populated areas and leaving those at the back of the hill, where the cost of installation would be high, you will get a better return on capital. If there is one thing that must be avoided it is the idea that the man at the back of the hill is going to be left out of the scheme.  If there is going to be rural electrification do not give one more jolt to the man at the back of the hill who is thinking of clearing out, and allowing the furze and the briars to take possession of the farm. If we are going to electrify rural Ireland greater encouragement must be given to that man to stay where he is. He will not do so if he is placed at a disadvantage compared with his neighbour who is nearer a town and enjoying its amenities.  I urge that that aspect should be kept in mind.  It will cost more, but I hope we will agree not to subscribe to the point of view that it must not be done because it would cost more.</P>
    <P>The Erne is to be the first effort.  We had in this House recently a great deal of discussion on drainage.  I wish to <Col N="1540" /> get from the Minister some information as to the effect of the drainage position in that area on this plan of electrification; whether drainage or electrification is going to take precedence in the management of the waters of the Erne and what is going to be the effect of one upon the other.  It is a big problem.  It is one I do not wish to discuss because I do not know what discussions were essential to the making of the plans which the Minister has somewhat vaguely put before us for development at Ballyshannon and the falls at Assaroe, and how the two schemes are to operate.  The problem of drainage is one of considerable magnitude and is one in which a number of counties are concerned.</P>
    <P>Electrification schemes demand that certain people must abandon their homes when certain areas are flooded. This is an aspect of the question upon which I should like further information. The Minister told us that the total expenditure anticipated on the scheme was £17,500,000.  He indicated that it was on a ten-year plan, and indicated that miles of cable would have to be laid.  That is all to the good.  Perhaps one can say with a good deal of pleasure that probably this is the first time that the Minister has had a real chance of making his dream come true, because he did talk a number of years ago about bringing the exiles home. If he is going to construct these 7,000 miles of cables every year over the next ten years he is going to employ a great many people who probably are hardly available at present.  The Minister has the nucleus in the Electricity Supply Board.  That is a great thing, but we may be certain that he can see the possibility of employment for thousands who had to leave this country inside the last ten years.  It is a big scheme and opens up rather pleasant prospects.  If the Minister cannot base his plans on getting money at a cheaper rate than he has contemplated and on the figures the Electricity Supply Board has put into the report the whole matter may have to be reconsidered.  There is no reason why the Minister should not be much more optimistic.  There are ways and means by which the Minister can learn about the management of money, and <Col N="1541" /> there are people here who can tell him how it can be done just as well as it was done in an adjoining country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that everything I have to say in support of this Bill, which I do support, will in due course appear in the official records, and that if I say the least little word of criticism of any part of the Bill, the Minister will not use his influence to have that excluded from the official records.  There are two aspects of this Bill.  One of them is merely development of the existing scheme for supplying current, which is mainly of urban interest, and the other is a new departure which takes the form of supplying cheap electricity in rural areas.  With regard to the first part of the scheme I have only to say that I welcome the proposals to proceed as soon as may be with the harnessing of the River Erne, and the evidence which that seems to afford, that there will be in fact real co-operation between the people in this area and the people excluded from this area in the production and sale of current when available.  I hope that that policy will be continued and will produce most fruitful results.  I am delighted to see that the Minister is taking an interest in some of the more important factors that must determine the growth of our agricultural prosperity. I often regretted that the Minister, in his official capacity, was not more directly associated with our agricultural drive or that he did not interpret his very important official, economic functions in such a way as would make everybody realise the extremely close connection there is between industrial development and agricultural development.  If I might venture a word of criticism, I should say that the building of our national economy has both an agricultural and industrial aspect and that the agricultural aspect is the foundational aspect. Industry is more in the nature of a roof and, so far, the Minister has been too busy building our national household from the roof downwards to think of strengthening or improving the agricultural foundations.  I take this Bill as evidence that the Minister, at <Col N="1542" /> length, realises that we do want him to strengthen those agricultural foundations and go ahead with an economic policy which has got both an agricultural and industrial aspect.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, then, in his now character as a recruit to agricultural development.  I am reminded of a story of a Chicago pork butcher who made a fortune out of his rather gruesome trade&mdash;millions of pounds&mdash;and then said: &ldquo;We, here in Chicago, have not taken up culture yet but, when we do, we will make it hum&rdquo;.  Now that the Minister is taking up agriculture, I am sure agriculture will hum.  The more it hums under his benign influence the better pleased I shall be. I hate to change the mood, so to speak, but there is a little proverb in Latin which the Minister will, probably, recollect: &ldquo;<i>Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes</i>&rdquo;&mdash;I fear the Greeks even when they are bearing gifts.  When the Minister bears a gift to agricultural interests, I feel inclined to look for the snag.  In this case, I looked for it with the hope and expectation that I would not find it but, nevertheless, I looked for it.  It is, perhaps, rather ungracious on my part to look what is, apparently, a gift horse in the mouth, but one wants to be quite sure that there is no cloven hoof anywhere about.  The only way of making sure of that is to look the gift horse in the mouth, if I may be guilty of an Irish bull.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is evidence of willingness on the part of the Government to contemplate spending a considerable amount of capital on a project which has as its primary purpose the development of agricultural production and the improvement of the amenities of life in rural Ireland.  Both matters are extremely important&mdash;one in a social sense and the other in an economic sense.  From the material point of view, perhaps, the economic aspect is paramount. In one of my numerous capacities, I happen to be a member of the Agricultural Committee who are doing their best, at the moment, to produce a general report on agricultural policy which, when it does appear, will, I hope, command a great deal of sympathy amongst all Parties in the State. <Col N="1543" /> In that general consideration of our agricultural position, we have not yet reached any effort to estimate the total amount of capital that would be really needed in the course of the next 20 or 30 years if we are to put our agriculture on a really modern basis.  But we do know that it will require a considerable investment of fresh capital in Irish land, in the housing associated with Irish agriculture and in various other aspects of our agricultural economy. This Bill matured in a different place. All the credit for it belongs to some other bodies, including the Government, and no part of the credit can be claimed by the committee of which I happen to be a member.  I do not want to &ldquo;crab&rdquo; the Bill on that account.  I welcome the Bill as a really substantial contribution to something that ought to be done and that will have to be done sooner or later.  But I should like to discuss certain aspects of the measure.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an isolated contribution to the problem of agricultural development, which has many and complex aspects.  In other words, it is not part of a comprehensive and fully-considered plan.  If one were considering in what directions one could use capital and money, provided under guarantee by the State for the development of Irish agriculture, one would find that there were various directions in which such money might be usefully expended.  I speak entirely on my own responsibility, and am not to be taken as giving in any way the views of the committee on post-war agriculture, which has not considered this problem, when I say that certain priorities should be observed in the application of large sums of capital to the development of Irish agriculture, and that this business of rural electrification would not, by any means, come first in those priorities, although it would, by no means, come last.  If I were asked to state the priorities for the post-war period, I would say that one of the first things Irish land requires is the expenditure of capital in supplying much-needed lime and phosphate to our 10,000,000 or 11,000,000 acres.  The amount of capital that that would absorb, on the <Col N="1544" /> 1939 price for phosphate and lime, would easily run into £10,000,000 or £15,000,000.  That would be one of the highest priorities in capital expenditure on Irish land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I would put it fairly high, but I mention these in the order of their urgency as well as of their relative importance.  Another high priority, here and now, would be money for the provision of high-quality grass seeds for seeding down land which has been under cultivation for a number of years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to refer to these matters in passing. That would account for about £10,000,000.  Another high priority would be the provision of modern housing for animals in association with the tens of thousands of Irish farms. If you take it that practically every farm in the country could do with an expenditure of, at least, £100, housing for animals would absorb about £40,000,000.  Having done all that, you would be in a fair way towards spending about £50,000,000, before coming to the spending of money on rural electrification.  The fact that the Government is bringing in this Bill does not necessarily mean that they are proposing to do things in what I would regard as the wrong order.  It is merely taking legal power to do something, which is well worth doing, in the course of the next year or two. I mention the various priorities to show that a complex problem is involved, and that in contemplating the doing of this work, the Government should bear in mind the other ways in which agriculture will need the expenditure of capital.  When it comes to the actual spending of the money, a certain priority should be observed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Apparently, the cost of rural electrification is rather high.  That arises from the fact that country people live in isolated homesteads. In fact, you would think by the isolation of our farm houses that we were one of the most unsociable people in Europe, instead of being one of the most sociable.  That is a fact from which we cannot get away.  But there are certain aspects of country life which we could modify.  There are people living in the country districts besides farmers.  There are farm labourers to be considered.  Money is being provided by the State and by the local authorities for the housing of farm labourers, and the cottages are being erected at a distance one from the other.  With a view to electrifying labourers' cottages, as well as farm houses some day, there should be a policy of building those cottages in clusters near suitable cross-roads.  If this were done, it would be much cheaper to electrify those houses and provide them with modern amenities, such as water supplies and sanitation.</P>

      <P>I should like to hear the Minister say that this Bill, which I regard as a very constructive and desirable one, is part of a full-employment policy for the immediate post-emergency period.  The other night the Minister delivered a speech which radio listeners were able to enjoy at their own firesides.  In the course of that speech, he developed a new concept of self-sufficiency, with which I found I had a remarkably high degree of sympathy.  I do not know whether &ldquo;self-sufficiency&rdquo; was the right name or not for the new policy but, called by any other name, it smells very sweet in my nostrils, and, if the Minister means by &ldquo;self-sufficiency&rdquo; a policy of full employment for the men and women of Eire, devoted to making the <Col N="1546" /> most of our national resources, agricultural and industrial, I, for one, shall be only too delighted to co-operate in every legitimate way in furthering such a policy.  Again, let me emphasise that that policy must be primarily based on agricultural development and on the realisation that industry is the inevitable result of increased agricultural production.  Also, I should like to point out that an ambitious policy of development, of which this Bill is an example, is bound, in the after-war period, to stimulate a considerable volume of imports from Britain, even though we do contemplate developing a certain amount of industrial activity in connection with manufacturing electrical equipment.  For one thing, we shall have to import thousands of miles of copper wire which we do not produce in this country, and, directly or indirectly, imports from Great Britain will be stimulated by this policy, and it is also bound to stimulate agricultural production and the export of agricultural produce from this country to Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir, but I wish he was.  Anyway, this Bill should be considered in all its aspects, including its effects on agricultural production and on imports from and exports to Great Britain.  There is also the consideration that the policy of full employment is gaining ground over there and that something is likely to be discussed in the future in connection with the policy of full employment in Great Britain and here.  I think there is ground for co-operation between that country and ours in the matter, and I hope that that will be taken into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak much on this Bill because I had not the same opportunity as my colleagues of studying it.  First of all, I should like to compliment the Minister on the amazing ability displayed in the handling of this matter.  From the discussion, however, it is evident that we have been assuming that costings <Col N="1547" /> must determine the price at which electricity will be sold ultimately.  I suggest that we should approach it from another angle, and that if the question of price were first considered it would be different.  We know that overhead charges will be a very important factor and that the price of current will be largely determined by the volume and costs.  I hope that the Minister will look at the matter in a very broad way and determine on flat rates over all the country.  I think that that would meet the point raised by Senator Baxter about the remotely situated cottage in the country.  I think that the advantages of this scheme should be enjoyed by every individual in the community; and to carry that out it would be necessary to institute flat rates for power and light, covering the whole country.  In that way, in my opinion, the scheme would have a greater chance of success.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I do not think we should worry too much about initial losses.  This scheme can so enhance the standard of comfort of our people and thus help to retain them on the land that even if we lost money on it for a year or two the money would still be well invested.  At this late hour I shall not take up the argument as to whether money should be available at 3 per cent., 4 per cent., or 5 per cent., but I hope that my remarks may be of some use in this discussion. Personally, I wish the scheme an immediate and big success.</P>

      <P>I should like to be able to follow the advice and example of Senator Douglas this evening in his speech and general attitude to the Bill now before us.  We are in the happy position in approaching this Bill that we got ample opportunity to prepare our minds for what it contains. In the first place, we were given, in good time, the very excellent report compiled by the Electricity Supply Board at the invitation of the Minister, and I think we should not let the occasion pass without paying some compliment to the people who carried out that investigation and thank them <Col N="1548" /> for the excellent way in which the report was presented.  One would wish that the report would get a very wide circulation and that, especially, the appendices to the report should be given as wide publicity as possible, so that they could receive as much study as possible throughout rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Minister has lived up to his reputation in regard to the manner in which he treats the House when he comes to it.  Friend and opponent alike are glad to see him come here.  Whenever he comes he has something very definite and constructive to put before us, and the manner in which he has presented this Bill, and the case he has made for it, have left us with very little to say in regard to it other than to welcome it and wish it well.  There are a few points, however, to which I should like to refer, and I shall be as brief as I possibly can in their regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place I should like to refer to a remark made by Senator Douglas, I think, with regard to the confidence which we should repose in the Electricity Supply Board.  I agree very largely with his remarks but I want to take this opportunity to draw attention to one defect which I find in the Electricity Supply Board, a defect which I hope will be remedied as soon as it is seriously brought to their notice.  As a citizen of this State I am entitled to use the Irish language.  If I should go into my grocer and he is not prepared to speak Irish to me, or if he proves discourteous, I can walk out to the other side of the street and find another grocer who will treat me as I should be treated.  On more than one occasion I have tried to do business with officials of the Electricity Supply Board, at their principal showrooms here in Dublin and at one of the principal offices, if not in the Gaeltacht, at least in the Breac-Ghaeltacht, only to be told that if I did not speak English I might go.  The Electricity Supply Board is in a very privileged position.  It is like the Transport Company, the Post Office, and various services of that kind.  I have no alternative; I must deal with them and, I think, as a citizen of this State, having the right guaranteed to me under <Col N="1549" /> the Constitution, that I am entitled in regard to these services to use the Irish language whenever I think fit.  I hope this matter will be brought to the notice of the Electricity Supply Board in a very serious way.  Indeed, I hope that at no very great distant date something may be done to overhaul the executive of the Electricity Supply Board and that something like national interests may be considered just as well as economic interests.</P>
    <P>Having said so much in regard to that matter, I now come to matters arising out of the Bill itself.  I should like to share the optimism of the Minister when he says that he hopes this scheme will be completed within a period of ten years.  It is essential that it should be completed within as short a time as possible, at least within ten years, but, as has been stressed by other speakers, it is very doubtful whether that can be done.  I wonder what preparations are being made by the Electricity Supply Board to provide the essential personnel to carry out this scheme at the rate suggested by the Minister?  I know that the Electricity Supply Board has an excellent scheme of apprenticeship.  With the exception of that operated by the motor traders, there is nothing like it in the country, but that scheme is a very limited one, and it is all the more limited when one considers the extent of the undertaking which is proposed and the urgency with which it should be carried through.  In the vocational schools all over the country there are thousands of boys getting a certain training in handicrafts, in manual work, iron work, etc.  I should like to have some information as to whether the board realises the necessity for making some approach to the vocational schools and of seeing to what extent they might draw on this reserve of boys to bring them into the apprenticeship course or to make use of them in this work at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>That brings me to a matter to which I think the Electricity Supply Board and the Minister should pay more attention, namely, the need for some education amongst rural communities as to the use that may be made of electricity.  I remember on one <Col N="1550" /> occasion referring at a meeting to the possible introduction of a scheme for rural electrification.  I remember after the lecture, as a lecture it was, many of the farmers who were present asked me in what way I thought electricity might be of use on a farm. Here in the report there are many indications as to the way in which it may be used, but there is not much use in setting them down there unless we proceed to prepare the people for their adoption.  The mere issuing of leaflets or propaganda in a general way, while it may be of some benefit, will not achieve very much.  It will be necessary in my opinion to provide special courses of instruction, both by agricultural instructors and rural science instructors in the vocational schools as to the benefits of electricity, as to the way in which it may be used and as to the actual handling of the appliances that may be installed on a farm.  Unless that is done, I am afraid that what we are hoping for from the scheme may be long deferred.</P>
    <P>Again, with regard to the question of appliances, there are a few matters to which I should like to draw attention. One of them is that there will be need for a great deal of supervision as to the type and quality of such electrical equipment as may come on the market, especially for use in rural areas.  When this scheme gets under way, there will be an enormous market for all kinds of electrical equipment suitable for the home and the farm.  A great deal will depend on the quality of that equipment as to whether this scheme will prove costly or otherwise. I expect there is something in the nature of a standard, or some bureau of standards, covering electric appliances.  I hope so; if there is, everything will be all right but, if not, I hope that the responsible authorities will see to it that the country is not flooded with all kinds of cheap stuff from abroad, with very serious results for the people who may be induced to invest in such appliances.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <Col N="1551" /> The following motion was on the Order Paper:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Seanad requests the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to take the necessary steps to provide that officers of local authorities, whose salaries are subject to cost-of-living bonus, shall receive a bonus equivalent to that being paid for the time being to civil servants.&mdash;(Senator Patrick J. O'Reilly.)</P>

      <P>I observe that according to the Dáil Order Paper for to-day the Minister for Local <Col N="1552" /> Government and Public Health is to move the First Stage of the Local Authorities (Cost of Living) (Amendment) Bill.  In these circumstances it does not appear necessary to move the motion relating to this subject which stands in my name on the Seanad Order Paper.  I therefore formally give notice that it is not my intention to move the motion.</P>
