      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2) to delete paragraph (g) and substitute instead the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(g)  such other person or persons as the Government may from time to time nominate.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 to Section 2 are really the same thing.  If amendment No. 1 were carried, amendment No. 2 would be consequential.  The plan of the section is that there shall be a committee of seven people and that two of these people shall be the secretaries receiving remuneration, that is, the member of the Oireachtas translation staff and the person appointed under paragraph (g).  While wanting to leave the Minister that particular plan, I suggested on the Second Stage, and I have put down the amendment to put that suggestion into operation, that he should not restrict himself under paragraph (g) to one person. I am more than ever convinced that I am right since I heard the Minister concluding on the Second Stage because apparently he contemplates that under (g) he will appoint a legal person with a knowledge of Irish.</P>

      <P>Then his committee, as the Bill stands, would be a committee of seven persons of whom six would be legal people and one a member of the Oireachtas Translation staff.  On that, it seems to me that it is quite wrong to assume that all you need for translation is a person with a knowledge of Irish and a knowledge of law.  You might get a person with no knowledge of law and with a very considerable knowledge of Irish, and with a knowledge of languages, how they develop and what you can do with them, because languages are like other things, you can only do a certain amount with them and you really want room on the committee for the kind of person who, though not a lawyer, may be an expert on this question of Irish terms.  I think, therefore, the Minister should not be restricted to one person under paragraph (g) and I am therefore suggesting in amendment No. 1 that he should have power to nominate such other person or persons as the Government may from time to time nominate.  Then he would have at least seven members on the committee but he might at any particular moment have eight or even nine.  I think the Minister would find, when he would be looking around for people, that that would be an advantage to him.  I think he is unduly restricted in the Bill as it stands.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 is consequential and simply provides that sub-section (6) shall be so altered that the Minister will have power to remunerate the person appointed under paragraph (g). I think that would be an improvement to the Bill and the Minister would be in the position that he could exercise the power from time to time as he pleases.  At certain moments he may find it expedient to appoint even three people under paragraph (g); at others, one person may do him, but I certainly think he ought to have power to appoint the kind of person, who, though not a lawyer, may be extremely useful on such a committee for such a particular piece of work.</P>

      <P>Might I ask if it is intended to submit to this committee the work done by the translation department here in Leinster House, or if it is intended to make available to the public&mdash;I think it should be done altogether independently of this committee&mdash;a vocabulary of the terms which have been used by the official translators in the last 20 years?  It would be a great advantage to students of Irish if that vocabulary were made available.  That is one thing; another point is the putting of the imprimatur, the seal of approval, upon certain of the terms.  I know the <Col N="5" /> Minister for Justice is not primarily responsible for such a publication. That matter was mentioned before, and it is very important; I do not know when we might have another opportunity of raising it, and I should like to know if it is intended to publish such a vocabulary.  A great deal of money is being spent on the publication of Irish books, and I think some of it could very easily be spared for this particular thing, which is much more valuable than a great deal of what we see coming into print.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure there will be a vocabulary published, but it would first have to go before the committee. If we were to publish all the terms agreed upon so far by the Oireachtas translation staff, it might happen in some cases that there would be differences when it came to the committee. Senator Hayes will admit that there might be confusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Once it is submitted to the committee and approved, then I take it that it will be published in the usual way for the general public.  I have not gone into the matter myself, but I am pretty sure that will be done. It will have to be authoritative.  That is what the Senator meant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  My difficulty is that the publication which the Minister contemplates is piecemeal publication &mdash;naturally so in the nature of things &mdash;over a number of years.  Unless I am greatly mistaken, this committee will work with remarkable slowness. The only way in which it could work rapidly would be by adopting what has already been done.  It would be well worth while to see what actually has been done, without necessarily giving them legal authority at all.  It seems to me that the vocabulary would be very useful.  Indeed, it goes far outside legal terms.  For instance, in the last six years, in translating Statutory Orders, particularly those made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the translation staff has done positively marvellous work in the way of finding terms for various things.  They are not all by any <Col N="6" /> means legal terms.  The Minister for Justice will remember the kind of Order which the Minister for Industry and Commerce publishes, giving long lists of commodities and so on.  All those terms should not be hidden, so to speak, in Statutory Orders, but should be available in the form of a vocabulary.  If the publication is going to be done piecemeal it will be very slow, and of very little use to anybody but lawyers.  I am thinking of the students rather than of the lawyers.</P>

      <P>It was of the lawyers I was thinking.  The other is a matter for somebody else, as Senator Hayes knows.  I will raise the matter and see what can be done about it, but I am concerned only with legal terms in this Bill.  I will have the matter raised in the right quarter.  I cannot say anything about it, because I do not know what will happen, but I expect it will be possible to get it done.</P>

      <P>There is one aspect of this question of publication which I should like the Minister to consider. In County Galway, a great deal of the court work is done in Irish and done very efficiently, as my colleague Senator O'Dea will confirm, but there seems to be a deliberate campaign to prevent the publication of those proceedings in the Irish language.  That is one form of publication which I think is essential.  We want terms. The terms will be provided.  But how is the public going to get at those terms?  Even the people of the Gaeltacht are debarred from becoming familiar with those terms owing to the action of certain local papers in consistently refusing to publish the reports of cases heard in the Irish language. I know it is rather a tall order to ask the Minister to see if he can compel the papers to give adequate publicity to cases conducted in Irish, but at the same time I think the matter ought to be mentioned in public, and if anything can be done by the Minister I hope it will be done as soon as may be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to what Senator O Buachalla has said in reference to this matter. <Col N="7" /> Constantly, in the west, cases are heard entirely in Irish.  They are published in English.  Our district justice made a protest against that, and the only change which was made is that at the end of the English report you will see the words: &ldquo;This case was conducted in Irish&rdquo;, or &ldquo;This case was conducted partly in Irish.&rdquo;  If there is a word of English spoken, you will see: &ldquo;This case was conducted partly in Irish.&rdquo;  It is a pity that there should not be force; we know how English was forced on this country, through the courts mostly, and through Parliament.  When cases are conducted in Irish, and are not published in that language, much of the good which would otherwise be achieved is lost.</P>

    <Title>Gárda Síochána Bill, 1945&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="8" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is intended to meet the need for more station sergeants and inspectors in the Gárda Síochána.  I am satisfied that we require at least 14 more station sergeants and 18 more inspectors.  Section 5 (2) of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, prescribes that the Gárda Síochána shall consist of such officers and men as the Government shall, from time to time, determine, not exceeding the total number of officers and men respectively specified in the Third Schedule to the Act.  In that schedule, the maximum strength of the rank of station sergeant is 44, and of the rank of inspector 60.  The actual strength of the two ranks has already reached that figure.  Therefore, we have to lift the statutory limit.</P>
      <P>All the existing 44 station sergeants are serving in the Dublin Metropolitan Division.  Three each are allocated to 14 stations&mdash;Kevin Street, Newmarket, Kilmainham, College, Lad Lane, Store Street, Fitzgibbon Street, Bridewell, Mountjoy, Donnybrook, Rathmines, Irishtown, Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock. There is one at Whitehall Station, which was established in 1935, and one is divisional clerk to Dublin Castle.  I am satisfied that Whitehall should have three station sergeants, and that four stations which have none should also have three each.  These stations are Sundrive Road, Kimmage &mdash;only opened recently &mdash; Clontarf, Terenure and Dalkey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the case for more inspectors, five of the 18 are wanted for the Dublin Metropolitan Division, two for headquarters and Depôt and 11 for country divisions.  The present E district of the Dublin Metropolitan Division extends about five miles from Ringsend to Inchicore.  Its present population is 142,000, representing an increase of 35,000 since 1936.  It is proposed to divide the district into two districts&mdash;one to include Sundrive Road, Crumlin and Terenure sub-districts, and the other Donnybrook, <Col N="9" /> Irishtown and Rathmines sub-districts. The establishment of the new district will, apart from other increases, mean an increase of three inspectors.  The B and C districts of the Dublin Metropolitan Division comprise the main central city and port areas and almost half the crime of the division is referable to them.  In each of these districts an extra inspector is badly needed for crime investigation, control of street offences and attendance at court.</P>
    <P>Of the two inspectors to be allocated to headquarters and the Depôt one is required for the Technical Bureau (Fingerprints and Criminal Registry) and the other to look after recruits who are now being taken on half yearly in batches of 100 approximately.</P>
    <P>Outside Dublin the Commissioner estimates that to meet urgent needs an immediate increase of 11 inspectors is necessary.  Two are required for Cork City and County and the remaining nine inspectors are to be allocated to divisions where relief is most urgently needed.  After these additions have been made the numbers will be: inspectors, 78 and station sergeants, 58.  The maximum figures provided for in the Bill are somewhat higher, namely, 90 and 70 respectively. That is in order to provide some margin for possible future requirements and to avoid having to ask for a further increase should it be required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is an excellent case for the appointments that the Minister mentions and for which he seeks authority in this Bill. I do not know very much about the country, but since the emergency and the establishment of the L.S.F.  I have got to know a good deal about police duties in the city.  Even in the country, without intimate knowledge, it has always struck me that there are not sufficient officers.  It strikes me that the superintendent in the country has a much more difficult job than the district inspector had in the old days. First and foremost, police duties have increased enormously in the 20 years since the change over from the British. The whole idea of a policeman has <Col N="10" /> actually changed.  He is becoming a clerk, a statistician, and a collector of information.  The whole modern tendency of Governments to increase their own scope has naturally increased the scope of the police. Hence I think there is need for more officers.</P>
      <P>So far as Dublin is concerned, the Minister mentioned the &ldquo;E&rdquo; district I have some knowledge of that district and you could only describe it as absurd.  It stretches from Inchicore to Ringsend.  It is really absurd, particularly when you remember the new houses which have been built and when you take into consideration the Sundrive Road area.  There can be no doubt that more station sergeants and inspectors are necessary in that area and also in the Drumcondra area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I put this to the Minister, since he is seeking power to appoint more inspectors or officers?  I think the great difficulty in the Guards since 1922 has not been so much to find a suitable type of Guard as a suitable type of officer.  Very great credit is due to those who have done the work, because they were asked to do the work in very difficult circumstances. Apart altogether from the difficulties arising from the Civil War in 1922, there were other difficulties as well. It is not very easy to do police duty in a country where you are told to go out and be friendly with the people and at the same time to do police duties.  It is difficult in any country, but it is particularly difficult in our circumstances.  I wonder whether the Minister has ever given any consideration to a scheme whereby a certain number, at any rate&mdash;I do not want to particularise at the moment as to the number I would say &mdash;but a certain percentage of the officers should be recruited from a class of cadets going in rather like the administrative class in the Civil Service; people going in, for example, with a university training, having certain educational qualifications to begin with, being interviewed with regard to general suitability, and having, of course, to undergo the usual physical tests.  For example, I see that there are police colleges in England now and possibly we will have to do something <Col N="11" /> of that kind ourselves and it may be found that such people, when given a training, would be successful.  I would not by any means stop the promotion of suitable people from the ranks, but I think an effort should be made to recruit into the Guards people with a better education than we expect from the ordinary Guard to see how that would work.  I am not clear in my recollection, but I think it was tried for a time already.  I suggest that it is something well worth considering.</P>
    <P>It is not quite relevant to this Bill, perhaps, but, particularly in a country town, it always strikes me that the superintendent of the Guards is asked to play a rôle which is impossible on the salary he gets.  He is a responsible officer; he has a certain status to keep up; he is the principal representative in many ways of the Government and of the State, and his pay is poor.  His job is getting much more difficult than any his predecessors had in former days in the old R.I.C.  A comparison is sometimes made between the R.I.C. and the Guards.  Certain things have been removed which were carried out by the R.I.C., but other things have come in which, on the whole, have made the work of the Gárda officer much more difficult than that of an R.I.C. officer, particularly in the period before 1913.</P>
    <P>I should like particularly to say that the Bill is one which is necessary, one which I approve of, and which I think we will all have to approve of, but I should like to ask if any consideration has been given to a scheme whereby a certain percentage of the officers would be recruited from cadets with a high educational standard and tested in other ways for suitability.  I think it would be a great improvement to the Guards generally and it would give an outlet to certain types of people who now, very often, are wasted so far as this country is concerned after receiving a very good education, indeed.  Since the Bill is intended to give an increase in the number of officers, perhaps the Minister will tell us what the system of promotion is and whether any consideration has been given to the cadet system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no comment at all to make on the Bill itself, because I think the Minister made a good case for it.  At any rate, we all agree that he has made a good case for it and that he will get it.  But I do not want to let this opportunity pass without making a request to the Minister, although I feel that, in making the request, I am pushing an open door.  I want to impress on the Minister the necessity for speeding up the spread of a competent knowledge of Irish among the Gárdaí throughout the country, from the newest recruit to the most senior of the officers.  That is a duty which is owed to the country, from every point of view.  I notice, however, in the Gaeltacht areas there is a danger that because Gárdaí and officers have Irish they may be penalised to some extent.  It happens on occasions that men, perhaps for health reasons or for family reasons of one kind or another, were anxious to transfer from the Gaeltacht to some other non-Gaeltacht area.  It is also true that men in other areas may be anxious to transfer to Gaeltacht areas. Because of the difficulty of getting men with a competent knowledge of Irish to fill these positions in the Gaeltacht men already in the Gaeltacht are left there for unduly long periods and are left there often against their own wishes, while, if they did not have a knowledge of Irish, they would be able to secure the transfer they desire.  The only solution of that problem, as I see it, is to insist that the whole Gárda force should be an Irish-speaking force so that such transfers as may be desirable in any part of the country may be secured without any difficulty or delay.  I want to impress on the Minister&mdash;I feel sure he fully realises the necessity of it&mdash; the need to see that that ideal is brought to fruition as early as possible.</P>

      <P>With regard to the cadet system, I think there will be no way out of having such a system in a few years' time.  One of the reasons why we have not one now is that there are not enough vacancies.  At the moment there is only an old vacancy. <Col N="13" /> In five or six years' time it is expected that a big number of the senior officers will be retiring&mdash;at least, that is what I am given to understand.  I have considered this matter carefully with the Commissioner and with the Government and it is my opinion that we shall have to have, in addition to men recruited from the existing force, some vacancies filled by cadets. Senator Hayes will realise that unless we have a sufficient number of vacancies we cannot have a cadet system.  If we have cadets there must be somewhere to put them; we just cannot keep them waiting for a number of years.</P>

A man with a good national school education must have his chance, and I think he is getting it under the competitive system.  It is really a qualifying examination now.  There is room for them.</P>
      <P>So far as the cadet system is concerned, we would have to guarantee posts, because we cannot have men marking time for an indefinite period. For the few vacancies that now occur we have suitable men in the force. That is what I have been told by the Commissioner.  He anticipates that many of the existing officers will be retiring in five or six years and we shall have to have those vacancies filled partly by cadets.  There are men of good education coming into the Gárda at the present time and among these men we are bound to get good material.  I will have the matter considered further, but what I have said is our view at the moment.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="14" /> With regard to the Irish language, when you consider the older men in the force, I do not think it would be quite fair to expect them to become Irish speakers.  I do not think Senator O Buachalla meant that. There is nothing more objectionable than trying to force the older men to start learning a language.</P>

      <P>For a good while past every recruit who entered the Gárda Síochána had to have a very good working knowledge of Irish.  About a year ago a special staff was recruited. It is not always the people with the best Irish who are the best drill instructors. We have a staff selected from different parts of the country, superintendents, sergeants and others who are training the recruits through the medium of the Irish language, in addition to the ordinary instructors. In that way we are making good headway, but the difficulty is that unless you have really good Irish speakers you cannot send them to the Gaeltacht. As some people say, it looks like victimising them, although they get extra pay for going there.  The aim is to have the whole force Irish-speaking, but that will take some time. I do not think anybody will suggest that we should try to compel people who are beyond the period when they could learn easily, to study Irish. Nobody should do that.</P>

      <P>This may seem rather irrelevant, but I happen to know cases such as Senator O Buachalla mentioned, of people left for a very long time in a remote station.  It looks like penalising them simply because they know Irish.  As well as that, it is very bad for the men themselves.  I cannot imagine anything worse for a policeman who is born and reared, say, in Connemara than to find himself planted in a remote district in Kerry and left there for eight years.  The results are dreadful.  If he were sent to Waterford City, or Tralee or Galway City it would be all right, but to shove him to a post six miles from a railway station is not a desirable course, particularly if he is left there for six or eight years.</P>

      <P>This amendment is intended to meet a point raised by Senator Duffy on the Committee Stage in regard to the maintaining of a list in institutions and exhibiting it in a conspicuous place.

      <P>This is intended to meet another point raised by Senator Duffy and supported by Senator Kingsmill Moore.  It will have the effect of giving the Minister a discretion, in certain circumstances, of extending the period within which a female nurse who retires for marriage will have to present her certificate of marriage.  If the Minister is satisfied, in any particular case, he can extend the period from three months to a maximum of six.  It is a compromise between the views of Senator Kingsmill Moore and those of Senator Duffy.  In so far as I have been able to ascertain the views of the classes of people concerned&mdash;and that ascertainment has been very limited&mdash; they were quite satisfied with three months.  They felt, as I felt, that there were potential dangers in having too long a period, within which the arrangements might break down.  However, it seems to be a wise thing to <Col N="17" /> make provision for the exceptional contingency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage perhaps I might be afforded an opportunity to remove certain misconceptions which appear to have arisen between the Parliamentary Secretary and myself on earlier stages of the Bill.  In the first place, I would like to withdraw a remark which I made and which I would not have made if either my hearing had been more acute or the Parliamentary Secretary had been in the habit of speaking loudly enough to be heard by Senators like myself.  I thought the Minister said that the services of chaplains were nominal in reference to the cure of mental disease.  On reading the report afterwards, it was quite clear that he was only referring to the question of chaplains who had no members of their flock in the institution and therefore their services were only nominal in the sense that they had nothing to look after. I am sure he agrees that the services of chaplains who have real patients to provide for are far from nominal.  I regret very much that I misunderstood what he said in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were other matters also which arose, which raised certain broad questions that I hesitate to discuss because I would hate to say anything that might in any way hurt anyone's feelings. Yet, there are certain matters which ought to be discussed in a spirit of friendliness and frankness as between the citizens of the same country, <Col N="21" /> and in the spirit of one of the most liberal, democratic constitutions existing anywhere in the world.  They concern the general relations that exist or that should exist between the State, as a secular organisation, and the Churches.  Those relations are admirably set out in the Constitution, and I think we should observe the spirit of the Constitution in all that concerns those relations.  I think everyone will agree that everything that has to do with the spiritual welfare of our citizens is rightly left to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Churches, but the welfare of the citizen has other aspects as well as his spiritual welfare.  We are all concerned with the mental and physical welfare of citizens as well as with their spiritual welfare, and while the Churches must have a monopoly of regard for the spiritual welfare of our citizens, in the other fields of civic welfare Church and State meet on common ground, so to speak, and both alike are concerned to promote in their separate ways the mental and physical welfare of citizens.  For example, in matters of education the Churches have an obvious and important part to play, and the State freely recognises that the co-operation of the Churches must be sought and recognised in providing for the mental development of the younger generation.  From that point of view I consider that if any matter arose in which it seemed possible that the Churches could make helpful contributions to the solution of a problem which was also the concern of the State, I, as a representative of the Oireachtas, and anyone else in a similar position, was perfectly in order in suggesting that the Churches should be disposed to consider the matter from the point of view of closer and more active co-operation with the activities of the secular authority.  As even the highest dignitaries of the Church are also citizens of the State and owe obedience to the secular authority, I thought that I was perfectly in order in making that suggestion.</P>
    <P>I seemed to notice that the Parliamentary Secretary on the Second Reading debate was not unsympathetic to that suggestion, but in the Third <Col N="22" /> Reading debate he rather tended to frighten me off discussing the matter at all.  Now, I do not want to make too big a fuss about it, but it seems to me that the Cathaoirleach is the person who should determine whether any remarks I make are in order or not, and that the Parliamentary Secretary was, perhaps, proceeding outside his function in warning me off the turf, so to speak, in making a certain suggestion.  The whole matter is rather delicate, perhaps, because I happen to be a democratically-elected representative of Trinity College, and it is common knowledge, although I had forgotten it at the moment, that my constituency is not, perhaps, <i>persona grata</i> in certain ecclesiastical quarters.  No one could deplore that fact more than I do.  And when I say that I deplore that fact, I speak as a representative of a university having literally thousands of Catholic students and graduates.  I am sure that in this matter I speak their mind, and I say on their behalf and on my own that from our point of view there is no atom of justification for the reasons which year after year are put forth as reasons why our college is not a desirable place for Catholic students to frequent.</P>

I think that the conception of citizenship and nationality which Thomas Davis advocated in his day is one which we would do well to remember now.  I <Col N="23" /> personally subscribe to every word of it, and in all our political actions and all our national activities I hope we will do our best to live up to the ideal of citizenship and nationality which Thomas Davis advocated 100 years ago, he being then a student or graduate of Trinity College.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that on this stage there is very little more to be said. We have discussed the Bill very thoroughly and I think that whatever our contribution has been it has improved the Bill.  I think I can make that claim, because practically all the amendments submitted to-day and adopted by this House were, on the admission of the Parliamentary Secretary, who is in charge of the Bill, <Col N="24" /> the result of our suggestion.  On the last occasion I complained with regard to one matter and promised, or threatened, if you like to have it that way, that I would introduce an amendment. I want to explain now why that amendment was not introduced. On looking over other legislation which was passed during the last four or five years I found that so far as the placing of contracts was concerned, there is no prohibition in respect of the members of any local authority to hold contracts with that authority. Therefore, there would be no point in introducing an amendment to this Bill having effect only in regard to the members of a joint board, whereas the same would not apply to members of local authorities generally.  I regret that the law has been so altered, but I cannot help it.  It is there, and I do not propose to discuss it further.</P>
      <P>With regard to the matter raised by Senator Johnston, it is regrettable that when we are dealing with a measure of this kind, which is purely of a machinery character, there should be imported into the discussion matters which are entirely foreign to it.  That kind of thing will do this House no good.  The contribution which this House ought to make, if it is to make any contribution at all, or if the Seanad is to be of any value under our Constitution, is a contribution which seeks to improve the legislation coming before the House, and personally I do not see very much point in discussing political speeches or in justifying a particular point of view on these Bills.  That can be done elsewhere.  It is not necessary that it should be done here and it is not necessarily done well when it is done here.  When I interrupted the Senator it was not for the purpose of denying him the right to defend the institution whose graduates elected him to this House.  My intention was simply to prevent, if I could, this House being led into a discussion which could have no effect but to damage the position of the House in relation to legislation.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion, the Parliamentary Secretary paid a tribute to the officials with <Col N="25" /> whose help this Bill was framed, and I think we ought not to let the Bill pass without expressing our gratitude to the Parliamentary Secretary himself. We must all have been struck, as was pointed out by Senator Duffy, by the way in which he met and accepted the suggestions offered to him.  He did not turn them down, but took the view that practically all the suggestions made were made for the express purpose of ensuring that the Bill would be as good a Bill as the House could make it.  That was what was in everybody's mind.  As Senator Duffy pointed out, most of the amendments accepted on Report Stage were put forward by various members of the House and accepted by him in the proper spirit.  It is a model for the proceedings of a House like ours.  I think we ought to congratulate ourselves upon it and regret that any false note should have been struck at the end.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to pursue the line of discussion pursued by Senator Johnston.  There is no matter in relation to the Bill which has been raised with which it is necessary to deal.  Naturally, I am not going to enter into a discussion as to the propriety of the attitude of the Catholic Church towards Trinity College. That is a matter that ought not to concern us here.  Neither ought we to enter into a discussion as to the attitude adopted by Trinity College on various issues in the past, recent or remote.  I have no doubt that if we did indulge in such a discussion, we would have a variety of conflicting views expressed here.  It certainly is not appropriate to this Bill and I doubt the appropriateness of such a discussion in any circumstances.</P>

      <P>I want to avail of the Final Stage of the Bill to thank the House for their helpful criticism and co-operation with me.  It is a very big measure, and I personally have been very closely associated with it and personally very much interested in the good effects which I hope will accrue <Col N="26" /> from its passage.  Both Houses have been very helpful, and the Bill has been substantially improved by the criticism and assistance I got from the members of this House.  It is encouraging to find that, when we bring before the Oireachtas a measure which ought not to be contentious, all sections of the House combine in an effort to make it a better measure.  It is the duty of and an obligation on the Minister in charge of a Bill to take advantage of any useful suggestions which may be made for the purpose of improving the legislation.  What we ought to be concerned about, and what I personally am concerned about in relation to public health and social reforms is, when passing legislation, to make it as perfect as possible.</P>
      <P>In relation to this measure, the Oireachtas, the Government and everybody associated with the measure, have very good reason to be proud of it.  I think we have done a good day's work, and I hope we shall all live to see the fruits of that work.  I have no doubt that it will bear fruit, and that it provides machinery by which we can reduce the magnitude of one of our great social problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am certain that we could not make very much headway with our measures for dealing with mental disease and the treatment of mental disease, particularly in the early stages, without the radical alteration of the law which the Oireachtas has now brought about. I hope that, when we begin to bring this measure into operation and require the co-operation of the local authorities and of the public, we will get&mdash;I have no doubt that we will&mdash; the co-operation of members of the Oireachtas and of this House particularly in getting the necessary understanding amongst the public to enable us to furnish ourselves with the money to make the Bill effective.  As we all agreed during the course of the discussion, we cannot make it fully effective without money, and money in liberal quantities, but we equally agree that money spent on such an object is well spent and that our efforts ought not to be curtailed by financial considerations.  I hope that spirit will be carried down through the <Col N="27" /> country, so that we will get the same intelligent and enlightened outlook from the members of local authorities as we have got from the members of the Oireachtas.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Arbitration Tribunal for" RHead="Agriculture&mdash;Motion (Resumed)">
    <Title>Arbitration Tribunal for Agriculture&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Seanad is of opinion that the Government should introduce as early as practicable legislative proposals for the establishment of an arbitration tribunal to which all labour disputes in the agricultural industry would be compulsorily referred for determination during the period in which the compulsory tillage regulations are in force.&mdash; (Senator Counihan).</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Adjournment was moved on the last occasion, I was endeavouring to deal with two aspects of this motion which was moved by Senator Counihan.  The first point I wanted to make was that if you accept this resolution you cannot restrict it within the narrow limits fixed by Senator Counihan.  His proposal is that arbitration machinery should apply to agriculture only, but even then he wants to restrict it to the conditions obtaining in agriculture during the operation of the compulsory tillage regulations.  I pointed out that was impossible.  Agriculture cannot, in this matter, be treated as an isolated question &mdash; away from every other economic activity of the country.  That, I think, was admitted very clearly by Senator Summerfield who, in order to give his imprimatur to the motion, took the opportunity of seconding it. The next point I drew attention to was that, in certain circumstances, one could see quite a good case for compulsory arbitration.  I pointed out that, in fact, in certain circumstances the workers are not opposed to arbitration. They have, in certain countries which I mentioned, agitated for compulsory arbitration, and the countries in which it has been most effective are those in which there have been strong <Col N="28" /> labour Governments for many years. The conception of compulsory arbitration that is in Senator Counihan's mind is not that which is known, let us say, in Australia or New Zealand. What is in his mind is a going back to those old ordinances of labour which were in operation in the 14th century when the British Government of the period appointed the local yeomen to be magistrates to determine maximum wages so that farm workers might not be permitted to make contracts, or to demand wages, in excess of those fixed by the magistrates.  That, I suggest, is what Senator Counihan is thinking of.  He even wants the Minister, as a last resort, to send out the Guards to arrest organisers, and in that way to go back to the 14th century principles. I do not think it would be wise to go back to the 14th century, even if you could, because there are other limitations, besides compulsory wage fixing, which could be imposed.</P>
      <P>As to the purpose of compulsory arbitration, I would like to quote the opinions of two people who are in a position to say what exactly is the purpose it is intended to serve, and the manner in which the purpose has been achieved.  The Prime Minister of Australia has said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was, and still is, the clear intention of the Government that the industrial court established under the Acts would assist rather than retard the efforts of the workers to improve their conditions of employment and raise wages.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So that in Australia, at any rate, the purpose of the industrial court, as established under the Compulsory Arbitration Act, is to improve the status of the workers and to raise their wages.  I do not think that Senator Counihan would subscribe too readily to that conception of an industrial court in relation to agriculture in this country.  In regard to New Zealand, the matter is discussed by Mr. Walter Nash, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance in New Zealand, in a book of his entitled <i>New Zealand:</i> a <i>Working Democracy</i>&rdquo;, which was published in mid-summer last year.  This is what he says on the subject of compulsory arbitration:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Since the legislative code issued <Col N="29" /> the workers with many benefits for which they would otherwise have had to fight strenuously, it was felt that the further amelioration of living conditions would best be attained by legislation rather than by direct action.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That shows clearly that the authors of the scheme desired to promote working-class conditions.  They were not primarily concerned with preventing strikes.  As a matter of fact, the industrial court, and compulsory arbitration, have not prevented strikes, as I will show in a moment.  Here is a remarkable thing, that when a Conservative Government was in office in New Zealand they abolished the industrial court and suspended the Compulsory Arbitration Act.  Senator Summerfield's friends and Senator Counihan's friends, or their counterparts in New Zealand, did not want compulsory arbitration.  They suspended the Act and abolished the court away back in 1930, and when a Labour Government took office in 1935 one of the first things they did was to restore the court, but not, as I have pointed out, for the purpose that Senator Counihan advocates here, but rather for the purpose of increasing wages.</P>
    <P>I often wonder whether those who advocate here, or elsewhere, the establishment of some form of compulsory arbitration ever address themselves to the question of how it is going to be worked in our conditions.  Looking at the New Zealand Act, I find that it provides three principles.  In the first place, it provides for the incorporation of employers' and workers' organisations and gives them legal personality; secondly, it provides for the establishment of district boards to which matters in dispute may be referred, in the first instance for conciliation proceedings; and, thirdly, it provides for the fixation of basic wages.  These points are entirely overlooked by the advocates of compulsory arbitration in this country.  Senator Counihan, for instance, talked on the last occasion about compulsory arbitration in agriculture as applied to agricultural workers.  One of the points he made was that there was no organisation amongst agricultural labourers.  The Minister for Agriculture made the <Col N="30" /> same point.  In that situation, who are to be the parties to the arbitration? Between what groups and what bodies is the arbitrator to intervene?  Does it mean that, if Senator Counihan employs 30 workmen, each workman can have a separate arbitration court for himself?  If not, then it clearly indicates that someone has to step in and organise the agricultural workers and farmers.  He has not said that he wants that.  He must contemplate organisation both on the part of the farmers and farm workers.  I know that Senator Counihan, if he is a member of a farmers' union, will not be easily disciplined and he may find that farm labourers will be as hard to discipline as he is himself.  If he wants compulsory arbitration, he must want compulsory organisation.  You cannot have arbitration unless you have groups to invoke the machinery of the court or tribunal, make a case before it and carry its decisions into effect. The other point I should like to stress in this connection is that, so far as arbitration in New Zealand is concerned, the court is not the first element in the machinery but the last. In both countries, machinery is provided for conciliation between the organised employers and organised workers and it is only when that breaks down that the court is availed of.</P>
    <P>One of the problems which will confront those attempting to implement the motion is that of giving legal personality to the employers' and workers' organisations.  As a matter of settled policy, trade unions and employers' unions have not got conferred upon them any legal personality. It may be a surprise to some people to learn that, if a member of a trade union or employers' organisation feels he has a grievance against the organisation, he has no legal redress.  He cannot go into court and enforce a claim against the organisation. I admit that there are certain remedies but, if a member claims a benefit from such a union and the union refuses to pay, there is no legal remedy.  That is distinctly forbidden by the statute which gives recognition to these organisations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> If a court or tribunal were established, there would be this further problem&mdash;it would have to act according to some set principle in determining the issues brought before it.  Let us assume, for instance, that a body of agricultural workers in County Dublin cited Senator Counihan or his organisation before the tribunal to get an increase in wages.  The first question the tribunal would have to decide would be on what principle the issue should be decided.  Senator Counihan would, I think, argue that it should be decided according to the ability of the employer to pay.  The workman might argue that he was not concerned with the employer's ability to pay but with the amount of money he needed in order to live.  Then, there are two conflicting arguments at the outset. The workman says: &ldquo;I am concerned only with the demands which my liabilities as a citizen make upon me. I must satisfy those demands and I claim from the court an award which will enable me to satisfy them.&rdquo; Senator Counihan may come along and say: &ldquo;We are not concerned with the workman's standard of living; we do not care what sort of house he has or what number of hours he works.  We are concerned only with the question: how much can the farmer pay?&rdquo; The court must have some principle to guide them.  If you take any ordinary common law case in the courts&mdash;a workmen's compensation case, for instance&mdash;the court acts on certain guiding principles.  The court knows the principles upon which the law was interpreted and applies them to the best of its judgment.  In this case, there is no parallel.</P>
    <P>I mentioned a moment ago some of the questions which would confront this tribunal.  There are many questions, apart from wages, which might very well become the subject of citation before an industrial court&mdash;the question of the housing conditions of the workers, for instance.  That, of itself, might be very important in some parts of rural Ireland.  Then there are the questions of the hours of work, and disputes in regard to priority of employment. An employer may want to dismiss two or three men.  He may say <Col N="32" /> that he will retain the fellows who suit him best and sack the others.  The organisation might say: &ldquo;We cannot allow an arbitrary decision of the kind; the men who came in last must be the first to go.&rdquo;  That could very well be the subject of dispute.  I do not know whether Senator Counihan contemplates such an issue coming before the court, and I do not know whether the employer is willing to abide by the decision of the court on that issue.  I am pressing that question on Senator Counihan, because he probably has the viewpoint of the farmer, who has had little experience of dealing with that kind of issue, rather than the viewpoint of the industrialist such as Senator Summerfield, who is accustomed to dealing with such issues.</P>
    <P>As to whether the establishment of the machinery contemplated in this motion would prevent strikes, I think that it is worth while looking at the experience elsewhere.  A number of people have discussed this subject over a period of years, and I think that the conviction of many of those in favour of compulsory arbitration is that it will not work.</P>
    <P>I took up, some weeks ago, when this motion was first put on the Order Paper, a very illuminating description of a situation which arose in Newcastle-on-Tyne. Do not overlook the fact that, so far as war-time England is concerned, there is not merely industrial arbitration and compulsion but there is what might be described as industrial conscription.  The Essential Work Order in Britain has in it most of the elements of industrial conscription and, in those circumstances, one would say: &ldquo;That ends strikes.&rdquo;  Here is a description from the <i>Sunday Dispatch</i> of 7th January last of a situation which arose in Newcastle-on-Tyne:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Bevin was faced with the danger of a major shipyard crisis at Newcastle-on-Tyne Police Court yesterday when 125 boilermakers of Vickers-Armstrongs' Walker naval yard, each fined £10 and 10/- cost, with the alternative of 31 days' imprisonment in default, instructed their solicitor to say they would not pay.  Mr. Gerald F. Rutledge, defending the men who had been found <Col N="33" /> guilty the day before of taking part in an unlawful strike, sentence being postponed pending the outcome of an 8 a.m. meeting yesterday of the 500 men concerned in a dispute that lasted 11 weeks, told the magistrates that the meeting had decided that the present position must continue. &lsquo;I am instructed,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to put forward nothing in mitigation of the facts.  What defendants have done has been in furtherance of the trade union principles.  They maintain that are acting within their union rights.  Whatever fines, penalties or costs are imposed will not be paid&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, that is the situation which confronted Mr. Bevin last January.  He had at his back all this machinery to compel the men to remain at their jobs, but they decided that they would not do so.  Not only did they go out and incur penalties for doing so, but they refused to pay the penalties and decided they would go to jail.  I think, much as you may deplore that situation, that you have got to face this fact, that the right to refuse to do something, the right to refuse to conform to regulations is, after all, the mainspring of human liberty.  I believe, and I think every reasonable person will agree, that once a man is deprived of the right to say &ldquo;I will not do so-and-so&rdquo; then you are depriving him of his liberty.</P>
    <P>Nor has compulsory arbitration in New Zealand prevented strikes.  Here is a further passage from a book which I have already quoted:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The arbitration system has by no means avoided all industrial strife. Many serious strikes have occurred in spite of the arbitration court, but there is little doubt that the machinery, as provided, has served a worth-while purpose in minimising industrial friction and in securing to large sections of organised labour&mdash; especially unions which lack the strength and resources to meet employers on equal terms&mdash;benefits which they would have otherwise been unable to secure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the case made for compulsory arbitration in New Zealand, that it has secured for workers in weak unions <Col N="34" /> benefits which they could not secure for themselves, but even the Compulsory Arbitration Act has not prevented strikes in New Zealand. Mr. Walter Nash in the passage from which I have quoted adds:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Certain large and powerful unions, on the other hand&mdash;for example, the waterside workers and miners&mdash;have preferred to remain outside the scope of the Arbitration Act, relying on their collective bargaining power.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, from that it is reasonable to deduce that in New Zealand the weak unions and the badly organised sections of industrial workers make use of the machinery provided under the Compulsory Arbitration Act in order to improve conditions while the strong unions say: &ldquo;We will not touch it; we will do our business ourselves and accept whatever the consequences may be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Last week an English weekly paper contained a number of reports of work stoppages in England despite the measures to which I have already referred.  Here are one or two quotations. The first relates to a district in the North-West of England, the name of which is not given, and says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;More than 16,000 workers had downed tools in protest against a return to day instead of piece rates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Some industrial employers will know what is the significance of that.  The men went on strike.  The next report says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Because Dundee busmen objected to the appointment of a conductress as a temporary inspector, the city's transport was tied up.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The next paragraph says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;After a War Office transport driver had been transferred from London to Oxford, and refused a subsistence allowance, 200 men at meat depôts went on strike last week.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore Senator Counihan will not derive much satisfaction from the evidence which is accumulating in Britain of the inadequacy of these punitive measures to prevent strikes and to compel men to work when they do <Col N="35" /> not want to work.  I could cite a number of other instances.  I have a number of cases here all taken out of one issue of a paper called the <i>News Review</i> of April 26th of this year but there is no need to give further quotations. It must be obvious to the Senator and to those who support him, that in fact compulsory arbitration is a complete failure except in so far as it can be used to raise the conditions of working-class people who are badly organised.  Once it is enforced, or sought to be enforced, for the purpose of imposing on workers a labour ordinance of the 14th century, it is a complete failure.</P>
    <P>One would imagine from the speeches of Senator Counihan and the Minister for Agriculture on the last occasion that everything is lovely in the agricultural world.  You have the Agricultural Wages Board endowed with an almost superhuman capacity for doing the right thing for everybody and we are told that that should put an end to all cause or danger of conflict in agriculture.  But the truth of the matter is that the much-lauded Agricultural Wages Board is defective in two respects.  In the first place the board is not representative of the workers whose conditions it attempts to regulate and secondly the board makes no effective effort to enforce its own determinations.  I can quote for the Senator a paragraph from a letter received from West Cork in the last week.  I should explain that this man was present in a district court in West Cork when a farm labourer was suing a farmer for money due to him.  This farmer who was sued was not his principal employer.  He was a man for whom the worker did spare-time work in order to augment his wages.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="36" />&ldquo;This man commences work at 9 a.m. and finishes at 7 p.m.  He is paid 10/- per week.  He is married and has three children.  He is fully aware of his legal rights but will not enforce them.  I am personally aware that several agricultural workers are receiving less than the legal rate.  They will not themselves report the matter nor permit anybody else to do so on their behalf. The idea is that if they report some farmer for failure to pay, they are afraid they will be given no work by any other farmer.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Senator that he should look up a return furnished in the Dáil recently covering that position over the last few years. The return will disclose that the number of inspections fell from 10,000 to 2,000, and the number of prosecutions to a couple of hundred.  As far as I can see no effective attempt whatever is made to enforce the regulations of the wages board.  In this case the man explained that the proceedings were brought to court, because the labourer referred to worked for an employer from 7 to 9 o'clock.  After he had finished his regular employment he went to work for another employer for these two hours.  The second employer died, owing him a balance of £15.  The action in the courts was against the representative of the second employer.  Curious to know how that could happen, and as the district justice thought the hours strange, it was explained that the worker, who was responsible for the maintenance of a wife and three children, had to augment his ordinary wages of 10/-.  Then we are asked why are there strikes; why not put every organiser into jail if he attempted to enter a farmyard or to get the workman out?  In the course of the discussion reference has been made to the wisdom or unwisdom of strikes.  I want to say that, as far as I am concerned, in the main strikes are <Col N="37" /> absolutely useless.  Many strikes have gone on for years for no particular purpose and without any particular plan.  I remember a strike that took place in a Dublin restaurant and that continued for three or four years.  The men on strike were wearing the buttons of a particular union, while colleagues of theirs wearing similar buttons were working inside, and taking delivery of coal and merchandise from other colleagues wearing the same buttons.  Of course that was sheer humbug.  Nobody will join more enthusiastically with Senator Counihan than I will in saying that that system is injurious not only to employers but to employees.</P>
      <P>There are other examples of that kind.  I know of a strike in Dun Laoghaire that has been going on for years and that, I believe, has gained international notoriety.  There is a story told that when an Irish ship was held up somewhere at sea by a German submarine one of the men who came on board to examine the papers, when he discovered that the ship came from Dublin, said to the captain: &ldquo;I see that you live near Dublin.  Is Downey's strike on yet?&rdquo; That was some years ago and the strike seems likely to go on.  One of the things that Senator Counihan is doing in propounding such a proposition as this, is that if you start to take men's liberty you will then get into a state of mind which will lead to chaos.  Take the general strike that occurred in Great Britain in 1926.  That was revolutionary.  The farmers' strike in 1923, to which Senator Counihan referred, was more or less leading to revolution, and had all the elements of a large-scale civil war, seeing that labourers' cottages were burned by farmers and farmers' hay sheds were burned by labourers.  When one starts to deal with a small item, where a half-dozen men strike for a couple of shillings a week, I suggest that if we interfere with them unjustly then we are preparing the way for strikers to hit back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the attempted strike or whatever it was that took place in County Dublin last year.  I made inquiries as to what led up to the <Col N="38" /> demand of the men for an extra 4/- weekly.  I think what happened was that the union concerned sought to have wages increased to £3 a week, as it was found that in some places men had 45/- and in others 55/-.  I was informed by a farmer that the suggestion that there should be a flat rate increase of 4/- came from farmers and not from the union.  One farmer told me that he did not mind whether he paid 10/- or 4/- additional if he could get men to do his work.  What happened was that one employer offered his men 10/- a day which they accepted, but they then drifted away gradually.  On making inquiries he discovered that some neighbouring farmers were paying their men £1 a day.  He said that he would be prepared to pay £1 if he could get his work done.  To talk of a demand for 4/- increase was a bagatelle from the farmer's point of view.  I suggest that Senator Counihan knows that, and that his neighbours know it.</P>
    <P>If one wants to have an impartial review of the condition of agricultural labourers I refer him to the report of the Commission on Vocational Organisation. The following paragraph seems to me to be relevant to this discussion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It had not been found possible to settle wages and conditions of agricultural labourers by the means generally followed in other industries, viz., collective bargaining between organisations of farmers and workmen.  In the absence of any effective organisation of farm labourers, they have been unable to enforce their decisions by strike action.  Hence, instead of improvement there was a steady decrease in wages from 1925 to 1934, in July of which year they reached the figure of 21/- per week.  It was generally admitted that agricultural workers were underpaid in comparison with industrial workers....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement is quoted from the Report of the Commission on Vocational Organisation, a report which was signed by the following representative gentlemen: Mr. Richard Wilson, Dr. Henry Kennedy, Rev. Father Coyne, Rev. Father Hayes, and by <Col N="39" /> two bishops.  I would ask Senator Counihan to address himself to that statement, having regard to the fact that his colleague, Mr. Wilson, a former member of this House, Dr. Henry Kennedy, secretary of the I.A.O.S., and Father Coyne, chairman of the I.A.O.S., are signatories to it.</P>
    <P>Another aspect that Senator Counihan referred to was the enormous loss entailed, the enormous waste and the amount of time and effort destroyed by strikes.  It is worth while looking at the figures to see what exactly is involved. As far as I can discover, the number of days lost in 1943 was 61,000 in all employments, none in agriculture. That 61,000 was the lowest figure for 13 years.  The next low figure was for 1941, 77,000 days.  The figure for 1942 was 115,000 days.  The figure seems to have reached the maximum for the last 20 years in 1930, when 3,170,000 days were lost.  But, at the time this motion is brought before the House, there is no evidence whatever that there is any great upheaval as far as industrial workers are concerned, least of all agricultural workers.  Let us measure the loss to the community of these 61,000 days.  If all the agricultural workers, industrial workers and commercial workers who have been on strike produced 10/- a day on an average, the loss would be, say, £30,000 in 1943.  In the same year, through sickness, the great bulk of which can be prevented, we lost 8,000,000 days which, at 10/- a day, represents £4,000,000, as against £30,000 lost through industrial disputes. Through unemployment, we lost 20,000,000 days which, calculated at the same rate, represents a loss to the community of £10,000,000.  There is not one word of complaint from Senator Counihan and those who support him about the loss to the community sustained through preventable illness and preventable unemployment, so there must be some other reason rather than the industrial one for the protest against the loss sustained through strikes.</P>
    <P>I think, whether we like it or not, we have got to face this issue, that if we pass the resolution it cannot be implemented.  You may set up your <Col N="40" /> industrial court and by doing so you may create a situation which will be regrettable, but you will not enforce compulsory labour by the establishment of your industrial court or any other tribunal emerging from this resolution.  I want to suggest that even if it were practicable to enforce the decisions of your industrial court, it would be wrong to attempt to do so. In looking at the debate which took place here on a somewhat different resolution, in 1940, I was impressed by the manner in which this argument was treated by the members of this House.  One of them, I am glad to say, is here this evening&mdash;Senator Magennis.  On the 24th April, 1940, Senator Magennis, referring to a remark made by Senator MacDermot, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A very slight study of the Encyclicals would assure Senator MacDermot that there are such things as inalienable rights of personality, and that the worker, just as much as the nobleman and the king, in virtue of his human personality, is invested with these rights, that no one can deprive him of them and that the society that does not allow of his exercising them is an immoral association badly in need of reorganisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas disclaimed any desire to prevent strikes.  Senator Hayes supported the motion, but also made it very clear that he would be no party to a motion that would have the effect of saying to a man: &ldquo;You cannot go on strike&rdquo;.  Other Senators made the same claim.</P>
    <P>There is one other authority to whom I should like to refer in this matter. I wish to quote from an article written by Archdeacon Kelleher, in <i>Studies</i>, in June, 1936:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It must be remembered that it was mainly through the activity of trade unions, using the weapon of the strike wherever it seemed called for and likely to prove serviceable, that workers have been able to advance from abject subjection to their present comparatively independent condition.  It is asking a great deal of them, therefore, to require that this weapon should be discarded <Col N="41" /> now while so many reasonable claims remain still unsatisfied.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think all the argument, all the reason, that can be applied to this subject suggests to the.  House that they ought not to pass this resolution. I regret that Senator Counihan is associated with it because I think that, in his own dealings, in his own relations with his workers and his labourers, he is about the last person who in practice would subscribe to what is implied in this resolution.  I can only conclude that the resolution is not his drafting, or else, that he misunderstands its implications, and I hope that he will consider it desirable not to submit it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is Senator Counihan's drafting and if anybody in this House understands motions, it is surely Senator Counihan.  He is the great drafter of motions.  I have never met anybody more fertile in producing motions than Senator Counihan and, whatever fault there may be in the motion, it is Senator Counihan's and he most emphatically does understand it.  Having said so much, I am in the position that I do not want to delay the House because, although I understand entirely the case that Senator Counihan wants to make, and I have great sympathy for it, I do not think the motion in its present form is one which the House ought to pass.  I therefore want to make a suggestion to the House with regard to the motion.  In the first place, Senator Duffy has, at some length, discussed the whole question of compulsory arbitration and it is, I think, a fair comment for Senator Duffy to say that Senator Summerfield jumped into this particular matter in order to clamp down compulsory arbitration upon all classes of workers.  That is not what Senator Counihan is asking for in this motion and, if any misunderstanding takes place, it is perhaps on the part of the industrialist who thinks that this is the thin edge of the wedge. Senator Counihan has a good justification for asking that, while the Compulsory Tillage Orders are in operation, some steps should be taken by the <Col N="42" /> State which forces the farmer to till to see that while he is tilling he will have labour under reasonable conditions. That is what Senator Counihan wants. It is very restricted.  It is not compulsory arbitration in general for all workers, and it is not compulsory arbitration at all times even for agricultural workers. The motion as it is framed applies only to the period during which compulsory tillage regulations are in force, and applies only to agricultural workers during that period.  For that there is certainly a very good case; whether you have compulsory arbitration or not, the man who is compelled to till his farm and who manifestly cannot till it with his own hands should have a scheme whereby he will be able to get labour under reasonable, established conditions.  That is a different thing entirely from general compulsory arbitration, of which, as Senator Duffy said, I have already put myself on record as not being in favour.  Neither, as a matter of fact, can I be quite clear as to what Senator Duffy is in favour of, but I do not want to start a debate on the matter.  He seems to argue that compulsory arbitration was asked for by certain classes of workers.  So far as I followed him, he said that compulsory arbitration benefited certain classes of persons, to wit, workers in weaker unions, but he does not appear to favour workers who are in weaker unions.  However, I will not interfere, in that particular quarrel.  That, perhaps, is a family matter, in which I ought not to interfere, but an advocate of labour and anti-totalitarianism who is in favour of the bigger unions as against the smaller ones, and who is opposed to compulsory arbitration lest perhaps it might favour those who are in weaker unions, will need, I think, to give some further explanations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree entirely that workers should have the right to strike.  For the benefit of Senator Summerfield this must be said&mdash;a great many workers at the present moment, in a highly tariffed State such as we have here, believe rightly or wrongly that the tariffs give immense profits to the employers and that the workers are not getting their share.  I have the <Col N="43" /> greatest possible sympathy with the workers in their endeavour to get their share of the money which is taken out of the pockets of the consumers, and which emphatically should not all go into the pockets of the employers. With regard to this matter of strikes, what Senator Counihan rightly objects to is the lightning strike, and I think nearly all the trade union officials, no matter what Party they belong to are also in sympathy with Senator Counihan. But, in 1940 a motion was moved by Senator Douglas, seconded by myself and agreed to by this House.  Perhaps I may be allowed to read the terms of the motion, but I will not read the terms of my own speech.  I will simply make a few comments on this motion, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Eireann would welcome the introduction by the Government of a Bill generally amending the law in relation to trade disputes, and in particular providing for the establishment of a permanent industrial court for the examination of industrial disputes and the promulgation of advisory judgments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fundamental idea was that, instead of what happens at present&mdash; where you have a prolonged strike, and then an inquiry, very often by a judge, and an award which is accepted by everybody&mdash;you should, before the strike takes place, have an investigation before a judicial officer, who would make an advisory judgment, so that the public would be in possession of a statement of the facts by an independent, impartial person. Then the right to lock-out on the part of the employers, or of strike on the part of the workers, would still be preserved.  But if a strike took place without that preliminary investigation, then the rights which are conferred by the various Trade Disputes Acts would not operate.  That, I think, was a fair proposition, and with that I am still in agreement.  That motion was passed in the House.  Nothing happened about it since.</P>
    <P>While I understand Senator Counihan's point of view, and while I <Col N="44" /> think it is urgent that agricultural operations should not be held up by lightning strikes during the emergency, because of the fact that everybody needs agricultural produce and because of the fact that there are Compulsory Tillage Orders, Lagree with the Minister for Agriculture that apart from the justice of the matter, it would not be practicable to enforce compulsory arbitration.  Anyhow, on general principles, I think I am not in favour of it, but I do think that steps should be taken by the proper Minister, perhaps two Ministers, if you like the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to have conferences with organised labour with a view to seeing whether strikes, especially in the agricultural industry, can be prevented during the emergency, and particularly with a view to seeing what can be done to prevent lightning strikes, which Senator Counihan is against, and which, I think, Senator Duffy, Senator Foran and everybody else, are also against.</P>
    <P>The suggestion I would make is that Senator Counihan should not press this motion, which in its present terms would not, I think, find favour with the House, and which the Minister for Agriculture has told us it would not be practicable to enforce, and that he should endeavour to achieve his object, with which I think we are all in agreement, by asking that conferences between representatives of employers and labour should now be called, with a view to preventing strikes and to seeing what concrete method can be arrived at to prevent, in particular, lightning strikes.  I think the time is ripe for that conference, and I think it would be fruitful.  While we have been neutral in the war, while we deprecate &mdash; nobody deprecates it more than the Labour Party &mdash; the use of weapons of war, while in international affairs we are in favour of agreement, conciliation and arbitration, it is extraordinary that in our domestic affairs we should persist in using the strike weapon and the lock-out to settle matters which surely could be settled by another method.  I agree entirely with Senator Duffy that strikes are generally useless.  I have seen a great <Col N="45" /> many of them, and I have seen them from the point of view of the worker and of the worker's household.  For example, we have had in Dublin several transport strikes which lasted quite a long time, and which in the end were settled by a tribunal&mdash;presided over by, I think, Judge Davitt on three separate occasions&mdash;which gave a particular award.  The award, when given, followed a number of weeks' loss on the part of the workers, and was of very little use to the workers because it took them a long time to recover their losses suffered during the strike.  One wonders why an award of that kind could not be made at the beginning rather than at the end of a trade dispute.</P>
    <P>What I suggest is that Senator Counihan should be satisfied with a debate on this motion; that he should abandon the principle of compulsory arbitration; even in the restricted way in which it appears in this motion; and that, especially in the light of the motion passed in 1940, the House should now ask the appropriate Ministers to consult with organised labour, with a view to finding out whether we can now arrive at a situation by agreement which would at least minimise trade disputes, and particularly to take special steps to do away with lightning strikes, which are very often unauthorised.  The lightning strike is bad in all forms of industry, but particularly bad in the agricultural industry. I have the greatest sympathy with Senator Counihan's point of view.  I am glad that it has been recognised by Senator Duffy&mdash;it is the merest truth&mdash;that Senator Counihan is by no means a person who wants to walk on the faces of the poor, or to prevent people from getting a fair return for their labour.  He is very far from that, either in theory or in practice. I would suggest that we should ask that steps be taken at once to have a conference between representatives of employers and labour with a view to hammering out a scheme&mdash; either the one that was in our motion in 1940 or another one &mdash; to prevent strikes, particularly lightning' strikes. If that suggestion were to go from this House to the Government, I think Senator Counihan's motion would have <Col N="46" /> done a good day's work.  In the meantime, I think we should not be committed, even temporarily, to the principle which Senator Counihan's motion does in fact contain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to detain the House very long on this motion.  In the first place I should like to say that I support very strongly the plea made by Senator Hayes to Senator Counihan to withdraw the motion.  I think the discussion to which it has given rise has served a very useful purpose, and the matter might very well be left at that.  With regard to the motion itself, when I read it first, I thought it quite direct and simple.  I thought I understood it. But then, when I began to think over it, it occurred to me that there must be something in it that I did not appreciate. I imagined that Senator Counihan must be quite familiar with the whole problem of stoppages and the evils of strikes, and that he must have considered, from time to time, whether or not there is any legislation or formula already in existence to provide for a better solution of industrial disputes than that solution with which we are all familiar, namely, the strike&mdash;a solution which we all abhor.  I think every Senator, no matter what affiliation he may have, agrees that the strike is a weapon to which resort should not be had if it is at all possible to avoid it.  While I agree with every Senator in expressing abhorrence of the strike, I also agree with Senator Hayes that we cannot reasonably adopt a motion which would declare against the principle of the strike; that we cannot adopt a motion which would seek to take away from the worker the right to strike whenever he thinks fit.  In certain undertakings there may be, on occasions, reasons why the right to strike should not be conceded.  But, in general, I subscribe to the principle that men have the right to strike, be they workers or employers, and that that right should be left with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I come to the motion itself. The thing that troubles me is this: whether Senator Counihan is aware of the Act of 1919, the Industrial Courts Act, which provides for the establishment <Col N="47" /> of an industrial court of arbitration or inquiry and, if the Senator is aware of that Act, what fault he has to find with it, because, if he seeks legislation for the provision of arbitration tribunals, I think he is pushing an open door.  The Industrial Courts Act, 1919, defines what a trade dispute is.  There is no difficulty in appreciating the definition, but the Act goes further and covers the question of agriculture itself; so that if anybody is uneasy as to whether the words &ldquo;trade dispute&rdquo; apply to agriculture or not, his mind will be set at rest by looking further down the Act.  The definition is covered in Section 8 and the question of agriculture is referred to in Section 11.  I wonder whether Senator Counihan has adverted to that Act.  Sections 1 and 2 are the most important ones, because these are sections which provide for the establishment of these industrial courts.  Not alone may these courts be established on the invitation of either of the parties if a strike is actually in progress, but it is expressly provided that if a dispute exists or is even apprehended, steps may be taken by the Minister to set up a court of inquiry.  The Act does not provide for the implementing of the findings of the court, and I think wisely so.</P>
    <P>I have not been able to grasp the meaning of the motion if Senator Counihan is aware of this Act.  If he is aware of it, and if he still thinks he has justification for framing the motion as it is, seeking the establishment of this kind of court, I think it would be well that he should address himself to the faults in this Act and suggest to us in what way it might be amended so as to make it more workable than it has been found in the past.  Clearly there must be some difficulty.  The Act itself, so far as I can see, granted the parties to a dispute are inspired with goodwill, is ideal, but it has been invoked so seldom that I feel there must be something wrong somewhere with it.  When we were discussing a few years ago the motion mentioned by Senator Hayes, I did mention that I thought the trade unions might assume certain new functions, might undertake certain work which they had <Col N="48" /> not been doing in the past.  One of the things I had in mind was that they might inquire into this particular Act and see whether, from their side, they could not suggest amendments that would cause it to be availed of more frequently than it has been in the past. Taking the motion then, by and large, I think it has absolutely no point, because, to my mind at least, what Senator Counihan is asking for is already there; in fact, as I said already, he is pushing an open door.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that Senator O Buachalla, in discussing the Act on the Statute Book, revealed that, while the Act is simple, it has not functioned at all, that it is a thing of absolutely no value.  I do not know what the Act purports to do but, from what he has read to us, it clearly gives the Minister power to convene a conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the impression I got, that, having debated it, there was no need to do any more.  In the beginning, of course, he gave us the idea that he favoured the suggestion of Senator Hayes.  There is something concrete and tangible in that.  The difference, of course, between what are termed industrial disputes and what are termed agricultural disputes is very considerable.  Your corn may be shaken in a night.  In a factory, you can leave the wheels there, if they are oiled, for a month and nothing goes wrong with them.  If you are farming, like Senator Counihan, Senator McEllin, or myself, or some other people, especially in these days when you are stretched to the utmost, <Col N="49" /> and when we are told that all over the world there is not half enough food for the people, when you have ploughed and sowed to the best of your ability and the ability of your horses or your machinery and the men you employ, there is a dread hanging over you about the harvest.  There is a saying among farmers that you can get the sowing done somehow, but the reaping is a different problem altogether.</P>
      <P>Senator Counihan is projecting his mind forward to the problem which will face him and other farmers when the harvest comes.  He is quite right to look ahead.  You cannot help doing that when you are engaged in agriculture. They had a spot of trouble in County Dublin last year.  A good deal has been said about the liberty of the worker and his right to strike.  I do not know whether, if Senator Counihan had revealed his own mind fully, there would be any evidence from him of his desire to restrict the liberty of the worker.</P>
      <P>I am quite certain there is no such desire on his part.  He does not want to take away from the worker the right to withdraw his labour if he does not want to work.  The truth is that any of us who happens to be engaged in farming never dreams of trying to keep a man working if he does not want to work.  If a man does not want to work it would be far better to let him go.  He will be only a nuisance about the place; he might destroy your crops or stock, and the further he is from the farmyard the greater peace of mind you have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the position of the farmers in their dealings with employees.  The farmers and their employees get on remarkably well, though occasionally there are difficulties.  These difficulties arise in a most peculiar way.  When they arise a peculiar outlook is revealed on the part of some of the people responsible for strikes.  I do not know the full history of what happened in County Dublin last year.  I have the feeling that it was not the liberty of the employee that was being restricted, but rather the liberty of the employer, and very definitely.  With conditions as they are in the world, with a harvest ready to be threshed and people in every land wanting food, <Col N="50" /> if there is a mentality in this country that will permit men to remain idle while food is going to waste because it is not harvested when it is ripe, or threshed when it is ready for threshing, it is little short of criminal.  In the conditions through which we are passing, in this very historic period in the world, I think the people who encourage that attitude of mind on the part of men engaged in agricultural pursuits are guilty of a very great wrong.</P>
    <P>I suggest that people with responsibilities ought to preach the doctrine that, whatever men may do on other occasions, another method must be sought, some other device must be discovered which will avoid wasted days or hours, and if there are differences, some machinery must be adopted to make it possible to settle disputes amicably.  I have the feeling that there are people who are not too anxious to have disputes settled amicably.  I wonder if the dispute which took place in County Dublin last year was not the kind of dispute that was cultivated partly for the purpose of creating a social upheaval.</P>
    <P>Senator Foran, who is a very wise and experienced campaigner, gave expression to rather strange views when he spoke here at a recent meeting. He is very canny indeed, but he expressed himself in a way that rather surprised me.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Let me say that I revel in a strike, and that I claim that because of the strikes in which I took part over a long period, the workers have been raised from comparative slavery to comparative freedom.  If it were not for the early strikes which Senator Baxter remembers, in the creameries, these workers would be leading the slavish existence to-day which they were forced to lead at that time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think strikes are not very desirable. It may be that at certain times they are a necessity, but if Senator Foran revelled in that particular strike in the creamery areas in 1923 and 1924 I do not think it is anything to boast about. It was a time when civil war had divided the country, had divided the national forces, when there were conditions <Col N="51" /> of confusion and chaos through the land.  It was in these circumstances the opportunity was availed of to put a red flag over the creameries in a considerable part of the dairying areas. That struck a blow at dairying in some districts from which it has never since recovered.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to some of the farmers who spilled milk.  The farmers who spilled the milk in Dublin or Wicklow or wherever it was were not the first to spill milk.  In the strike to which I have referred, the strike in which Senator Foran revelled, the milk of 40 or 60 cows was spilled in the manure pits by these people who put the red flags over the creameries, because at that time there were farmers who were not prepared to send their milk to creameries to be handled by the people who planted the red flag on the top of them and to be manufactured into butter, for which none of the farmers was paid, to be sent to those people who revelled in the strike.</P>
    <P>I do not think any advantage was derived by these workers, but it influenced the attitude of many dairy farmers to such an extent that men who had 60 cows then have only 20 to-day.  There was a loss of food and there are fears among Dublin farmers that they may have to face a similar set of conditions next harvest.  If the people want food, or if they are to send food to other countries that are in a worse position, then those who permit the loss of one ounce of grain or roots that can be saved are guilty of a very great crime.</P>
    <P>It is far better that we should be clear on fundamental issues.  I agree with the general point of view expressed by Senator Duffy.  You may take a horse to the water but you cannot make him drink.  I never knew a man who could.  You may bring an operative to a machine or a farm worker to a field, but if he is not prepared to work you might as well let him go about his business.  Along the lines of proper reasoning some method of solving these difficulties must be found.  Are the farmers the dreadful tyrannical employers they are sometimes represented to be?  Nothing of <Col N="52" /> the kind.  There are certain facts available for anyone who wants to study them, Senator Foran, Senator Duffy or anyone else.  There are facts covering a wide area in North Cork and Limerick which show that over a number of years the earnings of farmers and their sons were not equal to the payments they had to make agricultural workers.  These facts have been fully authenticated by a man trained in the task and they are available for anyone who wishes to study them.  The farmer's attitude to his workman has to be governed by his capacity to meet his liabilities.</P>
    <P>A couple of weeks ago we considered a motion put down by Senator Tunney and Senator Duffy.  It sought to raise the general level of farm prices so that agricultural workers could be better paid.  I think it will be necessary to force up prices so that the farmer will be paid a reasonable price for his produce. We have the outlook that there should be a division of forces between farmers and employees, one fighting the other by strike methods.  That is put forward as one solution.  On the other hand, you have the suggestion that people should be compelled to go to arbitration which they may not want and that they cannot withdraw their labour, from a particular industry without being penalised.  That is a situation to which I do not think this House should be asked to subscribe.</P>
    <P>There is a real problem there.  It may be narrow, inasmuch as it was last year confined to an area close to Dublin where the farmers were making a terrific effort and where they put in everything they had in order to produce crops, not to feed themselves. because they had more than ample. but to feed others, the women and children of those people who would not help to save the crops, and their fellows engaged in the industrial sphere.  We should face up to that aspect of our national problem.  I do not know whether there is reluctance on the part of the Minister to face the problem or whether the Act referred to by Senator O Buachalla is in itself sufficiently comprehensive, but there is a weakness somewhere.  There is a general inclination to shirk the issues, <Col N="53" /> in the hope that we may muddle along and find a solution somehow.  I do not think that is good enough, but that we should act courageously, with a definite resolve to settle the difficulty.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Counihan has been somewhat misrepresented in regard to this whole question.  We ought to be able to sympathise with him and his fellows in County Dublin.  They are not free men.  On the one hand, they have the Department, the courts and all the penalties of the law; and, on the other hand, they have to deal with employees who would be all right if there were not some of these conspirators outside.  I do not know how exactly they are to be dealt with.  It would be much better if right reason on the part of workers and employers could find a solution.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy cited a case which was brought to his notice where an employer was paying 10/- a week to an employee&mdash;and feeding him, I presume, and working him from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., that employee having worked from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. with another man.  All I can say is they must be the two queerest people on the land in this country.  If any man came to me at 9 o'clock in the morning, having worked for two hours with another man, I would not have anything to do with him.  A great deal of the good would be gone out of him, as I know from experience, and if he worked until 7 in the evening I wonder how much he was worth?  There is something wrong somewhere.  The facts may have been put all right, but the probability is that they were both oddities.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes has made a concrete suggestion, which the House should implement in the general sense by agreeing to this idea.  Senator Counihan did not ask me about the drafting of this motion, but put it down without any consultation with us.  He consults himself, he has a line of reasoning of his own, but then he has a problem of his own, too.  It is not a Cavan problem or a West Cork problem.  He is doing his best to solve it in his own way; he is a very wise man and, strange as it may appear, he is prepared to take advice.  I am quite sure he would be prepared to withdraw his <Col N="54" /> motion, if there were general acceptance on the part of the House in regard to the terms put forward by Senator Hayes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCampbell" hpid="Mr. Campbell Mr. Campbell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Foran, I abhor strikes.  Having had experience of three of them, in three years in succession, for three months each, I never want another.  I would like to protest at the emphasis laid on the incidence of strikes.  I think this country has been particularly free from strikes during the past ten years.  If the workers are not to give up all their rights, surely the occasion must arise when they can emphasise their point only by the strike weapon?  I have been a member, up to last week, of the Trade Union Congress, of which I was an officer for ten years, and during all that period I never heard any union representative ask for compulsory arbitration. I have been an officer in a union for 25 years, but I never heard any member declaring in favour of compulsory arbitration.</P>
      <P>Personally, I would go to any length to prevent industrial conflict.  I believe it is only the law of the jungle. I say that because I have a particular point of view myself&mdash;and let no one dare misrepresent me outside when I put it.  I am absolutely opposed to what is called the policy of class warfare. I do not believe there is any place for class warfare in this country or any need to develop along those lines.  I believe every man has an inherent right to work or not to work, just as the employers have the right to say, if the day is fine, that they will not go to work but will play golf.  If we cannot give that right to the worker, he will suffer most.</P>
      <P>I believe Senator Counihan is altogether on the wrong lines and, like Senators Hayes and Baxter, I would ask him to withdraw his motion, as it will not serve any useful purpose Senator Duffy has dealt with the difficulty of deciding whom one should arbitrate between, as the agricultural workers are not organised and neither are the farmers, to any great extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past 25 years, as an officer of a trade union, I have done everything possible to prevent strikes and I know of only one, and that was <Col N="55" /> precipitated by the employers, by the lightning lock-out in the case of the newspaper strike of 1934, when the newspaper managers locked out the workers in the industry.  After 14 weeks' strike, they were compelled to pay the workers a fortnight's wages in lieu of notice.  These things will happen.  Probably I have to take some blame myself for precipitating that strike, as it developed out of a statement in the <i>Evening Herald</i>&mdash;a false statement&mdash;in regard to the I.T. &amp; G.W.U. and we took the hazard in ordering our men not to print that paragraph.  Notwithstanding that action, we were entitled to a fortnight's notice and insisted on it.  We got it after the 14 weeks' strike in the printing industry.  In the three consecutive years in which there were strikes, the employers were insured against strikes and were at no loss.  In one case there was a lock-out and in the other two cases we served the notices ourselves.</P>
    <P>I do not see any remedy for this problem at the moment and, therefore, we would be well advised to let the hare sit.  There may be some development along the lines suggested by some of the speakers here, in regard to the efforts to prevent strikes or make them very difficult.  I do not mean they should be made difficult in the way of restricting or restraining the rights of the people to strike if they wish to, but rather in the way of conciliation methods.  In our own industry, there are many boards and, in the case of a strike, there is first of all a conference with the employers and, if that fails, there is the Conciliation Board.  If even that fails, I think eight weeks' notice must be given to the Minister.  All these delaying actions prevent any precipitate action and put off development for three or four months.  I would favour development along those lines rather than compulsory arbitration.</P>
    <P>As Senator Duffy has pointed out, these things do not always work out the way they were intended to work out.  The post-war period is now two days' old and the position is particularly grave, so it is very necessary to <Col N="56" /> see that the situation is not aggravated and that the organised trade unions, which are compact bodies, are not used for purposes of social upheaval, to which Senator Baxter has referred.  I think that that would be a disastrous development if it were to occur in this country.  As one who does not speak much but who observes much, I say very deliberately that there are elements in this country, connected with those in Britain, who would not be backward in facilitating upheavals in this country in the future.  I know the contacts of certain people in this city, particularly, and in other cities, with certain subversive elements abroad.  I may be quite frank and say that they are Communist elements.  I do not want to parade the Communist bogey here but I know the organisation that is going on in Britain, with a link-up here, and an endeavour may be made to throw us into an upheaval of that kind.  The trade union movement with which I am connected now will take good care that they are not made walk up the garden and facilitate subversive policies in this country.  I ask Senator Counihan to withdraw his motion.  It would serve no useful purpose. The House having ventilated its point of view, no purpose would be served in putting the motion to a vote. I oppose the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hayes has given a definite turn to the motion and, after the remarks of Senator Campbell and others, I cannot force the motion to a division.  Senator Duffy made some statements which were not wholly correct.  He has the great gift of the Bearla but, to give him his due, he does not use it very vindictively.  He spoke about the County Dublin strike, to which Senator Baxter also referred.  Senator Duffy said that he could not understand why I should be so much in favour of compulsory arbitration since I never had a strike in my life.  That is so, but I want to remind Senator Duffy and the House that I am here as a representative of the farmers and agriculturists. From that point of view, I think it my duty to ventilate any grievance from <Col N="57" /> which the farmers suffer and to endeavour to have it rectified.</P>
      <P>I should like to say some things, but they might be controversial.  As they might not be very complimentary to Labour or suited to the suggestion Senator Hayes has made, I do not want to disturb the atmosphere, but I should like Senator Duffy and the Labour people to understand that there is no such difference as is suggested between agricultural and industrial workers.  Senator Duffy says that if this motion is passed, farmers and labourers must be compulsorily organised.  He referred to the agreement arrived at by the farmers in County Dublin.  I pointed out on a previous occasion who the farmers were and that the agreement was obtained by duress.  The organisers of the Workers' Union of Ireland sent out a circular to a number of farmers. Very few of them replied.  Some market gardeners and dairy men and a few men who had threshing machines did come to an agreement.  Senator Duffy suggested that, because they agreed to a certain rate, all the farmers of Ireland should agree to the same rate.  That is nonsense.  What section of labour does the Workers' Union represent?  Would it represent 1 per cent. of the agricultural workers? The Minister for Agriculture, who has a greater knowledge of labour statistics than I have, said that he did not think, that more than 2 per cent. of agricultural workers were members of any labour organisation.  It would be very difficult to get an organisation either of farmers or agricultural workers to fix a wage which would be binding on the whole industry and the whole Labour movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Labour Party to consider whether, if those union terms are enforced on the farmer by their agricultural workers, they will be better off.  The agricultural worker can come in, perhaps, an hour late on two or three days in the week.  If there is a wet day, he is set doing something which is not very necessary. I would ask Senator Duffy, who referred to one case, to quote three cases in County Dublin in which agricultural workers who presented themselves <Col N="58" /> for work each day did not draw their full wages at the end of the week, irrespective of what the weather was like.  Does that apply to any other industry?  I discussed the question of builders' labourers with Senator Foran on one occasion.  He told me that many of these men would not draw 30/- some weeks, although their standard wages might be about £3 15s. for a full week.  That state of affairs never occurred in agriculture.  The Labour leaders do not know that but Senator Duffy should know it.  Every farmer ploughs an acre of land for his worker, gives manure and, in many cases, seeds for that acre.  He has the potatoes lifted for his labourer, too.  All that is done free of charge.  The labourer gets other perquisites in most cases as well &mdash;free milk, a house at from 1/2 to 3/6 per week&mdash;an average of about 2/6&mdash; and, compared with the worker in the towns and cities, he is better off.  In fact, he is the best off worker in the country if everything is taken into consideration, because he has health and contentment, which they have not in the towns and cities.  Any labour organiser or anybody else who would disturb the good feeling between the farmer and his workers would be doing no good service.  He would be acting, as Senator Campbell said, with ulterior and Communistic motives.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's statement.  He said that he could not take compulsory measures to prevent agricultural workers from going on strike.  The motion did not ask him to prevent anybody from going on strike.  What I asked was that it should be made a penal offence for any labour organiser to induce agricultural workers to go on strike and break their contracts, which was done in the County Dublin.  Under the existing law, I believe that the organiser could be prosecuted for the action he took.  The Minister and the Government will let that slide but they will not let matters affecting the farmer slide.  In several cases, during this emergency, the farmer was prosecuted for not completing his quota of tillage.  Even though that farmer may have to do all the work with the assistance of his family, the Minister will prosecute him.  I know <Col N="59" /> one case of a farmer who was a few acres short of his quota.  He was prosecuted, fined £50 and sentenced to six months in jail.  If that is not a different law for the farmer and for labour, I do not know what it is. However, I do not want to get into a discussion of these matters now, in face of the suggestions made by Senator Campbell and Senator Duffy. Might I ask, Sir, if a motion has been proposed in this connection by Senator Hayes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following motion, which stands in the name of Senator Fearon and myself:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That this House views with concern the reports of malnutrition and starvation in many countries as a result of food shortage due to the war, and requests the Government to investigate the possibility of this State making some contribution in kind towards the alleviation of distress in Europe, if necessary by the rationing of commodities, of which quantities may be available in excess of our essential national requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion was handed in about three weeks ago, and since the Minister for Finance has indicated the Government's acceptance of the principle, and has stated that the Government has appointed a committee to investigate what can be done, if this House should pass this resolution, it will, in effect, be support for the Government's action as far as it goes.  The only thing that I wish to say, in relation to the Minister's <Col N="60" /> announcement in his Budget speech, is that I hope the committee will act speedily, as the sooner help in kind can be sent the more value it will be.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, however, rather appropriate that this motion should be taken to-day, when the nations that were victorious in this war are celebrating their victory, and when so many of the smaller nations are thanking God for their liberation.</P>
    <P>This country has been a non-belligerent in this terrible war.  There may be room for honest differences of opinion as to whether that was or was not wise, but I do not think there is any possible room for a difference of opinion on the undoubted fact that the overwhelming majority of the people desired to keep out of the war, unless we were attacked.  I heard an ex-Senator say at a meeting some time ago that neutrality was not something to boast about, but rather something to be profoundly thankful for.  That is largely my own point of view.</P>
    <P>As a non-belligerent State, we, of course, cannot have any part in victory celebrations, but we can and should express our joy and thankfulness at the end of the war in Europe, and our thankfulness to Almighty God for the extent to which our country has been preserved from the worst results of war.  We can, I think, also on this day join in the feelings of relief, joy and thanksgiving felt by so many of our people who have relatives and friends who are in the armed forces of the nations at war, or who, as civilians, have been abroad and have been bombed or otherwise suffered the horrors of war.  Apart from the Irishmen who left home as volunteers of their own free will to take part in the war in one way or another, our very close connections with the United States and with Great Britain mean that a very large number of our own people have known years of anxiety, and have lost their loved ones. Whatever our political opinions, I believe every Irish man and woman feels deep sympathy for the bereaved for whom the ending of the war in Europe means bitter memories and much personal sorrow.  As a nation we have had to suffer a number of hardships and privations, and these have <Col N="61" /> been felt mostly by the poorest sections of the community, but compared with the horrors which other people had to suffer, ours have been as nothing.</P>
    <P>I cannot think of any better way of expressing our sympathy with those who have suffered and our profound thankfulness that our own country has been preserved than by trying to do something to relieve the acute distress now existing in many parts of the world.</P>
    <P>I am particularly glad that since this motion appeared on the Order Paper the Government has accepted the principle, but I think that a discussion in this House, if it is reported in the Press, will help to gain support for the Government in this matter, which, I think, would be highly desirable. After all, if food is to be sent to Europe, it will be at the expense of our own people.  Any sacrifices made will have to be made by them.  It is, therefore, highly desirable that the people generally should be convinced of the rightness of our sending food, if it is possible to do so, even if it does mean some additional rationing or more strict rationing here.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, also most important that it should be realised that at the present time it is only contributions in kind that can be effective immediately. I do not want to belittle in any way money contributions which, I am perfectly certain, will be needed if the Red Cross and other relief organisations are to do the work which they have planned.  But just now, the plain fact is that in some places people are actually starving, and in many places there is widespread malnutrition, and in these places money by itself is practically useless.</P>
    <P>Now that the war is over, I do not think that the various countries in Europe&mdash;few of them, at any rate&mdash; will have any serious difficulty in raising loans for rehabilitation purposes. I saw it recently announced that the Dutch Government had obtained a loan of 100,000,000 dollars from the Chase National Bank at 1½ per cent. for three years&mdash;I think it was backed by gold&mdash;and that the Norwegian Government had obtained a <Col N="62" /> loan of 16,000,000 dollars from a group of New York banks at 2 per cent. for two years, and 2½ per cent. thereafter. I do not know how other countries stand, but I am convinced that the most urgent problem will be supplies, not money.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to take up much of the time of the House by giving figures or quoting reports to show the extent of the need.  It is, I expect, pretty well known to members of this House. As an illustration, however, I propose to read the following extract from a report on the position in Holland, which I have taken from Keesings Archives:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Reports from occupied Holland during December said that in the big towns communal kitchens were issuing about a pint of watery gruel to long queues of hungry people; that bread and meat rations, when available at all, had been cut drastically (in the case of meat to 75 grammes&mdash;under 3 ozs. a fortnight); that butter, sugar and fats had virtually disappeared; that private household stocks were almost exhausted; that men, women and children were going into the countryside in bitter weather searching-for potatoes, beans and other vegetables, frequently dying on the road from exhaustion and hunger; that in the rural areas themselves supplies of these vegetables were seriously affected in view of the German policy of inundation and deportation of farm workers; that with the exception of Rotterdam (where there was still a limited supply of electricity) both electricity and gas had disappeared from western Holland; and that the health of the people (of whom some 6,000,000 were still in occupied territory) was in consequence deteriorating rapidly, with a growing incidence of deaths and illness, particularly from diseases of malnutrition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In South Holland&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I again quote from Keesings Archives&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;daily rations dropped from 780 calories at the end of October to 460 <Col N="63" /> at the end of December and to 320 during March, i.e., just over one-tenth of the amount considered by experts of the League of Nations as necessary for normal human beings. Concurrently black-market prices in occupied Holland rose to astronomical heights; reports reaching the Dutch Government during March stated that people were paying the equivalent of £10 for a loaf of bread, £1 for a pint of milk, and 2/-. for a potato&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Since that report the position has become worse, and on April 26th a Dutch Archbishop sent a message to the Archbishop of Canterbury that only five days' food (at the minimum rations) remained for 3,500,000 people in Western Holland.  Since then food has been sent to Holland by Allied Governments and by some neutral states.  I read recently that Sweden had placed 4,000,000 Krone worth of food at the disposal of the Dutch Government, and that they had actually sent 13,500 tons of food by air. The Swiss Government also sent 5,000 tons of food, I think also by air.</P>
    <P>The position in Holland is appalling, but it is not by any means the only country in which there is serious malnutrition. A few days ago I was speaking to a co-religionist of my own who had recently been in France in connection with relief work there.  He stayed with a civilian family and told me that the three daily meals consisted of a piece of bread and boiled vegetables. He thought France was not as badly off as some other countries.</P>
    <P>That we ought to do something, if we can, every right-minded person will agree.  But is there anything effective that we can do?  Only the Government can answer that question.  It is easy to pass a resolution, it is easy to talk, but we must face the difficulties.  We cannot send food of which our supplies are short and which is essential to the poorer classes of our own people and which is the only kind they can afford.  To do so would be wrong and foolish, and it would only create conditions here that we wish to prevent elsewhere.  But the fact remains that many of us could do with less food than we are getting without any <Col N="64" /> danger of malnutrition.  I do not propose to deal further with this because Senator Fearon, who will be seconding the motion, is much better qualified to speak on this aspect of the question than I am.</P>
    <P>I have been told that tinned or frozen meat and dried milk would be the best articles of food we could send. I do not know whether or not it is practicable to send these foods.  I have been told that we could send tinned meat in substantial quantities, if we could get the tins.  I do not know exactly what we could send, as I have not got first-hand information, but I am sure that it is our duty to examine every aspect and to do what we can.  It may only be a drop in the bucket, but every little helps.</P>
    <P>I and, probably, most of you have read a great many of the reports of the position in various countries, but I can tell you that nothing I have read moved me as much as talking to people who had seen the actual conditions.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that it is our duty, first of all, as Christians, to make every effort to do something.  The late President Roosevelt said that he desired for his country the policy of the good neighbour.  When Our Lord was asked Who is my neighbour, He replied with the parable of the Good Samaritan.  The neighbour in that parable was one with whom the Jews had no dealings and he had fallen amongst thieves.  I do not wish to press the analogy too far, but the worst suffering seems to be amongst the smaller nations whose people have fallen amongst thieves.</P>
    <P>I feel that we in Ireland have a peculiar and special duty towards the people of the smaller nations.  Norway, Denmark, Holland and Belgium&mdash;to mention only some of them&mdash;were just as desirous of remaining non-belligerent as we were, and it was not the fault of their people that they were involved in the war.  Like us, they wished to remain neutral, and like the majority of our people they preferred democracy and had no sympathy with totalitarianism.  I hope and pray that the end of the war means the end of totalitarianism in Europe, but I am by <Col N="65" /> no means certain of it.  I think all the small nations should co-operate and make common cause in the future as far as possible.  Our first step in this direction should be a genuine effort to send food as proposed in this resolution.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest for a moment that our duty or our desire to help should be confined to any one nation or group of nations.  If we had plenty of food to spare, I would send it anywhere that it was urgently required, but I feel that even our best effort will be relatively small as compared with the total need. One thing that the war has taught, or should have taught, every nation is that isolationism is impracticable as a national policy for any State, small or large.  We could not have got through the last five years as well as we have done if we had not been able to continue international trade to the limited extent in which it has been possible.</P>
    <P>We are vitally interested in the maintenance of peace in the future.  We may have no say in the political plans for world co-operation which are being made, but, like every other nation, we will have to pay our share of the price if these plans are a failure.  I believe that the future peace of Europe depends just as much on the efforts which will be made to save peoples everywhere from malnutrition and to enable them to live decent lives as it does on any plans which may be made at San Francisco.  You cannot build up an ordered society if large sections of the people are undernourished.  Starvation or malnutrition is therefore our concern whether it be in the slums of Dublin, in Holland or in Germany, or anywhere else.</P>
    <P>The resolution does not refer to clothing which is an urgent problem in many places.  By next winter, I think, the shortage of clothing may be almost as serious as the shortage of food in some parts of Europe.  I am afraid that our own position is such that we cannot do very much in this direction. Even second-hand clothing would be appreciated in many places, and if individuals here are prepared, especially while we continue rationed, to give their surplus clothes to be sent to Europe, I think the Government <Col N="66" /> should make it easy for them to do so by giving them the necessary export permits.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to emphasise that this resolution means that we are asking our people to give up some of their own comforts to help other countries.  The sacrifices will be nothing like those we would have had to make if we had been in the war, but they will be sacrifices.  It does not require much imagination to realise what this country might have suffered if it had been invaded and occupied. I do not believe that war will ever be abolished until all nations realise their mutual dependence on each other and until people are willing to make sacrifices in time of peace with the same willingness that they make them in time of war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFearon" hpid="Professor Fearon Professor Fearon">
      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  For some time past, the sentiments embodied in this motion have, I think, been felt by a great many people in our country and have been expressed in various ways, and the type of question that one hears being asked is: Are we doing anything, are we contemplating doing anything, or what are we actually going to do? Since this motion was tabled, we have been told that the subject is now under consideration by an inter-Departmental committee.  I shall not endeavour, and do not feel called upon to try, to put any elaborate programme before the House for the simple reason that an inter-Departmental committee must inevitably have access to far more knowledge than any individual member of this or of the other House. What I should like to do is to make this the occasion of stating or emphasising a few principles that I think should underlie any action we take.  As I see the situation, it resolves itself into four questions&mdash;what needs to be done, what should we do, what can we do and how we should do it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What needs to be done?  Here we are at the first of our difficulties.  From time to time we have been receiving from abroad various reports of lamentable states of existence.  Unfortunately, truth is the first casualty in war, and starvation can be exploited <Col N="67" /> for the purposes of propaganda just as it can be exploited for the purposes of policy.  During the last year, the Dietetic Council of the Medical Association, of which I am a member, canvassed the representatives of the various Governments for information as to standards of nutrition in various countries.  Of course, some of these statements were not of much use and other statements were not very trustworthy, but the general impression one did get, even allowing for propaganda where it was present, was that there was a terribly bad distribution of food, and the misfortune associated with it throughout Europe. Since then most of us have been meeting people coming back from the Continent.  We have heard first-hand reports from them and we know without question that conditions are appalling in certain parts.  We have seen countries, in many respects resembling our own, which have been overrun and out of which food was either removed, destroyed or consumed. What is more serious, the live stock was removed in some instances and, what is still more serious, the very soil was poisoned by the inrush of sea water.  It will take a long time to restore anything like normal conditions in these countries. If we are going to face this problem, it is well that we should know the precise extent of the difficulties before us.  For that reason I should be grateful to know if there is any chance of an independent committee going from this country to the Continent and making a report so that we can have first-hand information from our own countrymen.  That will also enable us to get our minds somewhat clearer as to how far the information we are getting is really representative. If it is anything like it has been represented, the conditions are terrible. That is on the question of what needs to be done.  If my information is accurate, it will need to be done immediately and to be continued for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the second question&mdash;what should we do?  My answer to that is that I think you can send <Col N="68" /> calories and proteins.  At the risk of impersonating the public educator, I shall try to tell the House what calories and proteins are as I understand them. I do not think it is generally realised that it was the work of a distinguished citizen of Dublin, the late Henry Thompson, that put national nutrition on a calorie standard.  If you take a copy of that valuable work, the <i>Statistical Abstract</i>, which should be by everybody's bedside, you will find food exports expressed in tonnage.  About 35 years ago, Thompson estimated them, not in terms of tonnage but in terms of their food value or calories, their human fuel value.  That is a far more useful way of expressing them, just as gas is measured in therms instead of in volume.</P>
    <P>Thompson's work, the importance of which was widely recognised everywhere except in his own country, forms a basis of rationing.  You have a figure below which you cannot maintain life.  The ordinary adult consumes about 3,000 of these calories in a day.  The ordinary person sitting in a chair, a Senator for instance, is consuming about 200 calories an hour.  If he goes to sleep, as Senators have sometimes been known to do, he is consuming about 50 calories an hour. He has got to consume a certain daily amount to live.  In that respect, we are like the gas-producer type of cars we see going round our streets.  We get our food in different forms, as fuel. We have got to get that fuel to keep the engine going.  If the engine stops, we stop permanently because we have not got self starters.  The first problem of nutrition is, therefore, to be able to get at least a minimum number of calories.  In the various comprehensive nutrition schemes put before the world, the minimum number has been fixed as round about 2,000 per day but there are people who have got to get very much more, people who are engaged in laborious work.</P>
    <P>Now, as to the question of proteins, the nitrogenous constituents of our diet, represented by milk, eggs and meat foods.  There is no known substitute for proteins.  They are <Col N="69" /> absolutely necessary for life, particularly so for the expectant mother, and for the growing child.  It has been shown that a proper protein intake is part of our protection against disease. The fearful outbreak of influenza, which created such havoc at the end of the last war, was partly due to protein starvation as well as lack of vitamins.  Now, we cannot send vitamins. We have got only enough for ourselves and what we have to do is to see if we even have proteins in sufficient quantity.  Again, on the question of what can we do, we have the <i>Statistical Abstract.</i>  I am sure there is a great deal of information available in Government Departments and for that reason I am not going to elaborate a scheme, as all the information can be obtained in a very much more accessible form. There is a report from the League of Nations on the problem of nutrition, which was published in 1936. Every country in the world is mentioned in this report except, for some extraordinary reason, our own. How we could have been left out is a mystery to me, but I suppose what was nobody's business was not the League of Nations' business.  It is, however, possible to calculate what would be the likely surplus which we could spare for relief purposes.  Here it is important to emphasise that, whatever we do, will have to be done for a period of time.  It is not just a question of fitting out a picnic basket and sending it out with our best wishes to the peoples of Europe.  We shall have to arrange to send supplies for a definite, period of time, and if we are to do anything effectively, we shall have to say that we are supplying so much proteins and so many calories at a certain rate.</P>
    <P>We then come to the most crucial of all the points, what should we do? Here various problems arise.  Senator Douglas has, mentioned the possibility of sending tinned food, but where can we get the cans?  Many foods are extremely bulky, and if we send them, we send a great deal of water as well. Surveying the subject, it appears to me that the most likely food would be something of the type of dried milk, <Col N="70" /> which is a valuable source of protein, provides calories, and many other useful things.  It does not require to be packed in canisters.  It can be processed in various ways, is of good keeping quality and, in the process of dehydration, is thoroughly sterilised. Have we got enough material?</P>
    <P>The question of collecting and supplying I am not going to discuss in detail with the House, because there are others here who can speak more authoritatively.  I submit that we should collect at least on paper details of what we could obtain in this country.  If we have so much proteins and so much calories, and if we make these available, will they be collected? It appears to me that the question of distribution is going to be extremely important on account of the shortage of ships.</P>
    <P>Finally, how should we do this? That is more a matter of distribution, possibly, working with one of the great organisations, like the Red Cross or the C.I.A.C.  I feel that we are in a very strong position as an united people, an united nation.  At present the Government has access to sources of food material, some of the best in the world, and in connection with this proposal I am convinced that the Government has access to a very great source of goodwill.  For that reason I hope that this will be more than a purely Government scheme.  I feel that a Government scheme in this country is exposed to two dangers, the danger of irrelevant Party criticism and the danger of political delay.  I feel that if it were possible for a committee to be formed from both Houses, representative of all Parties, it would be much more generally welcome than a purely Government committee.</P>
    <P>This year, and almost this month, we are entering on the 100th anniversary of the period when we encountered unprepared the darkest period in our recorded history, the famine years, a period that at one time threatened irreparable damage to our nation.  If any nation knows what <Col N="71" /> starvation is, and what its consequences are, it is this nation.  I think we have learned our history lesson.  I respectfully suggest that we should learn a geography lesson also; learn that we are not an island outpost in the Atlantic, but part of the great family of nations.  Justice, our geographical position and commonsense should make us appreciate that our partnership is linked up with other nations, that we are linked up with their welfare.  Hence, I support this motion, and stress that what we believe should be done will have to be done quickly and continuously, not as a charitable gesture, but as a sustained, well-thought-out, considered action, a rededication of this country in united form to the service of mercy and justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the motion, and I am glad of the opportunity to be able to tell the House that the farmers were not waiting for a lead from the Government or from the Seanad before trying to do something on their own lines similar to what the motion suggests. I approached the Department of Agriculture more than 18 months ago on behalf of the farmers with a scheme to produce potatoes to relieve distress in Europe.  The proposal was that every Irish farmer should be requested to grow an extra rood per acre of his tillage quota, to be sent as a free gift to relieve distress in Europe.  Though not turning down the proposal, the Department accepted it very coldly and we got no encouragement to proceed with it. When the Department and the Government would not do anything, Deputy Dillon and I then approached the chairman of the Red Cross Society. He was very enthusiastic and formed a committee, mostly of farmers, of which four members of this House were members, Senators Quirke, Duffy, McGee and I were members.  That proposal was received very favourably by the bishops and clergy of all denominations.  Secretaries of Red Cross branches, all over the country took up the proposal but, in October, <Col N="72" /> when the time came to lift the potatoes, we could not get a permit from the Department of Agriculture to export potatoes; we could not get a ship to take them to France or to convey them to any part of Europe; we could not get a sack to pack the potatoes in and we could not get a navicert.  It was very saddening.  I thoroughly agree with Senator Douglas that unless the Government take up the proposal nothing of this kind could be done successfully. The question is: what can we send to relieve distress in Europe? Senator Douglas pointed out that money is not much use to starving people.  I suggest to the Government that, as we have factories working here for the last four or five years preparing cooked meat and producing the tinned meat that is sent to the armed forces, it could be sent to those countries which need it most.  Instead of sending money to buy food, either to the Red Cross Society or to other Governments, the money should be spent in this country to buy food which could be manufactured here and then sent wherever needed.</P>
      <P>There is another thing that the country can do.  We have a very large quantity of live stock for breeding purposes, a number of heifers suitable for dairying, and I think it would be a very useful gift to some of the countries in Europe which are denuded of live stock if they were purchased here and sent out to them.  We have a surplus of cattle in this country. During the last 12 months many animals of that sort have been slaughtered for beef.  We have several other articles of food which could be very usefully sent out but, as Senator Douglas pointed out, unless we have the co-operation of the Government, as we know from our experience in the potato scheme, nothing can be done. I hope the Government will take up the matter.  Many of us feel ashamed because of the small contribution we have made to relieve the distress which we are told exists all over Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to associate myself with the proposal in the motion.  In particular, I feel that <Col N="73" /> what has been said regarding the form which relief should take is of considerable importance.  The view sometimes prevails that, in giving assistance, yon discharge your duty if you write a cheque.  It is quite obvious that in all these cases money is of no importance whatever.  As a matter of fact, we will soon begin to notice that even at home it is not of much importance, at least, not nearly so important as food, clothing, fuel, houses and things of that kind.  But there are difficulties in regard to food, as I think the other speakers realise.  One of the difficulties is transport.  I have been reading a number of reports on conditions in different parts of Europe.  They all seem to concentrate on the fact that lack of transport is a tremendous handicap in distributing food from centres where it exists to centres where it is needed.  I do not know how we can deal with that matter, I do not see that we can contribute very much.  We have shipping.  Perhaps we can make more use of that service to take cargoes to ports which may be easily accessible and from which the food can be taken to suitable centres for easy internal distribution.</P>
      <P>I agree with the suggestion which, I think, was made by Senator Fearon or Senator Douglas, that some steps should be taken by the country to ascertain accurately what the conditions are in Europe, because I have been reading a good deal of literature regarding the conditions in certain countries which seem to emphasise that they and they alone are in a bad state.  I can understand, for instance, that Holland is in a worse condition than France, but I cannot understand that Holland is in a worse condition in the matter of food than, say, Belgium. I imagine it is not.  Yet, very little attention has been paid to Belgium, while a lot of information is available in regard to Holland. Perhaps the Dutch are better propagandists than some of the other countries.  I do not know, but this statement was published in an English newspaper of the 22nd April&mdash;the authority is a Dutch official:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There is not a single child living under one year of age.  There are <Col N="74" /> scarcely any live births.  The population of the industrial area is so weakened by lack of food that even those who have a slight cold are written off as hopelessly incurable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a description and, I have no doubt, an accurate description, of conditions in Holland, but I am just wondering whether conditions in other countries are not equally bad.  Another English paper, <i>The Observer</i>, in April, drawing attention to the countries in eastern and south-eastern Europe, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Famine threatens the countries of eastern and south-eastern Europe which were the larders of the Continent before the war.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another point they make is that farming operations have been suspended for the greater part of this spring, so that the need for food is not merely for now, but, there is going to be a need next year if the crops upon which the people depend for the early part of next year have not been sown.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House in regard to the matter, but there are two points I should like to mention.  I wish to refer to a statement appearing in an English trade paper regarding a proposal by an organisation, in England for sending commodities to France, Belgium and Holland.  Whether it applies only to that organisation or is intended to have general application, I do not know, but it contains a very extraordinary reservation.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The articles which are required are: Part-used clean clothing or shoes; old clean linen and towelling suitable for babies' use; babies' shawls or blankets made from knitted squares of wool; sewing cases containing needles and thread; knitting needles.  Nothing else may be sent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I assume that that concerns this particular organisation but it does not make that point clear.  In fact, it would convey the impression that nothing else should be sent to the Continent.  However, I take it that the Government committee dealing <Col N="75" /> with these matters were informed as to what is needed and what is not needed.</P>
    <P>The other point to which I wish to refer is a matter in which we can be of immediate assistance. It has been brought to my notice that a statement was published in a paper&mdash;<i>Peace News</i>&mdash;of the 13th April, 1945, by a well-known English woman writer regarding the condition of children brought to England from Holland as evacuees.  They were in a camp at a place called Cottingham, which I think is near Hull. The purpose of bringing them to the camp is to build them up for a period, but after an interval it becomes necessary to remove them from the camp to make room for fresh evacuees who have been taken from famine-stricken and disease-stricken districts. The children had to move out.  Efforts are being made in England to place these children in English homes rather than send them back to Holland but, as it happens, for some time, the children at Cottingham are Catholics and objection has been taken to the boarding-out of Catholic children in Protestant homes in the vicinity.  That situation will alter, I understand, in the near future, when children will be brought to Cottingham from Northern Holland, the majority of whom would be Protestant.  It has been suggested to me that one of the things we might do right away is to offer to accept these children as &ldquo;boardees&rdquo; in Ireland, in Catholic homes, when they are obliged to leave the camp at Cottingham, rather than that they should have to go back to Holland, to the conditions which we are discussing, in the motion.  I do not know whether there are any legal difficulties that cannot be overcome with regard to these children but, if there are no difficulties, or if there are merely such difficulties as can readily be overcome, I urge that we might at least make a start by arranging that our people here who are willing to do so would be encouraged to adopt Catholic children, as they are being discharged from the camp at Cottingham.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may add to what has already been said in favour of the <Col N="76" /> motion, I should like to stress the point that, to a certain extent, consideration of this matter is more difficult in this country because we know far less about conditions in Europe than any other country.  Perhaps two years ago I put down a motion in this House, which the Taoiseach felt called upon to come to discuss.  On that occasion, I said some of the things which have been said to-night. I visualised the possibilities of a picture of Europe just as it is to-day, a very dreadful and very awful picture, but unfortunately the censorship of this country has not permitted the facts to be made known to our people.  In that respect the Taoiseach and the Oireachtas have a very difficult problem to deal with in regard to this matter.  I have no doubt that if the people of the country, the common people, who do not believe in man or beast having less to eat than is necessary for sustenance, knew what the conditions of life are like for the people on the Continent, they would do everything in their power to enable us to make the greatest contribution that it is possible for us to make towards relief in Europe.  Quite frankly, I think the Taoiseach and the Government cannot absolve themselves from responsibility in this matter.  They should have been freer in their dealing with the censorship in regard to it.  I understand that not very long ago a letter to the Press, dealing with the facts of the food position on the Continent, was censored&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly&mdash;the very matter under discussion now.  I am trying to point out that there are certain difficulties in dealing with this problem because of the ignorance of <Col N="77" /> our people in relation to the magnitude of it and the inevitable consequences which must flow from it if all of us do not make an effort to find a solution. When I listened to the calm, cool way in which Senator Douglas made his case, and to the facts as presented by Senator Fearon, I felt that they have information, but how much of that information has got across to our people, and how much is going to get across to them?  When they read this, how many of them will ask: &ldquo;Is this just propaganda, or are the facts really like that at all?&rdquo; How many of them will ask: &ldquo;Can we afford to do this, or are we justified in taking this step?&rdquo; On the other hand, I have no doubt in the world that there would be immeasurable goodwill and co-operation from the people if they knew the facts of the situation.  The Government has a certain responsibility for not having permitted more enlightenment to the people.  It was obvious that this flood-tide would break, and that this problem would be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite clearly, we are limited with regard to the contribution we can make towards the relief of distress on the Continent.  It has to be remembered that what surplus food we had we have been exporting.  It has been going to Britain.  We know, too, that Britain herself, a food importing country, has not anything like an adequate supply of the proteins, calories and vitamins that are essential for anything like the equivalent of what she enjoyed pre-war.  But the problem is there, and there are many reasons why we must shoulder our responsibility.  There are the demands of Christian charity.  Perhaps our first consideration should be to make our contribution an act of thanks giving because we ourselves have been saved from all the dreadful things which the people on the Continent have suffered; in so far as we can make sacrifices now, we should be prepared to make them. In attempting to examine what we can do, it seems to me that the Government is confronted with certain difficulties. Senator Fearon spoke of the possibility of exporting dried milk.  I presume it is within his knowledge that we are, or have been, dehydrating <Col N="78" /> milk in this country over a number of years in some of our largest creameries, and have been sending quantities of dried milk out of the country.  There are possibilities of doing that to a greater extent.  But there are certain limitations on what can be done in this regard, inasmuch as the production of milk is falling and has been falling in this country over a period of years.  That is a fact which was within the knowledge of the Government. It is a matter to which we have addressed ourselves in this House time and time again.  The consequences of that continual fall in our milk production should have been borne in upon the Government.  We know that the dehydrating of milk and the sending out of the country of dried milk will have certain consequences internally&mdash; a fall in butter production, and so on. That is something we will have to face. We will have to make our choice.  I attempted to discuss in this House two years ago&mdash;the discussion was hot very favourably received if I may say so&mdash; this whole problem of our dairy stock. I can turn up the records and show what was said, and the attitude with which I was confronted on that occasion. I feel that the reorganisation of our dairying even to-day would enable us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>If I have to continue by way of question and answer, it will take me longer.  I am prepared to conduct the debate on that line if you, Sir, permit it.  The examination of what we can do requires realism on our part.  I do not believe in the House being asked to pass a motion that does not mean something, and which, if passed, cannot be translated into reality.  I was trying to point out that the suggestion made by Senator Fearon as to the export of dry milk, if approached in a particular way, might have considerable possibilities. I think Senator Counihan, with his knowledge of the conditions of the live-stock industry to-day, can tell the House the problem the farmer is confronted with in our fairs.  There are obviously numbers of cattle in this country that farmers would be very glad to get off their hands in all the fairs in the country.  There ought to be a way found by which people who want cattle which we do not want, which can be utilised for food in one way or another, would have the cattle or the food made available for them. <Col N="80" /> I have been in fairs recently, and I am sure Senator Counihan has been also. I was at a fair on Tuesday, and I could not see any business being done there. No matter what sort of stock you had there, it was not marketable.  I have been at all the fairs since the beginning of this year, and I have not seen more unsatisfactory fairs since the days of the economic war.  Farmers all over the country will tell you that we have stock which we do not want, which, in fact, at present we cannot carry on the area of grass we have got. Although they may not all be in as good a condition from the point of view of providing good food as we would like to have them, nevertheless they would be acceptable to millions of people on the Continent to-day. That in itself is an aspect of the situation which I think requires examination, and a great many of us would be very considerably relieved to know that we have stock that could be made available to people on the Continent, either alive or dead, which we do not want, and which apparently they do not want in England at present.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that, if this whole question is approached from the point of view, in the first place, of a definite resolve on our part that we must, that we can, and that we will, we can make a fair and reasonable contribution to relieve the plight of people on the Continent.  I think that there should not be any discrimination as between Italy, Poland, Belgium and Holland.  All these countries are really in a dreadful condition, and it is a matter for people connected with an international organisation to determine in what way the distribution of the surplus food which we can make available can be made to serve the most useful end.  We should declare now that it is the opinion of this House that this motion is one that should be accepted unanimously and should be implemented by the Government at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I think six Senators have already spoken, and I say most respectfully to them that they have said nothing pertinent to the motion.  There is no use in having <Col N="81" /> a motion put down on the Order Paper and then have the greater number of the speakers telling us about our humanitarian responsibilities. These are accepted.  Nobody can deny our national sympathy.  Our Christian civilisation has established that for centuries.  Not one of the Senators has made a real contribution to the debate.  Some of the speeches have been directed to attacking the Government because of the things they have not done and some speakers have told us that whatever is to be done must be done now, although they did not tell us how we are to meet the immediate demand.  We all agree that something ought to be done; but what can we do?  What is there to send?  I have been puzzling that out. I live in an agricultural area and I am a farmer myself.  I come from one of the greatest dairying counties in the country and I ask, what have we to send?</P>
      <P>Let us look at things as they are, not as visionaries and sympathisers. It was not right to attack the Government. They gave a contribution 12 months or two years ago to Italy of something like £100,000 which was at least an indication of the sympathy that inspired the Government and which was characteristic of the whole nation.  What can they send now to feed those who are starving and who are dying by the wayside while we are talking?  Have we potatoes?  No. Have we butter?  No.  Have we meat? No.  We have unfinished stores which, at this time of the year, after the winter, are not fit for anything until they get the summer grass.  I was at a fair on Monday at which you could not sell a beast.  Other people coming from Nenagh told me the same thing applied there.  That has been generally the case except for fat cattle which, as Senator Counihan knows well, are in the minority.  What can we do?  What can we send?  We have no butter.  The only thing we can fall back upon is dried milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter has correctly indicated the position with regard to milk. I come from the premier dairying county and, since 1938, there has been a gradual diminution of dairy stock in <Col N="82" /> that county.  We had a statistical return made out and I can give figures carefully compiled on instructions from the agricultural committee.  In Limerick, in 1939, as compared with 1938, there were 15,785,000 fewer gallons of milk taken to the creameries, and there were 13,000 fewer dairying cows in 1939 than in 1938.  From then until now there has been a gradual and dangerously convincing reduction in the dairying industry and in dairying cattle.  There is no butter and there is less milk.  The number of fat cattle we have at present is neligible, as Senator Counihan or anyone else who is in the fat cattle trade knows.  Let us be realistic.</P>
    <P>This motion suggests that a certain thing should be done expeditiously. Have any of the Senators who have spoken indicated to the Taoiseach how it can be done expeditiously?  How are we to do it by way of food?  What food have we?  Let us be honest.  I think the only thing that can be done is to send a cheque.  Surely there is some Red Cross Committee or some international committee or corporation set up by the Allies that will be able to handle the one contribution that we can make and make now&mdash;a contribution of money?  We cannot give a contribution in kind.</P>
    <P>I shall be glad if anybody here will indicate to me anything that we can send that will be an immediate relief to the starving people in Europe.  The Government have already contributed £100,000, for which they have been thanked by the people to whom they sent it and also by the Pope.  That is the only type of contribution we can make now.  I suggest that those who fathered, seconded and supported the motion would be better advised to indicate in what manner we can best help the starving people of Europe rather than stand up here to attack the Government for what they have not done for the agricultural industry.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Madden has been very realistic in his remarks on this motion. While I agree that every Senator and the Government and the people generally would be very sympathetic with the object of this motion and would <Col N="83" /> be prepared to make every effort to give practical effect to it, it is very difficult, as Senator Madden suggests, to indicate in any definite way what we can do.</P>
      <P>I think it is unfortunate that the political note should have entered into this discussion.  I do not think the Senator really intended to introduce politics&mdash;I say that in fairness to Senator Baxter.  It was his way of putting it and he really did not intend to introduce the political note.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Patrick O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I really do not think that Senator Baxter intended to introduce a political note.  I am giving that opinion for what it is worth.  Senator Baxter referred to a certain lack of knowledge and to the censorship.  Perhaps there is some little germ of truth in that, but, how far would it affect the position?  I suggest that any lack of knowledge that may exist is due more to our position on the map in relation to the countries in Europe which we are discussing than to any censorship.  Suppose we were faced with the position that one-half of the people of Poland were in a state of destitution through lack of food, clothing or shelter; that one-third of the population of Germany and one-fourth of the population of Belgium and Holland were in a similar position, what could we do about it?  With the exception of the cheque mentioned by Senator Madden, if we were to do anything useful we would have to send articles vital in a period of famine, such as food, clothing and medical supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What can we do in that respect?  It is to that we should apply ourselves. I am not an authority on these things; I am not in possession of statistics. Suppose we were in a position to transport and distribute goods in European countries that, in the opinion of the Government, need help, we would have to take out of the market in this country, from our own people, commodities that probably we need here.  If we proposed to export sugar, one thing that we manufacture <Col N="84" /> ourselves, everybody will agree that the sugar ration is pretty severe, but it is the best that can be done, and were it not for the fact that it is manufactured in this country it would be so much the worse for ourselves during the war.  If we put a limit to what we can do in the way of producing sugar, and if we make up our minds that we can afford further to ration our people during the post-war period, then we might have some sugar to send to Europe.</P>
    <P>If we feel we can export butter, then we could help with that commodity, too.  But can we afford to export butter?  Senator Madden, who has at his disposal the statistics of a great dairying county like Limerick, has indicated a falling-off in butter and milk production.  That is the position in what he describes as the premier dairying county in Ireland.  If we were to export butter we would have to ration our people more severely.  With regard to meat, there does seem to be a surplus that might be exported, but there, again, we are up against the difficulty of distribution.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Baxter when he says that cattle could not be sold in the fairs during the past day or two.  Senator Madden singled out the same period.  I happened to be at a fair in Mohill and I could observe a slight improvement.  Even to-day there was a slight improvement.  Senator Madden is quite correct in saying that there is no point in exporting cattle of the type he indicated&mdash;unfinished stores.</P>
    <P>After all, if you send skin and bone, when these animals get to a country, alive or dead, they would be a very doubtful commodity.  We cannot deny that there has not been much purchasing of cattle during the past few days, but the reason is that there were not adequate transport arrangements in the country for which they were intended. That was the position during the past few days, and I think in all fairness that should be indicated.  Once that position is remedied, I think normal conditions will again prevail with regard to the export of cattle and there will be a corresponding reaction at our fairs.</P>

      <P>I assure the House that I am quite in sympathy with the motion.  I believe every other Senator is in sympathy with it, and I am sure the members of the Government are in the same position.  But let us face the facts.  What can we do? I am not in a position to make any suggestion other than that if we are to deal with this matter properly, we must adopt a realistic attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Seán O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be able to offer some practical suggestions.  I must first of all express my disappointment at the negative attitude adopted by some Senators who have spoken to this motion.  I suggest there is at least one body that can help, and that is the profession to which I belong.  During the war years there has been developed, under the auspices of the Government, an extensive export trade in canned products.  This is the very period in which that trade is falling off.  The cattle that became uneconomic during the winter period have been disposed of to the canning industry. There are hundreds of thousands of uneconomic cattle in the country.  Some of them are uneconomic through disease, but that will not interfere with their usefulness in the canning industry.  Those animals could be utilised immediately, but there is one &ldquo;if&rdquo;&mdash;if we could get the cans.  I think the thing is feasible if the Government can provide the cans. In that way we can utilise all our uneconomic cattle.  Thin cattle are better for the canning industry than fat cattle.</P>
      <P>Deputy Counihan suggested exporting heifers.  Let us export the uneconomic cattle in the cans and replace them with the heifers, which would become economic.  The veterinary profession would be of immense help in going through the country picking out uneconomic cattle.  There is not much difficulty in doing that, and even many practical farmers could do it.  These cattle are being held over until they are worse than uneconomic, they are wasters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to impress anyone with the idea that we are putting <Col N="86" /> diseased stuff into cans.  We are not. It is healthy meat of cattle that have become uneconomic.  There is plenty of that there still, and all that is necessary to provide it for export at present is to get the cans, if we can. It is possible that the tin could be got from America or some country, and the meat exported to whatever portion of starving Europe we can most easily and most quickly transport it.  We are not rationed in meat.  We are rationed in butter and sugar, so there is no use in discussing those things.  There is that one product of which we have a surplus and, with an effort, it could be utilised.</P>
    <P>There is one point to which I would like to refer in Senator Douglas's remarks.  It was emphasised also by the seconder of the motion.  I do not suppose that anything against the Government was intended, but it was said that, &ldquo;since the motion appeared on the Order Paper, the principle had been accepted by the Government&rdquo;.  I may say, on behalf of the Government, that the principle was accepted years and years ago.  We, as Irish people, have contributed as far as we could at the time in India, Italy and elsewhere. I would just mention that point, as certain publicity may be given to the remark that, because this motion was put down, the Government has awakened to the fact that there are starving people in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

      <P>If this motion was put on the Order Paper to afford an opportunity to Senators to express our people's anxiety about the position in Europe, our concern for the people who are suffering there and our desire to assist in so far as we can, then naturally I welcome the motion; but if it is the intention of the mover to press it to a division I think I must take a different attitude, as there are in it implications which are untrue.</P>
      <P>The Senator who proposed it made it quite clear that he was aware that the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance, in speaking to the Dáil about a week ago, pointed out very clearly that this matter was under active consideration already by the Government.  In order that Senators, if they have not seen this statement already, may refresh their memories on it, I will read it:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="87" />&ldquo;<i>RELIEF OF DISTRESS ABROAD.</i></P>
    <P>Members of the Dáil will remember that during the last year we were happily able to give modest financial help to parts of the world where, owing to conditions created by the war, such assistance was urgently required.  This assistance was gratefully received and acknowledged.</P>
    <P>An Interdepartmental Committee has been for some weeks &mdash;that is, before a week ago&mdash; examining the question of the possibility of our aiding in the relief of the people on the Continent now in distress owing to the war. The Committee was asked to make a report to the Government on the help that could be made available by the people of this country, and how such foodstuffs and other materials as we might be able to provide could be conveyed to the countries most needing relief and how best they might be distributed.</P>
    <P>The problems involved are not easy of solution and there are many difficulties to be overcome before any of the food that might be made available here can be transported overseas.  When they have been overcome&mdash;and we hope that with good will they shall be&mdash;a full statement on the subject will be duly made to the Dáil.  I am certain that all Parties in the House and the whole community will earnestly desire that this country should give such assistance as may be practicable, not merely in money but in the form of food and other essential commodities, supplied even at the sacrifice of reducing our own consumption.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the position as it was a week ago.  I asked the Senator to postpone this motion, as I was perfectly certain that our discussion here would really be of no value.  I felt certain that there was no need of any propaganda to make it clear to our people what their duty in this regard was.  No propaganda whatever would be necessary. All that was necessary was to show our people how they could help and our people could be depended upon to help.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="88" /> As far back as 1943 we tried to send help in food to Greece and Belgium. We could not do it.  There was a war on, there was a blockade, large portions of the Continent were occupied, the representatives of the people could not function.  There was an army on the mainland and there were blockading forces at sea.  They were at war.  Under those warring conditions, it should be quite clear that it was only with the greatest good will on the part of all the belligerent forces that we could be of any assistance whatever.</P>
    <P>Transport was then a difficulty. Listening to Senator Counihan, one would think that it was the Irish Government which gave navicerts.  In order to transport goods of any kind, we had to get those navicerts, so that our ships might pass.  That was one of the problems: the problem of transport and the problem of getting the necessary facilities from the belligerents so long as the war was on. The position, thanks be to God, has now changed.  It is hoped that in the small countries, at any rate, Governments representing the communities in these countries will be re-established and will be able to function.  It is also hoped that once the war has ceased, inter-communication, which will enable organisations like the Red Cross to function in a way that it has not been possible for them to function up to the present, will help to make their task in that respect much easier.  Anybody must see that if you are not to have useless things being attempted, if you are not to have overlapping and the sending of food where it is not required, you must have some organisation to see that it will be rationed out properly so that it can be sent exactly where it is most urgently needed; that you will have to keep in contact with this organisation or else that you will have to have direct contact with the Governments of the countries concerned. I hope that that position will come about.</P>
    <P>Again, listening to Senator Counihan, one would think that it was our Government that kept the potatoes, that the farmers grew, down on the quays until they became practically useless.  Our farmers responded, and <Col N="89" /> if there was any hesitation on the part of any Government Department in sponsoring that effort, it was simply because they knew what the position was and a lot of other people did not know.  The result of action of that kind, taken when it had no practical results, meant that when the opportunity came in which you could act in a practical way the people would say: &ldquo;Oh, it is the same as before.  We will give the potatoes and they will be allowed to rot down on the quays.&rdquo;  In this matter, the Government must be depended upon to give the lead.</P>
    <P>We cannot do without the co-operation of the community as a whole, if it could be organised, and we are very glad, naturally, to have that co-operation. Personally, I should prefer that there should not be Governmental action in this matter and that the individual citizen should be given the satisfaction of himself, directly and immediately, making the sacrifice which will be necessary in some cases in order that food should go out, but the organisation of that would be almost an impossibility.  You could not organise it quickly enough.  Accordingly, we who have examined the problem, and the representatives of the different Departments who have examined it, are convinced that it must be by direct Government action that we will operate what we propose to do or try to do, if it is to be successful at all.</P>
    <P>Now, I think that the Dáil is the place to make the full statement that was promised to the Dáil.  It will mean action that has to be taken by our people, action which may result in some places in putting hardships upon them.  As I have said, if you could organise effectively so that each one would make the contribution that he himself or she herself was prepared to make, everything would be splendid, but we are quite satisfied that to meet the demands of a situation like the present, that method would not work. It is a different thing, however, when we have to take action which will force individual people to make sacrifices. Most of us, when we are making sacrifices, like to feel that it is done voluntarily, and at least the people should feel that it is through their representatives, <Col N="90" /> directly elected, they will make these sacrifices if the sacrifices are going to be made.  Besides, it may involve a considerable sum of money, and I think that the Seanad will agree that, in the first instance at any rate, proposals dealing with these matters ought to come directly before the Dáil. It was promised to the Dáil and it was for that reason, in addition to others that I requested the mover of the motion to postpone it until I, as representing the Government, would be in a position to give details to the Seanad, and the Seanad, accordingly, would be in a position to criticise these details.</P>
    <P>There is no question of the desire of the Government to help.  There is no question of the willingness of our people to help.  The only question is, are we talking around it, as a number of Senators have been talking around this matter, expressing our sentiments, but not indicating exactly how the work can be done?  I believe that Senator Madden expressed the general feeling&mdash;he certainly expressed my general feeling with regard to the debate&mdash;and hit the nail on the head when he said that it is not a question of the will but a question of the way. And the way is not easy, because it depends in part not on our will but on matters outside our control at the present time.  As I have said, I do hope the situation will improve, now that Governments of these communities are going to be in control, and that there will be greater opportunities for an international organisation such as the Red Cross to operate, so that where the need is greatest the help will be most readily given.</P>
    <P>With regard to financial help, some remarks were made here which seem to indicate that it is of no use.  That was not the opinion of the people to whom it was offered.  It was pointed out to them in advance that in view of our situation, and so on, we could not ourselves make food available. The most important types of food, and the type of food of which they were in greatest need were available elsewhere and where shipping was also available under the control of some of the great Powers.  That being so, they were very glad to have the means of purchasing that food elsewhere. <Col N="91" /> Credits were very important for them and they were very glad indeed to get them.  In any case, it was the only way in which we could be of practical assistance, and they agreed that it was of practical assistance.  We did not offer it until we had asked them, and we were assured that these gifts of money would be most welcome and most helpful.</P>
    <P>As I say, I would ask the proposer and seconder of the motion not to press this.  The seconder of the motion made it quite clear that he understood some of the difficulties, such as the want of knowledge.  That want of knowledge is not due to the censorship. That want of knowledge is due to the fact that even such international organisations probably, as the Red Cross, which had the means of getting around and getting information, did not have the accurate information which would enable them to know exactly where the need was greatest, and, of course, in matters of food the need changes very, very rapidly.  Two or three weeks without food in a particular area changes the situation very, very rapidly.  In the case of food, the only hope I can see in most of the cases of preventing absolute disaster is the fact that there are quick methods of transport now in the aeroplane. Were it not for the aeroplane, probably, the situation in parts of Holland would be desperate.  While, so far as food is concerned the aeroplane may not be able to take over large quantities to a particular area, it can bring limited quantities of food there quickly.  With regard to the type of food to be sent, also, there is the suggestion of tinned food.  The difficulty there is the tin.  We do not make it.  We have got it in the past under certain conditions.  These conditions meant that the food was available for another country, and that was a thing that also had to be borne in mind.  We must bear it in mind that if the food we normally send to Great Britain were sent elsewhere, it would be at the expense of Great Britain. They would be deprived of the food we send elsewhere, and I think that if we are going to make sacrifices of this sort, we ought to make them really at <Col N="92" /> our own expense, and the only way of doing that is by cutting down our own rations in certain respects.  With regard to that, the difficulty is to distribute the burden properly.</P>
    <P>For instance, I, and, I am sure, members of the Seanad, could do for a considerable period on less than we are consuming at present, but there are other sections of the community who could not.  If each one of us could make our own immediate voluntary contribution, it would be all right, but the trouble is that in these matters you cannot go around and get from each individual his own contribution.</P>
    <P>Systems based on coupons and so on have been suggested.  I have had them examined, and I have been told that they would not work, so that the position is not by any means easy.  In the past, it has been complicated by the difficulties of getting permission and so on and in the future it will be complicated by the difficulties of transport and of getting the precise type of food required from our people.  In view of the fact that since 1943&mdash;and on the occasions on which I spoke, when looking for financial aid, I indicated the same thing in one form or another&mdash;this matter has been actively before the Government and in view of the fact that this resolution, as it is here, would seem to suggest that it was necessary to bring the matter to the attention of the Government, the fact that it contains a false implication, I suggest to the mover and seconder that if they are satisfied, having brought the matter in this formal way before our people and having got the publicity they desire for their views, they should leave it at that, because there is no difference between the view which the Government takes of this matter and the views expressed here, the only point of difference being that the Government has to formulate a practical scheme, and that is difficult.</P>

      <P>This is a matter of personal explanation.  Before anyone else speaks, I want to draw attention to a statement made twice by the Taoiseach which is not correct.  He said that he asked me to postpone this motion.  Now, he did not.  If he sent a message, it did not reach me.  I am not questioning that he sent a message, but I want to make it very clear, because we are now dealing with public matters, that I was not so asked.  If it had been suggested to me that the Head of the Government, for particular reasons, wished it to be postponed, I certainly would have consulted Senator Fearon and I feel certain that we would have agreed to postpone it.  What I was told was that the Taoiseach was busy this week and would find it difficult to be here.  The answer I made to the Clerk of the Seanad was that I felt that, having regard to the statement made by the Minister for Finance, it was not necessary for the Taoiseach to attend, that I thought it better that the motion should be formally moved and that we should indicate our support.  The motion was put down over three weeks ago, but I think, as a matter of personal explanation, the House is entitled to know, first, that I was not personally asked, and, secondly, received no communication asking me to postpone this motion.</P>

      <P>That was brought to my notice and it was precisely because of that that I came along.  Otherwise, I would have said that it was rather unfair of the Seanad not to agree, in view of the statement made by the Minister for Finance.  I understood, however, as I have said, that Senator Douglas was not prepared to postpone the motion at all.  I came to the House because the position which would arise if it were postponed was one of the matters put to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has covered a good deal of the ground which I intended to travel.  We have to remember, in the first place, that we are a Christian country, very small in numbers, and very small in area, trying to help in relation to a problem affecting hundreds of millions of people.  Naturally, with our small population, our total contribution will be comparatively small, but, however small our contribution, it is our duty to contribute to the relief of these people to our utmost capacity.  Senator Baxter rather accused the Government of denying information to our people through the censorship, but there never was a censorship in this world which could prevent people thinking.  There is one thing our people can do&mdash;they can think, no matter what censorship exists, and it is not necessary to think very deeply to realise the devastation which has been caused in the world for five and a half years, and to realise how that devastation can affect the people of the world.  Our people have a fair idea of what conditions are on the Continent, even if what Senator Baxter alleges were true, and it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was about to suggest to the Taoiseach that, this being a Christian country and the Christian Churches here being as anxious as anybody to help the starving people of Europe, it might be possible to get their co-operation in calling on the people, as a gesture, to have meatless days, milkless days or tealess days in order that we could make the maximum contribution to the starving people of Europe.  Certainly we should make some sacrifice, having been spared the horrors of war during the past five and a half years.  It will not <Col N="95" /> amount to much in the aggregate, but if we are prepared, as we ought to be, and as I am sure we are, to make this sacrifice and allow a bulk contribution to go to these people, future generations of Irishmen can be proud of the people who were neutral in the world war and who came to the aid of the sufferers.</P>
    <P>That is a practical suggestion which will get co-operation and support.  As I say, our contribution will not be very great in the aggregate, but it will be a genuine and earnest gesture made as a sacrifice, one which will reflect credit on our people, while, at the same time, helping the starving people of Europe. If this is handled properly, our people will respond with the same spirit as that with which they responded in the past to calls to assist people more unfortunate than they.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Although my name is not associated with those of the Senators who have put this motion before the House, it is a subject which has occupied my attention for some little time, and in discussing it with my friends on each side of the gangway, I became convinced that it was a subject which did not need any recommendation or anything in the nature of oratory on my part to back it up.  I also have reason to know that it is a subject which has been engaging the close attention of the Government and of the staffs of the various Departments for some time.  Accordingly, I did not intend to assist in pushing a door which was opened and which every Senator present was already laying his weight against.  I was waiting for the various suggestions which I thought would probably be put forward as to attaining a practical result.  I cannot agree with Senator Madden that this has been a barren discussion.  Our attention has been directed to this matter from the scientific point of view by Senator Fearon.  Certain valuable suggestions have also been made by Senator Foran.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My object in speaking is to urge, in a slightly different way, the principle to which Senator Foran has given utterance.  I think it is important that any help we send should be help <Col N="96" /> which is not purely Governmental: that it should be marked with some spontaneous sacrifice by the ordinary person, and that it should be clear that the totality of whatever is made available, in whatever form it is made available, for European relief, has been contributed very largely by individual sacrifices.  Senator Foran has suggested a meatless day.  I want, rather diffidently, to put forward another suggestion which probably has already been examined, and that is that the Government should sponsor a scheme whereby it should be made possible for each one of us to give up a proportion of the food coupons which are allotted to us under the present system, and further, that we should introduce a rationing for such a commodity as meat in order that we might be able, again by giving up portions of the coupons allotted to us, to contribute to a central fund to be administered by the Government for the purposes of European relief.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, great difficulties in that.  First of all there is the difficulty of the non-active coupons.  When coupons are issued in respect of any rationed commodity a certain percentage are not used.  In estimating the amount to go around, I believe that the Government take into consideration the number of those non-active coupons.  The coupons to be surrendered would have to be active coupons.  I mean that these would have to be coupons of people who have been using them for the past six months to the extent, say, of 90 per cent.  These are the coupons that, I suggest, should be made available for the purpose I have in mind.  I believe that if everybody was urged, as an act of voluntary sacrifice and of individual thanksgiving to make available 25 per cent. of their butter coupons, of their sugar coupons and of their potential meat coupons, and that if all men of goodwill&mdash;the Churches, the Government, the Leaders of the Opposition&mdash;were to put their backs into advocating that scheme you would get an individual response which would enable a large stock of coupons to be built up.  Those coupons would have to be made available to the Government, and it would be the Government's <Col N="97" /> business to allot, out of the central supply of particular rationed goods, the proportion which represented the coupons voluntarily surrendered.</P>
    <P>I am not quite convinced that something along that particular line could not be done.  I believe you would get a lot of coupons and that you could off-set against them a good deal of food.  I believe that the personal and voluntary note in the scheme would have effects both on those who made the sacrifice and on those for whom the sacrifice was made, effects which would be quite out of proportion to the mere quantity of food which the scheme might produce.  I do not think it would take very much time to organise it.  There, again, I realise that I am speaking with very little knowledge from the technical point of view, although I feel that in all these things it is rather easy to raise difficulties. Still, if you make up your mind to do a thing it is extraordinary how difficulties do get out of the way. Although we must not let our heads be entirely governed by our hearts, I think that in this matter the heart might lead the head, provided it does not lead it too much by the nose.  As I say, I am not quite satisfied that something could not be done along those lines.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to consider whether he could not draw on that big reservoir of sacrifice and goodwill which I believe is his to tap at this time, and which, I think, he has the art of tapping.  Let us, I suggest, accumulate a stock in that way.</P>
    <P>The difficulty of transport has been mentioned.  I know it is very great but I do not believe for a moment that if we were in a position to say that, thanks to the sacrifices of our people, we had so many thousand tons of butter, so many tens of thousands of tons of meat, whether it be canned or ready to be put into refrigerating ships to send out, and that if we could say to the victorious nations: &ldquo;Here is our contribution in the way of food to those who are now starving and it is for you to provide the ships,&rdquo; I believe they would be provided.</P>

      <P>I will not take up the time of the House for more than two or three minutes, as I do not propose to reply fully to the points that were raised in the debate.  The Taoiseach has been good enough to withdraw completely the suggestion that I was acting other than in good faith in putting forward this motion, and to say that his statement was due to a misunderstanding which, I have no doubt, is correct.  I thought it was important to raise that question at once because it makes a very great difference as to the aspect of the whole matter.  I admit that I rather resented the suggestion that I, or any other Senator, would use a matter of this kind for the purpose of gaining some particular Party point.  To do so would be despicable, in my humble opinion.  It is not my usual practice, and I resented the implied suggestion. I was also surprised and disappointed with the way in which certain members of the House seemed to be on edge to try to make, or see, a political point in everything that was referred to.  I rarely go to the trouble of preparing detailed notes for any speeches that I make in the House, but on this occasion I did so, because I wanted to be particularly careful, first of all, that I would definitely say nothing that implied criticism; and, secondly, that I would not knowingly do anything which could raise a Party issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan referred to my statement that, since the motion was put on the Order Paper, the Government had, by means of a speech from the Minister for Finance, accepted its principle.  It never entered my head that this could be misunderstood. It was necessary to make the position clear, because, obviously, <Col N="99" /> to have put down this motion in its present form after that statement had been made, would have been absurd.  It was handed in at least a fortnight before the statement was made.  I made no claim that it had any influence in connection with that statement.  I put the motion down because it expressed the views of a large number of people outside.  It is my honest opinion that, in a democracy, it is the duty of public representatives to give voice here to what they hear urged by large numbers of people outside.  A Second Chamber is very often the most suitable place in which to express such views.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach suggests that there are implications in this motion which might appear to be critical of the Government. I cannot see any such implications and I am perfectly certain that no such implications were intended.  I realise that a motion drafted three weeks ago before it was known that the Government was investigating the matter would now be unsuitable and, for that reason, I think that the proper course is to ask leave to withdraw the motion.  But I do not think that, even if this motion had been moved, as it was intended to move it, some little time ago, any such implications as are suggested could have been read into it.</P>
    <P>There are one or two small points to which I should like to refer.  One is the statement by the Taoiseach, with which I completely agree, that this work could really only be done by a Government organisation.  I have given some personal thought to this matter. I think that what the Taoiseach says is absolutely correct so far as food is concerned.  I do not think that it is necessarily correct so far as clothes are concerned.  A point was made by Senator Duffy with reference to an organisation&mdash;I think he said in Britain &mdash;which wanted secondhand clothes, linen, blankets, etc.  If you sent perishable food in small quantities to the Continent, it would be simply lost in 99 cases out of 100.  It is equally futile for an individual to send a coat or vest or suit by itself direct to the Continent.</P>
    <P>But I think that groups could send second-hand clothes.  They would have to be sent by people who could afford <Col N="100" /> to spare the clothes, who knew that they had only 72 coupons and that they would not get any more.  The reason I mentioned the distress in Holland was that that particular report impressed me.  If I had been moving this motion before the statement by the Minister for Finance had been made, I should have given the House similar reports with regard to Greece, Italy and one or two other countries which I cannot recollect at the moment.  Do not think that Holland stands alone.  At a particular stage, it may have been worse off than other countries but I hope that that state of affairs has been remedied.</P>
    <P>I am rather disappointed with the suggestion in one or two of the speeches that there was something political in this motion.  I am absolutely convinced that, in respect of our relations with other countries, particularly in the period after the war, nobody has any right to make political points.  That course of action would do the individual no good and might do us a great deal of harm.  In conclusion, I should like to make one suggestion to the Taoiseach with, I admit, a somewhat different motive.</P>
    <P>It might be well if our own papers, at any rate, published the total amount of food we have produced, adding to that what we have had to import and setting off against it what we export.  It would be well if it were understood at home and abroad that, if we cannot do very much on this occasion, we have long been a contributor to the feeding of Europe.  I do not want my statements with regard to the difficulties of the moment to be taken as indicating that this country is not contributing something towards the feeding of Europe, but I think it is desirable that our people should be made aware of the need. The Government should be assured of support if they can do anything in the matter.  If, after investigation, they find it is not possible to do anything, they have the responsibility and we realise that they alone can be the judges.  With Senator Fearon's consent and with the leave of the House, I propose to withdraw the motion.</P>
    <P>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.10 p.m. <i>sine die.</i></P>
