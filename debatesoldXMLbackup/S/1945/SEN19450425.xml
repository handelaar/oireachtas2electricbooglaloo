      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Presidential election is due to take place this year.  It should be completed not later than June 24th next.  The Constitution provides that the procedure for electing a new President shall not be set in motion before the 60th day prior to the date upon which the current Presidential term expires, and this procedure for electing the President is prescribed by the Presidential Elections Act, 1937.</P>
      <P>Under Section 6 of that Act the Minister for Local Government must make an Order appointing, among other things: the last day for receiving nominations; the last day on which a candidate who has been nominated may withdraw from his candidature; and the day upon which a poll, if such should be necessary, shall be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the most careful consideration <Col N="2290" /> of all the circumstances I have come to the conclusion that if there is to be a poll, the polling day should be the 14th June.  But it also happens that the elections for the local authorities must take place this year, and the law provides that these elections shall take place not earlier than the 23rd June, nor later than the 1st day of July; that is to say, within from nine to 16 days of the date upon which the Presidential poll may have to be taken.  I think that in these circumstances it will be generally agreed that the reasonable and sensible thing to do, would be to arrange that the polls for the Presidential election and the local elections take place on the same day. It is to meet that point of view that this Bill has been introduced.  It may not, of course, be necessary to avail of the powers which the Bill proposes to confer.  That will depend on whether or not, more than one candidate having been nominated for the Presidency, more than one still remains in nomination when the time fixed for withdrawals has expired. Should only one candidate then remain nominated, it will not be necessary to invoke the powers which the Bill provides for, Part II of the Act will not come into operation, and the local elections will take place in the normal way; that is to say, on such dates between the 22nd June and July 2nd, as may be fixed by the appropriate local authorities under Sections 5 and 6 of the Local Elections Act, 1927.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, should more than one candidate for the Presidency remain in nomination when the time for withdrawals has expired, then it will become necessary to take a poll in accordance with Sections 12 and 20 of the Presidential Elections Act, 1937.  In that case, Part II of the Bill will come into operation and under Section 5 thereof, the polling at the local elections will take place on the same day as the poll for the Presidential election. It will be seen, therefore, that in these circumstances, if there should be a contest for the Presidency, the date of the local election polling will be the date fixed for the taking of the poll at the Presidential election.</P>
    <P>It may be said that the procedure <Col N="2291" /> for electing a President is initiated when the Minister appoints the critical days, these days are those by which, or in the course of which, the various essential steps that the law prescribes for the taking of the election must be fulfilled.  The days in question are the days for receiving nominations for the office, for withdrawing such nominations, and for taking a poll, should a poll be necessary; and these are appointed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health by an Order made under sub-section (1) of Section 6 of the Presidential Elections Act, 1937.</P>
    <P>In conformity with the provisions of the Constitution, sub-section (3) of that section provides that the Order in question &ldquo;shall be made on or as soon as conveniently may be after the sixtieth day before the expiration of the term of office of the outgoing President&rdquo;, that is, in the present instance, on or as soon as may be after the 26th April, 1945.  I propose to make the required Order on Friday next, April 27th.</P>
    <P>The next provision of the Constitution which must be adverted to by the Minister when appointing the specified days is Section 7 of Article 12.  This section prescribes that the new &ldquo;President shall enter upon his office on the day following the expiration of the term of office of his predecessor or as soon as may be thereafter&rdquo;.  Accordingly, in appointing the day for the taking of a poll at a Presidential election, the Minister must endeavour to ensure that the counting of the votes will be completed, and the result of the Presidential election announced, in due time to allow the new President to enter upon his office on the day following the expiration of the term of office of the outgoing President.</P>
    <P>With this consideration in mind, I have decided that June 14th is the latest date that in prudence might be fixed for the taking of a poll.  In that connection, I should like to say that I have every reason to believe that the new register which will come into force on June 1st will be available to all concerned on, or perhaps before, the usual time in every area, and that <Col N="2292" /> indeed the inquiries which I have caused to be made indicate that the work of preparing it is well in advance of schedule.  When the day for taking the Presidential poll has been determined, the appointment of the other days is a comparatively simple matter.</P>
    <P>On the one hand, it is desirable that the period for receiving nominations for the Presidential election should be as long as possible; on the other hand, it is also desirable that the period in which the arrangements for the local elections are made should also be as long as possible.  But the date for the local elections cannot be known until after the date for withdrawals of candidatures for the Presidential election, when it will become clear whether there will, or will not, be a poll for the Presidential election and whether the local elections will be held on that day or, during the normal period, between 22nd June and 1st July.  If the poll for the local elections is to take place on the 14th June, the county secretaries must give notice of the county council elections 20 clear days before polling day, that is, not later than the 24th May.  In the case of local authorities other than county councils, 18 days is the prescribed time for giving notice.</P>
    <P>Before they can issue that notice they will require a copy of the Order of the Minister declaring the Presidential and Local Elections Act, 1945, to be in force.  Moreover, before the notice of election can be given, the county secretaries will require a few days to have the notice printed and published. The minimum time fixed by the rules for nominations for local authorities is the seventh day after the last day for the issue of notice of election.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to candidates for the county council elections that they should get reasonable notice of the date of the poll for the local elections, as they have to get nomination papers, complete them, and lodge them with the returning officers.  Thus the 24th May, being the latest date when notice of a poll for the local elections on the 14th June can be given, would be too late for withdrawals of candidatures for the Presidential election. The 19th May is a Saturday, 20th Whit Sunday, 21st a bank holiday.  Taking <Col N="2293" /> all these points into consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the last day for withdrawals of candidatures for the Presidential election should be the 18th May.  The Order will be made and issued with full publicity on the 27th April, 1945.</P>
    <P>Under the Act of 1937, three days' notice of the meeting of the council must be given if it is proposed to ask that body to participate in the nomination of a candidate.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the publicity which has already been given to the Presidential election, it may be assumed that any potential candidate for the Presidency who is seeking nomination by county councils will have made contacts with them already.  Three days' notice of the meeting of the county council must be given to the members of the council.  A not unreasonable period within which meetings could be held and the nomination paper completed and lodged with the returning officer would be 20 days from the date of the Order.  That would leave the 16th May as the last day for receiving nominations for the Presidential election &mdash; any lengthening of that period would be at the expense of candidates for the local elections.</P>
    <P>With all these considerations in mind I propose to appoint the following days by the Order, which, as I have already mentioned, will be made on Friday next: &mdash; (a) May 16th as the last day for receiving nominations; (b) May 18th as the last day for withdrawals; (c) June 14th as the day for the taking of a poll, if a poll be necessary.  If a poll for the Presidential election is held on the 14th June the local elections will, under this Bill, as I have endeavoured to impress on the House, be held on the same date.</P>
    <P>Working on the time schedule I have just given for the Presidential election, the following would be the significant dates in connection with the elections for county councils:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Notice of Election: Any time after 17th May but before 24th May.  Nominations: 31st May.  Notice of Poll: 6th June.</P>
    <P>These dates refer to county council <Col N="2294" /> elections.  As far as other local authorities are concerned the latest date on which notice of election could be given would be 26th May.  Nominations could not be made later than 2nd June and the notice of poll would have to be given on 6th June.</P>
    <P>If, however, and I think it is necessary to emphasise this, a poll for the Presidential election is not taken, the local elections will be held in the normal way on dates appointed by the local authorities between 23rd June and 1st July.</P>
    <P>To come now to the several provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 and 2 require no comment.</P>
    <P>Section 3 I have already referred to. It specifies the circumstances under which Part II, which embodies the remaining ten sections of the measure, comes into operation.</P>
    <P>Section 4 declares the Act to apply only to the elections in 1945.  In the normal course these elections will not occur together for 21 years.  Furthermore, we have no reason to believe that certain difficulties, such, for instance, as paragraph (f) of Section 14 is intended to provide against, would arise at a future date and necessitate some of the provisions which are embodied in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 5 modifies the Local Elections Act, 1927, by fixing the poll at a local election to be the day for the poll at the Presidential election instead of the day appointed by the county council, between the 23rd June and the 1st July.</P>
    <P>Section 6 adapts Section 20 of the Presidential Elections Act, 1937, by making the administrative county or county borough, instead of the Dáil constituency, the constituency for the purpose of Section 20 of the Presidential Elections Act, 1937.  Under this section also the county registrar or under-sheriff, as the case may be, is appointed the local returning officer for the purposes of the Presidential election.  It is essential, if a poll is taken for both elections, that the constituency be the same for each election <Col N="2295" /> in order to avoid confusion in the arrangements for the poll and in the collection of the ballot boxes and the counting of the votes and, of course, it will greatly convenience the electors. This adaptation involves the preparation of a postal voters list also, arranged according to each local electoral area.</P>
    <P>Section 7 authorises the issue to a member of the Gárda Síochána or L.S.F. of a certificate enabling him to vote at a different place in the county electoral area from that at which he would otherwise vote, provided that he is engaged on duties connected with the election.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I understand that in the copy of the Bill which has been circulated the words &ldquo;Gárda Síochána&rdquo; have been omitted in the index to the Bill, and also in the marginal note to Section 7.  The section as printed is correct.  It embodies the reference to the Gárda Síochána, but the reference to the Gárda Síochána is omitted in the marginal note.  It may be necessary, therefore, to make a verbal amendment in that section.</P>
    <P>Section 8 extends the obligation to preserve the secrecy of the voting to all agents present at the polling or counting, whether on behalf of the Presidential or the local election candidates.  Section 9 provides that if separate ballot boxes are provided a ballot paper will not be invalidated merely because of the fact that it is placed in the wrong ballot box. Section 10 places the polls for both the Presidential election and the local elections under the sole jurisdiction of the local Presidential returning officer. The duties of a returning officer in relation to the poll are such that a division of authority between two or three officers would be impracticable, but at the same time we may assume there will be complete co-operation between the returning officers concerned. I should like to emphasise that this merely makes the local returning officer responsible for the taking of the poll in so far as all the other arrangements leading up to the <Col N="2296" /> taking of the poll of the local elections are concerned.  Those who would ordinarily be the returning officers and would be responsible for the taking of the poll for these local elections will continue to be responsible for all arrangements preliminary to the taking of the poll.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is, perhaps, now unnecessary, but we have put it in as a precaution.  As has already been explained, the period for nominations for the local elections will expire in some cases possibly on 2nd June.  In order to guard against the remote contingency that persons who wish to participate in the nomination of candidates will not have copies of the new register which comes into force on 1st June, in their hands by that date, and to remove any doubts which might exist as to whether such persons are duly qualified, this section provides that where a person has been registered in the outgoing register he shall be deemed to be registered in the new register.  That is to say, we are putting this in as a precautionary measure to ensure that if by any chance a copy of the new register should not be available, no person will be deprived of any right he may have had in 1944 in relation to the elections of 1945.</P>
    <P>Section 12 authorises the expenses incurred in taking the joint poll to be charged and paid as part of the expenses incurred in the conduct of the Presidential election.</P>
    <P>In so far as these charges include expenses which would otherwise be paid by the local authority, the charges will be apportioned.  Senators may be certain that the Minister for Finance will see that they are apportioned correctly.</P>
    <P>I may say a similar provision was made in former days where county and rural district councillors were elected on the same day.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is consequential on Section 11.  The scale to be prescribed under this section for the local government elections will not include the expense of taking the poll, since that expense will be paid and recovered under the provisions of Section 12. <Col N="2297" /> Section 14 confers on the Minister for Local Government and Public Health power to make such regulations as may be necessary to give effect to the Act, including the issue of a polling card in respect of the Presidential election, to each Dáil elector.</P>
    <P>Those are the purposes which this Bill seeks to serve.  It has been introduced because of the fact that it seems to be probable that we shall have a contest for the Presidential election this year, and that, as the taking of the poll in respect of that contest must fall within a very few days of the normal date upon which the poll would be taken for the local elections, it seems to be a reasonable thing in the public interest and for the public convenience that arrangements should be made to allow the polls at both elections to be taken on the one day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a machinery measure arising out of the provision of the Constitution with regard to the election by popular vote of the Uachtarán or President.  That provision of the Constitution has always appeared to me to be entirely absurd, and to be based upon a false analogy with offices like that of the President of the United States, where the President has in fact immense executive and other powers. There is no precedent, and no analogy for the position here, where a person, an officer of the State, the Uachtarán, who has no executive powers at all and who has very little other powers of any character, is elected by popular vote. This year, if there should be a contest, the Minister has taken care &mdash; quite properly, perhaps, in the circumstances&mdash; to combine it, owing to an accident, with the local elections, so that that might create some interest in it.  In default of such a thing &mdash; if the election of the President were to take place by itself &mdash; it would probably excite little interest, have a very small poll and, on the part of well-organised people, have an immense amount of personation. It seems to be an elaborate, expensive, unique, and wholly misguided provision, but since the provision is there I think this Bill becomes necessary, and I have no objection to the machinery.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is really any objection to the provisions of this Bill.  Senator Hayes has admitted that, if it is not essential, it is at least desirable that we should arrange to take the poll for the Presidency, if a poll should be called for, and the poll for the election of local authorities on the one day.  I do not agree with him that if the election for the Presidency were to be held alone, and were not to be associated with the election for the local authorities, there would be little interest taken in it.  I think there are many others who do not take that view either.  In the other House it was alleged that I introduced this Bill because I hoped to avail of the interest which would be taken in the Presidential contest to ensure that there would be a full poll for the election of the local authorities.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;particularly in view of the manner in which his views in relation to the Presidency have changed.  He has told us to-day that this office is comparatively unimportant; that the President has only very limited powers and functions.  But that was not what he told the electorate in 1937.  The Constitution was opposed in 1937 on the grounds that we were creating the Presidential office in order to enable a dictatorship to be set up in this country.</P>

      <P>I am not for a moment contending that I can have it both ways.  I am not a member of Fine Gael.  They are the only Party in Irish politics which claims that right for its members.  However, that is all beside the point.  The real fact of the matter is that the Presidential Office is a very important one.  Its importance was indicated by the action which the Senator and some other members of this House felt called upon to take in relation to a measure which was before the House and which, at their instance, was referred to the President of the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all beside the point.  I am glad to see that everybody agrees that, in the circumstances, it is desirable that power such as is sought in this Bill should be conferred on the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and that there is no objection to the conferring of such power.  It would facilitate not merely myself but the local returning officers, who will be <Col N="2300" /> concerned with the conduct of these elections, if we could have all stages of this Bill to-day, so that they may know definitely what the law is and what their responsibilities under the law will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to obtain some information from the Minister on this section.  The section refers to members of the L.S.F. and the Gárda, and I should like to know what their duty in this connection is. Obviously, there is a duty upon them to preserve order, but I am not satisfied that, in all cases, the &ldquo;preservation of order&rdquo; is comprehensively understood and interpreted.  It is within the Minister's knowledge that there is a considerable amount of personation in every constituency at elections. It may be worse in some areas than in others.  Irrespective of who wins, that is not good.  I am sure the Minister does not agree with it.  It is very important that officers of the law in the polling stations should have full instructions as to their duty, and that they should act according to those instructions. They are continuously officers of the law, whereas the presiding officer and the agents for the candidates are interpreting the law for the day only.  Whatever the practice has been in the past with regard to instructions from the Department of Justice to the members of the Gárda on duty in polling stations, definite instructions should be issued to them, that they, above everybody else, are concerned with the detection of crime in the polling stations.  Whatever the presiding officers may know, and whatever knowledge the agents may have, it is very difficult for anybody to go into a booth and record a vote for another person without the members <Col N="2301" /> of the Gárda knowing about it.  When the election is over, and the gossip gets around that this thing has been done, it has a bad effect.  I do not know what the difficulties are.  It may be that the presiding officer is the responsible authority, and that the officer of the law on that particular day has no function except under his instructions. It does not matter what the position was in the past; if there are weaknesses in the law at present, the Minister should take steps, even in this measure, to rectify them.  Under a free system of election, it is a bad thing that young people should vote for somebody else, whether at an election for the Dáil, for county or other representatives, or for the President, and we should put a stop to the practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who has a fair experience of elections, Parliamentary and local, I admit that personation was at one time an evil.  It was a thing of which I never approved on the part of any Party with which I was connected.  I thought that it was a reprehensible method of securing election. However, I think that, during the past ten or 12 years, the amount of personation has been negligible in the areas of which I have a fairly close knowledge.  That is not because we have become more moral; it is due to greater efficiency on the part of the personation agents on behalf of the candidates and to increased vigilance on the part of the Gárda Síochána, who are now long enough in a district in which they may have to serve in a polling booth to know all the people on the register there.  In areas in which there is no post office, the register is available at the Gárda barracks, and that enables the local force to know with great accuracy the people whose names appear on the register. I think that the powers the Gárda have, and the regulations under which they work, are ample and adequate. <Col N="2302" /> If there is any loophole I should certainly like to see it stopped up, but I should not like it to go forth, without a mild protest, that personation has influenced any election here for the past 12 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that it is permissible at all to discuss this question on Section 7.  I cannot see much risk of serious personation so long as we have proportional representation. The number of electors in a constituency is so great and the number of votes required to furnish a quota is so great that it would require mighty organisation to make any appreciable difference in an election by means of personation.</P>

      <P>One point is very relevant under this section.  Senator Baxter referred to the L.S.F.  The L.S.F. has no function in connection with the elections except to preserve order.  The only people who have any function under the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, apart from presiding officers and personation agents, are the Gárdaí.</P>
      <P>The Gárda are fully secured in relation to any action they may wish to take.  If they suspect him of personation they can arrest a person. They have been known to follow a person suspected of personation from one booth to another, and to have him arrested there.  Certainly, if I were Minister for Justice, I should be very slow, however, to send out prior to an election any special circular to the Gárda calling their attention to the provisions of the Act, and directing them to enforce it because it would be said, no matter what was the object, that this was done by the Minister for Justice with an ulterior motive and with an improper purpose in view.  The Gárda know their duty, and knowing their duty I have no reason to believe they are not zealous to discharge it.  I think it would be better to leave the position as it is.</P>

      <P>There is one point arising in connection with this section which I should like the Minister to clarify.  The Bill says that for the purposes of a poll, the returning officer shall be the county registrar.  I understood the Minister to say in his Second Reading speech that it would be for the purposes of the poll only that the county registrar would come into the picture at the local election, and that all the steps prior to the taking of the poll would have to be taken by the secretary of the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>That means that the issuing of the nomination papers, the necessary notices that will have to be published, the actual reception and adjudication on the nomination papers in the case of candidates for the local authority will be carried out by the person who would otherwise be the returning officer.  I think that is the position&mdash; that the returning officer, the clerk or secretary of the local authority, who would be normally the returning officer for the purposes of a local election, will take all the steps necessary and also decide on the validity of the nomination papers.  In the event of there being more valid nominations received than there are vacancies, Part II of the Bill will come into force and the county registrar will then take over from him and make all the arrangements.</P>

I think, however, that in some cases a good deal of friction may arise, for instance, say, in relation to the appointment of presiding officers and polling clerks.  A secretary or clerk who is normally the returning officer for the purposes of local elections may feel that he has certain rights.  In view of the fact that he has carried on these elections for a number of years, he may feel that he has a grievance if at a particular stage somebody else will come in and, if there is disagreement between them, that other person will have the final say.  It is with the desire to secure that the machinery that will be established under this Bill will work smoothly that I raise the question at all, and I would ask that the Minister in making Orders should draw the attention of returning officers to the desirability of consultation rather than allow matters to drift into violent disagreement.</P>

I refer, in the first instance, to line 44, on page 3, where reference is made to &ldquo;course-betting permit&rdquo;.  I think that the section to which that refers is Section 24, and not Section 23.  Again, on the next page, page 4, in line 7, there is a definition attaching to the word &ldquo;levy&rdquo;, stated to be in Section 26.  I think that that is not correct, and that the section is 27.  In line 36, page 3, reference is made to &ldquo;governing bodies&rdquo;.  The phrase used is: &ldquo;The expression &lsquo;authorised racecourse&rsquo; means a racecourse at which race meetings are held with the sanction of either or both of the government bodies.&rdquo;  There is a definition for &ldquo;government body&rdquo; near the top of page 4, but there is nothing about governing bodies.

      <P>There was a good deal of discussion, I think the Minister will agree, in the other House as to the appropriate quorum of the board and as to the powers of delegation of the duties of the board to a committee.  I am entirely in agreement with the Minister that it is very desirable to delegate powers to committees of the board, but I do not think it is too much to suggest that at the annual meeting, at which the whole policy of the board will be framed, there should be a fully representative attendance.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2).</P>
      <P>I do not quite understand why the Minister wants to take power, through the first five years only, to sanction any appointment.  It appears to me that there might be a case, though I would not agree with it, for the Minister to take that power during the whole currency of the board's power, but it seems to me to be clear that there is no logical reason why, during the first five years, he would have a power of veto, and not afterwards. Having set up the board and entrusted it with carrying out the job or duties allotted to it by this Bill, I think that, while the Minister has retained power to approve or withhold his approval of the purposes to which money is to be devoted, within those limits the board should be allowed to carry on their duties without any question of Ministerial veto or approval, and more particularly than anything else in connection with the appointment of officials to that board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether this sub-section should await sub-section (2).  There is a reference in the sub-section to the chief officer of the board, and it appears to me that as this reference arises again in Section 20 there ought to be some indication in the Bill as to what is meant by &ldquo;chief officer&rdquo;.  Is it the secretary, the chairman, or the accountant, or what exactly is meant?  I have no idea what might be regarded as the chief officer of a board of this kind, but, as I say again, it arises in Section 20, and I think there should be some indication as to what the Minister has in mind when he refers to the chief officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I had in mind the secretary of the board.  He might be called by some other title; he might be called chief officer, but he would be the chief, responsible, paid official of the board.  That is the intention. Now, as to the purpose of taking this power that is sought in sub-section (2). In the first draft of this Bill that I saw <Col N="2308" /> it was suggested that the official should be a civil servant, and I did not like that.  Then it was sought that no official could at any time be appointed without the Minister's sanction or approval, and I resisted that.  I said that if we are setting up this board we ought to put confidence in them, and give them the right to select their own officials free of any control, but after a good deal of discussion I agreed to this sub-section on the grounds that there must be close relationship, at any rate, for a number of years, until the new board's work is familiar to everybody, between the chief official and the officials of the Department of Finance.  The question of the levy will give rise to regulations and a variety of statutory regulations will have to be made.  It would be necessary, therefore, to secure that there would be harmony of working between the officials in charge of the betting tax for the Revenue Department and those working this new levy, and though I would much rather have the board completely free to do its own work in its own way, I was convinced of the necessity of securing, at any rate for the few years at the beginning &mdash; five years was suggested as a maximum&mdash; that the chief officer of the board at least and probably the other officials under him&mdash;those at any rate who would have anything to do with the betting licences and permits, and the implementation of whatever rules will be made to enforce the levy &mdash;should work hand in hand with the officials of the Revenue Department. It is to make that certain that we seek to have this power.  I think it is a necessary power, and that it will prove to the bettor, as well as to the Government, a very satisfactory method of working.  After five years, I take it, the levy system will work smoothly, and I do not think it will be necessary to make this section operative for longer than that term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion in the section is that the officer's qualifications should have the approval of the Department of Finance.  There is the implication also that a Parliamentary Question may be addressed to the Minister for Finance regarding the qualifications, and if the appointments can be the subject of questions, we must also assume that they may be raised in debate.  On the whole, I do not think that it is a bad system so far as the first appointments are concerned.  As a matter of fact, I have always been interested, as an educationist to whom people come in search of avenues of employment.  I am anxious to see a provision which will ensure that every young, or for that matter, mature person, will get a fair crack of the whip from the Minister when posts are to be filled.  Therefore, I think this scheme is not a bad one.  It means the persons appointed will have to secure the approval of the Minister for Finance, and that the Minister will have to stand over the appointments, if he is called upon to do so, after the appointments&mdash;not a bad thing.  I hope the principle will be carried out further, although I know there are all kinds of practical difficulties regarding the other appointments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4) No authorised officer of the board shall, either directly or indirectly, enter into any course bet either on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person.  The board shall summarily dismiss any such authorised officer guilty of any infringement of this sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned this matter on the Second Reading, and the Minister, I think, is in entire agreement with the principle that authorised officers should not under any circumstances be allowed to bet, but on that occasion he did not think it was desirable that the principle should be enshrined in the <Col N="2310" /> Act.  If the Minister reflects, he will agree with me on the matter that the Act itself establishes the principles under which the betting system will work.  I know that it may be extraordinarily difficult to ensure that the sub-section I suggest is carried out, but it should be there as a principle and as a headline at which the board should aim.  It is common gossip at the present time that, notwithstanding any regulation that may exist in the governing bodies, jockeys do bet, and I think that the Minister's inference on the last occasion was that no matter what stipulation we make in the Act, it would be difficult to prevent authorised officers from entering into course bets.</P>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that if an authorised officer does enter into a course bet, he is contravening the conditions under which he accepted his position, and that if he is detected, he will automatically suffer the penalty provided.  What I am afraid of is that an authorised officer will get into the books of a bookmaker and that he will use his position&mdash;blackmail is the word &mdash;to prevent that bookmaker from obliging him to pay his just debts.</P>
    <P>If that authorised officer knew that on a disclosure of his betting transactions, he would lose his position&mdash; regardless of the personal feelings of the members of the board towards him &mdash;he would not have the same hold over the bookmaker which otherwise he would have under the terms of the Bill at present.</P>

You know that a man can get a pal to put his money on for him, and I think it will be a grave mistake to put provisions in the law <Col N="2311" /> which could not be carried out.  Any such provisions can be got over by a person arranging with his wife or with a friend to put on the bets for him.  I think it is very inadvisable to enshrine such provisions in the law.</P>

We discussed the matter the other day on the Second Stage, and since then my advisers have put up to me another argument.  That argument is that it will be necessary for the officials of the board to make test bets. Some officials will have to make test bets, so that we may see that the law in regard to the levy is carried out. Therefore, it will be entirely wrong to make a rule in the law that the officials should not bet.</P>

That suggests that some of them are going to be <i>agents provocateurs</i>, and I am afraid I will have to oppose it at a later stage.  I must decline to agree to any such proposal, although I feel that it will be difficult to make an amendment workable.  However, I ask the Minister to advise the board to make it a condition of employment, or something of that nature, that authorised officers should not bet.  I think that if the Minister is going to sit down deliberately with the intention of authorising officers to make what are euphemistically called &ldquo;test bets&rdquo;, and to continue the work which may, perhaps, be found necessary, but which is extraordinarily dangerous, of the Department of Supplies inspectors, he is introducing a bad principle in our legislation.  In justice to the bookmakers, I feel bound to discuss Part III of the Act in a very different way.  That is the part of the Act in which these officers are given absolute power.  I hope the Minister was not visualising exactly what he said.</P>

      <P>(5) Before establishing any new racecourse under this section, the board shall publish in a newspaper circulating in the locality where it is proposed to establish such new racecourse, notice of its intention so to do and shall consider any objections that may be made to such establishment by the owner or management of any existing authorised racecourse.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4.  In these amendments I had the view that the board might set up rival racecourses.  The purpose is to secure that they cannot do this without complying with certain formalities. I feel that the managements of existing courses should know the intentions of the board, and be given an opportunity to make representations. I am not wedded to the principle of the amendments, and I will <Col N="2314" /> welcome the views of the Minister, if he has any other method in view of carrying out my objectives.</P>

      <P>I had in mind that this is a permissive power that will probably never be required, but if it happened that there was a racecourse which was being very badly managed and the executive of the course could not be convinced that their services were not those that should normally be expected from such a board, the board should have power and authority to go to the executive and say: &ldquo;If you do not do what you ought to do, we shall start a course in the vicinity.&rdquo; I think it is very unlikely that such a power would have to be used, but we are putting it into the Bill in case it becomes necessary.</P>

I do not suggest that any executive would be so stupid as to run counter to the wishes of the board in the best interests of racing, but what I want to secure is that every executive will have an opportunity of putting up its case.  I would be strongly opposed to a suggestion that anybody other than the board should make a final decision.  It is possible, for example, that somebody might think that he or they were able to run Punchestown races better than they are being run.</P>

      <P>There is a general principle in this.  Every Government measure starts off on the assumption that <i>ex hypothesi</i> the board to be set up under any Act is going to be an excellent board.  Ever since 1922 I have heard that case being made.  The Minister in charge of the Bill feels that it is going to be a grand board because he is going to appoint it himself. Senator Quirke thinks that it is going to be perfectly just and do no harm to anybody and that, therefore, you need have no proviso for safeguarding individuals.</P>

      <P>I know nothing whatever about the merits of this business, but listening to the Minister and to Senator Sweetman, and accepting what they say as being right, I can see no objection to this amendment, except the objection I have stated before, namely that this is a grand tidy Bill drawn up by the Department, and that it would be very improper to sully it with any kind of amendment.  That applies to this Bill and to dozens of other Bills.  In other cases the case is made by supporters of the Minister who say: &ldquo;Surely, you do not think that the Minister would do an injustice.&rdquo; Then the case is made by the Minister in favour of the board.  The Minister says: &ldquo;Surely, you do not think the board would do an injustice,&rdquo; but human beings, when they are given power are inclined to be impatient of opposition.  I hope the Minister is not right.  Possibly he is when he argues that all these people are so interwoven that whatever the board is doing is bound to be known to those against whom they are going to take action.  That is an extraordinary argument.</P>

      <P>I do not think the board is likely to establish or to attempt to establish a racecourse in the vicinity of an existing course.  If they had any such intention it would not be long before that would become known to the proprietors of the racecourse. The racecourse executive would have a representative on the board.  Surely that would make the matter known to them in advance. What would the representatives be on the board for but to look after their interests?  My main argument against the amendment is that it is quite unnecessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw attention at line 30 to the reference to the chief officer of the board.  This is a matter of some importance, because in legal proceedings under this section a document purporting to be a copy of any regulation made by the board is to be certified to be a true copy by the chairman of the board or by the chief officer of the board.  Who is that person?  It is clearly not the chairman. I think there should be some definition of what the Minister means by &ldquo;chief officer,&rdquo; a term which is used here two or three times.</P>

There must be a definition of &ldquo;chief officer&rdquo; if you are going to use that word, otherwise it would be better to use the word &ldquo;secretary&rdquo;.  I prefer that the word &ldquo;secretary&rdquo; should be used, because this will be a limited company and any document will have to be served on the secretary.

      <P>On the last stage, Senator Foran discussed the levies made by the board which we are dissolving under Part IV.  It was suggested by him that the percentage was fixed at 10 per cent., and that in addition the board took all broken money.

      <P>I suggest that the Senator should read the regulations.  I have done so.  If the amount were worked out to the last farthing to be 2/5¾, the board would pay 2/6; if it is under the amount, it is grossed down to the nearest round figure.  The impression left by Senator Foran here&mdash; I know he still feels it is correct, but I think it is wrong&mdash;was an unfair one.</P>

      <P>Senator Sweetman is only emphasising the point.  The law lays down 10 per cent.  Through the board's regulations you can actually lose your money without having a chance of winning.  Senator Sweetman contends that the amount is grossed up as well as down.  There is a big margin between 2/- and 2/6.  They have all that.</P>

Furthermore, to show the carelessness with which this Bill has been drafted, I would refer to the first line in sub-section (4) of Section 40 which says: &ldquo;If the board are of opinion.&rdquo;  Everywhere else in this Bill, the board is referred to as &ldquo;it&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;where it is of opinion&rdquo;.

      <P>We are not now dealing with a matter relating to the principle of the Bill.  It is a question of getting the correct method of expressing an idea and that is a technical matter.  I do not claim that I am correct in my contention but it occurs to me that the phraseology is wrong.  I put that to the Minister, who has more experience than I have, and who told me on Second Reading that he had given more study to the Bill and had experts to advise him.</P>

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After Section 40 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>41.  (1) On receipt of a complaint from a trade union representing the employees of a racing establishment <Col N="2323" /> or of an authorised racecourse that the rates of wages paid to such employees or the conditions of their employment are unsatisfactory the board shall cause an inquiry to be held concerning the facts of such complaint and the board are hereby authorised to take such steps as may to them seem proper for the purpose of instituting such inquiry and securing the attendance thereat of witnesses and the production of documents.</P>
    <P>(2)  On the conclusion of the inquiry mentioned in the next preceding sub-section of this section the board shall make and transmit to the proprietor of the racing establishment concerned in such inquiry or the executive of the authorised racecourse, as the case may be, a recommendation in such form as may to them seem proper relating to the matters inquired into.</P>
    <P>(3)  If the proprietor of the racing establishment or the executive of the authorised racecourse to whom the recommendation mentioned in this section is addressed fails to give effect to such recommendation within a reasonable time it shall be competent for the board&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in the case of the proprietor of a racing establishment to exclude from every raceourse in respect of which they exercise jurisdiction until the terms of the recommendation have been complied with any horse owned, trained or entered as a competitor by such proprietor, or</P>
    <P>(b)  in any other case, to prohibit until the terms of the recommendation are complied with, the holding or promoting of a race meeting on any racecourses owned, leased or operated by the executive aforesaid.</P>
    <P>(4)  The expenses incurred by the board in giving effect to the provisions of this section shall be a charge on the funds of the board.</P>
    <P>The claim that this amendment makes is a modest one.  It claims that, where it is brought to the notice of the board that the conditions of service of employees are unsatisfactory, the <Col N="2324" /> board will have power to make an investigation and that, having received a report following the investigation, they should have power to make recommendations to the parties concerned, whether the proprietor of a racing establishment or the executive of a racecourse.  Nothing is suggested as to what are reasonable conditions, reasonable hours or reasonable wages. This board will be selected because of its competence to deal with matters affecting racing and the live-stock industry.  They will be experts, so far as the Minister can make them experts, and may, therefore, be regarded as people who will take a broad view of the issues brought to their notice. There is no suggestion of importing an outside authority into the matter. There is no suggestion that the Minister himself should intervene in relation to the conditions of employment. The amendment is carefully drafted so as to exclude any outside interference, leaving it entirely to the board to judge, after investigation, as to the reasonableness or otherwise of the complaints made&mdash;and not made by individuals but by a trade union representative of the parties concerned.  I do not make any allegations or assertions in relation to the conditions of employment.  I have been told that the conditions in certain cases are extremely bad, and I read a report of proceedings in a court of justice within the past four or five months in which the district justice expressed considerable amazement at the information given him at the trial regarding a young lad employed in connection with racing.</P>
    <P>I may be permitted to read what Senator Parkinson said on this subject when the Second Reading Stage of the Bill was under discussion here on the 18th instant:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As regards the stable boys of the Curragh, they get a standard wage. Their wages are now over 100 per cent. better than in 1937.  As well, they have many opportunities of making money, between presents and other things, that an employee in any other trade or business has not got.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would draw attention to two points only in that statement.  I do not want <Col N="2325" /> to argue this matter with Senator Parkinson, who knows the facts.  I am not challenging them.  There are, however, two points to which I would draw attention.  One is that the wages of stable boys are 100 per cent. better than they were in 1937.  We do not know what that means because we do not know what the wages were in 1937. If they were 1/- a week in 1937, a present wage of 2/- would represent an increase of 100 per cent.  If they were 5/- in 1937, 100 per cent. increase would bring them to 10/-, which some of us would consider very low.  The second point to which I want to refer is that Senator Parkinson was alluding only to stable boys.  This amendment refers to more than stable boys.  It refers to the employees of a racing establishment or of the executive of any authorised racecourse.  That, I assume, would mean all kinds of employment within the jurisdiction of the executive of an authorised racecourse or of a racing establishment.  When legislation is being put through this House to promote the interest of bloodstock, I urge the Minister not to omit the human beings who are to be employed in connection with this industry.  If I were endeavouring to insert an amendment which would involve a great deal of red tape and the enforcement of which would impose a burden on the Minister's Department, I could understand his resisting it.  I do not think that he can raise that objection now.  I urge him very strongly to have this amendment, or an equivalent amendment, written into the Bill before it leaves this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment.  We are not dealing with racing establishments as such, in this Bill.  I take it that a racing establishment would be a trainer's establishment.  We are not dealing with those and there is no power in the Bill to interfere with them.  They are the property of individuals and we are not giving the board power to examine into their affairs.  We are, of course, giving the board power to examine into the affairs of authorised racecourses. I hope that, as a result of the influence of the board and the moneys which will be put at their disposal, <Col N="2326" /> racing will, in the future, be put on a much more prosperous basis.  I should, certainly, be very disappointed if the workers employed in the racing business&mdash;I refer now to those employees of racecourse bodies with whom the new board will have authority to deal&mdash;did not share in the general prosperity.</P>
      <P>There would not be much satisfaction for them in the success of racing under the new Act, when it is passed, if they did not see some profit accruing to themselves out of the general prosperity of what, perhaps, I could call the industry as a whole, but there is a way of dealing with measures relating to conditions of employment.  There are certain laws in existence through which matters of that kind can be brought to the attention of the Minister concerned with these matters, who is the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and I think that that would be the proper mode of approach for the employees of the racecourses, if they have grievances&mdash;and I am sure they have&mdash;to have their grievances raised.  I do not think the Racing Board would be an appropriate authority to deal with the matters raised by Senator Duffy, and I do not, therefore, propose to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make only two observations in reference to what the Minister has said.  Firstly, I think the Minister is probably in error in saying that the Bill is not concerned with the proprietors of racing establishments.  I notice that in Section 16 provision is made for the carriage of horses to race meetings.  Surely, that is using the money of the board to assist the proprietors of racing establishments.  I do not know very much about the bookkeeping part of these transactions but it seems to me, at any rate, that if the board is entitled and authorised under this Bill to use its funds to assist those concerned with the ownership of racehorses, it is not unreasonable to ask the board to concern itself with the conditions under which the persons employed in these establishments are working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2327" /> Secondly, the Minister, I think, misunderstands the powers of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to this matter.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has power to interfere, through his inspectors, in relation to certain classes of employment, which are closely defined in different Acts of the Oireachtas, the most comprehensive of which is the Conditions of Employment Act, but these deal with conditions of industrial employment.  He has power to interfere also with factories and workshops.  He has power to interfere in relation to holidays for a large section of the people, and he has power to interfere in commercial employment under the Shops Act.  These, of course, are separate Acts, but beyond that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has no power at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has powers in relation to categories covered by an Act which was passed by the Oireachtas in 1936, but, unfortunately for the people with whom I am dealing now, and for very large bodies of people in employment, they do not come within the scope of any of these Acts and I suggest, with all respect, that this offers the Minister an opportunity of doing something for this particular section which, without making any reflections, I say is a lowly-paid section of the community.  I think the Minister ought not to let this opportunity pass without making these regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty I see about the amendment is that it gives the board power over the employers, but if the employee will not do what the board suggests, no power whatever over the employee is given to the board.  If the employee is dissatisfied with the rate of wages laid down, will not accept it, and goes out on strike, there is nothing here to deal with that situation, and that is the difficulty I see in connection with this amendment.  If what the Senator has in mind is the setting up of an arbitration board, then they should have power over the employee as well as over the employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>It will consist of five or six people nominated by these organisations engaged in racing, and other people selected by the Minister within a defined class.  The Bill lays down the kind of people he must select, including owners, trainers, and other people engaged in bloodstock production. I respectfully suggest that a body more favourable to the employers could not have been selected if the employers were hand-picking them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, in regard to the difficulty of enforcing conditions on the employees, I might mention that Senator Parkinson on the last occasion said that he and people in his position are inundated with applications for employment.  It would appear, then, that if men refuse to accept the award of the board and go on strike, the employers, according to Senator Parkinson, will have no difficulty in filling their place five times over.</P>
      <P>In any event, there is no suggestion here of doing anything beyond making a recommendation to the racecourse executive or to the proprietor of the training establishment, as the case may be, and there is an opportunity for the person to whom the recommendation is made to come back to the board, back to the people of his own profession, and they can revise the decision if they think fit to do so.  I do not think that the objections mentioned are likely to arise at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesParkinson" hpid="Mr. Parkinson Mr. Parkinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parkinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Senator is wrong about the number of applications that I get.  These applications are not concerned with stable lads, but with boys who are seeking to be apprentices.  With regard to the question of wages that he talks about, such as an increase of 100 per cent. on wages that were 1/- and 2/- a week, I may say that the wages the stable lads got in 1937 were the same wages that the agricultural workers had in the district, and now these wages have <Col N="2329" /> been fixed at 110 per cent. higher by the Government, or by the civil servants who act for the Minister for Supplies and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  We have nothing to do with the fixing of the wages, except to give the employees the total amount that it is legal to give, as laid down by the civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get into conflict with Senator Parkinson, but he is obviously wrong&mdash;and I know that he is not trying to mislead the House &mdash;because the Minister for Industry and Commerce has no power to fix wages for agricultural workers except under a trade board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamKyle" hpid="Mr. Kyle Mr. Kyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to what Senator Parkinson said as to the wages of these stable lads being the same as those laid down by the Department of Agriculture for agricultural workers in the district.  I do not get the connection in what he said as to the wages of these boys and the wages that were being paid to them in 1927.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesParkinson" hpid="Mr. Parkinson Mr. Parkinson">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamKyle" hpid="Mr. Kyle Mr. Kyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyle</NameTxt>
      <P>1937?  Well, the Senator stated that in 1937 the wages being paid to these boys were the same as those being paid to the agricultural workers of the district.  If I am wrong, I should like to be corrected, but if that is the statement then the wages certainly leave a good deal to be desired from the Minister's point of view and from the point of view of his good wishes that the lads may enjoy some of the prosperity that this legislation and the setting up of this board will bring about.  Certainly one hopes that the Minister's wishes will be brought to fruition rather than that the wages should be governed by the Agricultural Wages Board if that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesParkinson" hpid="Mr. Parkinson Mr. Parkinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parkinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The wage now paid to a boy is not the agricultural wage. It is 50/- a week.  I think 45/- is the maximum wage paid to agricultural workers.  These boys get much more than that and in addition, if a horse wins a race, the boy who looks after that particular horse gets £3 or £5 <Col N="2330" /> according to the value of the stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it might meet the case if the Minister would give an undertaking that he would have conveyed to this board his opinion that the conditions of people employed in the racing industry should be improved and that the effect of providing more funds for bloodstock breeders should not end with the animal section but that it should be applied to the human section as well.  If the Minister could do anything of that kind it would be helpful and I think he should also suggest to the ruling authorities, both the Turf Club and the National Hunt Committee, that this question of apprentices is a very serious one and should be tackled.  I do not want to go into Senator Parkinson's argument or into the merits of Senator Duffy's amendment, but if the Minister could do anything to improve these conditions, the Bill would be worth while.  It is certainly going to confer great benefits on the owner, the trainer and the breeder, but as far as I know nothing will eventually happen so far as the workers are concerned.  I am very much concerned with that aspect and if the Minister would help to improve the conditions of the workers in the industry, then the Bill would be a blessing all round, not a one-sided one, as it is likely to prove as it stands at present.</P>

If there are bad conditions in this industry, I am not personally aware of them and I do not know the facts in regard to them.  I have not any information that would lead me to believe that the conditions in the industry are bad.  If, however, any complaints reach me from anybody, the men employed in the industry or from anybody authorised to speak on their behalf, I shall, as Minister, have these complaints brought to the notice of the Racing Board with the request that they should be inquired into.  If prosperity is brought to the industry as a result of any Act of the Oireachtas, I should certainly wish, and it would be the wish of the Government, that that prosperity should be shared by the <Col N="2331" /> workers of the industry as well as by the bloodstock owners and the public in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if in furtherance of his desire to benefit, amongst others, the workers employed in the industry, he would not take power to make his recommendation effective?  There is not the slightest use in these workers making representations to the Minister if that is to be followed merely by a letter from the Minister to the board telling them that they should do something about it.  If the board does not get power in the Bill to hold an inquiry there will be no inquiry.  They have no right whatever to interfere in the private affairs of any racecourse executive, training stables, or anybody else.  If the Minister does not take power in the Bill to tell the board to follow up these representations, the making of representations is useless.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 24, to delete the words &ldquo;or of ordinary proper conduct&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the definition relating to an addict, it seems to me that the Parliamentary Secretary is taking a very wide scope and that there is considerable danger in giving the definition the scope which is proposed.  It is provided here that an addict means a person who, by reason of his addiction to drugs or intoxicants, is either dangerous to himself or others, or incapable of the management of his affairs, or of ordinary proper conduct. While we all sympathise with the desire of the Parliamentary Secretary to make the power given here as effective as possible, we will have to jib at the suggestion that a person can be treated as a lunatic, if, in the opinion of certain people, he is not capable of ordinary proper conduct, unless we can be told what is meant by the expression &ldquo;ordinary proper conduct&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There will be differences of opinion, even among experts, as to what is meant, or what should, in fact, constitute ordinary proper conduct, and the section as it stands is quite strong and goes far enough without the insertion of these words.  I want to move that they be deleted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the House not to accept this amendment.  Senator Duffy adverts to the possibility of a person who is incapable of what is termed &ldquo;ordinary proper conduct&rdquo; being treated as a lunatic.  I should like to take advantage of this discussion to remind him that under this Bill nobody will be treated as a lunatic. We are dealing now with persons of unsound mind or suffering from mental disorders, and we have, I hope, got <Col N="2333" /> away from the previous conception of lunacy and all that it implies.</P>
      <P>We look, as I stated on the Second Reading, on mental disorders or derangements as having no particular stigma attached to them.  We look upon them as being much in the same category as diseases of the body.  I do not think it is necessary to label them, but I should be sorry to find the House reverting to the old conception, which lasted far too long in this country, regarding disorders of the mind. Although this definition of addict is new to the House, and to our statutory code, it is very old in its origin. On this whole question of the inclusion of addicts in the scope of the Bill, a tremendous lot could be said.  We could have very interesting debates on the question of addiction to drugs, and perhaps more particularly addiction to alcohol, and as to how far that constitutes a contributing factor to subsequent mental disorder.  In fact, five years ago, I raised this matter in the Department.  Many members of the House will, in their own experience, have come across such cases where people have been addicted to drugs, particularly to alcohol, and where, by reason of the fact that no machinery had been provided for dealing properly with these unfortunate people, tragedies very often occurred.</P>
      <P>I have in my experience and practice met with a considerable number of such cases.  The law relating to inebriates is of no assistance to us in the solution of this particular problem. Under the law relating to inebriates and drunkards, a person has to be convicted a number of times in court, and then the court has the power to commit such people to a term of detention in an institution provided for the purpose. Again, that is the old criminal setting, and it does not deal with the problem in accordance with the present-day approach to it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case with which most of us would be concerned is that which we are trying to provide for in this particular measure&mdash;the type of case which never comes before the court at all. When it reaches the stage that a person is brought into the criminal courts or the ordinary courts, and convicted <Col N="2334" /> of drunkenness a number of times, and sent to an institution because of these convictions, the case has reached a stage where, very possibly, scientific treatment might not have very much chance to produce the best results.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy invites me to define what constitutes &ldquo;proper conduct&rdquo;. Well, I shall not undertake to do that. The House will bear in mind that a person will not be recommended for reception in an institution as a temporary patient under this section unless he is incapable of ordinary proper conduct by reason of his addiction to drugs.  If the Senator has in mind, or if it should be passing through the mind of any member of the House, that there is a possibility of the reception of a person who might occasionally indulge in alcohol, or, let us say, any other drug, that is not the intention of the Bill.  In fact, the section could not apply to such persons.  The point is that their incapacity properly to conduct themselves must be due to their addiction to drugs.  I do not think that it would be possible for anybody to define in this or in any other Act how improper the conduct would be in such a setting, and we must bear in mind that the medical advisers who will make the recommendation will have intimate knowledge of the patient's conduct and habits.  In case he should err&mdash;and medical men can err and sometimes do &mdash;the patient will not be received in the institution until the resident medical superintendent is satisfied that by reason of his addiction to drugs he ought to be detained, either because he constitutes a danger to himself or a danger to others, or is guilty of improper conduct by reason of his addiction to drugs.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose that it is necessary to delay the House on this subject, unless I refer to a definition of inebriates which I find in the report of a commission set up as far back as 1908.  When I raised this matter with the Department some five years ago all my technical and professional advisers were very keen on the idea of trying to make some statutory provision under which people addicted to drugs could be detained for a sufficient period to permit of scientific treatment <Col N="2335" /> and of bringing the craving to an end.  They were all very keen on it, but the trouble was that it was a very difficult matter to cover in law. The result of my raising the point brought to light a very comprehensive report of an inquiry set up in 1908 by Mr. Gladstone.  It is interesting to note that the machinery recommended by that commission for the treatment of addicts bears close resemblance to the machinery we are now providing for the treatment of mental diseases.  A definition was constructed by that commission for the purpose of suggested legislation.  It was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An inebriate is a person who habitually takes or uses any intoxicant or toxic thing, and while under the influence of such thing or things or under the influence of the effects thereof is (a) a danger to himself or others, (b) a cause of harm or serious annoyance to his family or others, (c) incapable of managing himself or his affairs or of ordinary proper conduct.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is a much more far-reaching definition than we have attached to the word &ldquo;addict&rdquo; in the Bill.</P>

      <P>On this section I should also like to draw attention to three matters which would seem to require attention.  I refer to the definition given to the expression &ldquo;joint board&rdquo;. It is on page 11, line 27.  The expression &ldquo;joint board&rdquo; means &ldquo;board appointed jointly in pursuance of Section 15 of this Act&rdquo;.  Later on I find that the expression &ldquo;mental hospital authority&rdquo; is defined as meaning &ldquo;local administrative authority&rdquo; under Section 15 of this Act.  It seems to me that both definitions cannot be <Col N="2336" /> in that section.  I suggest that where the joint board is defined is not in Section 15 but is in Section 16.</P>

On page 10 the expression &ldquo;assistant inspector of a mental hospital&rdquo; is defined.  It is defined again in Section 13 and the same thing occurs in regard to &ldquo;authorised medical officer&rdquo;.  There is a number of cases of that kind.  I do not know whether it makes any difference. In regard to the expression &ldquo;Inspector of the Mental Hospital&rdquo; it is defined on page 11 and again in page 12.  The definitions in both cases do not quite correspond.</P>

      <P>I do not think it right to pass away from this section without drawing attention to the fact that it is providing for the possibility of control of a class of person which, to the knowledge of every Senator, has never been adequately treated.  That <Col N="2337" /> is the person addicted to intoxicating drink.  Everybody has within the sphere of their acquaintance knowledge of people who have ruined themselves mentally and physically by intoxicating drink.  Because of the fact that in the main they belong very often to respectable families, the ordinary process of the law&mdash;that is, being charged in the courts the requisite number of times to permit of their being kept in custody&mdash;has never been invoked.  In practice it is never invoked against that class of person. We are bringing in a measure which may be of great benefit to that class. The person who will be kept in a mental hospital as the result of the passing into law of this section will be deemed by a competent medical officer to be a person who can be treated, and in all probability cured by detention, and even a person who after a bout of drunkenness resumed his normal outlook on life will find that if a medical doctor authorised under this Bill deems him to be an addict, provision is made for his detention until the prospect of a permanent cure is reasonably assured.  I do not want to exaggerate, but this is a very great advance in the treatment of what was undoubtedly an evil, though luckily it may not be an evil of great degree. Certainly it is there, and in this section it is being dealt with in a manner which demands the commendation of all right-thinking people.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), page 13, line 51, before the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; where it occurs the second time to insert the words &ldquo;uncle or uncle-in-law, aunt or aunt-in-law&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary has a particular objection to the inclusion here of the uncle or uncle-in-law, the aunt or aunt-in-law. It relates to the disqualification of certain doctors.  The sub-section provides that a doctor who bears a <Col N="2338" /> certain relationship to the patient may not be called in for any purpose under the Bill.  It will be observed that those who are disqualified include the husband or wife, the father or stepfather, and so on.  What I am endeavouring to do is to bring in those on the other side, that is the in-laws, for the purpose of being disqualified, in the same way for instance that the brother or step-brother is disqualified. The difficulty I have is that, while the brother-in-law or sister-in-law is disqualified, the uncle or uncle-in-law or the aunt or aunt-in-law is not disqualified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the section is sufficiently exclusive, or inclusive if you put it another way, to meet with all normal requirements. This matter was raised in the Dáil and we had a considerable amount of discussion on it.  It just comes to this, that we must draw the line somewhere. We cannot include, and it is unnecessary to include, all possible degrees of relationship.  In fact, I have no great enthusiasm for the exclusion at all, for the reason that under the existing law, and it has operated for a number of years, there was no restriction as regards relationship.  The dispensary doctor was doing something more then than certifying a patient for admission; he was committing the patient as a dangerous lunatic.  As far as the law was concerned, he could commit his own brother.  There was no restriction, and, as far as I am aware, there was no abuse.  It was thought well to put in some exclusions here but I think the section is all right as it is.</P>

      <P>I should be inclined to press this amendment, because from experience I think uncles and aunts are inclined to be very managing people, rather more so than sisters and brothers.  When a case comes before the Chief Justice in which a person is quite properly taken into charge, it is remarkable how often it is the uncle or aunt who is appointed the committee of the person or the committee of the fortune.  They are the people who move in the matter.  I rather think uncles and aunts should <Col N="2339" /> come in here, if the Seanad thinks exclusions are necessary, because experience of life shows that they are the people who very often are inclined to think that the parents are very inefficient and negligent in the treatment of their children, and that they could show them how to do it better. Accordingly, I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that possibly the danger might be anticipated from uncles and aunts just as much as from sisters and brothers.  I do it very tentatively; it is purely a matter for the opinion of the House as to the degree of busy-ness which corresponds to the degree of relationship.</P>

      <P>No.  There is no new principle in it at all.  I think I can now satisfy the Senator in regard to sub-section (2), which provides that the Public Offices Fees Act, 1879, shall not apply.  The Act of 1879 made provision for the collection of fees payable into the Exchequer.  It provided that the collection might be made by means of stamps or in other ways; that the Treasury might make regulations governing the collection, and that the moneys collected after payment of salaries and expenses of collection should be paid into the Exchequer.  It is purely a machinery measure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not feel very strongly about the matter but it seemed to me, on reading sub-section (2), that greater power was conferred on the assistant inspectors than was strictly intended.  The sub-section provides that the Inspector of Mental Hospitals may act by assistants and then goes on to say that the assistant inspector shall have all the powers <Col N="2341" /> for the time being conferred by law on the inspector.  I take it that many powers are conferred on the inspector which will not pass on to the assistant inspector or assistant inspectors.  In other words, the inspector will be the chief officer of the Department and he will remain in that position no matter how much he may be helped by assistants. I take it that what will happen, in practice, is that he will delegate certain of his powers to the assistant inspectors for the purpose of inspection. In the long run, however, he will be personally responsible to the Minister. It seems to me that we will have met the case if we say that the assistant inspector will have all the powers of the inspector which are delegated to him during the time he is acting in that capacity.  However, if the Parliamentary Secretary considers that the provisions are sufficiently explicit, I am satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather think that the nicety of legal construction has escaped Senator Duffy.  Under this section, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals can act by his assistant.  It is the inspector who is acting but he is acting through the medium of an assistant. It is in that setting that we have to consider the section.  If the Senator has in mind the appointment, from time to time, of an inspector for a particular purpose, that is not the intention in this section.  That matter is dealt with in Section 12 (4):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may appoint any of his medical inspectors to act as substitute for the Inspector of Mental Hospitals during any particular period or for any particular purpose and, during that period or for that purpose (as the case may be), the person so appointed shall be regarded as being the Inspector of Mental Hospitals and every reference in this Act to the Inspector of Mental Hospitals shall be construed accordingly.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>In such circumstances, the person appointed as substitute will have the powers of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals while discharging those duties and at no other time.

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 18, lines 48 and 49, to delete the words &ldquo;may with the consent of the Minister, and shall if the Minister so directs&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section deals with the provision of staff residences.  I am not at all sure that the Parliamentary Secretary should sponsor a provision which leaves it to the discretion, in the first instance, of mental hospital authorities whether they will or will not provide accommodation for their staffs.  The provision of such accommodation becomes mandatory only if the Minister orders them to provide it.  There are a number of instances in the Bill where the expression occurs &ldquo;the mental hospital authority may, with the consent of the Minister, and shall, if the Minister so directs&rdquo;.  I think this is one instance where that form of words should not be retained and the purpose of the amendment is to make it perfectly clear that the mental hospital authority must provide and maintain, in connection with any institution administered by them, suitable residences.  I am not attempting to say what would be a suitable residence in relation to any particular institution. That I assume will still be a matter for the committee&mdash;the county council in certain cases and the joint committee in others&mdash;in consultation with the Minister and his officers.  I think so far as the Bill is concerned we should definitely see that the authority responsible for these institutions will maintain suitable buildings and accommodation for the staffs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather surprising, in view of the amount of talk we have had about centralisation of authority, that such an amendment as this should be proposed.  I think it is assuming that mental hospital committees or authorities will not discharge a duty that as far as I know it is their whole inclination to discharge, namely to supply the housing needs of the attendants. The discretion, in the first <Col N="2344" /> instance, that is left to the mental hospital committees is a discretion that is properly left to a local authority composed of popularly elected people. I, in common with a good many Senators here, am reluctant to take any authority that may be given to local bodies under this or similar Bills away from them unless a very clear case can be made for it, or unless actual proof that they will refuse to do something they should do is brought forward.  In this case a discretion is left to the local authority, in the first instance in any case, and the initiation of the matter should be left with them. I think in actual practice mental hospital committees will avail of the power and avail of it to the full.  The section leaves with them some powers that, I think, they should have; and the attempt to impose upon them a direction, before they have actually failed in their duty, is something to which I certainly could not agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to what the last speaker said, I do not think there is any discretion at all left there. The wording in this section follows the wording of every section in connection with local authorities.  You have to empower them to do certain things, and the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; empowers them to do these things, and if they do not do them, the Minister has power to compel them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is, in fact, as explained by Senator O'Dea.  The mental hospital authority is empowered to provide and maintain, in connection with any of its institutions, suitable residential accommodation for members of the staff, but if they fail to do so, the Minister can come in then and give them a direction, upon which they must act.  Senator Duffy suggests that the power of the Minister to direct should be deleted from the section and that it should be made directly obligatory upon the mental hospital committee to make the necessary provision.  I do not think it would work out in just the way the Senator has in mind.  It is not just so simple as that.  For instance, there are members of the staffs of mental hospital authorities who do not reside <Col N="2345" /> on the premises, or for whom it is neither necessary nor desirable that residential accommodation should be provided.  For example, the clerical staff employed by the mental hospital authorities would not ordinarily be accommodated with residences on the premises.  Similarly, married attendants very often live out.  Now, I do not think it would be in the interests of the attendants themselves that they should be compelled to live in residences provided for them by the local authority, nor do I think it would be wise to put a statutory obligation on the local authority, regardless of the circumstances and conditions, to provide residences for each and every person employed by them.</P>
      <P>The machinery of the Bill, I think, will operate satisfactorily to everybody. If a particular class or classes of officers require accommodation, and if the mental hospital authorities fail to provide it, the Minister can then, in the exercise of his judgment, issue a direction.  If, on the other hand, the mental hospital authority in its wisdom decides that certain individual officers or groups of officers ought to reside outside the institution, then clearly they will not be asked to provide residential accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not feel like pressing this very far, but I think there is some misconception involved here.  Senator Hearne, for instance, urged that the amendment should not be accepted because in this case we are dealing with the elected representatives of the people to whom, he suggested, we should leave wide discretion.  We are doing nothing of the kind.  We are dealing with the county manager or the city manager.  It is not a question of the representatives of the people at all; it is an official who will decide this, and, in my view, there must be some sympathy with this.  If there is going to be a direction given in a matter so clear as this, that direction should be given by this House and there should be no discretion given so far as a matter of this kind, the provision of residential accommodation for the staff, is concerned.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary read more into the amendment than is here or than is intended <Col N="2346" /> because, if this amendment were inserted, the section would then read that the mental hospital authority should provide suitable residence or residential accommodation.  That is not an obligation to provide it for everybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary has given any more study to the question I raised on the Second Reading regarding the financial implication of this and the following sections.  We are committing ourselves in this Bill to a very big scheme of curative treatment, at an expenditure of which we had been given no indication.  Frankly, I think the Parliamentary Secretary did not sponsor this plan without having some calculation made as to the cost of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has not given us an idea, roughly, of how much expenditure we have to face so that this scheme may be carried out.  I know that it may be possible to provide funds for the erection of additional buildings, equipment, and so on.  That expenditure might fall into one category, but you have also to consider the cost of maintaining, staffing and running all these institutions.  I have no wish to open <Col N="2347" /> up a discussion on local taxation and rating, although I would be quite entitled to do so if I desired, but I feel that the House and the country ought to get some idea of our commitments under these sections.  Section 43 indicates that the moneys will be raised in the hospital districts by the poor rate.  I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give us some enlightenment, because the House and the country, while anxious for better treatment of mental diseases, will want to know whether it will bear very heavily on the ratepayers of the country.  In the long run, the expenses of administration of the scheme must be borne by the local ratepayers.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the Parliamentary Secretary and the House on this question.  I do not want to hold up the measure, but Senators from the country would like to know what we are being committed to.  On paper, the plan is an excellent one.  It is a plan which we wholeheartedly approve, but, unfortunately, many people, while subscribing to good ideas, like to see the responsibility for carrying them out placed on the shoulders of other people.</P>
    <P>It may well be that local authorities will be alarmed by the financial results of our action to-day, and I would like, therefore, to have some indication of the cost and how the Parliamentary Secretary views the financing of his plan.  We are, I feel, asking local authorities to commit themselves to a great deal&mdash;we may say that we are giving the Parliamentary Secretary a blank cheque.  He has authority to give directions that must be carried out.  If the local authority do not carry out his directions, he can do it himself, but they will pay.  It is not expecting too much that a Minister in charge of a measure of this kind should give us some estimate, even with a margin of £100,000 or greater, to indicate what a grandiose scheme, planned like this, is likely to cost when it is working to the limit of its extent.</P>

      <P>In sub-sections (4) and (5) a provision is made in respect of the methods by which the sum required <Col N="2348" /> under Section 43, will be raised in the case of a county council.  In other words, the proportion of the sum payable to a joint board by each county council concerned will be raised as a county-at-large charge on the poor rate.  No similar provision is inserted regarding the raising of moneys required to be paid by a borough council.  I do not know if it was necessary or not that that should be done.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might dispose of Senator Duffy's point, if I understand it correctly.  In the case of a joint authority, the money will be raised in proportion to the cost of chargeable patients maintained in each institution on behalf of the different counties constituting the joint body. In the case of a borough council, the amount will be raised over the entire borough.  In the case of a county council, the necessary money will be raised by way of a county-at-large charge.  Is that what the Senator had in mind?</P>

      <P>Oh, no.  As regards Senator Baxter's point about the general financial repercussions of bringing this measure into full operation, we had some discussion on the Second Reading&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Senator Baxter appreciates, just as any other Senator, and perhaps better than a number, that it is utterly impossible for me, or for anybody else, to give an estimate of the probable expenditure that may be incurred in bringing this Bill into full operation.  It depends on factors which we cannot estimate&mdash; the number of institutions, the classes and the number of persons suffering from mental diseases in the different <Col N="2349" /> categories.  In so far as our preventtive measures are concerned, to such extent as they are successful, the ultimate cost of the maintenance of our institutions will correspondingly fall, but I cannot predict, and nobody else can, to what extent the preventive measures may be successful.</P>
      <P>We venture to be hopeful.  We have reason for a modified degree of optimism. If we get this Bill into full operation, if we can provide clinics, and get hold of cases in the early stages before any gross disorder of mind occurs, a much less period of detention in a mental hospital, if any at all, would become necessary.  I do not intend to indulge in any prophecies on that score.  I hope that the effect of this Bill after it is fully in operation will be up to our anticipations. Beyond that I cannot go.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a machinery measure. Everybody agrees that it is a good and a necessary machine.  Many Senators have commented upon the fact that our lunacy law is very much out of date, and entirely out of harmony with modern ideas of mental treatment. We are now providing the best machinery that human ingenuity can devise.  If the Bill is to be made fully effective we have to spend money, and we have to ask ourselves&mdash;is it worth while spending money in order to prevent mental disease?  Senator Baxter has anxieties on that score.  I have none.  I believe that the taxpayers will back us in this measure.  I believe that the people will willingly contribute if we can satisfy them that the steps we propose to take are sound and well conceived.  I may be wrong.  I know, particularly in rural districts, that the public representatives and contributing public will not like to see rates having to be raised.  At the same time I feel&mdash;and I have always been in fairly close touch with public feeling on these matters&mdash;that if they think we are lessening some of the social evils that are so prevalent amongst our people they will give us the necessary money.  If they do not give us the necessary money we cannot do the job.</P>

      <P>I have a good deal of <Col N="2350" /> sympathy with what Senator Baxter said.  I agree that whatever is done by this Bill will be well worth the expense. I feel that the local authorities will have to do a great deal.  They will have to erect different hospitals. A great deal of expense will have to be met, and as far as I can see the Bill provides that the local authorities shall erect these institutions.  In this Bill we provide for institutions for inebriates.  There were one or two institutions to which people were sent if convicted of drunkenness for the third time.  Very seldom people qualified for admission to these institutions. It was very hard to get three convictions, particularly, as Senator Hearne said, when they were respectable persons.  The police would see a man home instead of prosecuting a third time.  We are now to have a number of institutions, and I should like to know if it is the intention that these are to be erected by the State rather than by the local authorities. There is also provision in Section 14 whereby the Minister may make regulations for the erection of hospitals. I shall be glad to know if the regulation provides that the expense will be met by the State.  In the previous debate it was mentioned that the capitation grant was only 4/- per week for those in mental hospitals. That amount is entirely out of date, considering the cost of maintaining patients now.  I wonder is it the intention of the Parliamentary Secretary to improve that position, so far as the local authorities are concerned.</P>

      <P>We have the machinery. Who is to determine how many clinics we will have?  Have we got any figures?  Are we to erect clinics without knowing how many people are to be treated?  Do I gather from the Parliamentary Secretary that he does not know until he gets the Bill?  If we are to do a certain amount of this work in the dark I do not know what we are committing ourselves to.  I would not like to believe that the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department will be a party to expending money for the treatment of patients without having some information as to the incidence of the disease and how many there are to be treated.  If there is information on that score we might have some data as to what this is going to cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is so the Parliamentary Secretary has some idea of the cost, and I am trying to get it.  I think we ought to know the worst.  The problem is there to be solved even if it is going <Col N="2352" /> to cost a considerable sum of money It would be better to face that position. When it comes to the question of who is going to pay, it is there the ratepayers are concerned.  Perhaps we would get a bit of a fright if we were told how much the ratepayers will have to pay.  I wish the Parliamentary Secretary would inform us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite recently I heard somebody say that what we get for what we pay is far more important than what we pay for what we get.  It seems to me that that trite saying applies to this very laudable measure before the House now.  I was diffident about saying anything on it, but I have been encouraged by the remarks of Senator Baxter because it seems to me that we all are in hearty accord with the Government in introducing so splendid a measure as this undoubtedly is in its general principles, but I am wondering whether it precludes the possibility that, having got the powers which the Bill seeks to get for the Government, they could be applied to the setting up of national institutions for the treatment of what is really a national calamity.  It might be that in one area the incidence of this mental disturbance would be greater than in another.  It could easily happen that in a poor part of the country there would be more of this disease than in a richer part. Since we have given our whole-hearted support to the general principles underlying this Bill, I think we might urge the Government to go a step further and decide that mental disturbance of any kind is really a national matter, and not one to be dealt with entirely by the local ratepayer.  It might be that it would be better if we were to set up one large institution.  Here, I share with Senator Baxter the view that perhaps it would be well if the House were furnished with some idea of the incidence of mental disturbance in the country.  We do not know whether there are 1,000, 2,000, 5,000 or 20,000 people so afflicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that there are relatively so few people afflicted in this way that they could be housed in one or two or, if you like, three centrally situated institutions, where by reason of their <Col N="2353" /> very size the treatment of the disease itself would be far more skilled and far more concentrated than it could possibly be in a number of widely scattered, small clinics.  This is so important a Bill that I feel the Parliamentary Secretary will not mind even a layman like myself throwing out suggestions of this kind, because the Government's desire is one which is shared by every member of the community who has any interest in his unfortunate fellow-citizens&mdash;to see that this helpless section of the community is given the very best service that this State can afford to give them.  I feel that, by concentration of the kind I have suggested, it might be possible to give far more skilled treatment at a lower cost than might be the case with a number of widely scattered clinics.  I throw out that suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary in the hope that he might find it possible to look into it.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Dea asked whether the institutions to be provided under this Bill will be provided by the State or will be provided by the local authorities.  Senator Summerfield, from a somewhat different angle, raised practically the same question.  From a still further angle, Senator Baxter was interested in the financing of the provision of those institutions.</P>

      <P>That is specific.  I think it is understandable, and I thought I had made it quite clear.  In fact, I thought that any amendment for such a purpose would not be in order at all.  I thought, when the Bill came to the House, it might have been assumed that we could not, in a strictly orderly way, discuss the principles involved between State and local taxation for <Col N="2354" /> the purpose of giving effect to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all right.  I am not reflecting on the Chair at all.  The Chair, as I have previously remarked, is particularly generous in this House. That is quite a good thing.  On a matter such as this, I think it is well that we should not be confined strictly to rules of order.  The matter is very important, and it is better that we should discuss every aspect of it which is agitating the minds of Senators. Senators are aware that, in the very considerable extensions and new provisions which we have in relation to our mental institutions, very generous grants have been given towards the provision of those institutions out of the Hospitals Trust fund.  We all hope that the Hospitals Trust fund will, in the early future, recover itself, and if that fund is able to bear the additional financial burden of assisting in the provision of these institutions the same line of policy that has operated in the past in relation to mental institutions will operate in the future.  Again, we cannot give any firm undertakings on that, because we are not in a position to know what money may be at our disposal in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once again, our old friend the 4/- capitation rate has been raised.  I hope we will not get into a full dress debate on the failure of the State to increase this 4/- grant per head in proportion to the rising cost of maintenance of patients.  If we were to debate that, I would have to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the House that the amount which was provided out of State funds when this 4/- capitation grant was made available would be only a drop in the ocean compared with the amount that is now provided out of State funds for the relief of local rates, but if we have to go into that we will be getting into deep water which is not strictly proper to the Bill.  This 4/- grant out of State funds towards the maintenance of patients in mental institutions was never intended to represent 25 per cent., 40 per cent., 50 per cent., or any other particular percentage of the cost of maintenance <Col N="2355" /> of patients in mental hospitals.  It was intended as an inducement to mental hospital authorities at the time to take those unfortunate people out of gaols and workhouses and make separate provision for them.  It was merely an inducement.  It bore no relationship at all, and never was intended to bear any relationship, to the cost of maintenance of those people in the institutions. On every Bill that I bring before the House which involves increased expenditure, we have our old friend central taxation <i>versus</i> local taxation.  Perhaps it is a good thing, because the last time we debated this matter I converted Senator Duffy.  I believe I now have his support and the support of the Labour Party&mdash;at least that section of the Labour Party to which Senator Duffy belongs&mdash;for local taxation rather than central taxation for the purpose of financing those schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the provision of national institutions, we are, perhaps, at cross purposes. National institutions may be necessary for certain purposes&mdash;for addicts, for instance, as mentioned by Senator O'Dea&mdash;in the sense of one or two institutions serving the geographical area that constitutes the State.  I have not in mind national institutions of the <Col N="2356" /> type which would be built, equipped and maintained by the State.  There is provision within the machinery of the Bill to enable a number of mental hospital authorities to combine for the purpose of providing a particular institution. As regards the question which Senator Baxter has harped back upon again and again, if I have not answered it to his satisfaction it is because I cannot make the matter any clearer.  He brings the question home to himself and the Parliamentary Secretary when he mentions the conditions which might obtain under this Bill in Cavan and Monaghan.  I have no reliable data as to the number of people in Cavan and Monaghan suffering from minor degrees of mental disorder who are not under care and treatment and who ought to be.  There may be quite a number.</P>
      <P>The development which I would like to see in that area, and every area of the State, would be the provision of clinics.  My idea would be that, once a month or so, the resident medical superintendent or deputy-resident medical superintendent or a specially trained member of the medical staff of the mental hospital should visit each of the principal towns in the area and hold a clinic.  I think that there is not a full understanding of what is meant by &ldquo;clinics&rdquo;.  I do not contemplate the erection of residential institutions. Perhaps, I would have been better understood if I had used the word &ldquo;dispensaries&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;clinics&rdquo;. What I mean is that a clinic or dispensary should be held for people suffering from various nervous complaints and, perhaps, from incipient mental disease, that their doctor should say to them: &ldquo;The R.M.S., who is a specialist in that class of work, will be in this town holding a clinic on such a day, and you had better come in and see him; he will understand more about your case than I do.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that way, we would try to put the advice of the specialist and his scientific skill within reach of those people before they would become mentally disordered.  That is the idea behind the Bill.  To get it operated would be difficult, but I do not think that that particular development would be an <Col N="2357" /> expensive development, because we ought to avail of existing dispensaries, health centres and clinics to accommodate this particular clinic once a month or once a week.  A similar idea will have to be brought into operation in the cities and large towns.  In the cities&mdash;particularly in the City of Dublin&mdash;we have another problem which does not exist to anything like the same extent in provincial Ireland. That is the problem of juvenile delinquency. I do not say that we have not the criminal type amongst juveniles; we have.  But we have a considerable proportion of juveniles suffering from psychocic conditions who, if they received proper treatment, would not enter either a jail or a mental hospital.  I should be anxious to bring that service within the reach of that class, particularly in the cities, as soon as possible.  I do not think that these provisions will be very expensive. Senator Baxter and other Senators will, of course, raise questions here for debating purposes and in the hope that they may draw out something which, otherwise, would not be drawn out, but, approaching the problem in a reasonable, commonsense way, it must be clear to everybody that we cannot give firm estimates as to the cost of the full development of the purpose and policy behind this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Summerfield asked for figures.  I can give the House figures regarding the number of persons suffering from mental disorder who are in our district mental hospitals.  I have not figures as to the number of persons who may be similarly detained in private institutions but that number would be comparatively small.  On the 28th February, 1945, the number detained in our mental hospitals was 17,539.  If Senator Summerfield is under the impression that we have a large number of those institutions scattered all over the State, some of them not fully occupied and many of them not wholly staffed, he is under a misapprehension.  Our trouble was that most of our mental hospitals were overcrowded.  Our problem was to provide additional accommodation in existing institutions.  Those figures cannot convey a full picture of the <Col N="2358" /> problem, for the reason that our real problem is not one of the 17,000 persons at present detained in our mental hospitals but of the 17,000 potential patients whom we want to save from entering the hospitals, if we can.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is under a misapprehension in two important respects.  He told us that he had converted me to some view which he holds.  I do not know whether he has or not because I am not sure that I follow his view in this matter. It has been my opinion for a long time that people who are making a claim for large subsidies in relief of rates from central funds are misled, or misleading themselves, as regards the effect of that operation on the general community.</P>
      <P>What I said in this respect I qualified by pointing out that I understood the case made by Senator Baxter, and those who spoke with him, because of the manner in which local rates were levied.  Anybody interested who looks at column 2217 of the Official Debates of April 19, will find that while I recognised that I could not go into the matter in detail, I did point out that the rating system was entirely unjust, and that this injustice gave rise to the claims which are made by Senator Baxter and others.  I do not like to be misrepresented, as suggesting that I am swallowing the case put up by the Parliamentary Secretary, because I am not.</P>

      <P>Going back to the point I raised, while it may not be welcome to the Parliamentary Secretary, I am sure he feels he is quite competent to deal with it.  I have elicited from the Parliamentary Secretary that, apparently, <Col N="2359" /> there is the intention to establish the equivalent of what is to-day recognised as a dispensary and that to this dispensary people who are mentally afflicted, are to be invited.  We are told that the resident medical superintendent can come from the mental hospital to inspect people and that that can be carried on without new buildings of any kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just going to say that I think nothing could be more unhelpful, in the effort to start an effective policy of curative treatment, than to have any of these buildings other than in a remote place.  I ask Senators to imagine the position of people who are troubled with nerves having to go to the local dispensary doctor.  A special day in the week is set aside in a county town when the resident medical superintendent from the adjoining county will attend.  This arrangement is publicised to a certain extent.  A building is provided and into it the people go.  I do not mind what the building is called but these are the conditions under which you will not get people to attend.  That is how it strikes me.  We as a people are sensitive about a great many things, but there is nothing about which we are more sensitive than about a person's state of mind.  It seems to me that I have elicited from the Parliamentary Secretary, that while he thinks we are not committing ourselves to the provision of even subsidiary institutions to any considerable extent, to make this scheme effective we shall be involved in a very considerable cost in the matter of the construction of buildings and the procuring of sites in suitable places.  I think I am justified in the belief that it is going to cost the ratepayers more than the Parliamentary Secretary would like to tell at the moment.</P>

      <P>Oh, no.  I cannot let Senator Baxter away with that statement. I have no desire whatever to minimise the amount that this Bill will eventually cost.  I have said repeatedly that it will cost money, and lots of money, if we are to make this measure effective.  I have not pretended at all that it will not cost money, but I said that a particular aspect&mdash;and I did particularise, and made it very clear to Senator Baxter what I had in mind&mdash; of our policy could, I thought, be brought into operation without involving any serious expenditure.  I did not suggest, and I hope I did not convey to the House the suggestion, that every dispensary in the country is a suitable place for the treatment of mental disease or for any other purpose, because the vast majority of them are not suitable for anything.  One of the first problems&mdash;and again it means expenditure, but we can discuss that on an other occasion&mdash;will be to provide proper health centres, where not only mental disease, but every other disease, can be treated, and where the necessary advice can be afforded to people under proper conditions.  To such an extent as existing institutions will serve our purpose, we shall use them.  To such an extent as they do not serve our purpose, we shall have to turn our minds to the provision of suitable institutions.  Now, the provision of a clinic or the provision of a centre does not entail a very big expenditure. I think Senators' minds are running rather more along the provision of residential institutions than the health centre, or the clinic where advice, mainly advice, is afforded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving that aside for the moment, I do not find myself at all in agreement with Senator Baxter's idea of the provision of special clinics or dispensaries in remote parts of the country where these people, ashamed of their stigma, can steal in.  There is no stigma associated with mental disease, and the sooner we get that into our heads, and get the public to realise it, the more progress we can achieve, and I did hope that the enactment of this Bill would get us out of that atmosphere.  So far from making provision in isolated places where these people could seek and obtain advice <Col N="2361" /> and treatment without anybody seeing them, I think we should head in the other direction&mdash;that of indicating our belief that there is nothing more extraordinary about an ailment of the mind than about any other ailment, and that we believe it can be treated in the same type of institutions as those in which other ailments are treated.  If we could do the same thing with mental disease, even where it reaches the stage when people have to be put under restraint, it would be a good thing.  We are dealing here, however, only with people who have reached the first stage of mental illness, what may be, perhaps, very little more than insomnia.  Mind you, if any of you went without sleep for about two weeks at a stretch, your nerves would get pretty rattled.  Some people would get into a rattled condition of mind without loss of sleep&mdash;even Senators.</P>

I think it is quite a good thing we did, because it cannot be too much discussed.  The one thing I did want to bring home to the House, in contradiction of the impression Senator Baxter conveyed as to my attitude, is that I believe&mdash;I always have believed&mdash;that if the machinery that we provide here, machinery to which so much tribute has been paid, is to become fully effective, it is an absolute certainty that we must spend money and lots of it if we are to get the full effect of the provisions we are now making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to where that money is to come from, we cannot determine it the moment, but the whole machinery of the Bill is constructed on the idea that the local authorities will bear the cost of the maintenance and treatment of persons suffering from mental disorder, that the State subvention will not be increased, and that in so far as the Hospitals Trust.  Funds are available to assist in the provision of the necessary capital for the erection and equipment <Col N="2362" /> of new institutions, the policy of the past will be the policy of the future.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to have to disagree with the Parliamentary Secretary. My disagreement is very largely on the point of the desirability of having dispensaries in populous areas rather than in remote places.  I agree with what Senator Baxter has said.  It is far better for us to be realists as to what we may call the shyness of our people in connection with any form of disease, no matter what it is.  There is a natural tendency to shyness about disease amongst our country people, and it is better for us to realise that. While it is highly desirable for the people to get rid of that feeling, and do what the Parliamentary Secretary wants to have done, and that is to come out in the open and get treatment as early as possible, the fact remains, unfortunately&mdash;and it is unfortunate&mdash;that there is that tendency in the Irish people.  That is the actual fact, and I am afraid it will take a long time and a good deal of publicity and enlightenment to induce our people to get away from that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 27, line 19, to delete the words &ldquo;payments for overtime&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first of the many sections which deals with the superannuation of the staffs of the mental hospital authorities, and the portion of it with which I am concerned in the amendment is somewhat narrow in its compass. It is the definition for the purpose <Col N="2364" /> of part of the Act of the expression &ldquo;salary and wages&rdquo;.  The section provides that the words &ldquo;salary and wages&rdquo; include emoluments but do not include payments for overtime, travelling expenses, or any allowances paid to cover the cost of office accommodation or clerical assistance.  I think it will be obvious, generally, that the inclusion of the item &ldquo;payments for overtime&rdquo; is hardly relevant to the other payments mentioned here. Travelling expenses are something given to a person to cover out-of-pocket expenses when he is away from his home station doing the work of the mental hospital authorities; or if he is paid an allowance to cover the cost of an office, he is paid it merely as an agent, handing it out later to somebody else for the use of the office. In other words, it means nothing to him personally whether they are travelling expenses or not.  He derives no personal advantage from them, but the payments received by an employee or officer of a mental hospital authority in respect of overtime are in a completely different category.  Some people may be required at certain periods in the year to work many hours overtime.  They are paid for it, and it is a common feature that if they are required to work overtime in that way, they derive a certain regular income from that source year after year.  It seems to me reasonable, therefore, that the payments which they earn by way of overtime should be taken into account when you are calculating their salaries, wages or emoluments for the purpose of determining the rate of pension on retirement.</P>
    <P>I think that the question I am raising now was raised in the Dáil. Unfortunately, I did not have an opportunity of following up the views which the Parliamentary Secretary expressed in regard to the matter, but I can hardly imagine that he is personally opposed to having payments for overtime calculated&mdash;at any rate, if they are frequent and regular payments&mdash;when determining the emoluments, salary and income of an officer who is about to retire on pension.  My proposal, therefore, is that that reference <Col N="2365" /> to payments of overtime should be deleted.  The section will then read that the words &ldquo;salary and wages&rdquo; would include emoluments, but would not include travelling expenses, or any allowance paid to cover the cost of officers' accommodation or clerical assistance, and I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to accept the proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in favour of the principle embodied in this amendment. In case Senators have any doubt as to the effect of it, it means in simple language, that if the amendment is accepted, payments received for overtime will be included in the calculation of income for pension purposes.  That is the principle that is involved.  Now, the rejection of the amendment does not mean that in future there will be no overtime under any circumstances. It means that if there is overtime payment in respect of overtime, it will not be counted as income for pension purposes. I think that is a sound principle. I do not think that we ought to make the working of overtime an attractive proposition.  Personally, I am not in favour of the principle of overtime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I grant that in certain circumstances, it may be necessary on occasion to ask employees to work overtime for short periods, but it should not be permitted to operate to the point of depriving other persons of normal employment, and that is the danger if we make it attractive as a pensionable emolument. If we make it attractive, there will be a tendency to develop overtime rather than to give the additional employment that would become available if overtime were not worked.  I suggest that a person who periodically gets overtime is already in a privileged position compared with the man who gets only a weekly wage.  He is paid full time and a quarter for his overtime, but his fellow-worker who is not so privileged has to do with his ordinary wages, without extra emoluments. If this principle were embodied in the Bill, I rather think that in the later years of service there would be a definite tendency to encourage overtime so as to influence superannuation. <Col N="2366" /> In my judgment that would be a bad development, and I think it ought to be discouraged.  While we do not put any prohibition on overtime, we ought to discourage it in the sense that it will not be calculable for pension purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary in what he has said regarding the discouragement of overtime?  I am not advocating that anyone should work overtime.  I do not want it to be attractive, but, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, it is attractive.  It is attractive because people whose incomes are low are able to increase them substantially by working overtime. But may I put this to the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;the person who will work overtime is not the boss in this case?  He does not decide whether or not he will work overtime&mdash; somebody else decides that.  Let us take the case of a clerk&mdash;I do not mean the clerk in charge, but a junior officer. He is ordered to get books, documents, files and vouchers ready for audit or some other purpose&mdash;let us say coming to stocktaking.  The clerk must get all this work done.  There may be a limit to the time in which he must get it done, and there are two courses open to the people in charge, either to get in additional assistance or instruct the existing staff to do the job in overtime.</P>
      <P>I do not want to encourage the employment of staff on overtime.  I would prefer that additional staff would be employed, but the case is often made that work will not be done efficiently unless it is done by people already on the job.  The only case I make in respect of this is that where it is a practice of a mental hospital authority to employ some of their staff on overtime, and to pay them overtime, that sum earned under the heading of overtime should be calculated, the same as any other emolument, in determining the rate of the pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the staff, whether they are getting old or not, are not going to decide the issue whether or not they will work overtime.  That will be decided by other people, the resident medical superintendent, the manager, or whoever else is in charge.  It cannot be decided by the clerk who is <Col N="2367" /> going to work the overtime, and I may say that, in many instances, the staff would readily forgo the privilege of working overtime if they had a free choice in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>If the amendment is being pressed, I would like to say something about it.  I must say frankly that I regard it as a most revolutionary proposal.  It is far more than an amendment to a clause in a particular Bill.  It brings up something which challenges the whole fabric of our association with one another.  Very speedily it would create a precedent, and it would be sought to introduce it into every activity in which overtime is worked at any particular time.  I think it is a proposal to which the House must give very serious consideration. I feel that the question whether overtime is to be regarded as part of the normal wage or salary is a revolutionary idea and I hope that the House will reject the amendment without difficulty.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(6) Notwithstanding anything contained in the first sub-section of this section a clergyman of any recognised denomination who has given continuous whole or part-time service as chaplain to a mental hospital shall be eligible for a superannuation allowance on the same terms as were in operation before the year 1926.</P>
      <P>This amendment in one respect cannot be regarded as a small matter in that it involves very big principles.  In the first place it merely seeks to restore the situation that existed before 1926 with regard to pensions for chaplains. The salaries paid to chaplains who, as a rule, if not universally, are only part-time servants of such institutions, are trifling.  I think they are of the order of £50 a year, and in view of the work that they do in consideration of these salaries their services cannot be regarded as anything but extremely important.  I am assured on the highest authority that the responsible medical officers regard the services of chaplains of the various Churches as an essential element in the treatment and cure of mental diseases.  One of the reasons I urge the restoration of the pensionable rights of the chaplain is the recognition by the State of the important services that such people are rendering and that they may be expected to render to an even greater extent in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this amendment is enacted, as I hope it will be, the number of persons affected is likely to be extremely small and the cost a mere trifle.  At any given moment it is extremely unlikely that more than one or two of each of the Churches' chaplains would be drawing a pension.  A pension of two-thirds of £50 a year is not a very great amount.  The amendment is framed in such a way as to apply to <Col N="2369" /> the clergy of all Churches.  In common sense and in equity the rule should be the same for clergy in all Churches, but in practice there are certain differences in the operation of the rule as it existed before 1926 to which I should perhaps draw the attention of the House.  The clergy of the Church of Ireland when they secure parochial standing often remain in the same parish for 20, 30 or more years.  They have what I may call fixity of tenure. Consequently it happens quite frequently, at all events in a number of cases, that the clergy who happen to be in a parish where there happens to be a mental hospital may have served 20 or 30 years as chaplain before they reach the age of retirement.  In the case of the clergy of the Church of the majority of the people I believe that the senior curate is generally appointed chaplain.  The clergy of that Church as the House knows are much more mobile than the clergy of the Protestant Church and are liable to be sent from one parish to another.  In actual practice it has happened in the past that the chaplains of the Church of the majority rarely serve for more than five or ten years.  Possibly in the next parish to which they are moved there is no mental hospital to which the clergyman can be appointed.  That is a mere accident of the case.  If I may have the temerity, and I think Senators will agree that I have more temerity than most, I would suggest that the Church of the majority&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator had better keep from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that it is worth the consideration of the dignitaries of that Church, that a priest who has shown the talent and capacity for giving valuable service in a mental hospital, even if he has to be moved from such a centre should be moved to some other centre where there is a mental hospital, and where he can continue to develop his special knowledge and capacity for rendering special services to the mentally deficient.  It may be argued that a person who spends only a year or two as a chaplain to a mental hospital is a mere amateur, and has no experience of mental patients, and consequently that his services are <Col N="2370" /> not as important as they would be if he spent longer and acquired greater experience.</P>
      <P>If that be so, then the case for recognising the longer service of those who do, in fact, remain 25 years or more as a chaplain in a mental hospital is rather stronger, and my argument for so arranging matters that the clergy of the Church of the majority should be encouraged to specialise is strengthened.  This is a matter I should like the House to consider with all possible sympathy.  Even if, in the first instance, in actual fact it affects the clergy of the Protestant Church it should be borne in mind that under the changing conditions it can include the clergy of every Church.  The really important point I want the House to recognise is the status of chaplains.  As a matter of fact, the chaplaincy to a mental home can be no sinecure for any clergyman.  I imagine an important part of the work, apart from holding religious services on regular occasions, must be the maintaining of correspondence with the families of patients, and reporting to families how patients are getting on, and so on.  All that kind of thing can be extremely worrying, and involve a good deal of time.  I think their salaries are well earned, and that they have a very strong claim to be recognised in equity, and to recognition for the part they play in the therapy of mental disease.  They should be regarded as eligible for pension rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise from listening to Senator Joseph Johnston how difficult it is to satisfy all sections of the House.  A short while ago we were urged to advance, and advance very rapidly.  Reference was made to conditions that existed 80 years ago among certain sections of the community, and it was suggested that we should forget about that now.  Senator Johnston wants us to go back to a policy that was pursued 19 years ago. I am disposed to keep moving forward. I am not impressed by the strength of the case that has been made by Senator Johnston.  In fact, if I were to express my personal reaction I would <Col N="2371" /> have to confess that I have no enthusiasm for the payment of salaries to part-time chaplains.  However, that does not arise in the Bill.  The principle in the Bill of paying salaries to chaplains has already been adopted by the Dáil, and is clearly acceptable to the House.  I merely express a personal reaction.  Now, we naturally have to examine how such a proposal would affect the persons concerned if this amendment were carried.</P>
      <P>If this amendment were inserted, all part-time chaplains employed in mental hospitals would become pensionable. The House may not realise that in many of our mental hospitals we have quite a number of chaplains.  We have a Catholic chaplain&mdash;sometimes whole-time, dependent on the size of the institution; sometimes part-time.  His responsibility, by reason of the proportion of the Catholic community in the State, would, of course, extend to the greater number of the people whose spiritual needs have to be looked after Then we have various other communities&mdash;Protestant, Methodist, Presbyterian. We have as many as three or four chaplains in some institutions.  All those people would become pensionable. In fact, in some of those institutions a period of months or perhaps even years might elapse before we would have any patient of the particular denomination.  The chaplain is retained in order that his services may be available if and when patients of that particular denomination come to be accommodated in the institution. That is, I think, a very proper provision. But when we are presented with the proposition that not only should they be paid a salary, notwithstanding the fact that they have little or no duties&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not advocate that they should be paid a salary for doing no work whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but that they should as well become pensionable officers, it is a proposition which I cannot recommend to the House.  Let us take a number of institutions as an example.  In Ardee, the number of inmates of all denominations other than Catholic, is <Col N="2372" /> eight.  In Castlebar, the number of Protestant inmates is three.  We have a Protestant chaplain there.  In Cork, the number of Presbyterian inmates is two.  We have a Presbyterian chaplain there.  In Ennis the number of Protestant inmates is three.  We have a Protestant chaplain there.  In Monaghan the number of Methodist inmates is one, and we have a Methodist chaplain there.  In Mullingar, the number of Presbyterian inmates is four, and we have a Presbyterian chaplain there.

      <P>I am dealing with the amendment.  The amendment refers to chaplains&mdash;part-time chaplains and whole-time chaplains.  I am explaining to the House how that amendment would operate if it were incorporated in the Bill.  Regarding the Senator's suggestion to the Catholic ecclesiastical authorities as to how they might more properly discharge their ecclesiastical functions, I can only say that I will not undertake to transmit the Senator's recommendation to them.</P>

      <P>I can understand perfectly the view of the Parliamentary Secretary that a person who has a vocation should perform that vocation without reward or emolument. That is a view of great antiquity, and of a very respectable authority.  But, dealing with the matter governmentally, it has never been accepted.  In fact, people are paid for the work they do.  In the vocational schools, where religious education is given, clergymen of all denominations are paid for it.  If you accept the principle that a clergyman of any denomination who gives time and thought and services to a mental hospital should be paid in proportion to the amount of time he devotes to those services, I cannot see any reason why the payment should not be extended in the same manner as in all other professions by recognising that when he has grown old in his job, and is no longer physically capable of <Col N="2373" /> carrying on, there should be some reward for his services in addition to the payment made to him when he was in his heyday.  The Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out that in a number of those institutions you may have very few patients of a particular denomination for whom it is necessary or customary to provide a chaplain.  I notice that his selection was one which was apparently haphazard but was, in fact, very careful.  He went through the mental institutions, found out the particular denomination which in the institution he was dealing with was represented by the smallest number of people, and said: &ldquo;We have a chaplain there&rdquo; for that denomination. Judging by the smile on the face of the Parliamentary Secretary, I think he rather agrees that that was the method adopted.</P>

      <P>I can understand that that is a perfectly laudable point of view.  But, when you are dealing with the matter from the State point of view, you adopt the principle that a person who does a job of work is entitled to be paid for it.  I can quite understand the Parliamentary Secretary's suggestion that, in a place where the work is small, the remuneration should be small, and that the pension which is subsequently given should also be correspondingly small as it is based on the remuneration.  I am not suggesting that a chaplain whose flock is represented by one person, whom he would probably have to visit only twice in the year, should get the same payment as a chaplain whose flock ran into hundreds, and whose visiting of those patients might occupy a great deal of what would otherwise be his leisure, but I am saying that the State recognises the principle that a person should be paid for the work he does while he is doing it.  This Bill <Col N="2374" /> should not exclude the corresponding obligation that he should receive some small amount by way of competence when he is no longer able to work. The payment of superannuation allowances or gratuities to part-time officers has been perfectly well recognised by the State and by the local Government authorities in a number of different types of occupations.  It was the custom up to 1926 as far as chaplains are concerned, and I am interested to find that the Parliamentary Secretary regards it as a retrograde step to continue to recognise people's services not only by payment at the time but by a subsequent small pension. If it is a retrograde step in the case of chaplains, why is it not a retrograde step in any other case?  I am under the impression&mdash;I speak subject to correction by the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;that the tendency in legislation has been to provide more gratuities and more pensions than there were in 1926.  If that is so, why should it be a retrograde step that the system of giving a pension, which prevailed in 1926, should be included in this Bill?  I press this upon the House. If a man has done his work faithfully and well, if he has done his best to give spiritual consolation and mental healing to the inmates who belong to his flock, surely when he has grown old the State will not be so parsimonious as not to give some recognition of his services, measured upon the scale which they thought fit to pay during the time when he was active?</P>

      <P>In spite of the Parliamentary Secretary's statistics, I should like to assure the House that, in proportion to our numbers, we Protestants are just as mad as you are.  These figures were carefully chosen to suggest that there was hardly any insanity at all amongst certain sects of Protestants. The fact is that there are very few Methodists or Protestants in Cork or Ennis neighbourhood, but if the Parliamentary Secretary had been completely frank with the House, he would have mentioned that in at least one institution of which I am aware there are 40 Church of Ireland patients.  The chaplain of that institution has a serious amount of work to do in looking <Col N="2375" /> after that flock of 40 mentally-afflicted persons.  I am not suggesting that a pension should be given for having been merely nominally chaplain of an almost non-existent flock in a mental hospital.  I think that the payment both of salary and pension should be related to the number of persons who had to be looked after over a certain number of years, and that it should be based, to some extent, on capitation. I am prepared to modify the terms of my amendment in such a way as to make it obvious that the number of persons concerned will be the material factor in determining both the amount of the salary and the pension.  The principle is one which I must insist on the House regarding seriously.  The services rendered by the clergy of all denominations are an essential element in the treatment of mental disease. They are not nominal services by any means, as the Parliamentary Secretary, by an unfortunate slip of the tongue, said on the last occasion we discussed this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, there is one question on which I should like an answer from the Parliamentary Secretary.  He has defined, in the beginning of the section, the words &ldquo;officer&rdquo; and &ldquo;servant&rdquo;.  He has defined the word &ldquo;officer&rdquo; by confining it to a particular type of officer, and he has defined the word &ldquo;servant&rdquo; by confining it to a particular type of servant.  There is nothing in the section to show what the broad word &ldquo;officer&rdquo; means or what the broad word &ldquo;servant&rdquo; means.  This has been a very old problem in local government law, and I am under the impression that some recent Acts made an attempt to clear up what has always been <Col N="2376" /> a difficulty to lawyers.  It is quite clear that you do not get very far with a definition of the term &ldquo;officer&rdquo; by saying that it means an officer of a limited type because you are still left to find out what are the characteristics of the officer as opposed to the servant.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is relying on any recent legislation, I suggest that the matter might be cleared up by stating that the word &ldquo;officer&rdquo; has the same meaning as it has in such and such an Act, or he could adopt the expedient, which, I think, he adopted before, of saying that, in cases of doubt, the Minister may decide whether a person is an officer or a servant.  That is not an expedient I favour, but it may be better than leaving it undefined, because I think that you may have a good deal of trouble in deciding who is an &ldquo;officer&rdquo; and who is a &ldquo;servant&rdquo;. You may have cases coming to the courts and we do not want to make money out of arguing again a subject which gave us a lot of trouble previously.</P>

      <P>I do not think that there is any real ground for apprehension. &ldquo;Officer&rdquo; and &ldquo;servant&rdquo; are comprehensive terms, intended to embrace all employees.  Who is an &ldquo;officer&rdquo; and who is a &ldquo;servant&rdquo; does not really matter, so far as I understand. The original intention was that we would use only the term &ldquo;officer&rdquo;. Then, we thought that a point might be made that every employee was not an &ldquo;officer&rdquo;.  In order to make sure that the terms of the Bill would apply to every employee, we put in the words &ldquo;officer&rdquo; and &ldquo;servant&rdquo;.  The purpose of that was to ensure that everybody employed by a mental hospital authority would be regarded either as an &ldquo;officer&rdquo; or a &ldquo;servant&rdquo;.  Who is an &ldquo;officer&rdquo; or who is a &ldquo;servant&rdquo; is not material.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (5) of this section makes provision to enable people not covered by the Act of 1909 to come in under this measure, subject to certain conditions.  The important point is that they must pay up arrears of contributions and that is the aspect of the sub-section to which I should like to refer.  It seems to me that, if a person coming in now under the Act of 1909, after ten or 15 years, is required to pay, at the rate of 3 per cent. of his wages, the whole of the arrears of contributions, a very substantial sum will be involved.  So far as I can gather, it would be necessary to pay that sum at once.  I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should make provision to enable the lump sum concerned to be paid in instalments over a period of a year or two or three years, depending on the amount involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The necessity for this provision arose from the fact that, under this Bill, certain types of officers and servants will become pensionable who are not pensionable under the 1909 Act.  If they are to enjoy pension rights, they must pay their contributions. I think that I moved the amendment in the other House to cover this matter.  It would be a hardship if contributions over a period of years were to be demanded at one particular time.  Provision governing <Col N="2378" /> that will be found in Section 85 (1), which states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Part of this Act, an officer or servant of a mental hospital authority shall contribute in each year for the purposes of this Part of this Act 3 per cent of his salary or wages for that year and the amount of such contribution shall from time to time be deducted from his salary or wages.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That does not say that the money must be deducted at any particular time.  There will be discretion as to the spread-over which may be necessary to facilitate such person in paying contributions.</P>
