      <P>I move the amendment on the Order Paper:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2 to add to Section 3 a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) If there shall be any inconsistency between the immediately preceding sub-section and Section 65 of the Principal Act, the latter section shall prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is obvious.  Section 5 and Section 65 were in the original Act of 1926.  It is well established that, where any inconsistency arises between two Acts, the later enactment is to prevail.  In this Bill, the wording is, as the Minister correctly states, taken from Section 5 of the original Act.  I suggest that, if there was any inconsistency in the original Act, Section 5 would have been covered by Section 65. Now, the 1945 Act will be a later one and it might, perhaps, be taken to govern Section 65.  It is not really in connection with that question of legal interpretation that I raise this matter. I appreciate the Minister's point that he has taken the wording from the 1926 Act but, in all legislation recently, I think that there has been too much variation in phraseology where the same thing was intended.  In various powers given to Ministers, we have different wording.  If we look at the <Col N="348" /> records, we shall see that if a Minister wants to grant a butter, meat or potato export licence, the word used is &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  If you pass on to aerodromes, you will find in the Act that &ldquo;the Minister may if he is satisfied that a licence is expedient...&rdquo;.  In the case of a lorry licence &ldquo;the Minister may, if he considers it desirable in the special circumstances...&rdquo; while in the case of cement &ldquo;the Minister may in his discretion...&rdquo;.  All those variations make it extraordinarily difficult to interpret Acts of the Oireachtas.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that he should, as soon as possible, ensure that standard phraseology be used&mdash;that, wherever possible, the same phraseology be used in all similar circumstances.  I fully appreciate that, in this case, he was merely adopting the wording of the 1926 Act but, if the 1926 Act was not precisely consistent, we should not enact another inconsistency.  So far as the amendment itself is concerned, it is purely a question of legal interpretation.  If the Minister tells me that the Parliamentary draftsman is quite satisfied that Section 65 will still remain the paramount section, I shall be satisfied.</P>

      <P>As regards the drafting, we are in the hands of the Parliamentary draftsman. I had the same opinion as Senator Sweetman, but we have to accept the phraseology used by the Parliamentary draftsman.  I am not re-enacting a provision which was unsatisfactory.  I am quite satisfied that the section in the original Act covered all the points which it was intended to cover.  This amendment is not necessary.  There is a clear distinction between the powers of the Minister and the powers of the President of the High Court in Section 3.  What the Minister has to do with are matters of general administration, including such things as control of staff, appointments, applications for sick leave and so on, and anything dealing with the judicial end is reserved in the same section to the President of the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 3 there is only one officer referred to.  That is the officer who <Col N="349" /> may take the place of the present Master, whereas in Section 65 the President of the High Court has control over officers of the courts, not one officer alone but any officer.  This amendment is unnecessary, and, therefore, I am not inclined to accept it.  There is no danger.  There has never been any question in the past when it came to the functions of the Master and President of the High Court in their respective powers regarding the management of the staff.  No occasion for disagreement has ever arisen and it is not likely to arise.  I considered the matter very carefully and I am satisfied that is the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister a question?  The question which he has answered is not the question I put to him.  I asked him if there should be inconsistencies between the two sections, which one would prevail?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The different spheres are so clear that there is no likelihood of it.  It is not likely to arise.  I do not think that the judges want to be bothered with questions of promotion, recruitment of staff, holidays or anything of that kind.  Even if they did, these are matters for the Minister for Finance.  In matters of finance, the Minister for Finance must have control, but when it comes to ordering staffs to do work in the courts, that will be done by the President of the High Court, and I cannot conceive of any difficulty arising.  It has never arisen.  I am not prepared to discuss a hypothetical case like that suggested, because I am perfectly satisfied it will not arise when the two spheres are so different.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>What is known as the National Stud Farm at Tully, County Kildare, was established as such in 1916.  At that time Col.  Hall-Walker, afterwards Lord Wavertree, made a present of the stud, that is the stock both here and in England, to the Government which was the British Government of the time, the Government of the United Kingdom, on condition that the Government would purchase Lord Wavertree's interest in the property.</P>
      <P>That agreement was carried out and the property with the stock passed over to the British Government.  In 1922, the Government here made a claim for the national stud as part of this territory, but the British Government would not recognise the claim at that time on the grounds that the stud was a gift to the United Kingdom and that under the deed of gift it could not be alienated.  Discussions went on from time to time from that on, and eventually it came to this that the British Government were prepared to agree that the buildings and the lands were ours but they claimed at the time that the bloodstock were theirs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1935, we again raised the matter that all belonged to us as from the 6th December, 1921, and if there were gifts made in the meantime, these gifts should also come to our side.  Discussions took place between representatives of the two Governments, and it was agreed that negotiations be continued <Col N="351" /> by correspondence but these also broke down, and in 1943, we finally made the agreement.  It was to the effect that the Government of the United Kingdom on December 31st, 1943, would hand over possession of Tully lands and buildings.  The Irish Government would take over, as from that date, the farm equipment and livestock&mdash;there was no bloodstock.  The bloodstock had been removed, and the Government of the United Kingdom would pay an agreed sum for user in lieu of rent on the Tully premises as from 6th December, 1922.</P>
    <P>In actual cost it worked out that they owed us £28,260, and we owed £6,960 for stock and so on, so we got a net £21,300, as well as whatever livestock and farm equipment were there. The intention is that when the transfer date under the Bill approaches, we give the staff who are there a week's notice as our employees, the employees of the Department of Agriculture, because the place has been worked by the Department since 1st January, 1944, and then the company will take over all the existing staff or such of them as the company will have work for, which I have no doubt will be the whole lot, and then the company are enabled by the memorandum of association to make provision for any terms they may wish to lay down for their employees with regard to retiring gratuities, pensions, etc.</P>
    <P>It will also be possible for the company under these articles to provide for the services of the staff under the Department since January 1st, 1944, as being services with the company in case they are drawing up any scheme of superannuation or gratuities.  The farm there comprises an area of 871 statute acres, and when it was taken over on January 1st, 1944, it was being run by the Department of Agriculture in England, and we, having taken it over on January 1st, without any bloodstock, have run it as an ordinary farm since, making the necessary arrangements with regard to repairing paddocks and buildings, so that it can be used as a stud farm as soon as the company is set up.</P>
    <P>A great deal of useful work has been done during this last year and a half <Col N="352" /> and it should be possible at any time now to commence with the purchase of bloodstock.  The Government decided at an early date that Tully farm should be used as a stud farm, as a national stud.  Various suggestions have been made to the Government in the Press and elsewhere for using this farm for many other purposes, but we think on the whole it should be used as a national stud.  Secondly, it was recommended by me to the Government that it could not be properly run by the Department directly, and the Government agreed with that.</P>
    <P>Preparations were made for the legislation which is before the Seanad in this Bill.  A public liability company will be formed to take possession of the national stud farm which will be financed by State funds.  Senators will have noticed in reading the Bill that this company will also be empowered to carry out special schemes for improvement of thoroughbred horse breeding.  Senators will note that the Department has schemes for horse breeding which apply only to the breeding of hunters and heavy horses. We consider that these schemes are satisfactory but we have never had any schemes for the breeding of high-class blood horses, and up to this that matter has been left entirely to private enterprise.  I am satisfied that there is no necessity for a State owned stud farm as far as the present scheme of the Department are concerned.  Under the present scheme we have to purchase animals and sell them to owners throughout the country for the breeding of hunters.  Having gone into this matter fully I think we should continue that.  We would never breed that type of hunter on a special farm.  They are better when they have finished their racing careers because what we are looking for there is confirmation.  We do not need any pedigree horses with sprinting blood in them or anything of that kind.  We would continue the schemes under the Department and the national stud will be a separate matter altogether.  It will be for the improvement of the very high-class blood horses.  It can be made, I believe, the medium of valuable assistance and encouragement for the <Col N="353" /> thoroughbred breeding industry generally.  It will ensure that the services of the best class sires will be made available to small breeders.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil, great concern was expressed for the small breeder.  There is a good deal in the point, because the big breeder is able one way or another to get the services of the best stallions, but the small breeder is not in a position to do so at the moment. To that extent I think the national stud should favour the small breeder. I do not think we should undertake at all that it should be exclusively for the small breeder.  Certainly it should give him preference.  A big fee is charged for the services of high-class sires, and with most of them standing outside the country, it is made almost impossible for the small breeders to get a good stallion even though they have sometimes very good mares.  If the mares were mated with the best stallions they would, in all probability &mdash;although nobody can be dogmatic, I believe, about breeding&mdash;produce from time to time very good animals. There is a feeling that the number of really good horses in this country is going down.  That would be a great misfortune, because we have a good name all over the world for horse breeding.  If, during the coming years, we fail and our numbers go down markedly, it might mean that buyers who are coming here at present might cease to come as it would not be worth their while.  I think we are justified in making every attempt to keep the horse-breeding industry going as we did in the past.  These are the main reasons for the establishment of a national stud here.</P>
    <P>The next point that arises is how the stud should be run.  It was suggested by various people to me that it is not the sort of business that a Government can interfere with, because it is a business proposition and therefore we should sell or lease the national stud farm to a private individual or a number of private individuals or a syndicate of breeders. I do not favour that because I do not think we would have achieved anything if we did.  The object is to help <Col N="354" /> breeders in general, not a syndicate. I do not think Senators will advocate that we should have done that and therefore I do not want to labour the point too much.  The next point is that if it is not a company run by private enterprise then it appears to me only two alternatives are left, that it should be run directly by the Department of Agriculture or through a company as proposed in this Bill.  The British Government did run it directly. They appointed a director and he usually had a committee of management of either two or three to advise him, but they were only advisers.  As far as I can gather the whole concern was run by the Department of Agriculture, much as we run one of our agricultural farms.  I do not think that that would be satisfactory in our case.  It was a very small item in the activities of the Department of Agriculture in London, but I am afraid that here it would be a rather big thing and would not succeed as well as if it were divorced from the Department, at least by interposing a company. I do not know anything about horse breeding.  As far as breeding of thoroughbreds or high-class racing horses is concerned the technical members of my Department admit to me that they do not know anything about it.  Their training would help them to be as good experts as there are in any other country in the breeding of cattle, pigs, sheep, or even ordinary horses.</P>
    <P>The breeding of race horses is a very technical and very speculative business, and for that reason is not at all a suitable one for the Department of Agriculture to engage in.  The people doing so must have a great deal of knowledge and be in a position to take a chance as it were.  A Government Department is not inclined to take a chance that this particular management must take.  It would be admitted by all who know something about horses that if the proposed company buys say six hunters and one turns out well, they will have succeeded as well as nearly any other stud management.  That is the sort of thing that a Department can hardly do.  A Department can hardly take a chance, <Col N="355" /> On the whole I think it better to have a company set up.  It will of course be a non-profit sharing company, that is the men on the board will not benefit by any profits that are made.  They will only hold one share out of the 250,000.  It is possible under the Bill to pay them directors' fees, but they cannot profit from any profits made by the company.  Any such profits will go to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Broad policy will be laid down by the Minister for Agriculture.  In defining broad policy, I should like Senators to realise that I would not, for instance, be in a position to interfere with the mating of mares.  The company will have to decide that for themselves. They will have to decide what mares are best for the particular stallion concerned, and matters of that kind, but if I were to say to them, for instance, that I thought they should provide stallions at certain centres outside the Tully Stud, that it would be very convenient for breeders in the West to have a stallion standing there for the season rather than expect Western owners to send brood mares to the Curragh, or if I were to say that I thought that they had some horses to spare and that they could sell some of these stallions outright to certain owners at reduced prices&mdash;these are the things I mean by broad policy.  I would be able to direct policy in that way but not to interfere with the day-to-day working&mdash;to say the particular stallion that they should buy, what they should pay for him, or the particular mares which they should select for nomination.  That would be a matter for the company and the manager. There might be a scheme for the leasing of stallions.  There will necessarily be, as time goes on, a scheme for the leasing of young horses during their racing period.  I do not think it would be advisable for the stud company to race these horses themselves.  I have no idea of what the system will be but they will have to adopt some system of leasing young horses for their racing career.  They will have an option on them so that when their racing career is finished they can claim them for stud purposes.  There may be other schemes. I mention some only for the purpose <Col N="356" /> of distinguishing broad policy, in which the Minister would direct the company, from day-to-day working.  We do not direct such companies really.  In most cases we call in the directors and discuss matters with them.  If we see that they have no strong objection to our suggestions, we say that it might be as well to go ahead with a scheme of that kind.</P>
    <P>The general framework of the Bill is the same as that of some other Acts which have already passed the Oireachtas, such as the Industrial Alcohol Act and the Sugar Manufacturing Act.  The principal features of the Bill are: a provision enabling the Minister for Agriculture to procure the formation and registration under the Companies Acts, 1908 to 1924, of a company to be known as the Irish National Stud Company, Limited, whose principal object will be to take leases and licences of the national stud farm and carry on the business of stud farming.  The Bill vests the property in the Minister for Agriculture and he will in turn make leases or licences of the property to the company.  Then there are arrangements for financing the company.  The company will have a capital of £250,000 which will be subscribed by the Minister for Finance.  All the shares will be held by or in trust for the Minister.  The company will have power, as well, to borrow a certain amount of money with the consent of the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture.  They will have power to borrow certain sums, not exceeding £100,000 or not exceeding the amount of the capital not called up.</P>
    <P>There are other smaller items with regard to the buying of land, etc., and then the matter which I mentioned already with regard to the specific schemes which the company might be asked to undertake.  There was one matter about which, I was asked and I might anticipate some Senator, who may raise it again.  I was asked whether it was necessary to provide in the Bill for the acceptance of donations or bequests of bloodstock from private persons or gifts, grants or loans from the Racing Board.  It is not necessary to put such a provision <Col N="357" /> in the Bill.  Suitable provisions will be put into the memorandum of association of the company so that if they are asked to accept gifts of that kind they will not have to refuse; they will be able to accept them.  I would recommend the Seanad to agree to the Second Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Though this House is not elected on a geographical basis, nevertheless it is very obvious that when something comes before the Seanad that affects our own home area, we take a more than particular interest in that scheme, the more so when it affects a matter such as the breeding of bloodstock.  I think it will be admitted by everyone without question that from the earliest times the love of horses has been engendered in each and every one of us in this country.  From the earliest times, right through the 16th and the 17th century, when the export of our horses was first noted, and when the Irish horse was known under the name of &ldquo;The Hobby,&rdquo; down to the present time, anyone going back over the list of winners of major races, particularly going back over the list of winners of the Grand National, will find that instead of its being a record of English races, it is much more a record of Irish breeding.  For that reason, therefore, it gives me very great pleasure to welcome the proposal to set up again a stud at Tully belonging to the nation.  It is a step in the right direction.  It is a step which I am extremely glad the Minister has taken, instead, perhaps, of yielding to such representations as may have been made to him by other people, that the farm and the lands there should be used for purposes other than the breeding of thoroughbred bloodstock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill, in dealing with the manner in which that stud will be operated, there are, I am afraid, some things which cause me some concern, some things with which I feel the Minister should have dealt somewhat differently.  I feel in the first place that he should have given us a little more information as to what he meant by a national stud.  He did, of course, tell us that he hoped that the stud would assist the small breeder, and that he <Col N="358" /> was not yielding to representations made to him that it should be leased to one person or a group or syndicate of persons for private profit.  On that last decision he is very much to be congratulated.  I did think, however, that he would tell us more as to what he meant by a national stud&mdash;not that I expected him to bring in the New Oxford Dictionary, or the Dictionary of Turf Terms, if such there be.</P>
    <P>A national stud means a stud owned by the State, and I should have liked the Minister to have given us an indication, more on the lines of the broad policy on which it will be operated. National studs in other countries have been operated along two very different lines.  It is true to say that so far as the British national stud is concerned it was operated very much more along the lines of a private person owning a stud, whereas in the French model the national stud there is operated as a stud that has to be truly national in the real sense of the term, and has to be utilised, not from the point of view at all of the reputation of the stud as such, nor, of course, of the profits of the stud as such, but from the point of view, and solely from the point of view, of improving and assisting bloodstock throughout the country as a whole.  I think, quite frankly, that the Minister has that French model in his mind, but I should have preferred that he should have stated so in no uncertain terms.</P>
    <P>I am a little worried as to whether that is so under the provisions of Section 23, which provide that dividends and so forth shall be paid to the Minister.  That may only mean that the company may have to pay some fair interest rate on the money advanced, and that it is not expected to pay profits in the ordinary sense of the term, but what I want to impress on the Minister above all else is that those moneys must be provided, and that though the Minister for Finance may say that the moneys so provided must bring back some small return, the aim of the stud and the policy under which it is going to be run, must never, if it is going to be a success, be looked upon from the angle of dividend and profit returns.  If it is going to be looked upon from that angle, if it is <Col N="359" /> going to be looked upon from any angle other than that of helping bloodstock breeding as a whole in the country, it will not achieve the success which we believe it should achieve.  It will not be the success we hope unless it is going to be a question merely of interesting and helping breeders of bloodstock in the country&mdash;be they large or small.</P>
    <P>It is admitted everywhere that the horse, more than any other animal, is one which is susceptible to climate and to environment, and it is an absolutely accepted fact amongst breeders and owners of thoroughbred bloodstock in every part of the world that the British Isles have the complete monopoly of bloodstock breeding, and that no matter where the stock are taken to from the British Isles, once they have been in another country for a particular length of time, they lose their inherent characteristics and become, so to speak, acclimatised to that other country in a particular way that worsens their condition.  Bearing that in mind, and bearing in mind the fact of the position in which the British bloodstock owners and breeders find themselves after the war, it can easily be seen that we have here a chance of a monopoly second to none that has ever been open to us; that we have here the most perfect chance now of ensuring that not only our name and reputation as breeders of bloodstock will be assured in the future, but that we have in the bloodstock industry a perfect chance of getting whatever form of foreign or hard currency&mdash;or whatever else we like to call it&mdash;that we may require in various other countries, outside the sterling area, in order that we may import the goods which we may require.  Bloodstock is going to be one of our most valuable assets in that bargaining match in the near future, and, therefore, I would suggest that it is absolutely essential that we should ensure that, so far as the country as a whole is concerned, everything possible is done to make certain that not merely the produce of the national stud, but, in addition to the produce of the national stud, the produce of breeders throughout the whole country is assisted, in quality particularly, <Col N="360" /> with a view to getting us that bargaining power.</P>
    <P>I came cross a further proof of the fact that we were in such a peculiarly advantageous position when I was reading an American annual journal, known as <i>The Thoroughbred Record.</i> I found there an authoritative article written by a man named Moss, who, I understand, is one of the leading experts on American bloodstock, and I shall just give one small quotation from his article, which was this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No country in the world is better suited than Ireland for breeding and raising horses, and no people more intelligent in breeding horses than the Irish.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We must remember that the bloodstock industry in this country has a tremendous place in our economic scheme. I have not been able to get figures since 1935, but I do find that in 1935 8½ per cent of our male population over the age of 15 years were dependent on the horse-breeding industry, and I find that there were 2,000 farmers keeping one mare or more, and that was in addition to the 3,000 people depending on racing, as apart from breeding.  It can easily be seen, therefore, from that the vast importance of the Bill that is now before the House.  I would have thought, too, that in dealing with the broad policy of the national stud, or of the company that is going to operate the national stud, the Minister would have made some reference to the commission of inquiry on which, I think, two members of this House sat.  That commission, in one of the parts of its report, reported that even in 1935, although there was no diminution in the number of thoroughbreds here, there was a distinct falling off in the standard. They reported, too, that in order to command higher prices, to improve the standard of mares, and to maintain the reputation of the Irish horse, and particularly of the Irish yearlings, thoroughbreds must be sired by horses whose racing and stud careers would give promise that their stock would be successful on the Turf, and they recommended at that time that at least three first-class stallions should be purchased, and that those stallions should <Col N="361" /> be utilised towards improving our bloodstock here.  They further recommended at that time that seven stallions, of a slightly lower class, should also be bought so that they, too, would be available for the same purpose.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister refer to the fact that it might be desirable to locate the stallions sometimes, during the season, away from the national stud, because it would appear that in that suggestion of his he had in mind the paragraph in the commission's report which read as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The commission has considered the question of location and is of the opinion that all such horses should be located at a central stud during the off season.  During the season the three first-class horses should still remain at the central stud, and the seven second-class horses should be distributed at suitable centres throughout the country, returning to the central stud on its conclusion&mdash; a system which has been successfully adopted in France.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I do not expect the Minister to tie himself to whether we are going to have one, two, three or more first-class horses, nor whether we are going to come down to the numbers of first-class sires that were suggested in the report, but I do suggest to the Minister that before the Bill passes through this House he should take the House into his confidence and tell us whether he accepts the report of that commission as indicative of the broad lines of policy on which he proposes to operate.</P>
    <P>The comment, too, might be made that this Bill is overdue, and that the Minister shall I say, has, in fact, missed the boat.  I am afraid that to a large extent that is true, and were it not for the fact that I went all over the Tully Stud since the Bill was before the other House I would have expressed myself rather forcibly on that question.  Having been over the stud I cannot press that point of view very strongly on the Minister so far as Tully is concerned, because it is the regrettable fact, from a personal inspection of the premises, that it is perfectly clear that when the Minister took them over one and a half <Col N="362" /> years ago they were not in the state of repair which would have been satisfactory to operate a first-class stud. Whether it would not be possible for the Minister to have set up his organisation at an earlier date, in order that he might purchase bloodstock and, having done so, put that bloodstock perhaps elsewhere while Tully was being put in order, is another matter.  To be perfectly fair it is easy to be wise after the event. Certainly he could not have got bloodstock and put it in Tully until the repairs of which he spoke had been put in hand, and put in hand fairly successfully, as I must frankly admit after having been over the premises.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that I am afraid it is going to be extremely difficult now for the company to buy stallions of the type that the Minister possibly has in mind, certainly of the type that the commission reported on, because they are not available for sale.  That type of stallion is largely held now by syndicates of breeders, who will not part with them, and it may be, no matter how much we wish to purchase sires, that we would not be able to get them for a considerable time.  I am not saying that on the question of cost.  I am leaving out the question of cost altogether.  It may not be possible to get sires and in consequence it may be necessary to wait until suitable young horses have been bred at the stud, and have, through their racing career, shown that they were satisfactory, and the material to make suitable and successful sires.  It may be, therefore, that the day when that particular part of the commission's report can be put into operation may be some distance ahead, but I ask the Minister to inform us if it is his intention to operate that part of the scheme as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Government property is subject to the ordinary regulations that apply to every other person's property throughout the State so far as compulsory tillage is concerned.  Whether it is or not I urge on the Minister the necessity at the earliest moment to make certain that a progressive policy is adopted so far as compulsory tillage <Col N="363" /> and the laying down of grassland for stud farm purposes are concerned.  It has been calculated by most breeders of bloodstock that a ratio of about 30 cattle to one mare is about the proper one for land, to ensure that it will not become horse-sick within a period.  It has already been accepted at the other side of the Channel that it is essential for mares and their foals, as they go on to yearlings, to get good grassland; that there must be plenty of grass feeding over which they can range, as it is that grass feeding which, more than any feeding of dry food, which ensures and builds up their bone.  That is not a subject on which I can speak with any personal authority.  I know nothing about it, but I have taken the greatest trouble to try to ascertain the position from those who have made a success of breeding satisfactory and successful thoroughbred yearlings and in consequence succeeded in obtaining good prices, and whose progeny won good races.  That is their view and I must bow, as I think the Minister will, to their view as experts.  It is a highly technical matter for which we must go to highly technical expert.</P>
    <P>I earnestly ask the Minister not only in connection with the national stud, but in connection with bloodstock breeding, that a more loose policy in regard to compulsory tillage would be adopted as far as the stud farms are concerned.  The stocks of stud farms, as far as my information goes, are tied to the 1939 figures; they are tied to the number of mares that they had on their land in 1939.  It is difficult to find out exactly what acreage is permitted by the Department in making an allowance, but I ask that that question to be taken into account by the Minister, so far as possible.  In consequence, it will assist very much, perhaps even more than the national stud, in ensuring that we have suitable stock coming on here.</P>
    <P>There is another point that these technical experts tell me is only secondary in importance to that of range, so far as foals and yearlings are concerned, and that is change.  I know it is a fact that the Italian <Col N="364" /> breeder, Signor Tesip, has had outstanding success in Italy, for the reason that in order to get change he had three places where his stock was sent periodically, one in northern Italy, one in mid-Italy and one in southern Italy.  There has been a suggestion in England that they should do the same thing.  I suggest to the Minister that he should adopt the same thing here, so as to ensure that at Tully and elsewhere we would have another stud farm as a change, but part and parcel of our national stud.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I do not like some of the machinery for operating this farm.  I shall not take up and throw at the head of the Minister chunks of the report of the Vocational Organisation Commission.  I did that before on the Minerals Bill in respect of another Minister and it had some unfortunate results.  So far as this Bill is concerned, it is not the fact that it is a company which is to operate the farm to which I object but rather that the company is to operate it in what I might describe as a loose manner. However, those are matters of detail which the Minister and I will have a few words about when the Bill reaches Committee Stage.  It is the absence of regulations by virtue of which nominations to stallions will be made and so forth that I take objection to in the machinery of the Bill.  May I again impress upon the Minister that this is, as he himself said, a highly technical matter.  Only highly technical experts really appreciate the niceties of breeding. I might say that there is almost an instinct for right breeding&mdash;that it is not merely a matter of knowledge. Therefore, when the Minister comes to nominate the board of this company, I appeal to him to nominate persons who have had success in the past as breeders and who have shown by their success that they have what I may call &ldquo;instinct&rdquo; in the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, so far as I could take down his words, that employees would be given a week's notice by the State and that, thereafter, such employees as the company will have work for will be taken over by the new company. I have no doubt that all the employees will be taken over.  I read <Col N="365" /> the Minister's speech in the other House on the Second Stage with the greatest care.  Taking into account what he has just now said, I myself have no doubt that the company will take over the whole staff.  I fully appreciate that the State, as such, must terminate the employment of the staff, and I appreciate also the legal implications which make it impossible for the Minister to put such an undertaking as he has given, in the Bill. Reading the Minister's speech in the other House, I do not think that there could have been any doubt in the matter.  Therefore, to say the least, it was undesirable and mean that any person should have indicated to the staff that there was any doubt about their continued employment.  That suggestion was, unfortunately, made and I ask the Minister, in even more uncompromising language, to undertake&mdash;in the most specific terms&mdash;that the company will take over the whole staff in the ordinary way and that, if they continue to be satisfactory, they will be retained.  If they do not continue to be satisfactory, they themselves cannot expect&mdash;and do not expect&mdash;to be retained.  Having regard to the very mean method which was adopted of sowing doubt and dissatisfaction in the minds of these men and their families, an undertaking such as I suggest would come well from the Minister.  I am quite satisfied that that would express only what is in his own mind.  I want to be perfectly clear that I am not suggesting that the Minister said anything to the contrary but, having regard to the suggestions made elsewhere by other persons, I should like to stress the matter.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister also to tell us&mdash;he was asked this in the other House and said he would look into it &mdash;whether it will be possible for the new company, within the terms of the Bill, to keep up the Japanese gardens. These gardens were very famous even outside the country, and it would be very desirable that they should be kept up as a show place.  It is also desirable that they should keep up to date the unique display in the riding school, which showed a record from <Col N="366" /> the very beginning of every horse bred at Tully, which subsequently won.</P>
    <P>That record was kept from the time of Colonel Hall Walker, who established the stud.  That record is completely unique and would impress a stranger who might visit the place and furnish proof, if proof were required, that in Tully we have the soil which is so necessary for the production of good livestock.  We all know that we have a mild climate but that record proved beyond question that the grass and soil of Tully had been a success in the past&mdash;a success which I sincerely hope, and which everybody connected with the thoroughbred industry hopes, will be continued and even excelled in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>My reasons for intervening in the debate are, like those of Senator Sweetman, mainly geographical. But there is some difference in our general outlook.  While Senator Sweetman very properly looks forward to the production of great racehorses, my outlook on behalf of the small farmers in my part of the country is concerned with the pious hope which, I am sure, will be implemented, that the breeding of the country horse will be improved.  There is no doubt, from what I know of my county, that that type of horse has somewhat deteriorated over the past decade or so. We had a very fine hunter type that might be raised by the ordinary farmer. The production of racehorses is the luxury of the few, but the production of a good class hunting horse or mare may be undertaken by any ordinary farmer.  That is the type of horse to which I refer.  We had a type in County Clare&mdash;I am sure the same could be said of every other county&mdash; known as the Irish draught horse&mdash;a good class animal with a dash of blood. It was said of him that he was suitable for harness on Sunday, for hunting on Monday and for agricultural work on the other days of the week.  That was a very good and useful animal.  When he came to five or six years of age, having been worked for a few years, there was a fairly good market for him and a remunerative price&mdash;from £50 to £80.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> That breed of horse has practically died out in my part of the country, and it is very much to be regretted, because it was more or less the backbone of the ordinary breeding farmer, and I hope the Minister will see to it that the class is revived as soon as possible. Recently I asked a breeder and farmer whose family have been in the business for generations, to what he attributed what you might call the downfall of this fine type of animal.  He said that he believed, and most of his friends believed, that it was caused by the introduction of foreign sorts of animals, such as the Clydesdale, the Shire and the Suffolk, breeds entirely foreign to our part of the country.</P>
    <P>There were no suitable mares to mate with these sires, so they were mated with the ordinary mare with the result that the breeders only got mongrel progeny.  I asked him how it was that there was a market for these animals and what was the object of it.  In reply, he deprecated the animals as working animals.  He said that the old Irish draught mare would work two of them off their legs in one day.  Nevertheless, buyers came down from the North and bought them as yearlings, or year and a half olds, and in that way they got a market, but they were never up to the standard of the old Irish horse or mare, one of which was equal to two of them in a day.</P>
    <P>That is the class most suitable to our part of the country, and incidentally it may interest somebody to know that he produced a Grand National winner, Shannon Lass, out of that class. She was bred and reared on the very farm on which is now situated the Shannon Airport.  The runways of the airport now pass through the farm. The other mare; Lady Hillen II, was bred nearby.  It is quite possible that by producing a good class type of hunter you may get a valuable racehorse of the steeplechase type.  Of course, the Minister has good reasons for introducing good horses, but this man of great experience and his friends said he concurred with the reorganisation of the Tully Stud and added that the Minister would be doing a great day's work if <Col N="368" /> he entirely withdrew those stallions from the country altogether because they are not suitable for our soil, climate or breed.  They have nothing in common with the Irish horse or mare.  Those who are in a position to know, contend the Minister for Agriculture would do a good service by eliminating them from the country altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>As the nominee of the Irish Bloodstock Breeders' and Horse-owners' Association, I rise to support the Bill, and I would like to congratulate the Minister on having produced this Bill in what, I regard, at any rate, as the shortest possible time. Senator Sweetman, who in his speech, I must say, was very reasonable and helpful and displayed considerable industry, said he thought the Minister may have missed the bus, and that the Bill came too late, but again, I can assure Senator Sweetman&mdash;I think he is in fact a member of the association himself, but in case he is not&mdash;over the past ten to 12 years, at every annual meeting of the association, the possibility of regaining the national stud or re-establishing a national stud was never overlooked, and, on every possible occasion, the Minister was urged by the association to do whatever he could to bring about the reestablishment of the national stud.  In the Bill before us, he has done that. As has been pointed out by Senator Sweetman, and also by Senator Honan, it is very desirable that the small owners should be helped, as far as it is possible to help them through this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the other House, I noticed that a considerable number of references was made along those lines.  I feel quite sure that the Minister will not overlook that aspect of the situation, and that every effort will be made to help the small breeders throughout the country.  Heretofore, the small breeder was at a considerable disadvantage, and when I say the small breeder, I do not mean what is generally regarded as the small breeder, the man with four or five or more mares.  I have in mind the man with one or two mares, the man who spends hours and hours of study on horse breeding every night, <Col N="369" /> and I think if we go back on the records we would find in a great many cases that the outstanding Irish horses were produced by that particular type of man.</P>
    <P>I know myself, with a small experience of the country, that it is nothing unusual to find a group of people sitting around the fire in any of the districts where horse breeding is regarded as a definite industry, night after night, studying not so much what is regarded as form, but the pedigree likely to produce the best type of horse.  As I say, I believe the Minister has done a good job, and I was amazed to hear him criticised in the other House by people who should have known the struggle he must have had, along with the officers of his Department, to bring about the present situation. It has been suggested, particularly in the other House, that this was the wrong type of organisation, and that the national stud should be run by the Department of Agriculture. I am quite satisfied that if the Minister brought forward a scheme to run the national stud as a section of his Department, the very same people would stand up and say he was doing something which was heading for disaster.</P>
    <P>If it were run by a Government Department, it would lack the different interest and experience necessary if this project is to be made the success we hope it will be.  I am not suggesting that the Minister's Department has not some of the greatest men in the country, men who have made a life study of the breeding of horses, but, on this particular type of work, a better type of man can be found, a man who has himself been keenly interested for, if you like, the greater part of his life in the breeding of horses, and who is, at the same time, sufficient of an Irishman to throw his weight into a job of this kind and make it a success.</P>
    <P>I am sure several people in this House are of opinion that people connected with the steeplechasing breeding industry are of a type which would not be bothered with flat racing, but from my experience of the industry I can tell them it is not so.  Everyone <Col N="370" /> connected with the horse-breeding industry, no matter what side of it, is interested in its welfare from a national point of view.  I know men who would spend every night of the year, and every day of the year if they could afford it, trying to make the stud a success.  I have no doubt whatever that the Minister will be able to find a sufficient number of suitable men who can be relied upon to do the job properly and who will not be open to criticism from any section of the community. Senator Honan referred to the winning of the National by a horse bred in Clare.  I feel sure that many other Senators could make similar claims.  Senator Sweetman might say that all the winning horses were bred in Kildare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid none of us would be right; they were bred in County Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not argue about it at any rate.  The fact is, as Senator Sweetman pointed out, that the most of the records of the Grand National, which is supposed to be the greatest race of this time in the world, are really a history of Irish horses. Reading the history which was produced by the Bloodstock and Horse Breeders' Association I observed that in 20 to 40 years 15 Grand Nationals were won by Irish bred horses.  One was won by the American horse, Battleship, and four by English horses.  I think that is a record it would be very hard to beat.  I believe that in the selection of the Board to run this national stud the Minister should keep in mind that over and above the breeding of what you might call sprinters or flat-race horses we should have regard to the breeding of the steeplechase horse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I might say so, in recent years there was an indication that the breeding of steeplechasers had been falling off, and it is harder to-day to find what you might call the makings of a good chaser than it has been for 30 or 40 years.  That is increasingly impossible in view of the fact that that particular type of horse is scarcer in Europe, and even in America, than <Col N="371" /> it ever was before.  The horse-breeding industry has got a very definite rap. A lot of people who were in the industry before the war have found themselves practically even without a foundation stock.  I believe that this is a very important side of the horse-breeding industry which should not be lost sight of in the setting up of the board and in the subsequent running of the establishment itself.</P>
    <P>I daresay the Minister would reply to that by saying that in fact it would be a matter of policy, but in the laying of the foundations things of this kind, to my mind, should not be lost sight of.  I was particularly gratified to hear Senator Sweetman complimenting a member of the Horse Breeding Commission some years ago.  I happened to be a member of that commission, and I feel that a lot of good work was done at that time.  That was in 1935, I think, and in that time we advocated a system of what you might call boarding-out stallions.  To my mind, that is the best system by which the small breeder can be catered for, because though he may have a very good mare, when he comes to putting down hard cash to send the mare 120 or 150 miles to the stallion, he has to consider his purse.  The result in many cases is that though his board of directors, as you may call the farmers sitting around the fireside and discussing the pedigree, may decide that the right mare is in County Meath, the farmer happens to be down in West Cork. They finally try to persuade themselves that the grandsire of some horse situated locally was a very good horse, and they think the only alternative to leaving the mare barren is to send her to the local horse.</P>
    <P>That is a disastrous system.  It is a situation that can be remedied by the kind of system that may be called boarding-out stallions.  In that way stallions could be sent to areas in which they are scarce.  It was suggested by some people that it would be possible to distribute the existing stallions.  Anybody who knows anything about the matter knows that that is not possible.  There are areas within 30 or 40 miles of Dublin where you <Col N="372" /> would find ten or 20 of the best sires in the country, all doing excellent business.  They cannot be interfered with.  The only thing I can say is the heartiest congratulations to the people who got hold of these horses, and may they never be without a good horse. The horse-breeding industry is certainly one of the greatest industries, if not, in fact, the greatest in the country.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out, it is the life stream of agriculture in this country. While at times we have produced wonderful cattle, and even now have a considerable name as breeders of cattle in various foreign countries, I think we will all admit that the one thing that stands out as regards our agricultural industry, is its production of high-class thoroughbred horses. What there is in the soil it is hard to say, but whatever it is the fact stands out that since the days of the hobbyhorses that Senator Sweetman referred to, we have kept breeding and exporting horses, exporting, naturally, the best horses.</P>
    <P>The best horses were generally sold in the Dublin sales or at Doncaster. Notwithstanding that, we have continued to produce the best horses. With our own going away and becoming acclimatised in foreign countries, and the race deteriorating there, we can come along breeding from the Tully if you like and beat the best horses of any other country.  The fact that we could do that makes the establishment of this stud a very important item in the history of this country. I believe that everything possible should be done for it and I can assure the Minister that he has the blessing of practically every man in the country who has at heart the interest of the horse-breeding industry.  Even the sending of horses to the best sire in the country may not always be the best thing to-day.</P>
    <P>As we all know, some of our best sires have in recent years been sold for export.  Some have gone to England, some to America, India and various other countries, so that it may be necessary, very desirable, and well worth while, if it were not for the fact that pounds, shillings and pence <Col N="373" /> have to be taken into consideration, to send a certain type across the Channel to a really good sire.  That procedure can be avoided if we get the right type of sire here in the national stud.  Senator Sweetman is pessimistic as to the possibility of doing that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it is going to be very difficult, but as Senator Sweetman has pointed out people now in possession of what we might call the top-notchers, just refuse to ask a price. I know of several good sires that people have attempted to buy, and they were turned down without being asked a price.  It will not be easy to get them in the next 12 months.  I believe we must realise that with the best will in the world it will be a very difficult job to get the right sires.  We all know that at a recent sale in England the price for the service alone of one sire was £4,600.  That would give a fair idea of the sort of price that might be asked for the sire.</P>
      <P>Another reason I suppose why the stud could not have been started before now, or why foundation stock has not been bought, was because of the state of the place.  I am very glad to see that Senator Sweetman took sufficient interest in it to walk the farm on Sunday last but I am sorry that he got one of the greatest wettings in his life. It is a pity that more people would not inspect the national stud and other things of that kind which are being set up under Government control or direction. When this stud farm is more in what I might call &ldquo;apple pie&rdquo; order, it would be a good thing if, at least, members of both Houses were invited to see the work in progress, so that they can appreciate the difficulties facing the people entrusted with the running of the farm.  The same thing applies to various other developments such as the Turf Board and the Sugar Board.</P>

At least one member of the board should be representative of that type of breed, a man who would, if you like, keep that end up. But I am not suggesting that a man who is interested in flat racing would not be interested in the breeding of steeplechasers, but there are a good many cases where men will not bother, when they go to a race meeting, to watch the steeplechasers.  In other cases men will go to see steeplechasers and will not look at the flat racers. We can boast of the pedigrees of some of the most famous steeplechasers in the world, and horses which will go down in history as flat race winners. On the steeplechasing side our record is as good as that on the flat.  We can point to steeplechasing blood string the best flat racers in the country.  Look at the famous horse Ben Battle which sired Bendigo and Ambuss II which won the Grand National Steeplechase.</P>
      <P>We have the same argument all down the line to Prince Regent, one of the greatest chasers of all time.  We should all do what we can to make this national stud a success, and I can assure the Minister that so far as the bloodstock breeders and horse owners association and the bloodstock breeders are concerned, he will get a very welcome reception if he comes to our next meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the same qualifications as Senator Quirke to <Col N="375" /> discuss this Bill, but listening to what was said by those who have taken part in the discussion the impression entered my mind that there is a certain amount of confusion as to what is intended by the Bill and what the Minister hopes to achieve.  When I listened to Senator Honan making a case for the small breeder and the small farmer, I had in my mind some of the small-holders of the West of Ireland who have ten or 15 or 20 acres of land and I was wondering where they fitted into this picture of the national stud, but I gathered from Senator Quirke that a small breeder is a totally different thing, a man with five or six mares or probably in certain cases only one or two mares.</P>
      <P>That seems a long step especially when you bear in mind that these are thoroughbred mares, from a small farmer in the counties of Clare, Galway or Mayo, which Senator Horan referred to.  Senator Quirke mentioned something about fees.  He first talked about the cost of transport, the cost of transporting a mare from West Cork. I don't know how much that would cost&mdash;probably £10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>But when the mare reached the stud, the service fee might be more than £4,000 according to what we heard.  A figure mentioned a few minutes ago was £4,600.  I wonder how many of Senator Honan's farmers in Clare would be able to indulge in many luxuries at £4,600 a time.  Let us get clear on this.  Whatever Senator Honan may say to satisfy his own mind, this is a luxury business.  It is not a small farmer's business or even a medium-sized farmer's business.  It is the luxury business that Senator Sweetman and Senator Quirke so thoroughly enjoy and in which they are so much at home.  I think that the first thing we ought to get in mind is that we are dealing with a luxury trade.  I am not disparaging it on that account.  I think luxury trades are essential.  Some people think we have not nearly enough of them.  I have heard of many projects in contemplation to induce people with plenty of money to spend it on luxuries.</P>

      <P>I must plead guilty that I do not know much about racing, backing horses or breeding horses.  I am endeavouring to suggest to the Minister, who must be a higher authority on that subject that, so long as that Bill is under consideration it is necessary to clear up certain points which seem to have misled, shall I say, some of the Senators including myself.  Then Senator Sweetman disturbed me very much when he started making a plea for the Japanese Gardens in County Kildare.</P>

      <P>Senator Sweetman will be in trouble with some of his colleagues if I know their mentality on these subjects. I do not know whether these gardens are small gardens or whether they cost much.  When we come to administer the scheme set out in the Bill, I rather detect a conflict of views between Senator Sweetman and Senator Quirke.  Senator Quirke is entirely in favour of the proposal in the <Col N="377" /> Bill, which appears to me to be the establishment of a company financed by the State but responsible only to the Minister.  I think Senator Sweetman has some doubt about that, and I gathered from the course of the discussion that the Minister and Senator Quirke are of one mind, that it is utterly impossible for the Department of Agriculture to administer a business of this kind, but it has not been difficult for the British Department of Agriculture to do that.</P>

      <P>I do not know.  I wonder whether that is the explanation.  I am prepared to be told that the explanation is that it was run by the State, but that argument cannot be used in relation to the Post Office.  The Post Office seems to be pretty well administered by the State.  I do not know why the Department of Agriculture should be less competent than the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a recollection of the telephone when it was under private ownership.  Senator Quirke apparently considers that you will get five or six people to become directors of this company and that they will be patriots devoting their whole time to running this organisation, but you cannot find one patriot in the whole country who would act as manager for the Department of Agriculture.  That is the argument.  If the Department of Agriculture said: &ldquo;We are taking over this stud and we are going to run it but we are going to get someone who will manage the job in an efficient manner,&rdquo; I think one of the five patriots would probably be willing to take the job.  There would be this distinction, that when the manager was running the stud for the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="378" /> somebody at some stage might raise a question in this House or in the other House as to how the public money was being expended.  I think that if the truth has to be confessed the Minister must say that the real reason for the setting up of the company rather than running the stud himself is to avoid public discussion as to the manner in which the stud is run.  This follows a pattern.  I am drawing attention to this fact because I think the Minister yesterday in another instance indicated a departure from the practice, which has grown up, in relation to the Labourers Bill.  You may remember that I drew attention to the fact that he was divesting himself of the power to determine certain things under that Bill.  In other words, there was a breaking with the practice which has been recognised by the State as Government policy for ten or 12 years, that is to say, the Ministers take away the power of the courts to define certain legislative matters.  From the fact that the Minister broke with that tradition it seems to me that personally he dislikes some of these traditions.</P>
      <P>I am suggesting that the policy set out in this Bill of establishing a quasi-private company of the kind that was denounced by the Vocational Commission is not the Minister's policy but is forced upon him by the Department of Finance.  It is the policy of the Department of Finance and it is not necessarily in accordance with the views of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have a long string of these concerns in respect of which large sums of public money have been voted, and over which there is no control by the Legislature.  If any member of this House asks a Deputy of Dáil Eireann to put down a question as to what is being done by the organisation financed by the State he will be told in the big office downstairs that the question cannot be put on the Order Paper, because the Minister is not responsible. That would apply to the Sugar Company, the hydro-electrification concern.  It applies to the Cement Company, to the Transport Company, to shipping, butter production, industrial alcohol, mining.  I am not raising <Col N="379" /> this as a new issue.  I have raised it in respect of mining and transport, the two measures that came before this House during the period I have been here.  We are setting up this kind of concern, and handing over to a few individuals, whose names are not divulged to us until the Bill has gone through, the administration of large sums of money, and we are divesting ourselves of all responsibility as to how the concern is administered and how the money is spent.</P>
    <P>Some of the people concerned in some of these companies appeared before the Commission on Vocational Organisation and were asked questions which they refused to answer.  For instance, I put a question to the Governor of the Central Bank.  I asked him where our Irish notes were printed.  He refused to answer.  I could have told him, because I had seen the invoices coming from London.  I knew they were printed in London, but before the Central Bank was established they were printed by the Bank of Ireland in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>And very well printed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bank of Ireland was employing men in Dublin to print those notes, but once the Central Bank came along they must be printed in London.  We asked the official concerned the names of the printers, he refused to tell, saying it was not to be divulged.  I am drawing attention to what is being done under this Bill. It is a matter of vital concern to every person here irrespective of the side of the House on which he sits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You are authorising the establishment of a company, and once the Bill is passed, it deprives you of any further right to inquire what is being done.  If on occasion here, a very rare occasion, an endeavour is made to put down a motion regarding the national stud at County Kildare, the Cathaoirleach or the Leas-Chathaoirleach or whoever is responsible at the time, will tell you: &ldquo;That motion cannot go on the Order Paper because there is no Minister responsible.&rdquo;  If you are satisfied to <Col N="380" /> agree to that, very well say so.  I personally am not satisfied.  I believe that a big national concern should be operated by competent people.  I am not suggesting that the Minister or that civil servants should operate the national stud but I am suggesting that the Minister should have placed upon him by this House the responsibility of securing the best and most competent administrator he can find and that the Minister should be asked to hold himself responsible to the Oireachtas for the manner in which the duties of that office are discharged.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be misunderstood; I do not want it to be said by critics who are not particularly scrupulous as to the way in which they misrepresent people that I am blowing hot and cold, that in one case I am all in favour of State enterprise and that in another case I am not.  I put my position clearly.  In a matter of this kind where the public must find the money, the line I take is that the Minister responsible to the Oireachtas should have placed upon him the responsibility of administering these funds and of seeing that the best possible persons are selected to administer the scheme.  He could then come back and answer to us here as to how these functions are discharged.  I know it will be argued that in these circumstances it is open to any irresponsible person to get up here or in the other House and ask the Minister why such-and-such a mare was refused a nomination or why such-and-such a stallion was not sent to Castlebar, West Cork, or somewhere else.  No sensible person would suggest that the Minister should be asked questions of that kind.  I agree that there are occasions on which, not in this House but elsewhere, questions of a particularly narrow character are asked, due no doubt to local pressure. The Minister knows as well as I do of the local pressure that is brought to bear on Deputies to ask questions about matters that are not important.</P>
    <P>I think it will be found that as our experience of this kind of organisation grows, as we begin to see the big electrification scheme with capital resources of £30,000,000 or £40,000,000 developing, the Sugar Company developing, the Cement Company developing, <Col N="381" /> the Transport Company developing, with a large investment of public money, that the people's mind will broaden and that they will not be asking Ministers 2½d. questions about 2½d. matters.  The way to develop that mentality is to act in a big way, to let the public see that Ministers have big responsibilities and that they must not be asking 2½d. questions.</P>
    <P>I was concerned mainly with that aspect of the Bill.  As to the details, apart from what I mentioned, I do not think that anybody need concern themselves. The Bill is a well-drawn Bill and all of us can join in welcoming the decision of the Minister to set up a national stud.  All of us can join in applauding him for having brought forward the proposal and I take the earliest opportunity of doing so.  That, however, should not blind us to the fact that the manner chosen by the Minister of the Government for administering this organisation is unsatisfactory and we should have the courage to say so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>When I agreed with the last speaker on a recent occasion, it was referred to as an unholy alliance.  I am afraid that that unholy alliance will have to continue for a bit longer because on the question of these new nominal companies, I am just as uneasy as Senator Duffy. Senator Sweetman on a previous occasion also had reason to express anxiety about them and there is real anxiety.  Senator Duffy, if I may say so, put it very well in pointing out that these large sums of public money placed at the disposal of these companies are altogether outside the control of Parliament.  Parliamentary control of finance is a fundamental principle and I think we have departed from that fundamental principle, perhaps largely due to the emergency, without considering where it is going to land us.  I think we should really stand back, take stock of the position and get somebody to examine whether the thing is not catching hold and becoming dangerous and to report to the Government what modification, safeguards or changes are necessary in this practice which is quite unsound, this change from the orthodox or old <Col N="382" /> fashioned methods of Parliamentary control.  Parliamentary control is hallowed by experience and one does not feel that it should be lightly set aside in this rather unconsidered and fortuitous manner.</P>
      <P>It is absurd to suggest that because questions might be asked about the location of mares or stallions, the whole system of Parliamentary control should be abrogated.  At present there are opportunities for asking endless questions in relation to appointments in the Post Office.  You get them occasionally, but I do not think it could be said that the Order Paper is cumbered with trifling questions of that kind.  Similarly, I do not think that if questions concerning the national stud could be put on the Order Paper, there would be any degree of abuse.  There is undoubtedly a certain number of troublesome people who will go to any length to put such questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what the Minister says as to the mentality required for running a stud farm.  I speak with some hesitation on the matter, because I am not a racing man, but I have sufficient intelligence to realise that the particular risks to be taken require a different approach from that called for in the case of breeding commercial stock.  I do not see, however, why a person expert in that matter should not be appointed by the Department to manage the farm I do not think the previous manager of the farm when it was under British control was anything other than a gifted individual.  I think he would have been very restive if he had been under the control of a company, even if they were a company who had a wide knowledge of stock breeding.  I cannot see&mdash;although I do not say that one is necessarily better than the other&mdash;why a specially appointed person, directly appointed by the Department, could not undertake the management of an affair of this kind every bit as well as the company.  I agree with the Minister that he has not the officials on his staff now, but that does not say that he could not make a special appointment for the purpose. That is all I have to say about this <Col N="383" /> question of the general structure of the company, but there is another matter that I want to mention, and that is this: Have the Minister and his advisers considered the possible change that the growing practice of artificial insemination is going to make in stock breeding? I am told that that practice is growing in other countries at great speed and that it is likely to make revolutionary changes in this whole matter of stock breeding.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister tell us what amount of research is going on in his Department in this matter?  My information is that there is little or no research, and I think that it really is very necessary, when embarking upon an enterprise of this kind, on which artificial insemination may have a revolutionary effect, that we should be up-to-date in the practice and be able to anticipate, in the structure of a company of this kind, the effect of this new practice on its future activities.  Otherwise, you might find yourselves committed to a large capital expenditure on an enterprise which may become out of date or unproductive in the course of time.  I would be satisfied with an assurance from the Minister that he is fully aware of all the implications involved in this growing practice and that it is being borne in mind in connection with future developments, not only in relation to the particular matter of horse breeding but of stock breeding in this country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I know practically nothing about horse breeding and therefore shall not say anything about it, but like Senator Duffy I have some definite views on the question of control of similar industries by companies partially or directly controlled by a Department of Government. I am not going to join the unholy alliance referred to by Senator Sir John Keane.  I have a great deal of sympathy with some of his remarks, and also a great deal of sympathy with the remarks made by Senator Duffy, but I do not believe that either is correct. It seems to me that one of the serious difficulties in the operation of democracy effectively in the future is <Col N="384" /> going to be, here and elsewhere, the overloading of Parliament and the difficulty of getting efficiency with the full amount of Parliamentary control.  If you object to the formation of a company, and if your only other solution is that it should be run by a Department, there is no use, to my mind, in Senator Duffy's suggesting that while we have anything like the present system of Parliamentary control, any clerk, official, chairman, or anybody else, is going to make a distinction between what is a silly or unreasonable question and what is an essential one.  In my humble opinion all of the questions that he suggested might be put down, would be put down if the national stud were under the direct control of the Minister and his Department.  For some considerable time I have felt that there ought to be a way out.</P>
      <P>The great fault that I find with these companies which, in a general way, were criticised by the Vocational Commission, is that we have not provided any proper alternative for the shareholders' meeting in an ordinary company, and that while I know that normally, if the State holds shares in a company, the Minister for Finance sends an official, who may or may not ask questions as to the affairs of the company, and who will report to the Minister afterwards, that is not, in the proper sense of the word, a shareholders' meeting, and does not give to Parliament the control that shareholders would have at an ordinary annual meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, I was very much impressed with the way I understand they deal with the matter of Parliamentary committees in Sweden.  I am not quite sure of the actual procedure, but I do know that in Sweden Parliamentary committees have been set up to deal with many matters, and that the officials&mdash;in this case it would be the directors or the manager&mdash;can attend at these committee meetings. My suggestion would be that the whole position of these companies should be carefully examined and we should see whether it would not be possible to have a series of Parliamentary committees&mdash;preferably, joint committees <Col N="385" /> of both Houses of Parliament&mdash;before which, once a year, the annual reports of the directors would be placed and at which the directors would attend or, at any rate, be represented in the same way as at an ordinary directors' meeting; that questions could be put and answered at that committee, and a report afterwards made to Parliament in connection with anything which they felt required special attention. Shareholders' meetings are public, and these meetings would also be public, and Some system of that kind would avoid the wasting of time by Parliament and also the danger of relatively petty and small matters being raised through local pressure while at the same time maintaining a degree of Parliamentary control which, to my mind, does not exist at the present time.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say a word against the Post Office, for which I have considerable respect, and having been chairman of a post office board some years ago, I have some experience in that connection, but I should not like to see the Electricity Supply Board placed in the same position as the Post Office.  I do not think it would be an advantage to have the same kind of control, but I think it would be an advantage if some such control as I have suggested were introduced in connection with all or almost all companies of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I am rather a Simon Pure in this matter, and feel bound to go further than the speakers before me.  I object, in principle, to a government having economic control over commercial interests.  It is a doctrine which the Nazis took from Marx, and which has formed part of the Nazi handbook: that for any party to get complete control in a State, it is necessary to combine economic and political control. I am not accusing the Government of a conscious following of that maxim, but if you do find economic and political control being mixed up, you have taken the first step to what is known as the one-party system, and if you have taken the first step towards the one-party system you have taken the first step towards totalitarianism. <Col N="386" /> I have the greatest distrust of many of the Bills that have recently come before the Dáil, whereby the Government is given whole control, partial control, or any kind of control of economic aspect of the national life.  I think that it would be dangerous.  I know nothing about horse breeding, and less than nothing about horse racing, but I oppose this Bill on the general principle that it is wrong that the Government should get a great and increasing control over the economic aspects of national life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sweetman was the first speaker, and he raised certain matters.  The first point that he put to me was that he thought the English National Stud was worked exactly as if a private individual were in control. I think that is quite true.  Senator Keane, speaking afterwards of the manager of the stud, said that he would have found it almost impossible to work under the direction of a company. I think that Senator Sweetman agreed with the statement that the manager worked as if the undertaking were a private concern&mdash;in other words, that he did what he liked.  That may be one way of running a stud, but I do not think that the Government, having spent public money, could say to any individual: &ldquo;Go ahead and do what you like.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sweetman said that the French National Stud was worked from the point of view of assisting bloodstock production throughout the country.  That is what we are aiming at.  Whether we shall achieve it or not is another matter.  It is rather important to have this money spent for the benefit of bloodstock breeding in general, and, having given the matter full consideration, we brought this Bill before the Oireachtas.  I agree with Senator Sweetman that high dividends should not be paid to the Minister for Finance.  If that should occur, it would be a sign that things were not being done as they should be done.  The Minister for Finance should get a reasonable dividend.  A stud of that kind should be made pay to the extent that the Minister for Finance would get, at least, as much as he has to pay <Col N="387" /> for the money, or perhaps a little more. If he got 5 per cent. on his money, I do not think that anybody would object.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If, after some years, the Minister for Finance were getting 20 per cent. or 25 per cent. on his money, that would indicate that this institution was not being worked as intended, because the company would not be devoting as much money as they should devote to the encouragement of bloodstock breeding in general. I confess that I have not read the recommendations of the Horse Breeding Commission of 1935 for some time. At the time I studied the report, and I agreed that everything contained in it was desirable.  We set out to give effect to a number of the recommendations, and some of them were, in fact, carried out.  One of the recommendations referred to by Senator Sweetman had to do with the purchase of stallions. That is a matter I should like to refer to, because it shows how difficult it is for a Department to do certain things.  I was very keen on purchasing three tip-top stallions and seven secondary stallions.  After a great deal of trouble, I got the Minister for Finance to agree to give me the money to do so.  Then I tried to get the stallions and failed.  There was no man in my Department who claimed to know anything about the purchase of thoroughbred stallions.  I was advised that a number of men would undertake to buy the stallions for us but that we should not have them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we were not entirely bereft of honest men.  We got in touch with three or four good judges of stallions who were very honest men, and we had a discussion about our requirements. We gave them a certain amount of freedom if they saw a stallion going which they thought would suit the purpose. We told them that we did not want them to write back to us and to wait until we got the sanction of the Department of Finance, that, if they considered a stallion which was offering was good value, to telegraph or telephone us and that we would tell them <Col N="388" /> whether to buy or not to buy immediately. We got only one inquiry.  We were asked if we would pay so much for a particular stallion.  We said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  The person concerned said: &ldquo;I am going out to see if the stallion is available&rdquo;, and he came back and said it was not available.  That system does not work.  We must get down as closely as possible to the position of the man working for himself.  The manager of the stud must have a great deal of power in the making of purchases under the control of some body &mdash;whether that body be the company or the Department, I shall discuss later.</P>
    <P>Senator Sweetman said we should have made some attempt to purchase horses.  Recently, a very good horse was offered.  I said: &ldquo;Let us purchase that stallion and have him when this stud is set up&rdquo;.  When we went to the owner, we found that he had decided not to sell at all.  I am glad that Senator Sweetman raised the question of the employment of the staff, because I should not like them to have any apprehension about their future.  I am told that, legally, it is safer, from the point of view of the future of the company, that we should say to the staff: &ldquo;We are letting you go in a week's time&rdquo;.  That would be seven days before the company would take over. The company will take them over under ordinary conditions of employment&mdash;as any farmer would take over his men-but they may have a little more security than they would under the ordinary farmer because they may have certain rights regarding gratuities if they are found unsuitable.  No man need have the slightest anxiety, any more than he has next Saturday night, as to his employment by the company.  If it is found at present that there is no work for the staff, somebody has to go, but it is not likely that any man will be found redundant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably.  Senator Sweetman referred to the Japanese gardens.  They have been famous for many years.  There is nothing in the Bill regarding them but there will be a condition in the lease or licence to <Col N="389" /> the company requiring them to keep these gardens in order.  I understand that the laying down of those gardens cost a huge amount many years ago.  They were supposed to be an allegory of some problem in life.  They are well worth seeing and we must have them maintained properly.  During the past few years, they may not have been maintained as they should, but I think that they will be much better maintained henceforth.  Senator Honan spoke of the Irish draught horse and other horses.  We are not dealing with that matter in this Bill but I agree with the Senator that the Irish draught horse should be encouraged in every way.  Indirectly, the maintenance of a stud like this may have a good influence on breeding in general.  I need hardly repeat&mdash;though Senator Quirke invited me to do so&mdash;that every preference will be given to the small breeder.  I do not know how the company will define &ldquo;small breeder&rdquo;&mdash; whether a man with from four to six mares or, as Senator Quirke suggested, a man with one or two mares.  If there be any controversy on the question, it would, I think, come to the Minister because the fair interpretation of &ldquo;small breeder&rdquo; would be a matter of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Quirke said, we want as manager a man with a thorough knowledge of horse breeding.  That is a very ticklish subject&mdash;a question of mating, different lines of blood and so on.  He should be, as was suggested, an Irishman and, I should like to add to that, a man of great integrity.  I think that we should be able to get a man of that type. Senator Duffy said that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs managed the Post Office and asked why we could not manage a stud farm.  I myself could manage a post office, but I am doubtful if the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would manage a stud farm. It is quite a different matter.  As we have all stressed in this debate, a person requires a good deal of technical knowledge to run a stud farm properly. That is the big reason why this company was set up.  There is a Bill following this one on the Order Paper, with regard to the estate in County <Col N="390" /> Wexford on which we are going to run an Agricultural College.  That college will be run directly from the Department, because I feel as I did when walking over Johnstown farm, that I know enough to be able to criticise what is taking place there, and the officers of my Department, while eminently qualified to manage a farm of that kind, could not manage a stud farm.</P>
    <P>There is no use in saying, like Senator Sir John Keane, that we have officials who know something about horse breeding.  Of course we have officials who know something about it, but we cannot expect an official who has come in at the ordinary age and minded his business properly to know all about horse racing and horse breeding.  I am not making little of the men who do know all about it, but it is only men of that kind who know all about the breeding of horses and the management of a stud.  That is the first reason why I asked the Government to have the farm managed by a company and not run by the Department directly, but the second reason is, as some of the Senators here have mentioned, that there might be public criticism of the detailed management of a company of that kind, and I think if Senators would be a little bit sympathetic to the manager, they will see that it would be extremely awkward if a manager was subject to question and answer in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Even the best manager we could get in the world will not be successful every time.  If he goes on buying stallions, he is sure to buy a dud sometime, and if he buys brood mares he will make a mistake sometime, and if some disappointed seller of a stallion hears that the manager bought another stallion which turned out to be no use, he can approach some local Deputy and say: &ldquo;You have a manager getting a big salary and he goes and buys a stallion which anybody could see was not worth a bob.  He paid £30,000 for him and there must be something shady about it.&rdquo;  The Deputy can then ask: &ldquo;Why did your manager buy a £30,000 stallion, when he was not worth a bob?&rdquo; The result of that would be the manager would be afraid of his life to buy another stallion for any price, <Col N="391" /> if that sort of procedure was adopted. Even from that point of view alone it should not be done in that way.  But the primary consideration was that I did not know anything about it, and my officials did not know anything about it, and if we were to put a manager in whom we knew was competent, we could always say to him whatever he might suggest: &ldquo;You know the best&mdash;go ahead.&rdquo;  I might as well say to the manager: &ldquo;I am appointing you because I am going to have full control in my Department.&rdquo;  It is better we should have a manager appointed and have four or five men who knew something about the business to examine his proposals and criticise them if necessary, and carry on in that way.</P>
    <P>I have heard a good lot of talk about the principle of setting up a company.  I did not realise there was a principle in the matter.  Senator Sir John Keane says there is a fundamental principle in regard to the spending of public moneys.  For 20 or 25 years, and before that, with the British Government, we have often had grants-in-aid for large amounts.  Nobody said that was going against a fundamental principle in devoting public moneys without finding out how they were spent.  You can go back further to the time of various governments in relation to the taking over of land, and someone not being very particular to whom they gave the land, or who paid for it.  That is going a long way back.  In recent years, when the principles of parliamentary government became more or less established, large sums of money by way of grants-in-aid were given, and surely that was not against the fundamental principle.</P>
    <P>If we departed from that principle, the departure was generally accepted. On the formation of the Electricity Supply Board, certain members of the Dáil and Seanad did not appear to have realised that we were on the wrong road.  No one appears to have realised it until now, when the National Stud Bill came up.  I was rather surprised to hear such strong criticism of that form of looking after <Col N="392" /> certain things.  I can understand Senators like Senator Kingsmill Moore having strong objections to Government dealings in economic matters at all.  It may be wrong, and we may be going in the wrong direction, but I do not know how we can deal with things like this national stud unless we have Government interference.  We could have said that we do not interfere in economic matters, and, therefore, we are selling this farm to the highest bidder, but I think it would be a pity to do it, from the point of view of the horse-breeding industry.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane has asked me about artificial insemination.  We have not done any research in it here, but we have sent officials to study what has been done in other countries, and we have studied literature on the subject. I do not claim to have read a lot about it, but I have read something of what has been done in countries where it is in practice for some years. So far as I can gather from the knowledge available at the moment, it is not likely to interfere in any way with horse breeding in this country.  From what I can gather from the experiments so far carried out&mdash;in fact, they are not experiments now&mdash;it is routine practice in Soviet Russia, and to a great extent in the United States. The number of mares served through artificial insemination is not appreciably larger than the number of mares served in the natural way.  That being so, and the distances in this country being such, I do not think it is likely that artificial insemination will ever be introduced in this country unless there is some further change or further knowledge is secured.</P>

When we gather that knowledge together, we may make up our minds whether we will proceed with it here or not.</P>
      <P>Senator Douglas gave us what he might consider as a reasonable alternative to the arrangement for the stud contemplated in this Bill.  The alternative was one between the Department running all these various activities and the Minister being responsible to the House for the activities of companies, or running them, and the Minister not being responsible to Parliament for the companies.  The Senator suggested as an alternative that there might be a joint committee from both Houses which would be more or less in the position of representatives of the Minister on the same principle as shareholders at an annual meeting.  I do not think I have anything else to say arising out of the discussion.</P>

    <Title>Johnstown Castle Agricultural College Bill, 1945&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the beginning of last year, intimation was received by the Government from Mr. Maurice Victor Lakin, of County Wexford, that he proposed to make a gift to the nation of the entire property of Johnstown Castle, with certain minor exclusions which will be referred to, to be used as a lay agricultural college.  On getting this offer, the Government was very glad to accept the gift, and on referring the matter to its legal advisers for the necessary agreements and so on, we were advised that legislation was necessary as a consequence of acceptance of the gift.  That is why this Bill comes before you.  Johnstown Castle is well known as one of the historic residences of Ireland.  It is a very imposing structure, and has been visited always as a place of interest and a place of historic associations.  I believe it is a place of architectural interest to those interested in that subject. The lands attached to it comprise about 1,000 acres, all held in fee simple, save for one small piece held on lease.  The lands are admirably situated for an agricultural college. There are about 600 acres of arable land, typical Wexford land.  It is the type of land that must be tilled in order to keep it in good condition, like most of County Wexford, and it will be suitable on that account in particular for an agricultural college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are about 300 acres under timber some of which is mature, and about 100 acres which is more or less <Col N="395" /> waste, but which we believe we can reclaim.  This will be a particularly interesting experiment for the students of the college.  The grounds are very attractive and the gardens which are walled in are large and well stocked. It will be possible, I think, to maintain a fairly substantial horticultural college as well as an agricultural college.</P>
    <P>I need hardly stress to the Seanad the necessity for more accommodation for agricultural colleges.  We have more applications from boys in the country than we can satisfy at the moment.  We have three State colleges at Clonakilty, Athenry and Ballyhaise.  University College has a somewhat similar college at Glasnevin, and there are four colleges under religious control&mdash;by the Salesian Fathers in Limerick and Meath, by the Franciscan Brothers at Mountbellew, and one under the Diocesan Clergy in Monaghan.  All of these are not sufficient for our needs at the moment and Johnstown Castle will certainly be a great help.  I am sure the Seanad will realise that the gift is a very valuable one to this nation and I would like to say that we appreciate the gesture of Mr. Lakin and of Mrs. D.V. Jefferies of Carrigbourne, County Wexford, who has an interest in the lands and has been associated with Mr. Lakin in making the gift.  I want to mention two or three conditions because the Senators may be rather puzzled about some of them. There are a few conditions mentioned in the Bill.  They relate mainly to making provision for existing employees on the estate.  We have dealt with the employees on the national stud farm.  No condition was made by the British about that, but here we have undertaken with the donor to see that the employees are treated in a special way with regard to pension, retiring allowances and so on.  We have also undertaken to preserve the general ornamental condition of the grounds and the right of way to the private cemetery where members of the Fitzgerald family have been buried for the last 50 years, reserving fishing and <Col N="396" /> sporting rights to the donor and refunding the death duties on the estate only.</P>
    <P>I ask Senators to keep that in mind because there has been a misundering on that question.  There is no question of Mr. Lakin getting away with all the death duties on the property inherited.  Only the death duties on this particular estate will be refunded.  There were certain other small matters.  The Bill contains sections providing for the implementation of these conditions and to enable the property to be used as a lay agricultural college.  There was a form of agreement signed in the beginning for the transfer of the property. This is attached to the Bill by way of schedule and a copy of the conveyance by which the property will be conveyed is also attached.  The Bill is implementing the agreement made by Mr. Lakin and the Government and providing for the conditions that Mr. Lakin asked for at the time he was making the gift.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on having acquired Johnstown Castle as an agricultural college.  I am sure it will make a useful addition to the institutions in which specialised agricultural education is given and I would like to join in appreciation of the generosity of the former owners in presenting this estate to the State for such an important public purpose.  There is not much to be said on the specific matter of this Bill but perhaps I would be in order in making some general remarks about agricultural education and the need for emphasising it.</P>

      <P>Will you, Sir, give me a certain amount of rope <Col N="397" /> before you hang me?  I should like to put the matter in its proper perspective. I should like to point out that for an agricultural country we do not spend an awful lot of money in providing for agricultural education.  What is still more important, very few of our people, especially very few of our farmers, are, in fact, able to acquire a whole-time agricultural education in a residential college.  There are 450,000 children attending primary schools, 35,000 pupils attending secondary schools&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the fact that we hope to add perhaps 40 new pupils to a number which does not exceed 200, seems to be significant in itself, but it is still more significant in comparison with the large number of people who acquire a non-agricultural education and in relation to the terrific necessity there is for extending agricultural education in general.  If you think, however, that this question does not arise on the Bill, all that is left to me is to sit down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>After the experience of Senator Johnston I do not quite know how anything I may have to say will be treated, but I do know that under Section 3, the Minister is going to establish here a lay agricultural college, and perhaps I would be in order if I said that while I, of course, join with the Minister whole-heartedly in expressing the gratitude of the House for a very generous gift by the personal representatives of the Fitzgerald family, at the same time I think I might be permitted to say that it is unfortunate that we had to wait for such a generous gift before further extending our provision for lay agricultural colleges such as are visualised in Section 3.  So far as the college which it is proposed to set up under this Bill is concerned, perhaps the Minister would give us a little more detailed information as to the particular type of college, or the particular manner in which he proposes to work this college.  Is it intended that the <Col N="398" /> agricultural college to which he refers will be carried on in exactly the same way as similar colleges, or is it intended that there shall be some special type of agricultural research carried on here?  I see, Sir, that you are looking rather uncomfortable, but I would submit with all respect that within the ambit of Section 3 we are entitled to inquire on the Second Reading the type of agricultural college that will be set up on the farm that is being acquired under this Act.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;As soon as conveniently may be after the passing of this Act, the Minister shall establish on the Estate a lay agricultural college and may for that purpose do all such things as he considers necessary.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would suggest that the things he considers necessary may vary very much according to the type of agricultural college that is going to be established.

There is one small point the Minister might deal with, having regard to the provisions of the agreement. He referred to the death duties which were being paid to the State. Those are, I gathered, duties that have been paid in respect of the property which we are getting as a gift.  I am going to ask the Minister a very technical question: has the property included in the gift been excluded for aggregation because it would be unfair on the family not to have it so excluded.

      <P>This Bill, by its title, continues the remission of rates for a certain limited class of residences and extends the period of qualification for residences completed before 31st March, 1946.  From 1925, onwards, remission of rates has been granted on buildings which were not the subject of remissions by virtue of certain Acts, to which I shall refer shortly. In 1940, the Local Government (Remission of Rates) Act, 1940, confined remissions to dwelling-houses or to portion of buildings which were for residential purposes and for a separate family.  The Act provided two-thirds remission of rates for five years for dwellings completed before September, 1942.  An amending Act, in 1943, extended the 1940 Act to operate till 31st March, 1945.  The purpose of the present Bill is, as above said, to extend further the period for one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the Second Reading of this Bill in the Dáil a number of Deputies appeared to have great difficulty in understanding what was the nature of the buildings which this Bill covers, and although a number of Senators may be aware of exactly to what it refers, I propose, in order that there may be no misunderstanding, to indicate very clearly the scope of this Bill. As I have said already, the Bill is one that simply continues the remission of rates for a period of one year.  It has <Col N="402" /> no new principle in it, but since some members of the Seanad may not be quite clear as to its character, I shall proceed to give some further details. Now, the original Act upon which this Bill is based excluded a whole series of buildings from this remission qualification. First of all, they excluded all buildings constructed under the Labourers Acts, 1883 to 1937.  These were cottages built by local authorities and receiving a subsidy, growing as time went on, especially since the coming into office of the present Government.  Therefore, quite naturally, there was no rate remission in connection with these cottages, since at a later date these cottages could be purchased on favourable terms, and the terms were so favourable that it was felt that no remission of rates could be granted in connection with improvements on cottages after they had been purchased. Another group of dwellings not affected by the 1940 Act, on which this Bill is based, were those built under the Housing Acts, 1890, 1931 and 1932. These consisted amongst others of houses built by local authorities, and in the case of which grants were given. As in the case of the cottages, naturally, there was no remission of rates there either, since a large subsidy had already been granted in connection with the building of these houses. Another group of houses excluded was in connection with the Housing Acts, 1924-25-31, and the amendment of these Acts thereafter.  These Acts dealt with grants which were limited by the cubic space of the house, but also provided grants for the reconstruction of houses, including rural houses.  In the case of reconstruction there was a rates remission for seven years.  The reconstructed portion was not subject to re-valuation, and there was no extra rate imposed on the reconstructed portion for seven years.  In connection with the actual remission, there was a two-thirds remission for seven years, but this Bill does not apply to that type of house. It does not apply, moreover, to houses built under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts, in connection with which there were special facilities for owners of houses built in the Gaeltacht area, <Col N="403" /> where there was a remission for a period of 20 years.</P>
    <P>Now, I have given to members of the Seanad the Acts to which this Bill has no relation, and I now have left the question of what houses or types of houses the Bill does apply to.  It applies to buildings which are not in receipt of Government or local assistance. In fact, it applies to large residences&mdash;houses built by private persons or private companies for residential purposes with a cubic area over and above that of the houses which receive grants.  It applies, for example, to the reconstruction of large houses into flats.  It applies to improvements effected to large residences for which no grants are available. If a farmhouse requires reconstruction or if a farmhouse is to be built or if an improvement is to be added to a farmhouse and the valuation is over £25, as Senators know that farmhouse does not receive assistance under the Housing Acts.  In that case, the remission of rates provided for in the Act of 1940&mdash;two-thirds for five years&mdash;applies to such dwellings.  In the rather remote case where a farmhouse was under £25 in valuation and a form of reconstruction was carried out which did not conform with the Acts and the owner was refused a grant, he might be able to qualify under the 1940 Act.  In connection with the houses for which remission of rates is granted, included in &ldquo;improvements to houses&rdquo; are such things as garden houses, motor houses or servants' quarters.  Therefore the remission of rates which is being continued to 31st March, 1946, applies only to a limited number of dwellings. It is very difficult for me to estimate the number of dwellings in respect of which rates have already been remitted. We know that there are about 5,000 in Dublin.  That would include not only new buildings but improvements to old buildings.  One might make a guess that 10,000 or 15,000 dwellings or improvements to dwellings benefited under the 1940 Act and previous Acts.</P>
    <P>The reason for this Bill is that it was felt desirable to continue the <Col N="404" /> policy for one more year of granting these remissions of rates, particularly in view of the uncertain position regarding supplies and the fact that a number of houses the completion of which was anticipated have not been completed owing to emergency conditions. The continuance of these remissions does not imply that the Government have decided what their policy will be in the future.  Many of the conditions attending housing development have altered.  It may or may not be desirable in the future to continue this legislation, but that does not arise on this Bill, which is merely one for the continuance of the privileges granted up to date.</P>
    <P>Certain Deputies asked in the Dáil whether farm buildings&mdash;byres, stables and outhouses&mdash;were covered by this Bill.  The answer is that they are not covered by the 1940 Act, whether or not they had previously received a Government grant.  When constructed, they are freed from rates for seven years and they are outside this legislation, which applies entirely to dwelling-houses.  Dwelling-houses, under this Bill, must be for separate families.  That would exclude institutions or buildings for housing people collectively.  It is definitely stated in the 1940 Act that it applies only to houses for separate families.  The continuance of this remission of rates will also apply to the residential portion of a building which has some other use, such as a garage with a dwelling above it. it or a shop with a dwelling above it. The remission of rates will apply only to the residential portion of that building.  I hope I have made as clear as possible to Senators the very limited nature of this Bill and I recommend it for Second Reading because the Government is of opinion that the privilege should be continued, particularly in view of the emergency. The whole matter will be reviewed when housing conditions change and when conditions in relation to materials and the inducement given to builders to construct houses come under consideration again.  Members of the Seanad will be aware that, to a very large extent, builders and landlords do not pass on this remission of rates to those who occupy the houses. <Col N="405" /> It is definitely an inducement to them to employ their capital for building purposes.  It is an inducement to those builders who cannot avail of any grant or subsidy to construct or reconstruct large dwellings or residences or to convert large residences into flats or to improve large dwellings or residences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely approve of the Bill and I hope that conditions will permit some people to make use of the remission of rates within the present year.  We all know that, for the past four or five years, hardly any new houses were constructed, with the result that this remission of rates, so far as new houses were concerned, was inoperative.  The Act most made use of in the town with which I am familiar was the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  Under that Act, a person could borrow up to seven-eighths of the entire cost of building a house.  A very small grant was available. The owner was entitled to the remission of rates because the grant was so small&mdash;£50 or £60&mdash;that it was not taken into account in calculating his indebtedness to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was entitled to the remission by reason of the fact that he had to pay back the entire sum borrowed, plus interest, over a period of 35 years. Calculated at 5 per cent.&mdash;the actual amount was, I think, about 4¾ per cent.&mdash;the amount of interest he would pay on £1,000 over the entire period would be £1,127 4s. 2d.  At 4½ per cent. the amount of interest would be roughly equal to the amount of capital borrowed&mdash;say, £1,000.  Some monetary reformers made great capital out of that position&mdash;that, if you borrow £1,000, you have to pay back £2,000. On the figures that was quite correct, but that sum produced a house the rental value of which I estimate at £50 a year.  The tenant or borrower had this house for 35 years.  It was of an annual value to him of £50, and at the end of 35 years, after repaying the principal and paying the interest, he had the property for the balance of his life, and those who came after him had also the advantage of it.  That represented to him an approximate outlay of only £250.  After 35 years, a house is still a very good house. That was a most excellent Act, and I <Col N="406" /> hope that conditions will be such in the near future that we shall be able to recommence the building of houses.</P>

      <P>Bille beag isea an Bille seo ach tá práinn leis.  This is a short Bill, but I regard its passage into law at the earliest possible date as important. There is a danger, I am informed, of a valuable collection of papers&mdash;a collection which I think is unique&mdash;being lost to the country.  For some time past, the Government had been considering the taking of steps to put the collection of national documents and their proper keeping on a sound basis.  There is a general scheme in contemplation for the setting up of a national archive.  We have found it necessary, however, to proceed with this measure to deal with the situation to which I have referred.  The situation could be approached by making it impossible to export articles or documents of value to the country, but we have considered that that might impose too great a liability upon the owners of papers or other valuable objects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had also the alternative of leaving matters entirely free, as they have been during the past 50 years.  A considerable number of valuable documents have been lost to the country and, as we are not as rich in some records as other countries, it is necessary that we should collect whatever is valuable.  We have been placed in the unfortunate position in recent years that valuable documents of which no copy was available were sent out of the country and the National Library has had to buy them back in the London market at greatly enhanced prices. Under this Bill, export is not completely prohibited but a person who wishes to export a document or paper of 100 years old or over or a document or paper in respect of which I make an Order applying the provisions of the Act to it, even though it be less than 100 years old, will have to procure an <Col N="407" /> export licence from me.  I may ask him to permit a photographic copy or copies to be made of the document or series of documents.  If I make that request, the exporter will not be allowed to export the document or documents until the copy will have been made.  I have introduced an amendment in the Bill to make sure that the copies will be made within a reasonable time.  As a matter of fact, copies can be made within a few hours. Even a very large collection of documents can be copied in a day or two days, so that there need be no great delay.  Copies will be made either by ordinary camera, in the case of larger papers or drawings, or by microfilm, which is used in the National Library pretty constantly, in the case of a large number of documents.  When a copy is made under Section 3 (1) the Minister must permit the article to be exported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this Bill is sound and is a very happy compromise between complete prohibition of export and free export.  Complete prohibition might mean that many attempts would be made to evade the law.  There are a few points which I should like the Minister to elucidate. Section 2 (1) (b) refers to any &ldquo;painting&rdquo;. Would a coloured map be considered a painting?  It is frequently necessary for solicitors to put maps on deeds.  If a solicitor is sending a modern deed out of the country to be executed and it contains a map, will that be a &ldquo;painting&rdquo; within the meaning of the paragraph and must he obtain a licence to export it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under sub-section (2), of the same section, if the Minister has in mind a particular document, as I believe he has, there should be a provision that the Minister would forthwith furnish the owner with a copy of the Order. It would not be fair to expect the owner to be aware of the Order unless he had been given a copy of it.  I mention all these matters because I fully appreciate that there is urgency in connection with the Bill, from the Minister's point of view, and I may <Col N="408" /> save time by mentioning them now.</P>
    <P>Under Section 3, it is provided that &ldquo;it shall not be lawful for any person to export...&rdquo;.  Suppose that section is infringed, what is the penalty?  I cannot see where the penalty is prescribed. It appears to me that no penalty is provided in the Bill. Whether these offences are automatically brought under some other Acts, such as the Customs Acts, I do not know.  I do not think that they would be so brought without a section stating that this Act was to be construed as one with the Customs Acts.  Senator O'Dea may be able to give me some enlightenment on that question. I think that some penalty should be prescribed or that there should be express provision that the Act is to be construed with the Customs Acts.  I cannot deal with this section in detail until I know the Minister's answer to that question.  This is a Bill against which a person might easily offend with the best will in the world and without realising that he had offended. I think that this is a case in which it should be necessary to prove that not only has there been a breach of the law but that there has been <i>mens rea</i>&mdash; guilty intent.  It should be necessary to prove that the person knew, or should reasonably have known, that the document was over 100 years old.  It would be only in respect of that matter that the point would arise.  It would be unfair to obtain a conviction where a man had attempted to export an article which he did not know was over 100 years old.  The Minister will agree that there must be many documents in respect of which it is difficult to say whether they are 90 years old or 100 years old.</P>
    <P>An attempt should be made to see that this Bill is administered in such a way as to cause as little inconvenience as possible.  If a large collection of articles were being sent from Mayo to America, by liner from Galway, the Minister should not make a request that they should be all sent on to Dublin to be copied and then sent back to Galway.  He should make arrangements to have the copying done on the spot.  Subject to those remarks, I have no objection to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that this is a <Col N="409" /> much more important Bill than the Minister indicated.  I do not know what the urgency of the matter is.  So far as I listened to the debate, it turned merely on documents.  There has not been much elaboration of the provision with regard to paintings.  I can see a good reason why a valuable historical document should be subject to control, but when I see a reference to &ldquo;any painting&rdquo;, without reference to age, I begin to wonder what it involves.  Suppose that the last survivor of an old Irish family dies and his inheritance passes to some person outside the country.  That inheritance will include a number of family possessions. It may include old furniture as valuable as any paintings.  The whole of that property, in the ordinary course of the disposal of the estate, should go outside the country.  I presume that these articles would be allowed to go.  Is it suggested that every single painting should have to be submitted to the examination of the Minister or his officials and that a photograph should have to be made of the painting?  Evidently, until the photograph has been taken, the export will not be allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the matter requires more careful examination than it has had.  As I read the provision at present, it is absurd.  There might be a work by a school-girl which might have some value for family reasons, but which would have no historical value.  I have left one or two pictures to members of my family who are out of the country.  Before they go, under my will, to members of my family, will they have to be submitted to the Minister and will this elaborate procedure have to be gone through?  I think it is intolerable that we should be passing into this state of control and regulation.  Until I hear more from the Minister, I shall use all my efforts to have this matter fully investigated.  This Bill has been hurriedly drawn without regard to the irritation it will cause to members of the public who have no desire to export articles of historical value but who claim the right to move about the world and to move their possessions without restrictions of this kind.  We cannot regard ourselves as living in a <Col N="410" /> small watertight compartment, with everything we hold subject to the sanction of the Minister, irrespective of the circumstances of its holding or the value of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Sweetman that there is no sanction in this Bill and that there ought to be. The Bill is complete in itself and does not refer to any other Acts.  Therefore, the penalty ought to be prescribed in the Bill.  Possibly, a statement as to the confiscation of the documents, if it is desired that they should be confiscated, should be included in the Bill. It might be desirable to have a closer definition of &ldquo;painting&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Document&rdquo; is described all right.  It may be desirable to prevent the exportation of certain printed papers.  The Minister has power to make an Order referring to certain documents but it is doubtful that he can prevent the exportation of documents which are all in print.  That matter should be considered before the Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that we are interested in modern books.  The general feeling is that, since 1870, our affairs are fairly well documented in easily accessible records&mdash;newspapers and books.  It is the older matter in which we are chiefly interested.  As regards the point that if an Order be made under Section 2 (2) a copy of the Order should be furnished to the owner of the document, I shall see if it is possible to bring in an amendment. There may be difficulty in identifying the owner.  We may know that a particular document is here but its exact whereabouts may not be known.  If we had a complete register of all documents, matters might be simpler but the trouble is that, if we wait for information, the documents may be gone. A coloured drawing on a deed would, I think, come under the definition &ldquo;painting&rdquo;, as in the Bill at present. I have not been able to get a satisfactory definition of painting.  No definition is known to the lawyers. This Act will be administered by customs officers.  Even if it were possible to define a painting of historical interest, I doubt that a customs officer would be able to say, if the definition were a technical one, <Col N="411" /> whether a particular picture would come within its terms or not.  We have gone into this matter with the draftsman and we have not been able to get a satisfactory definition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It has received consideration. On Committee Stage, it may have to be accepted, from my point of view, that a closer definition of painting is not possible.  I suggest to Senator Keane, in that event, that the persons whom he has in mind should remember that Section 4 merely prescribes that the Minister may request the applicant for an export licence to afford him facilities to make a copy.  The Minister may not ask for a copy.  To meet the case of persons who might be importing pictures for the purpose of an exhibition in Dublin and sending them back immediately afterwards, I put in a special clause in Section 2 whereby the Minister may declare that any particular document or painting, or any document or painting belonging to a particular class, shall be excluded from the operation of the Act.  If persons who wish to export paintings are not satisfied that they will get a fair deal from the Minister&mdash; where the painting is not of historical value, they will not even be asked for leave to make a copy&mdash;I can only refer them to the fact that I have power to exempt a particular picture or class of pictures from the provisions of the Bill. The number of dealers in pictures and documents is rather small.  I have no wish to hamper them in their ordinary business, but it may happen that one painting or document out of 50 is of some value from the historical point of view.  We shall merely make a photographic reproduction which will not reduce the value of the painting.  We may wish to have a record of the <Col N="412" /> painter's work.  A picture might be of little artistic value but might be of great historical value.</P>
      <P>Under the provision I have referred to, I do not think we are going to impose any hardship on owners.  That is not the intention.  If an owner does not facilitate us in making a copy, when we consider that a copy is necessary, we have to invoke the section. Our legal advisers tell me that Section 3 of the Customs (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1945, provides a penalty for exporting anything which it is illegal to export under any enactment. The penalty would be three times the value of the document or painting, or £100 as the Revenue Commissioners may decide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>From a study of the text of the Bill as passed by Dáil Eireann, and of the reports of the discussions in the Dáil, Senators are no doubt already aware of the general purpose of the Bill and of the nature of its particular provisions.  I do not think, therefore, that it is necessary for me to explain it at any great length.</P>
      <P>On the 15th May last, within a week of the ending of hostilities in Europe, I informed the Dáil in reply to a Parliamentary Question that it was obvious that so long as the position regarding essential supplies remained as it was, the Government would continue to require certain of the emergency powers which had been exercisable since 1939.  I said that it was not the desire of the Government to retain the Emergency Powers Acts in operation for a moment longer than the public interest required, and that it was their intention to divest themselves of any powers that could be dispensed with without detriment to the public interest.</P>
      <P>In the debates on this Bill in Dáil Eireann, I again made it perfectly clear that I would be glad to see the end of these emergency powers as soon as possible.  In the course of almost six years, however, it was inevitable in the conditions through which we have been passing that a complicated code of emergency powers would grow up.  Reasonable time is required for the full examination of this code and of the circumstances which now exist and which may be anticipated in the future.  It is not, therefore, practicable to dispense entirely in the immediate future with the powers taken in 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill now before the Seanad gives effect to the Government's intentions in this matter.  It provides&mdash;(a) that the provisions in the Emergency Powers Acts relating to postal and telegraph censorship and the censorship or control of newspapers, a condition in the lease or licence to <Col N="414" /> of the publication or the spreading of any matter shall be dropped and that the Government shall be specifically precluded from exercising them; (b) that the provisions of the Emergency Powers (Continuance and Amendment) Act, 1942, regarding the imposition of minimum fines shall be dropped.</P>
    <P>(c)  That the Emergency Powers (Amendment) Act, 1940, which provides for the arrest without warrant and detention of natural-born Irish citizens shall not be continued, and that the 1939 Act shall be construed in its original form in this respect; (d) that the Emergency Powers (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1940, which provides for summary trials by commissioned officers of the Defence Forces of persons not subject to military law shall not be continued and that the prohibition against the exercise of this power shall be re-inserted in the 1939 Act.</P>
    <P>(e)  That the powers contained in the 1939 Act for the prohibition, restriction or control of the entry of natural-born Irish citizens into the State and the movements of natural-born Irish citizens within the State shall be discontinued; (f) that the power to authorise the arrest without warrant of natural-born Irish citizens shall no longer be exercisable under the Emergency Powers Acts; (g) that the power to authorise and provide for the searching of natural-born Irish citizens under the Emergency Powers Acts shall be dropped.</P>
    <P>(h)  That the Government shall be expressly precluded from suspending, amending or applying the Emergency Powers Acts by means of emergency Order; (i) that, subject to the above, the Emergency Powers Acts shall be continued for a further period of 12 months from the 3rd September next when they are due to expire in the ordinary course.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains the usual provision that the Government may, by Order, declare that the Principal Act shall expire on a date earlier than the 2nd September, 1946.</P>
    <P>With a view to dispensing to the greatest degree possible with the exercise of emergency powers, Departments have been instructed to examine <Col N="415" /> the question of incorporating in ordinary legislation any powers which it may appear necessary to retain for an appreciable period, e.g., powers relating to the provision and control of supplies and services essential to the life of the community.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government has already revoked a wide range of Emergency Powers Orders.  Details of these have already appeared in the Press. They cover such matters as censorship, military courts, sitting of courts in camera, powers to arrest and search without warrant, requisitioning of goods and vehicles, regional commissioners, restriction of movements and activities of suspected persons, and a variety of other subjects.  The examination of Emergency Powers Orders by Departments is continuing with a view to the revocation at as early a date as possible of every Order of a restrictive nature which can be dispensed with without injury to the public interest.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, in introducing this measure, referred to the fact that there had been considerable discussion in the Dáil and probably most of us had read it.  Unfortunately we can read the newspapers, but we do not get the Dáil Reports in time to read them, and I find&mdash;I am not expressing any dissatisfaction at the method of introduction of the Bill&mdash; that unless one reads the daily newspapers very closely it is very easy to miss something which has occurred in the Dáil.  We do not receive the Official Reports with the same frequency that we received them before the emergency. That is entirely due to emergency conditions, because reports are now published weekly and do not always reach us in time to enable us to study them before Bills reach us.</P>
      <P>On one or two other occasions, Ministers have assumed that we were aware of what happened in the other House, but, as I said, unless one reads the morning newspaper very carefully, it is very easy to miss things of importance unless they get a heading.  That is inevitable, of course, and I am not complaining about it.  There are very good reasons why the Reports are published only once a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" /> For my own part, I do not think that this is a Bill requiring very much discussion in this House having regard to the long time spent on it in the Dáil.  The essential part of the Bill is contained really in two sections, Section 4 which continues, in effect, the 1939 Act, and Section 6 which reduced the powers previously held by the Government.  I think no fair-minded man can possibly dispute the fact that some extension was necessary, and it seems to me that any democrat must welcome the fact that there is some reduction of the powers which can be exercised by the executive without the formal sanction of Parliament.</P>
    <P>In particular I was extremely pleased myself that the Government had decided before this measure was introduced to abolish the Press and postal censorships.  Many people thought, and I was glad to see quite erroneously, that the censorship might continue for a period of six months or a year afterwards.  My personal opinion is that its abolition was one of the wisest things the Government has done for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>In every democratic country, it is essential that the people should feel that the information they get is free, but until we have better supplies of paper there will be a certain exercise of censorship, and it will not be perfectly satisfactory.  It will not be exercised by the Government, and the responsible people will be the editors and others, but I think it is better, as it is now, that we should recognise that the amount of information available to the public will be restricted until we have better supplies of paper.</P>
    <P>I think it was Mr. Cordell Hull who said that in the exercise of democracy it was not sufficient that people should ultimately have control of their own government, but also the right to obtain the information on which to base their opinions with which they could control their own government. My principal personal criticism of this Bill lies in its drafting.  This is a Bill of maximum importance.  It is one of the Bills which is covered by Article 28 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="417" /> The Constitution cannot be cited against it in question of its powers because it is a Bill expressed as necessary for the public safety.  It is therefore, in a sense, a fundamental Act of a temporary character and I think it is a pity the Government did not insist on a new Bill.  Only a short Bill would be necessary.  At present you have to get three volumes and make several references to understand this measure.  Personally, I do not think it would have taken very much more time to produce this Emergency Powers Bill, giving us an exact outline of what the remaining powers are. Incidentally, I think there would be less misunderstanding.  I have a suggestion which will, perhaps, come better on the Committee Stage regarding Section 6 of this Bill but I shall leave it until the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I wish to say a few words as one who was, perhaps, unduly active in the resistance to the censorship. I should like to express my thanks, gratitude and relief, that the Government has allowed us to emerge from the valley of darkness, and, to some of us, the intolerable sufferings the censorship imposed on us during the war years.  I think now that the censorship is removed, the Government and the public realise that no danger really has been incurred, and even if the censorship had been very much less harsh than it was, no real danger might have been expected.</P>
      <P>However, we do not want to have a <i>post mortem</i> on the whole thing, but I do feel that the real burden was what might be called the mental tyranny of the censorship, and I think its departure has been noted with great feelings of relief by large numbers of people.</P>

While it would be churlish not to express my pleasure, it was not unmixed with some measure of surprise. I wonder if all those burdens which can be removed have been removed. I am not going into the restrictions that exist, but I would like <Col N="418" /> to express a general view.  I think, undoubtedly, that there is a case and an unanswerable case for preserving the restrictions dealing with supplies of commodities and certain other matters which fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Supplies.  Yet the case has not been made out for the preservation of any of the other emergency powers especially those affecting in any way the ordinary liberties of the citizens.</P>

      <P>I want to take the opportunity to ask the Taoiseach particularly to inquire into the necessity for the retention of the emergency power by virtue of which land is acquired. I hope it will be possible to dispense with it at a very early date, because its operation, and particularly the operation of the provisions by which compensation is given for such land and turbary so acquired, has given rise to considerable, very considerable, dissatisfaction in County Kildare.  Therefore, I would ask him to make sure if possible that the examination of the necessity for the retention of those powers will proceed as early as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it should be realised that the Bill does effect a considerable number of repeals in so far as restrictions were imposed under the Act of 1939.  These, in the main, are found in Section 6 of the Bill and I think they are important.  There is, however, a certain power remaining which is also very important and which can be used in a manner that leaves in people's minds a doubt as to whether in certain cases the best policy is being pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in mind, particularly, the powers which are availed of by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to place a ceiling on wages and salaries.  At the moment the ceiling is 11/- a week which means, regardless of the considerable increase in the cost of commodities, that the maximum increase which a worker can obtain in his wages is 11/- weekly. I know the arguments which have been used in support of that policy. I doubt if these arguments can be sustained in relation to wages.  In other words, has the fixing of a ceiling <Col N="419" /> in relation to wages, the effect of preventing inflationary tendencies?  My submission is that it has not and, therefore, whatever is done is in fact placing an obligation on the poorest element in the community in order to prevent the sky-rocketing of prices which the inflationary tendency eventually involves.  One could accept the principle and it has been accepted elsewhere that it is necessary to put a limit to wage increases if these were accompanied by a limitation of prices. I complain that that is not done and, in fact, I suggest that there is widespread profiteering, not merely an increase in prices, not merely an increase of 50 or 100 per cent. in prices as against, say, 15 per cent. in wages, but wholesale profiteering, and it has gone unchecked.</P>
    <P>I happened to be speaking to a manufacturer the other night, and he mentioned that he made a particular garment of child's wear.  He told me that the price at which he sold it to the shop was 10/7.  He was waiting for a bus last Saturday evening to go down the country, and while he was waiting he wandered over to a shop window and saw the garment marked 31/6.  I happened to be in a boot factory and I was shown a pair of boots sold by the factory in Dublin to the retail shop at 19/9.  The manager of the factory admitted that the retail price in Dublin was 35/-.  That, I think, is pretty general.  I could quote other instances.  No doubt certain regulations have been made for the purpose of limiting profits and margins of profit.  I am suggesting that they have not been effective while the limitations of wages are miraculously effective, with the result that tremendous injustice has been done.  I want to follow the example of the other speakers.  I do not want to have a long discussion on this Bill at this stage in view of the lengthy consideration it received elsewhere, but I do think that the Government might very well consider limiting the life of this Bill to, say, six months, so that having regard to the discussions which have taken place, and having regard particularly to the point I have just mentioned&mdash;that prices are not effectively <Col N="420" /> controlled and wages are effectively controlled there should be a limit of, say, six months to the life of the present Bill.  That would enable the situation to be reviewed, because so far as this House is concerned there is no opportunity of discussing the effects of the Bill except on an occasion of this kind.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil there are opportunities when they are discussing in particular the Estimate of the Department of Supplies and the Estimate of the Department of the Taoiseach, and so on. These opportunities do not arise here, but there would be an excellent opportunity for a more lengthy consideration of the Bill if, for instance, its renewal was proposed in a modified form let us say next March.  I suggest that it might be an advantage if the Government considered initiating the amending legislation here rather than in the Dáil.  It could receive probably a different kind of consideration which in the long run might be much more beneficial than the kind of discussion that sometimes follows a measure like this in the other House.</P>

      <P>The question as I understand it is that the Bill be read a Second Time, and on that question the general opinion I gather is that it should be read a Second Time.  I attach very little importance to some of the issues that have been raised by Senators on the opposite benches.  I think it is a great thing that the Taoiseach and the Government should now divest themselves of these powers and do so very early thereby fully rebutting any charges of dictatorship, alleged or otherwise, which might be hurled against them.  Speaking personally, and only personally, I cannot but feel that they have been a little precipitate or premature in divesting themselves of these powers.  In this connection I would like to pay a well-deserved tribute which has not yet been paid to the Minister for Coordination of Defensive Measures, for his attitude during recent years towards Press censorship.  The Minister conferred untold benefit on the country.  I am as fully conversant with censorship and its implications as anyone in this House.  I say that very, <Col N="421" /> very mildly because I know a little about it both in this and other countries.  I cannot help harking back to the censorship of other days when the protagonists of opposition to censorship were not so vocal as they are now, but let that pass.  I fear that the Government were a shade premature in divesting themselves of these powers but after all they are only human.  If they had been armed with the knowledge that we now have of the flood of phoney films and photographs which have descended on us they might not have done so.  They are not omniscient but I think if it were to be done over again possibly they would not have divested themselves of these powers.  What are we facing in the present crisis?  We have films and illustrated weeklies spreading all kinds of undiluted rot.  That is all I have got to say.  I welcome this Bill, and for my part I am only sorry that the Government have relinquished the sword which they used so sparingly and to the credit of Ireland.</P>

      <P>No one would ever guess that a gentle soul like Senator Kehoe would have used the strong terms that he has applied to the Government's move in introducing this measure.  Perhaps one has no inclination to quarrel with the views he expressed about some of the films and about the fact that the Government by the withdrawal of the censorship have made it possible for people to see these things.  I wonder how long would the Senator suggest the power of censorship should be exercised?  Is it to be so that the people would never see these things or is it his view that it is within the competence and the obligation of the Government to save the souls of the people as well as nurture their bodies?</P>

      <P>The Senator referred to <Col N="422" /> war films.  I have not seen any and I do not intend to.  I do not think they are exhilarating, but perhaps the Senator can give us some enlightenment as to what is to be done.  There are other people who can withstand these shocks.  You cannot close people's eyes and minds.  If Senator Kehoe's argument is that the Government's power should be continued to save the people from themselves it would be nothing short of a tyranny, and that would not be profitable for the Government or the people.  An aspect of this Bill that was discussed in the other House was the power of the Government to restrict the passage of people out of the country.  I am not going to pursue the general lines of the argument there.  In fact I have a different view about it.  I would like to ask a question from the point of view of getting information from the Taoiseach.  There is a problem in this country, apparently, with regard to our education and to the position of teachers.  It is being urged that the restrictive powers of the Government under this Bill are being used to prevent a considerable number of teachers who are anxious to leave the country and, in fact, have applied for permits from doing so.  I would like to hear the Taoiseach on that point and on whether the matter has come to his notice, and how far it actually affects conditions in the educational sphere. I have information myself that within a limited area a considerable number of teachers are to-day applicants for permits to go out of the country.  They have not yet obtained them.  Indeed, that is a very general position and it is said these powers are being used to restrict the movement of these people and deny them the opportunity for better employment while in fact they are restrained from bringing into their homes the incomes necessary to the standard of life which their qualifications entitle them to enjoy.  I am seeking information on this point, which I think is a matter of very considerable concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If these be the facts there is definitely a denial of the opportunity for these people to provide for their families in the way they desire.  It may very well be argued that the <Col N="423" /> opportunity to emigrate is something on which the Government can take a decision and that the power invested in them under this Bill is a matter of importance from the community point of view and the security of society.  It may be argued that this is a power that the Government ought to have the right to exercise.  I am not speaking on that issue.  This is perhaps a narrower point, but it is a point on which a large number of people feel intensely.  I would be glad to know whether in fact this is the Government policy in regard to these powers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Baxter, I too am interested in this Bill as I am anxious to get information as to how far the powers restricting the movement of certain people since 1939 are still in force.  I come from a district where, unfortunately, for economic reasons the young people have to migrate annually to Britain to get employment of a more remunerative nature and, I regret to say, under better conditions than are afforded in this country.  Some people in sheltered occupations are inclined to grow eloquent at times at the unpatriotic action of these people in fleeing from this country as if it were a plague spot.  They are not fleeing from it as from a plague spot, many are fleeing for the purposes of being able to put savings by always with a view to returning to this country and purchasing a home in which they may live for the rest of their lives.  I happen to know one such person who paid £800 for a holding in 1937, got married and started to rear a family.  Unfortunately, the economic war came along and the man went into debt.  His little farm is very heavily rated, about £1 per acre. That man was offered within the past two years lucrative employment in England and he made arrangements to have his farm worked.  By getting away he would have been able to work off the debt, but he was forbidden to leave the country and had to stay at home. I have no wish to talk about the past but in 1932 when the change of Government came about one of the strongest arguments that appealed to the migratory <Col N="424" /> labourer in the West of Ireland was the promise that the new Government would provide employment at home.</P>
      <P>I am not going to blame those who made the promise.  No doubt they were disillusioned and circumstances did not turn out as they expected, but the promise was that facilities would be given for employment on better lines than those existing in Britain and America.  No other part of the programme was more responsible for capturing the votes not only of the young people but of their parents also who were anxious to have conditions in which the children could remain at home.  I know the case is made at the present time that if you have no restriction in the case of people who provide fuel the country would be left fireless, but some means should be adopted to improve the working conditions for those who cut turf and to give them at least wages equal to what they would earn in England.  That is my concern about this Bill.  The trouble is to get suitable employment at home, and these restrictions should not obtain under the present Bill while that trouble exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a few criticisms that I took a note of.  There is a question about land, but first I will deal with that of censorship.  The censorship was absolutely necessary here.  It was necessary for two reasons: in the first place because if there was anything published in our papers which was forbidden in the papers across the water, that might have been a cause of complaint on the ground that information was leaking out through our Press and might be useful to the enemies of Britain, for example.  That was one reason for censorship and a very important one. The other reason was this: we were a neutral State and we knew that the people of this country might have different views about questions arising from the war.  These views might be held very strongly by different sections of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not been to any of the cinemas, but I have heard that since censorship was taken off, there were demonstrations on one side with <Col N="425" /> counter-demonstrations on the other side.  If you had that sort of thing happening during the war in this country and the liberty that was being given to one side was used by the other side to claim further liberty for themselves, we would have a very serious internal situation here.  We would have the merits and demerits of the war from all angles discussed and the subject of demonstrations.  One of the purposes of censorship was to prevent the warring Powers using this country as a base for propaganda of various kinds.</P>
    <P>There was no prevention here in this country of the publication of official communiques; all these were published.  Statements by responsible leaders of the Governments on both sides were also allowed to be published.  In fact, the truth is that there was scarcely anything kept from our people that genuinely could be regarded as of an informative character generally.  I know that does not affect the general principle and somebody may say; &ldquo;I do not agree; I think the principle is wrong in any case; you have got a democracy to face in all this&rdquo;.  It must be remembered that we were passing through one of the most dangerous periods through which this country has ever had to pass, a period in which the whole life of the nation was at stake, and that everything that might be published or any action that might be taken on one side, would be immediately used by the Press of whatever country might be offended by the publication of these things, to the detriment of this country.</P>
    <P>I think that the censorship has been impartially carried out here by the Minister in charge.  Of course, as I stated in the Dáil, when you act impartially at a time when two sides are bitterly engaged in conflict, each side imagines that you are throwing your weight against it because you do not allow views which it may have expressed to be published in the way they want to express them.  I think that anybody who reads the papers to-day and who read them during the censorship, will not feel, now that the censorship has gone, that there was anything really new being published <Col N="426" /> which they did not know before.  They have had examples of pictures and faked photographs.  They provide some example of the things that were stopped by censorship&mdash;photographs that were proved afterwards to be faked and which were sought to be used for propaganda purposes.  That is what this country has been saved.  Now, I am not at all arguing for the principle. We have got to accept these things in ordinary times.  We have got to allow people to judge for themselves, but in times of crisis, when passions become inflamed and when foreign countries engaged in conflicts can take offence at various things published, I think it is quite a different matter. That is all I have got to say on the question of censorship.  We believe that it was necessary in war but we are not in favour of it as a principle.  We believe it is desirable that people should be able to judge for themselves and that they should receive every expression of opinion, every dissemination of opinion, in ordinary times. That was why, immediately the real danger passed, we got rid of censorship.</P>
    <P>The next question asked was why we require powers in regard to land acquisition. One example is that we need power and authority to go in on land and cut turf for the advantage of the community as a whole.  In certain cases there has been an Emergency Powers Order to settle the basis of compensation in accordance with a previous Act.  That matter is being considered, to see whether we could do anything to arrive at a wider basis than that which we have already.  This power is also necessary in order to make our compulsory tillage policy effective.  The Government must be in a position to see that land is used for the purposes which we require.  We want to be in a position to take it over, if necessary, to see that it is used effectively for the time being.  Because we still may have to face a fuel shortage, steps will have to be taken to ensure that everything that we can do to provide fuel will be done.  There is also the necessity of seeing that land is used for the purposes of providing necessary food for the community.</P>
    <P>The next matter referred to was the <Col N="427" /> standstill Order.  That has been debated much more than any other Order made by the Government, and the reasons for it have been given repeatedly. The reasons are that if we did not hold down wages, that if wages were to rise continually, then prices would follow them and we would get what is commonly called a spiral which, it was felt, would get completely out of control.  It is really in the interests of the poorer sections of the community more than those of any other section that we want to prevent that inflation.  It is said that it is effective, unfortunately, only on one side, that it is effective in keeping down wages, but that it is not effective on the other side in which we also tried to make it effective, namely, to keep down prices.  There have been complaints made in that way, but machinery and other schemes have been established for the purpose of seeing that this profiteering which, it is suggested, is carried on, does not take place.  I suppose no machinery is ever fully effective, but I think, at any rate, that whilst it has not been effective in reducing prices or in holding them as steady as wages, at the same time there are certain factors to be considered in regard to prices.  You had material coming in from outside, the cost of which had increased considerably and you had to allow for that.  Firms were also asked by the Government, in order that there might not be more unemployment than could be avoided, to carry larger staffs than they would if they were simply working from the narrow point of view of cutting down costs and reducing expenses. That had also something to do with the increase in prices.</P>
    <P>The Minister is as alive to that matter as any member of the Seanad here can be.  The matter is constantly having his attention so as to see that prices will not go up wherever he can stop it.  Again, as regards the price of food, the cost of living has gone up considerably, but our position was that if we had not to use compulsion to an extent to which it might defeat its own purpose, we had to give the necessary inducements to the farmer to produce. I think that the farmers have responded <Col N="428" /> very well.  They have got, as I have often said when speaking to farmers, reasonable prices, and a reasonable return for their labour.  They are a section of the community, who, perhaps more than any other section, have been sheltered by the increases given in prices from the results of the war.  We had to be fair to them, because at other times the farmers were very badly hit.  We had to be fair to them at a time like this when we were putting a great deal of pressure on them, and asking for an exceptional effort from them.  We had to try to give them reasonable prices.  These prices are very much higher than the prices which obtained before the war, and they resulted in increasing the cost of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If you take the increase in the cost of living generally, and the increase in the price of agricultural produce, you will find that there has been compensation given to the farmer, so far as it is possible to judge compensation, for the increase in the cost of living more than to any other section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a section of the community I have been talking about, manufacturers and so on, and I have not been able to examine what exactly their position is, but if you take the workers or any other producers of the same type, you will find that there probably has been greater compensation to the farmers than to any other class in the community.  It was inevitable, of course, that from the fact that we produce more than we require for our own needs, generally, that we have an export surplus which, in ordinary times anyhow, regulates the price, and the farmers had to sell their produce in a market where they were up against competition from the whole world&mdash;it was inevitable, as I say, that our farmers would think that they were not getting an equal return for their labour as compared, for instance, with those working in the cities.  Personally, coming from the country, I have very often had to fight for that point of view, but I must say that during the <Col N="429" /> emergency period that has just passed the farmers were not, as they had been on previous occasions, in the front-line trenches, but were well behind the lines, so to speak.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of teachers.  In connection with this matter of the control of emigration it has been suggested that teachers have been held back.  I have not heard of any particular case, and this is the first time that I have heard teachers mentioned in this regard, but the general idea is that in the case of people who are in employment and who are needed in that employment, they should not be allowed to go.  I mentioned the principle of the thing in the Dáil.  I have not given a great deal of attention to the matter from what I might call the fundamental, philosophic point of view, but the fundamental point as regards justice and the rights of the community is first of all this: if in ordinary times an individual has been brought up and educated in the community and, in ordinary times, has got a living from the community, is it wrong in a time of crisis to say to him: &ldquo;Very well. You can get some better reward for your labour, temporarily, elsewhere, but this community will have to carry on and you will be very glad to have this community receive you back when exceptional circumstances stop&rdquo;?  Is it very wrong to say to that individual: &ldquo;You have been brought up and educated in this community; you have got advantages from it and have been provided with work in it up to the present.  Now all that you want is to go somewhere else, temporarily, to get an increase in wages, and you are going to leave our community in the lurch, and we think that you should not be allowed to do so&rdquo;?  I do not think there is any State in the world that will say that that individual has that right as against the right of the community. It is a fundamental question, and it is very hard to draw an exact line as to where the rights of the State should not interfere with the rights of the individual.  It is a very difficult question.  I would say myself, and I have not any qualms of conscience about it, in regard to any person who has been in employment here in <Col N="430" /> normal times and who, if there had not been a war on, would have continued working here, that if in the time of crisis the community wants him here&mdash;I would say that the community has the right to say to that man: &ldquo;No.  You cannot go.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to compare human rights with the more material ones, but suppose a farmer were to say: &ldquo;We can get more for our butter, our milk, or other things elsewhere, because of the particular needs that exist elsewhere. We can get all these higher prices for our commodities and, in order to enrich or better ourselves, we demand the right to export all these products&rdquo;, is there anybody who would say that the State should not say: &ldquo;No.  You cannot do that.  This community must exist and it has the right to safeguard itself&rdquo;, and say to the farmer who wants to take advantage of a peculiar situation: &ldquo;No. This community has been as fair to you as it could be.  You have been educated here and have been a member of this community, and you will have it to come back to; and therefore, because you had these advantages in ordinary times, in a time of crisis we want you and must get your services&rdquo;.  If you do not admit that, you do not admit the right of a community to maintain itself in a time of crisis at all.  If you do not admit that, you certainly cannot admit the right of the community to say: &ldquo;We will conscript you into an army and compel you, if necessary, to lay down your life in defence of the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am only thinking aloud now, so to speak, but in my opinion and from a fundamental point of view the community has a right to say to a man in such circumstances: &ldquo;No.  You cannot go, because we want you&rdquo;.  At the same time, however, the community has a duty to safeguard that person from injury to the utmost extent.</P>
    <P>Now, in regard to turf production and high wages, I think that the turf workers&mdash;those in camp and so on&mdash; were getting conditions which were beyond those which prevailed in ordinary times, and that there was a special effort in connection with the <Col N="431" /> work they were doing to give them special remuneration.</P>
    <P>I think I have touched on the points raised, in general.  There is one thing I would say about this matter.  I have been asked that we should have a different type of Bill, and there is a great deal to be said for that.  The reason is that we have not been able in the short time at our disposal to go through this very large number of Orders, to segregate them and be able to say: &ldquo;Well, this is exactly the class that we want.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have had these general clauses which were objected to very much in the Dáil, and these are still remaining in the beginning of the Act.  One would like to have these powers more definitely and specifically related to supply and distribution problems, but time did not permit of that.  I told the Dáil that I would endeavour to have that examination carried out so that we can relate them more specifically, but I am afraid we will have to look forward to these problems remaining for at least a year.  I do not see the matter of shortage of supplies being cleared up in one year, seeing that the war in the East is still on.  I do not see the supply and distribution problem being cleared within one year, and I feel that whoever is alive next year will have to come along here this time 12 months and seek for a continuation of emergency powers.  I promised the Dáil that we would examine the matter so as to have a complete Bill or one more specifically related to what appear to be our problems in the future. There is a remark that I made in the Dáil which I think it is important to bear in mind here.  In fact, there were some members in the Dáil who shook their heads when I made the remark, and that was that in fact, during this emergency which has passed, our main and most dangerous problems &mdash;I am not speaking now of threats of attack upon us; these were always in the offing and we had to make the greatest efforts to deal with them&mdash;but the chief problems, in fact, that we had to deal with were supply problems, and therefore from that point of view, nothing new has happened, and the powers necessary to deal with that <Col N="432" /> matter, I am afraid, will have to be maintained until the supply problem is ended and we have no longer a shortage of supplies.</P>
    <P>I made the promise in the Dáil, and of course it holds in the Seanad also, that when this thing comes along again I shall endeavour to have a new type of Bill.  The Departments have been told to get ready for it, to make all arrangements as quickly as possible to examine into it, but it must be remembered that our Departments are not over-staffed.</P>
    <P>There is constant pressure of ordinary work from day to day.  When you suddenly throw a big pile of work of this kind on a Department, you cannot without extra staff, and without upsetting its work, get it done very quickly.  It seems to those who have examined it, that it would take almost until Christmas, considering the holiday period and all the rest, to have such an examination carefully made.  We will then have to start to draft the necessary legislation, and to examine it carefully, and we would hardly be ready at the earliest until some time in March to bring in legislation. I would not like, therefore, to promise that we could have it before this time 12 months, and I am asking the Seanad, as I asked the Dáil, that we should be given the necessary time for the preparation of suitable legislation. It was also indicated that in the examination there should be segregation of the type of power that should be given through ordinary legislation. As the doing of all that would take time I ask the same time that we have had up to the present, that is that we should have, so to speak, another year's continuance of these powers. It may be possible to get rid of them before that, but I would not like to give any promise.  Looking to the future it does not appear to me to be by any means bright.  I am, therefore, asking the Seanad to be good enough to agree with the Dáil and to give these powers.  I have said something in anticipation, perhaps, which may affect Senators who have put down amendments to that extension of time.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="433" /> Agreed to take the Committee Stage now.</P>
    <P>Sections 1, 2 and 3 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 29 and 30, to delete the words and figure &ldquo;2nd day of September&rdquo; and substitute the words and figures &ldquo;31st day of March&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There are two amendments in my name, one being consequential on the other.  The proposal in the first amendment is that sub-section (1) should be altered in the first sentence so that the Act of 1939 would expire on the 31st March next.  I have listened to what the Taoiseach said with regard to the need for the continuance of control by emergency powers legislation in respect of supplies.  There can be no doubt that the position will not be materially improved in the near future, and, therefore, there is need, as far as one can see, for legislation of the kind for some years.  However, that is different to the type of legislation envisaged here.  Bear in mind that even if the amendments were inserted in the Bill which we are now considering there are still very considerable powers reserved to the Government under the Act of 1939.  I refer to Section 2 (1).  I do not know if Senators have looked at that Act in relation to this Bill.  Those who have done so will be impressed by the fact that if all the remaining portion of sub-section (2) were wiped out the Government would still have considerable powers, almost the powers they have now under sub-section (1) of the section.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) The Government may, whenever and so often as they think fit, make by Order ... such provisions as are, in the opinion of the Government necessary or expedient for securing the public safety or the preservation of the State, or for the maintenance of public order, or for the provision and control of supplies and services essential to the life of the community.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once it can be shown that any Act proposed by the Government is required <Col N="434" /> for any one of these four reasons there seems to be no prohibition on what can be done.  I am not proposing to take away that power.  All I am asking is that this Bill, which is to continue the Emergency Powers Act of 1939, and the amending Act should be limited to expire on March 31st next.  The Taoiseach has given reasons why the Act shall remain in force for a year, and I do not think there could be reasonable criticism for his action, but under the amendment there would be an opportunity to discuss the position as we see it.  On the other hand, the Taoiseach may be in a position to deal with a different type of Bill next February.  He may say that many of the things included in it are no longer necessary.  There is a further reason why we should have the opportunity of having the matter discussed in February.  We are asked now to agree to the Second Reading before we have really got over the shock of having agreed to deal with other stages.</P>
    <P>I know that we are at the end of the session, that everybody is in a hurry, that there are a number of things to be done, and that staffs have to be considered.  All these things are reasonable human requirements, but I suggest that it would be better if we could consider this Bill again next February and its implications rather than at the end of the session.  I seriously suggest to the Taoiseach, in the light of the circumstances I mentioned, that he might accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with what Senator Duffy said, but I have also a good understanding of the case put up by the Taoiseach.  If it meant that this Bill was to come up again next July it would be extremely unsatisfactory.  If we had an assurance from the Taoiseach&mdash;I think he has almost given it&mdash;that he would endeavour to see that a new Bill, which I gather would be of a somewhat different character, would come on two months before the end of a session, so that it could be treated as a serious Bill, and not as an Emergency Bill, I would not be inclined to support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="435" /> I want to take what seems to me to be a reasonable attitude.  I do not like September 2nd&mdash;I have never liked it as a Parliamentary date, because I have been sufficiently long in this House to know that it nearly always means that Bills expiring early in the autumn arrive in this House usually a few days before the summer holidays.  I think the Clerk of the House will bear me out that that has happened again and again.  As I said, I do not like September 2nd but July 2nd would, I feel, be a more suitable date.</P>
    <P>There is one matter I would like to mention if it is relevant at this stage. I wish the Government Information Bureau would consider issuing a statement once a month, setting out in a simple form what Orders have been repealed.  Those of us who have had to deal with emergency Orders for the last five years are all painfully aware of how extremely difficulty it is to keep in touch with changes in the emergency Orders code.  Orders are repealed or varied, but the printed copies are often not on sale for a week or a fortnight after the making of the new Order.  I know that there are good reasons for that in present circumstances, but it is sometimes rather inconvenient to merchants and traders. At any given moment they do not know exactly what has been repealed.</P>
    <P>What I am suggesting now is that the Government Information Bureau should issue a simple document&mdash;not a lengthy legal document&mdash;which would set out exactly what has taken place within the month.  This monthly statement would give the public an idea of what had happened and would enable all of us to go over to the Government Publications Office and get copies of the Orders which had been repealed. I might add that I do not want an answer to my suggestion now.  I am simply throwing it out as a practical suggestion which the Taoiseach might consider.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer to make the date December 31st, 1946, instead of September 2nd, 1946, because of the experience which we have had in dealing with Bills of this kind at the end of a session.  In the case of the Army <Col N="436" /> Act, it always ends on March 31st, while other Acts end at December 31st.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the date was not fixed by us.  We had to take a date at the time of the year the emergency began.  I quite agree that it is a bad time.  The Dáil is not in session as a rule at that time, and neither is the Seanad, so that you cannot deal with any legislation about that time.  At a time like that you are inclined to put things on the long finger, to put them off as long as you can, and you have to deal with them at the end.  I will do my best, without making a definite promise, to have this Bill next year early in June.  We will try to make that a zero date for ourselves&mdash;not to have it later than the first week in June.  Without making a definite promise, I can tell the House that we will do our best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that will be a zero date, because the Dáil usually takes a month to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I had forgotten about the length of time it takes in the Dáil, but I will try to do what the Seanad would like, to have it as early as possible so that both Houses will have a reasonable opportunity to consider it on the Second Reading and also in Committee, but I will ask the Senator not to press his amendment for the date.  I am afraid I could not accept anything shorter than the time I have stated.  It will take a great deal of pressure to get it done in that time. Although you might get temporary people from some other place to deputise for some of the men who are acquainted with this sort of work, nevertheless it does mean a very serious addition to the work of the staffs.</P>
      <P>Not everybody can do it properly, so that it must engage the attention, necessarily, of some of the highest officers.  Therefore, I would ask for the time and I think I can ask with confidence, notwithstanding all your criticism.  I do not think that anyone can say that the Government under these emergency powers has ever tried to do anything except what was considered to be in the interests of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that anyone can show <Col N="437" /> that the Government has been trying to utilise this emergency for the purpose of getting to itself any powers in a permanent way except the powers it has under the ordinary Constitution. I think that nobody will say that we were trying to use the emergency situation to get for ourselves powers of the dictatorial or authoritarian type.  I think we can be trusted as shown by the readiness with which we are getting rid of these powers which interfere with the liberty of the individual and the liberty of expression and opinion. I feel that that is evidence of what our attitude is, and I think we ought to be trusted for the remainder of the time. I ask, therefore, that the Senator should not press his amendment, because I will have to ask the Seanad not to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that I do not propose to divide the House on this amendment but I would make one suggestion.  In the early part of the year, down to the months of May and June, the Dáil is exclusively occupied, almost exclusively, with the annual estimates, with the result that this House has little business on hands.  It seems to me that the Bill might well be initiated here.  The Seanad could consider it while the Dáil was dealing with the Estimates.  I do not know if that procedure is possible but I think it is.</P>

      <P>On the section, it seems to me that sub-sections (3) and (4) are not necessary.  The Schedule to the Bill repeals No. 1 of 1940, No. 16 of 1940, and No. 16 of 1944.  Sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) deal with the situation in a way which suggests that the two Acts of 1940 are still in force, although it appears to me that when you repeal the two Acts the original Act goes back to its original state.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be sure I did not misunderstand the Taoiseach about his intentions.  The situation I take it is that the Government can do everything except certain specified things.  Do I understand him correctly to say that this is going into reverse and the new procedure is that the Government can do nothing except certain specified things?  When the time comes to consider this new legislation I feel that we should not deal with it on the basis merely of consolidating, although consolidation in this case is very desirable, the provisions of the 1939 Act.  We should also deal with it on the basis that within that time we should be able to say what type of things it is going to be necessary to control and what is necessary to carry out by Orders.  This procedure states: &ldquo;The Government can do everything except....&rdquo;  I <Col N="439" /> suggest that the new Bill should be framed in the reverse way: &ldquo;The Government should do nothing except....&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is difficult.  I urged before this Bill was drawn up that in procedure of this sort we should not seek to legislate by reference.  I agree that it is rather an ugly Bill.  It is not the type of Bill you would like to present, but it was found, from the safest point of view legally, that this was the best way to do the work and I had to give way to advice in that regard.  There is the question of the draftsman's office.  The staff there works very hard, but we cannot have it over-staffed.  I am constantly receiving complaints that we have not staff enough in that office.  Usually there is a delay in the preparation of Bills and it is sometimes attributable to unavoidable delays in the draftsman's office.  We do not like to be carrying more staffs than are absolutely necessary <Col N="440" /> to get the work through, and we have, therefore, to put up with delays from time to time.  I may take it that there is no question of amendment to this section.</P>

      <P>At the end of sub-section (1) to add new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) to suspend the operation of or amend the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act of 1936 (No. 58 of 1936).</P>
      <P>This section contains a limited number of things which definitely cannot be done under Section 2 of the Principal Act.  I understand from to-day's newspapers, although I did not see a <i>verbatim</i> report of the Dáil, that the Taoiseach yesterday made a suggestion that he thought all Parties and all sections ought to accept the present constitutional position, whether they might or might not have liked it at the time.  I do not know whether that is a correct description of what he said, but, if it is, I am in complete and absolute agreement with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that nothing would be better for this country than a feeling that so far as it is possible we will maintain our constitutional position and our external relations with the British Commonwealth as established by the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act.  If there were a general feeling that that was the case it would be extremely welcome to a large section of the community.  At the time of putting down this amendment I had not read the Taoiseach's speech.  A certain amount of uneasiness would be relieved by a clear statement of our relations with the community called the British Commonwealth.  I think the number of people who seem incapable of understanding our external and internal constitutional position seems to be almost legion.  I have found a large number of people asking me if there was any possibility that we will wake up some morning <Col N="441" /> and find that our relationship with the Commonwealth has ceased by reason of an Emergency Powers Order.</P>
    <P>My first reactions to such remarks was to say that it was quite impossible and that nothing of the kind could happen, but on closer examination of the Act I found that actually it could happen.  I cannot conceive under any circumstances that the Government would find it desirable to act in that manner, but I think it would be a good thing and that it would help towards the general acceptance of the circumstances if it were made clear that there is no intention to use the Emergency Powers Acts for this purpose.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the Senator ought to press this amendment, because I have made it clear that the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act is an enabling Act to carry out the policy which has been the definite policy of the Government from the time it has come into office.  I have indicated that is our policy, and I certainly would not think it would be wise or right to deal with matters of that sort during an emergency unless something which we cannot see should happen.  I think it would rather indicate, if inserted by the Seanad, that there was a danger we would do something of that sort.  Large questions of foreign policy, or external policy, are matters which concern the people as a whole, and I think it would be wrong, suddenly, by means of an Emergency Order to do anything of that sort. There was some suggestion, when we were talking about the exact nature of our present Constitution, by one <Col N="442" /> Deputy, that this was done behind the backs of the people.  There was nothing of the kind.</P>
      <P>This Constitution of ours was discussed for weeks in Dáil Éireann.  It was before the people for a considerable period.  There was no question of rushing it through.  It was published I think a considerable time before it was approved by the Dáil so that people were given a reasonable opportunity to consider it.  And, I think, nobody can say that we have a sleeping Opposition.  We had an Opposition during that time and every aspect of that Constitution was discussed. I do not know to what extent it was said that this is a republican State or anything of that sort.  I do not know whether there was any talk about that aspect but everybody knew it.  The External Relations Act had been passed a considerable time before that and it was for lawyers and everybody else to consider and understand what its implications were.  In any case it is of course only an enabling Act.  Therefore I would suggest to the Senator that we should leave it at that. There is no intention on the part of the Government to act in the manner which might be suggested by an amendment of this sort.</P>

      <P>While I accept the Taoiseach's assurances, there are other people who are not in this House and are not able to hear him.  I would put that point of view to him, that the very fact of not incorporating it in this Bill might, to quote one sentence in his speech which I do not think he really meant, create some uneasiness. I think the Taoiseach, on reflection, will agree that, while he said &ldquo;unless circumstances arise,&rdquo; no circumstances could arise in which he would deal with a matter of that sort by Emergency Powers Order.  He might come to the Oireachtas and ask the Oireachtas specially to rush through a legislative measure.  I do not think for a moment that the Taoiseach would deal with the matter by an Emergency Powers Order.  As I say, we are present here, and we are in a position to assess more accurately than those people exactly what may or may <Col N="443" /> not be done.  I think it would strengthen his assurance if the Taoiseach were to agree to allow the amendment to be incorporated in the Bill for that reason.</P>

      <P>There seems to be some doubt in the minds of some Senators as to the effect of inserting the amendment in the Bill at this stage.  The Act was passed in 1939, and now, six years afterwards, we are asked to put into it certain guarantees which were not asked for at any period during the war.  I cannot see the advantage of that.  It appears to me that a scare is being started by this amendment and that it is likely to do more harm than good.  So far as I am personally concerned, I would be opposed to inserting in the Bill an amendment of the kind on the Order Paper or anything approaching it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make a suggestion which may help to solve the difficulty which appears to exist in the minds of certain people.  There is a general idea that lawyers are concerned with words.  They are not. They have the greatest contempt for words.  They regard words as valuable only as representing a bundle of rights and duties.  I am not concerned in the least with words, whether taken out of a dictionary or a number of dictionaries.  I am not trying to make any cheap joke.  I am merely trying to explain this amendment. My own view is that the Taoiseach has succeeded in making an invention.  He has in the political sphere invented a new heraldic animal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think any words which have been used to describe the particular political relationships entirely fit in with the conception which the Taoiseach has arrived at.  In fact I personally believe it defies the possibility of being expressed in any one word, and it is very nearly impossible to express it in a great many words. What people are concerned about however are realities&mdash;the reciprocal relations, undertakings and agreements which exist.  For instance our doctors can practise in England and English doctors can practise here.  Ireland and Great Britain recognise a great many <Col N="444" /> qualifications which the other party confers, as existing and as having validity throughout what was once an united area.  That is the simplest way I can express it.  There are people who are very seriously concerned, lest those relationships which are sometimes courtesies, sometimes depend on agreements, sometimes depend on a tacit understanding, should be suddenly disturbed.  I think that if the Taoiseach could give this House a guarantee with regard to those mutual rights and facilities, it would go very far towards allaying the doubt which Senator Douglas has mentioned and which is widespread. I imagine that the Taoiseach could give an undertaking that relations of the type I have described, admittedly rather loosely, will not be interfered with in any way by an Emergency Powers Order or by any form of executive action without full discussion and legislative implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, of course, in a matter of this kind in the hands of the House.  Nothing is further from my mind than that this question should be made a matter of division or of any acute controversy.  That would obviously defeat the purpose which I had in submitting it at all.  The Taoiseach mentioned the word &ldquo;republic&rdquo; in connection with this.  I had not intended to raise this, but as it has been mentioned in connection with the amendment which stands in my name, I should like to say that I have not the slightest objection to the word &ldquo;republic&rdquo;, and never had.  To my mind few people in this country are interested in names of that kind, but an enormous number are interested in the political independence of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main thing is that this country shall be politically independent and that independence shall, first of all, be understood by our own people and, secondly, shall be recognised outside. That is to my mind fundamental.  I have held that view right from the time since I was a member of the first Constitution Drafting Committee.  I think the Taoiseach has seen drafts which were signed by me, and I think <Col N="445" /> he will admit that there was nothing in these drafts which would in any way be inconsistent with the independence of this country.</P>
    <P>I say that, because as time goes on, it is obvious that there is a certain amount of misunderstanding.  I have always believed, and I still believe, in close association on a friendly basis with the British Commonwealth.  I have no use for any basis of loyalties which I think do not exist.  Its only value is in so far that it will help us, first, in maintaining our independence, and secondly, in living closely in friendship with our neighbours and in maintaining our trade and industry. I think that is a proper and reasonable point of view.  The Taoiseach has pointed out, and it is perfectly correct that our present relations with the Commonwealth in so far as they can be defined in an Act at all, are to be found in the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act.</P>
    <P>It is very well recognised that not only is our constitutional position at the present time extremely difficult to define, but the relationship between the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations is equally difficult to define.  I myself was some years ago endeavouring to lecture on kindred subjects in Geneva, and I was asked for a definition of the constitutional position of the British Commonwealth. I told them I did not believe there was any such thing.  I said it was like nothing on earth, and it would only stay together as long as it worked.  I believe that is still so.  My only point in putting down this amendment is that there is an extraordinary amount of hazy thinking among people who believe that by a stroke of a pen the Government should be able to change that relationship without any reference to the people. If that was done, it would be completely contrary to everything the Taoiseach has stood for, and opposed as I have been to him in some things I do not think that he would dream of doing anything of the kind.  I do ask him, however, to believe that there are a great many people who, not through any lack of faith in him, believe that this is something that might be done <Col N="446" /> in the ordinary course of government.</P>
    <P>I think that the putting down of this amendment has served some useful purpose from what the Taoiseach has said.  If I am correct in the assumption I am making, I would ask leave to withdraw the amendment, and I take it that the Taoiseach thinks that this Act cannot be properly dealt with by emergency powers.  In other words it is an Act passed by Parliament which if it is changed should be changed by Parliament.</P>
    <P>If that is his view, personally, I do not think this is a very serious matter. The simple reason for the amendment is that I cannot see how you can deal with this Act as a temporary measure. It would be the height of absurdity to alter it until the Emergency Powers Act ends in September.  For that reason I do not think it is a serious matter.  Some Senators on the other side may think that I am exaggerating when I say that a whole lot of people got the most absurd ideas about what was happening during the week.  I laughed at it first but I found there was some foundation.  Just because there was an academic discussion in the other House, some people got all sorts of ideas for which I did not believe for an instant there was any foundation in fact.  Unless the Taoiseach says that I am not correct in my statement of his view, I am quite prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>Senator Douglas recommends his proposal by insisting upon the ardent desire he feels for an assurance as to our present relations with the British Commonwealth of Nations&mdash;I hope I am correct in that account of his position. Let us apply a simple test: suppose we accept his amendment, how is the situation altered?  In what way will the relationships at present subsisting between us and the British Commonwealth become affected?</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, Senator Magennis said that I based my argument on a desire to maintain the relationship with the British Commonwealth.  I did not do <Col N="447" /> so.  I based my case on this because I wanted to make it clear that the Act could not be changed by an Emergency Powers Order.</P>

      <P>I took the Senator as expatiating at some length on the desirability of quieting the public mind with regard to what are our relations with the British Commonwealth and the Government policy in their regard.  I proposed a simple test.  If we pass the amendment, I can see the leader writers of hostile papers busy pointing out that a vigilant and zealous Opposition has wrung from the Taoiseach this undertaking not to use these emergency powers for the disruption of the Commonwealth relations.</P>
      <P>That, I think, from our point of view is a sufficient reason why we should resist the amendment: it will be represented as a victory of the Opposition Party.</P>
      <P>Why, this very Act of External Relations was enacted by the Government. It is an integral part of Government policy.  And we are to exact from the Taoiseach a pledge that he will not by an Emergency Powers Order rescind his policy! The amendment is not quite as innocent as it sounds.  The implication in it to my mind is that by some sudden trick the Government might go back upon what has been for years its considered policy.  That policy is expressly referred to in the Constitution and that has been completely overlooked by those who have spoken of the amendment.  In effect, it asks the Government to bind itself that it will not by an Emergency Powers Order eliminate one of the Articles of the Constitution.  That is how it works out.</P>

      <P>Senator Douglas' argument is based on the ground that, to use his own words, there is hazy thinking by a number of people and these people who think hazily cannot properly understand the constitutional position in this country.  All I say is that if they cannot understand the constitutional position, we must agree that they think hazily.  Somebody said earlier: &ldquo;Thank God I am not a lawyer&rdquo;.  I am also inclined to say: &ldquo;Thank God I am not a lawyer&rdquo; because it is only among the lawyers that this hazy thinking on the constitutional position appears to exist. Having regard to the fact that all the instruments of Government and control in this country come from the people I think the people feel that for all useful purposes this is a republican State.  That is well known to the majority of the people.  Senator Douglas mentioned the word &ldquo;republic&rdquo;.  I am of opinion that the only reason the State is not called the Republic of Ireland or in Irish Poblacht na hÉireann, is that the Six Counties are not included.  As far as the Twenty-Six Counties are concerned, it is a republican State.  The <Col N="449" /> Government, in a State republican or otherwise, have a right by legislation to make provision for association with any group of countries or any league of nations according as the Government and Parliament consider proper or expedient.  I am speaking now without being a lawyer but the External Relations Act has been used by the Government to do a particular thing and if the Government have these powers they have got them from Parliament and Parliament can change that position at any time it is desirable. The Taoiseach has given an assurance that the Emergency Powers Acts would not be used in the manner suggested by Senator Douglas' amendment. That assurance should be accepted because surely a Government that would do that sort of thing would feel that it had lost the confidence of the Oireachtas and that its period of office was nearly expiring.  I do not think that is the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to say that Senator Magennis has been dealing with an Article of the Constitution from memory and was not quite accurate. For that reason, I thought I would get the Article and read it to the Seanad.  It is Article 29, Section 4. Sub-section (1) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The executive power of the State in or in connection with its external relations shall, in accordance with Article 28 of this Constitution, be exercised by or on the authority of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is, the executive authority in the State is the Government.  Sub-section (2) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purpose of the exercise of any executive function of the State in or in connection with its external relations, the Government may to such extent and subject to such conditions, if any, as may be determined by law, avail of or adopt any organ, instrument, or method of procedure used or adopted for the like purpose by the members of any group or league of nations with which the State is or becomes associated for the purpose of international <Col N="450" /> co-operation in matters of common concern.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a very wide Article.  The latter part indicates the attitude towards international affairs and so on.  It was put in because we realised that if there was to be any peace in the world we would have to have co-operation among nations and as symbol of that co-operation various methods might be used.  It was put in in order that it would be possible for us, as a State, to use any procedure that might be agreed upon for the purpose of indicating the solidarity of any particular group or association in a particular group of nations.  It did apply also, of course, to the group of nations with which we were associated before the Constitution came into effect.  It enabled us, by carrying on the External Relations Act, to continue the procedure which had been adopted to indicate our association with the States of the British Commonwealth.  Politically, the problem that faced this country was that we were quite willing to have the association, but the symbols, constitutional forms and so on which had been adopted by the States of the British Commonwealth were associated with something very different from our position.  They were associated with the growing up of colonies that looked to Britain as their mother country.  They had loyalties of that kind and so on.  We could not have loyalties of that particular type. The words &ldquo;British Dominion&rdquo; do not hurt a Canadian.  It probably would not hurt if it applied to Australia or New Zealand, but it certainly would hurt us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Again the word &ldquo;subject&rdquo; was abhorrent to us.  The idea that we could be classed as British subjects was abhorrent to us. We might, perhaps, be taking the common meaning of the word &ldquo;subject&rdquo; and not the interpretation which lawyers might put on it, but the fact was it had a connotation which was abhorrent to us.  We did not want to be British subjects and we could not have a relationship in which that could be said of us.  The question of <Col N="451" /> allegiance also came in.  We did not owe and we did not think we owed any to the British Crown.  These are things which are all right for the people of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, but which were not right for us.  The problem was that we recognised we had a number of things in common and could we get a solution which would enable us to have these contacts in the things for which the States agreed to work together?  Can we get some way by which we will have that co-operation and that association which will be consistent with our desire here to be recognised for what we are: as a mother country and as an independent nation?  That was the problem: what could we do in that regard?  We were in a certain legal position before we took up office, and that position carried all these ugly implications.</P>
      <P>I know that Senator Douglas or anybody else could argue that these things were only apparent, that they were not real, but to our people they were very real.  They were very real to me, for one.  The idea of taking an oath of allegiance to a Crown which I did not regard as having any authority here, and to which I felt that I owed no loyalty, was to me, personally, abhorrent, and it had connotations which were going to deprive me of my ordinary self-respect as an Irishman who believed in the independence of our country.  We had to get rid of these things, and the question was whether there was any method which would indicate that, although we wanted to get rid of them, we wished to cooperate with these other States in matters of common concern, and have an outside symbol of some kind, partly because we were in association, in seeing that certain things would be done, and also because there would be a great difficulty in dealing with the matter in this particular way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, it has worked.  It does not matter how strange it may appear&mdash;it has worked.  It has given us in this part of Ireland an independent republic, which is what our people want, and at the same time it has, or had, enabled us to meet representatives of the <Col N="452" /> States of the British Commonwealth as equals and to consider matters with them that were of interest to us. It enabled us, for instance, to have our Reciprocal Citizenship Act.  We are not British subjects.  We do not accept that.  Whatever Britain may say about it, we do not accept it.  I think I said on one occasion that, in view of Acts passed here, it is really impertinence for anybody to try to pretend that we are in that position. We do not accept it.  The position has been like that since 1936&mdash;certainly, since our Constitution was passed&mdash; and, as I said in the Dáil, in the light of and with a complete and full knowledge of our Constitution and all that it meant, this is an independent republic.  It was actually referred to in the British House of Commons as such, by no less a person than the present Prime Minister.  And that is what it is.  It may not have been referred to in that particular way, but it was understood.  Now, at the same time, there was an External Relations Act, and that was also understood and the whole thing was that when the Constitution came into operation in 1937, everybody would have understood what it meant. Deputy Dillon asked a question in the Dáil which, I think, every schoolboy in the country could have answered. The question he put to me in the Dáil was, in effect: &ldquo;Why did you not mention a republic?  Why did you not talk about a republic?&rdquo; The reason was that we would have had the same kind of confused thinking as we had in the Dáil&mdash;the same confused thinking or, if you like, an effort to sneer at it, as we had when Senator Kingsmill Moore got up a moment ago to speak on this matter.  He did not refer to it, as somebody in the Dáil did, as a political monstrosity, I admit.  It is nothing of the kind.  It is an effort to determine the relations of the various nations associated with the British Commonwealth of Nations, one with the other, because in the long run, these relations cannot be defined. They are the result of goodwill on all sides, and these States cannot take part with one another in an association unless they feel absolutely free to do so, if they wish.  It is a matter of goodwill.</P>

      <P>If I could imagine myself approaching this matter from the point of view of a British statesman, I imagine that he would say: &ldquo;It is not the forms that we want.  What we do want is an understanding, in the belief that we have common interests. That is the reality, but the forms do not matter to us.&rdquo;  Now, that is the difference.  The forms matter very much more to us because our struggle, over the centuries, has been to assert a certain thing&mdash;our independence&mdash; and these forms indicate to an Irishman that that thing has not been achieved.  The real thing that matters about our Constitution, if the people on both sides would understand it, is that it gives our people in the Twenty-Six Counties what they want, and, as far as the External Relations Act is concerned, it gives, at any rate, an indication of our desire to be associated in the free way in which we are associated with these States for the purpose of dealing with matters of common concern.  As I conceive it&mdash;and I think it is the view of the Government&mdash;that is a far greater safeguard than any question of law or forms, or things of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that Senator Douglas has withdrawn his amendment, because I agree with Senator Magennis that this whole thing could be misrepresented. It could be misrepresented so that it would appear that we had to be forced to do a thing which has been the deliberate policy of this Government since we came into office, which was to achieve a Constitution like this. The fact that I was asked to explain the position as it is, is no indication that the people are only now beginning to wake up to the facts of the situation and to the propaganda that was used against the Constitution at the time it was being put to the country.  It was opposed by all sorts of misrepresentations, and it was hard for the people to withstand the propaganda.  It was a big document and one, necessarily, of a legal character, and so it was easy for certain people to misrepresent it.  For example, you saw where intelligent women went out campaigning against <Col N="454" /> the Constitution and saying that if it were passed women would all be confined to the kitchens, or something of that sort.  That was the sort of campaign that went on at the time, and I, honestly, had not the heart to go out since then and controvert it because I knew that at every cross-roads in the country it would only mean the starting of the same kind of controversy and misrepresentation, if I had attempted to do so.</P>
    <P>One point that has been made was that we have not a republic for the whole of Ireland.  Now, Poblacht na hEireann conveyed to us at a certain period, when this was a legitimate, democratic State&mdash;founded, mind you, by the votes of the whole people, and not by any junta or anything of that sort&mdash;that it was a republic for the whole of Ireland, and if it was not allowed to function, it was not because there was not a democratic basis for it: it was because the Power or State that had control in this country in the past had not a democratic basis here. The Republic of Ireland&mdash;Poblacht na hÉireann&mdash;is a sacred phrase to those who worked and fought for it, and I certainly would not like to put it in our Constitution until that Constitution is effective over the whole of Ireland&mdash;and I hope to see it yet.  But even until that time comes, there should be no hesitation in people using the phrase.  The fact that the name &ldquo;Republic,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Poblacht na hÉireann&rdquo; is not in this Constitution does not mean that there is any objection to our people using it.  There is no objection at all.  In this connection I have seen it pointed out in certain newspapers that the United States of America&mdash;one of the first of modern republics&mdash;is not referred to in its Constitution as the Republic of America.  As far as the United States of America is concerned, it is called, not the American Republic, or the Republic of America, but the United States of America, just as our State is called Éire.</P>
    <P>Again, some people seem to think that the using of the word &ldquo;republic&rdquo; would constitute a further difficulty against the possibility of the unity of <Col N="455" /> our country.  Well, people who speak in that way should remember that the first republicans in this country were Northerners, and that the idea of Irish Republicanism originated in the North; and I believe that the people opposed to us there have republican ideals just as strong as we have in this part of the country.  I have not the slightest doubt in the world that the recognition of the fact that we are a republic here would not have any effect whatsoever in retarding the day, which I hope to see, when we will have a united country; and although I am getting older and, naturally, my time is getting short, I still hope to see the day.</P>

      <P>On the section, I should like to say a few words.  I do so with reluctance at this late hour. My observations arise from the very wide questions raised by the Taoiseach. I am not concerned with these forms or names.  I am concerned with the relations in spirit between ourselves and other countries, including the Dominions.  I feel sorry that recently&mdash;I think this is an undoubted fact&mdash;these relations have deteriorated. That is the only matter about which I am concerned.  I feel that the blame is not entirely on other people. I think that there is a certain amount of blame on us and I hope, now that frank and free association in dealing with all these big world problems is so important, the Government will do all they can to offer friendly gestures to people whom we should meet and with whom we should aim to secure a full measure of co-operation.  Do not let us bother whether we are a republic or a member of the Commonwealth.  We are a nation and should be in association with other nations.  We cannot <Col N="456" /> live in isolation.  Since the United States could not live in isolation, we cannot.  We should take every opportunity to allay any prejudices or feelings of estrangement which have developed lately.  We should do our best to heal any breaches and to come together in full and friendly association, without too much regard for constitutional rights or national dignity. With that, I leave that subject.</P>
      <P>I should not like the remarks which were made on censorship to pass without some further explanation.  I cannot believe, from what the Taoiseach said on that subject, that he realised what was happening.  Nobody could object to the censorship exercised in connection with the subjects mentioned by the Taoiseach. But does not the Taoiseach know that the censorship encroached on all kinds of purely domestic matters?  If the censorship had been in operation in the past fortnight, the criticism of the Minister for Local Government in connection with Cork Street Hospital would have been censored.  I give that, as an instance.  Domestic censorship would have been exercised in many cases if the powers had been in force of late.  That is an example and that is why we are so much relieved by the abolition of the censorship.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation&mdash;I congratulate myself on having provided the occasion for that speech by the Taoiseach.  He professed to correct me.  Now, I wish to point out that the External Relations Act was passed in 1936 and that the Constitution was enacted in July, 1937, and came into operation on the 31st December of that year.  The Article of the Constitution which I cited and the Taoiseach read out in full, admits, as he and I interpret it, of application to the External Relations Act previously enacted.  That is all the use I made of the Article's provisions. I did not suggest that the words I quoted from the External Relations Act were verbatim repeated in the Constitution but I described the relations in terms of the Constitution and the External Relations Act taken together.  My point was&mdash;it is too bad that I have to explain what my point <Col N="457" /> was&mdash;that the present relations between the members of the British Commonwealth and ourselves, which Senator Douglas is so anxious to preserve, would not conceivably be abolished by an Emergency Powers Order.  It would be sheer inanity for our Government to do so, as it had been a great act of statesmanship on the part of the Taoiseach to create that relationship, which has been accepted as a matter of fact.</P>
      <P>I hope that I do not appear as resenting the correction.  On the contrary, I rejoice that I made the occasion for the speech delivered by the Taoiseach; yet I do feel a certain tenderness with regard to the suggestion that, I do not know the Constitution.</P>

      <P>Personally, I have no objection to the Final Stage being taken now, but it is quite unfair to Senator Duffy to say that there was agreement to take all the stages to-day. There was no agreement to go further than the Committee Stage.  I do not want to be taken as opposing the proposal that the Final Stage be taken, but it is not fair to say that there was agreement on the subject.</P>

      <P>I quite understand that there should be an interval between Second Reading and Committee Stage or even between Committee Stage and Report Stage to give Senators an opportunity of putting in amendments.  However, since we have arrived at the present stage of the Bill, I think we ought to finish it unless Senators desire to establish some principle.</P>

      <P>If I might make a personal appeal to the Seanad, it is very awkward when I have to make appointments to have to say that I cannot be sure whether I can keep them or not, if I have to be in the Seanad on the same day.  Having put my hand to the plough to deal with this Bill, I should like to finish it, unless the Seanad considers that it would establish a precedent and wants to make sure it would not happen again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to press the matter further.  I must confess that I find it much more difficult to do so after the Taoiseach's personal appeal.  Nobody here wishes to resist a personal appeal, but the fact remains that a number of Senators had no reason to think that all stages of this Bill would be taken to-day.  In this case, possibly, that might not happen, but some of us feel that this has occurred on several occasions, but as Senators who are present heard the <Col N="459" /> discussion it seems that this might be treated as an exceptional case.  It has happened in this House when we put through all stages of a Finance Bill, that it inconvenienced a number of Senators who could not be present.  It is not out of sheer cussedness that the point was raised.  I am inclined to let this Bill go through on this occasion, but I ask the Taoiseach, unless the case is an exceptional one, not to come again with a personal appeal for all stages of a Bill to be taken on the one day.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be the odd man out, and so I withdraw my opposition.  I said what I conceived to be in the interests of the House and of members, so that they should make themselves acquainted with what is contained in the Bill and take a serious interest in their duties.  In view of what has been mentioned as far as I am concerned, I have no further opposition to what is suggested.</P>

      <P>In reference to what Senator Magennis said, I asked leave to withdraw the amendment before he spoke.  There was an implication that there was some earlier ulterior motive in putting it down.  The Senator said that certain things could be implied from amendment.  As far as I am concerned I put down the amendment in good faith.  It was done at my suggestion, because I thought discussion would be helpful.</P>

      <P>If there is to be blame I accept the blame.  In connection with the remarks of the Taoiseach, with which I am in agreement, it is important to those who took a small part in the early life of this State&mdash;as he knows, I was interested in the constitutional <Col N="460" /> question then&mdash;that we should not have continued differences of opinion as to what was or was not the position here ten or 20 years ago. I think that many things have contributed towards the final recognition of our political independence.  My personal opinion is that the greatest step towards recognition of our political independence was when Professor Berriedale Keith wrote a letter to the London <i>Times</i> in which he noted that there were certain words omitted from the Constitution as then published.  As everybody knows, that Constitution was supposed to represent a compromise.  It was not submitted to the original drafting Constitution Committee and did not completely satisfy anyone.  The circumstances were different, as we were threatened with civil war at the time. He pointed out that that Constitution did not give the Irish Parliament the sole and exclusive powers to make laws for the government of this country.  I saw that and, when I went to see the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins and pointed it out, he said he thought it was vital. Eventually, the then sitting Parliament here put these words in, with general agreement.  The net result of their acceptance by the British Parliament was a firm act of renunciation, which stated that no Parliament could make laws for this State but this Parliament. I believe it was because that was done that the External Relations Act and the accompanying Acts could be passed and Britain could do nothing about them.  I think we ought to recognise that as No. 1 in the way of political achievement towards independence.  If we can say that we have reached a constitutional position which no Party now proposes to change, we may have reached a stage which would be regarded as stability.  If we have not that stability, I do not think we can make steady progress in any direction. At some point, we must have constitutional stability in this State.</P>
