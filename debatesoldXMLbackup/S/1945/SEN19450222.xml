      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 25, to add at the end of Section 5 the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;Provided always that a sufficient capital sum shall be left in the fund to provide income adequate to defray the deficits of voluntary hospitals on the basis of the year 1944&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I told the House yesterday the reason for putting down this amendment.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will not make this a sort of question of personal antagonism, because I think I am being quite fair in asking him to give us further enlightenment on this matter of the hospitals' deficits. On the Second Reading, the Parliamentary Secretary said&mdash;I take no exception to what he said&mdash;that the hospitals should take steps through the corporation to put those poor patients on a paying basis.  I pointed out the difficulties in bringing that into practice. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary, having slept on it, will admit that I am entitled to a reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A poor patient comes along to the outpatients' department of a hospital. The doctor says: &ldquo;This patient should be an intern patient,&rdquo; and in due course, under the hospitals' charter, under the hospitals' traditional practice of taking in our people, that patient is taken in without question. If the Parliamentary Secretary's proposal that the corporation should pay for those patients is to have effect, the hospital authorities must go to the corporation and say: &ldquo;We have taken in A.B., and we want two or three <Col N="1370" /> guineas a week.&rdquo;  The point I am trying to make is that the patients must come in the first instance through the dispensary system.  What happens in the country is that a patient goes to the dispensary doctor; in due course a case is put up, the county board of health agrees to his going to the hospital, and a payment is made.  Some system of that kind must apply in the city in order to make the thing workable. For that purpose, the dispensary system must be made effective.  I may be told that there are dispensaries. But they are not effective; they are not large enough, and in practice the poor patients do not go to them; they go to the outpatients' department of the voluntary hospitals.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with that point.  He says that the hospitals must go to the corporation, and he says he will aid them in their approach, but I really feel that it is for his Department to put pressure on the corporation to take the first step by setting up a working dispensary system.  That is the first step.  I shall be glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward) Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to find that Senator Sir John Keane has adopted quite a reasonable attitude on this amendment.  We are dealing with a Bill to provide sanatoria, and an important feature of our scheme will be the provision of dispensaries.  I understood, when Senator Sir John Keane talked in a rather vague way about dispensaries last evening, that he had in mind dispensaries under our tuberculosis schemes.  Now, I understand that he is concerned about our dispensary system under the Public Assistance Act, particularly in the City of Dublin.  He has no radical objection to the principles involved in the policy I have outlined, but he is concerned as to how it can be made operative.  I cannot outline to the House a scheme of operation that will, undoubtedly, work smoothly, but my case is that so long as we continue to pay the deficits of the voluntary hospitals and fail to put pressure upon them to reduce those deficits in the only way <Col N="1371" /> we can see they can be effectively reduced, so long will those conditions obtain and the deficits not be reduced.</P>
      <P>For years I have been trying to impress on the voluntary hospitals the urgency of doing something practical in this matter of their rising deficits. A scheme cannot be worked out until the necessary contact is made between the parties, the voluntary hospitals and the local authorities which will have to contribute towards the maintenance of their patients, and I am not suggesting, and have not suggested at any stage, that the local authorities should pay the full cost of the service that is provided. I do not believe that it is conceivable that any local authority could pay the full cost.  The services provided in the City of Dublin, particularly, are not purchaseable.  We have nothing to compare with it in the provinces at all. It is a voluntary system in which all these eminent physicians and surgeons place their services freely at the disposal of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I am suggesting is that the local authority make a contribution, not towards the treatment of their patients, but towards the maintenance of their patients in these institutions.  I do not think there is anything wrong in that principle.  It can be worked out as soon as the representatives of the voluntary hospitals and the local authorities come together and set themselves towards finding a solution to the problem. Senator Sir John Keane feels satisfied that it is my function to insist at the outset that the local authorities should take action in this matter.  I rather think that the initiative ought to be taken&mdash;I agree with him to that extent &mdash;by the voluntary hospitals.  After all, it is scarcely in accordance with our experience of life to hope that the local authority so long as they can get service completely free will come forward and say: &ldquo;We want to pay three guineas&rdquo; or &ldquo;We want to be afforded the privilege of paying two guineas towards that amount.&rdquo;  I do not think they will do that until the authorities of the hospital make it clear that they cannot continue to provide the service <Col N="1372" /> without some contribution from the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any detailed debate in the House will help towards a solution.  Everybody is anxious to find a solution.  The voluntary hospitals themselves are anxious to find a solution and I do not want to suggest that Sir John Keane is constituting himself a busy-body, but I do think that if we had less public discussion on this matter until the difficult aspects are more fully examined by the people who are now beginning to examine them for the first time, we would have a better prospect of making headway.</P>
    <P>I have reason to believe, and I think some Senators have reason to believe, that there is a better understanding of the position now, and that an effort will be made to find a reasonable adjustment.  Consequently, it might be wiser if we did not pursue this matter too far on this particular Bill.  Again, of course, I do not know that I can contribute anything very helpful as to how the agreement might, in fact, operate.  I concede, immediately, if it is necessary that I should concede it, that the public assistance system in the City of Dublin is far from satisfactory.  But we cannot overhaul that system within a year or two.  It is one of the problems I have set myself, and whether I will be there long enough to solve it or not is another question.  If not, somebody else will take it on where I left off. Anybody who knows anything about the operation of the system is not satisfied that it is working satisfactorily, but other machinery could be set up for the easy admission of patients of all classes for whom the local authority should take a share of the financial responsibility.</P>
    <P>Machinery other than the dispensary system might be employed.  It may be possible that, through the bed bureau, a system of admission to hospitals could be worked out.  I quite agree with anybody who contends that to operate a satisfactory admission system entirely through the dispensary service in the City of Dublin would scarcely be feasible.  I take it that the Senator has put down this motion <Col N="1373" /> for the purpose of extracting, let us say, a statement.  I thought I had said nearly everything I could say on the last occasion, and I certainly did not intend any discourtesy to the House. I did not think such a charge could be levelled against me.</P>

      <P>I do not want to embarrass the Parliamentary Secretary in negotiations going on at present.  I am sorry that I should have given the impression of discourtesy&mdash; I did feel a bit irritated by his refusal to answer.  I am sure the Parliamentary <Col N="1374" /> Secretary appreciates that an efficient dispensary system would very much reduce the expenses of the hospitals.  Obviously, one of the big expenses of the hospitals is the outpatients' department, and if the main strain is taken by the dispensary system it will save the deficits.  I do see difficulties in sponsoring a meeting between the hospitals and the corporation. Would the Parliamentary Secretary consider sponsoring such a meeting and even presiding at it? Unless the convening comes from the Department, it will not be very easy to arrange such a meeting.  That is all I have to say, Sir, and I should like the leave of the House to withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few remarks to make on this stage of the Bill.  I do not want to detain the House very long except to say that I thought I recognised in the discussions yesterday a sort of anxiety in regard to the Bill at which, I am glad to see, the Parliamentary Secretary has hinted and quietly resisted.  At all events, there was an impression left on my mind that there was a sort of anxiety to rush the matter through&mdash; at least, it seemed to be suggested by some Senators&mdash;without, perhaps, very full and complete consultation with the local bodies concerned.  I think we are all wise enough to realise that if the Bill is to be the success which we all desire it to be, that can only be achieved after the fullest and most careful consideration so that practically everybody connected with a public body will bring his goodwill to bear upon it.  Speaking on behalf of the smallest county in this country&mdash; smallest in area, at any rate, but containing a population of 64,000 people, and with two towns of a population approximately of 16,000 and 18,000 respectively&mdash;we find an increase in the number of tuberculosis patients that have to be attended to, and I must admit <Col N="1375" /> that in the past, in County Louth, we have not reached the measure of success which we would like to have reached.</P>
      <P>In that connection, I venture to suggest that we have had the best medical service at our disposal that could be had in the land.  During my experience, we have had four or five county medical officers of health who were as good as could be found anywhere and who did their best to deal with this matter, but, for one reason or other, their efforts or their schemes were not availed of.  For some reason or other, the people in this country are not hospital-minded and have never jumped to the orders of the county medical officer of health in the way we would desire.  Therefore, I hold that if a general urge is going to be made on the Ministry to rush up the rates for this purpose, a prejudice will be created in the minds of these people against the scheme.  I have seen suggestions of 1/- in the £, or something like that.  Now, obviously, this cannot be expected to take place at once, and if an increase in the rates means the imposition of greater hardships on our people, that will only make the people, and particularly the poor, more susceptible to the disease.  The various public bodies, I am perfectly certain, will try to balance the matter faithfully and well, with the little means at their disposal.  They have done so in the past, and I am not without hope that they will continue to do so in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that the Parliamentary Secretary has a difficult path to tread; it is beyond his resources or those of any Minister or Ministry, or of any body of people, to eliminate this problem at once, but we all wish to give him our support.  In this connection, I am of opinion that an ideal sanatorium would be one situated amongst the trees, and in a part of the country where there would be a nicely adjusted temperature, where they would produce their own milk, butter and, so far as possible, their own food.  I would also suggest that, wherever possible, such sanatoria should be staffed by the members of a religious community.  To <Col N="1376" /> my mind, the best service we could hope to receive would be from such people who have built up and carried on hospitalisation for so many years, and I might give, say, St. Vincent's Hospital or the Mater Hospital as an example here in the city.  I may say that in my own county some years ago I sold two demesnes, one to the Dominican Convent and one to another religious community in Drogheda. These institutions are equipped to send out people all over the world, to serve the needs of black men, red men or yellow men, and I am perfectly certain that it should be possible to get girls here to devote their lives to the treatment of tuberculosis at home.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary realises that, and I only mention it by way of trying to assist him in arriving at the decisions he will have to make in order to make the scheme for the treatment of tuberculosis here sufficiently stable and attractive to the poor.  It is a very big problem, and its solution will not be reached in an hour or a year.  Realising our responsibilities in this matter, I think that the fullest and calmest consideration should be brought to bear upon it between the Department concerned and those who have to foot the bill.  That is all I wish to say on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Bill finally passes, I want to say a few words, particularly as I was interested in what the last speaker said.  This Bill is a very useful step forward towards trying to remedy the incidence of tuberculosis in this country, but a complete policy for the permanent eradication of tuberculosis from our midst must be more than merely remedial. Such a policy must seek to remove the fundamental causes of the disease, and the first and most necessary step in that direction is to isolate the patients suffering from that disease so that they will not be a source of infection to other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, I welcome the proposals contained here, but, in addition, I should like to emphasise the importance, apart from this matter of isolation, of better housing, better nutrition and better clothing for our <Col N="1377" /> people if they are to maintain a state of health that would be likely to enable them to put up a successful resistance against the incidence of this disease.  In that connection, I think that, of the two, better nutrition is perhaps more important than better housing, and a policy of better nutrition is not only complementary to the remedying of tuberculosis, but also complimentary to the remedying of other diseases, so far as our national policy is concerned.  I think that a certain cookery book mentioned, as part of the recipe for cooking jugged hare, that you must first catch your hare, and then cook it.  Along the same line, before we can have an adequate policy to deal with this disease, we must increase the national income of our people so that they can have proper nutrition, housing and so on, and I think we should expand the national income for that reason, and especially that part of our national income which is derived from agricultural production.  That, directly or indirectly, is a necessary step in the improvement of the standard of living of our people as a whole.</P>
    <P>I may say that, in another capacity, I have been very much impressed by the room that there is for expansion in our national income as a result of the development of our own national resources.  I think that it could be doubled, or even trebled, within the next 20 years or so, and I believe that if we could do that, we would be able to create an environment favourable to our agricultural development and very much against the present conditions which are so unfavourable to the health of our community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not speak on the Second Stage and I would like to say that I entirely agree with the remarks that have been made with regard to the particularly helpful way the Parliamentary Secretary dealt with the Bill.  Not only in the way that he dealt with this Bill but in the information which he saw fit to give the House on matters pertaining to the subject, but which are not strictly connected with the Bill.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary was exceedingly wise in doing so because apart <Col N="1378" /> altogether from his courtesy he brought out quite a number of points which are not fully understood.  If I might make a suggestion it is that I have a strong feeling that if propaganda notices which appear from time to time were to start with the simple statement that tuberculosis is curable it would be a wise step.</P>
      <P>If you once get the people to believe that it is curable then everybody will think twice about staying away from the doctor.  On the other hand, you have the opinion, which is far too prevalent, that: &ldquo;I have a family; I have dependents; I will be able to stick out this for a bit and they will be better off. If they once think I have tuberculosis nobody will want me and I will never be able to get employment.&rdquo;  I have found that attitude and it is a fairly common view.  I know comparatively little about advertising.  I have always been puzzled by it, but I do know that a great deal of money was made by simply stating: &ldquo;Tyler's boots are the best&rdquo; and things like that without any attempt to prove it.  I have a strong suspicion that if it was impressed on the country that tuberculosis is curable that would be the starting point and would be much better than present publicity.  I am not so much criticising present advertisements as saying that the other course would be better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary made it very clear that while this Bill was essential he felt they must almost immediately consider the problem of the bread-winner&mdash;I would go a little further than the bread-winner&mdash;who is taken from work and see that some provision for his dependents is made, because it is not in the public interest or in the interest of the person concerned or his family that the present state of affairs should continue.  The Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, I think wisely, that if the State takes a man away from his work it is not only for his benefit but for the benefit of other people who are thereby removed from the danger of infection. It is, therefore, reasonable that the community should be considered as sharing in that benefit.  I take it that the Parliamentary Secretary has under <Col N="1379" /> consideration at an early date some method by which allowances may be made to dependents.  I do not know how far he has gone into the matter, but he is probably not in a position to make any statement now.  I am not asking him to do so, but I would like to see much better consideration given to the possibility of employment for persons who suffer from tuberculosis. Senator Duffy made some reference to Papworth and said that there should be a farm adjoining or connected with each new sanatorium.</P>
    <P>I think the Senator said that any other kind of employment such as takes place at Papworth would not do here. I do not agree.  I was interested in watching the very praiseworthy effort that was made at Peamount.  The Parliamentary Secretary need not be worried.  I am not going to try to reopen that question, but I was given figures and looked into the matter pretty carefully.  I am satisfied that £500 a year would have kept these industries going.  The total number given employment by that means was relatively small, but to have given adequate payments to the dependents would have cost considerably more than £500 a year.</P>
    <P>I should like to see some small committee, with probably representatives of the Department of Health, one or two men with industrial experience, and one or two of the doctors who have been advocating the finding of employment for people suffering from tuberculosis appointed and, without committing the Government to anything, considering whether it would not be possible to provide a scheme of employment in some cases partially and in other cases wholly.  Senator Duffy said that conditions were different in England, and he gave that as a general reason why a scheme like that at Papworth would not be suitable. Of course, conditions are different, but our people are not so different.  The vast majority of them would rather earn the money that was being paid to their dependents and feel that they were earning rather than getting a State grant.  I am not foolish enough to think it would be immediately <Col N="1380" /> practicable to provide employment for all who come into the sanatoria, but I am suggesting that there would be a great deal to be said for some settlement or industrial concern more or less on those lines.  I would like to see three or four of them in this country and work paid at normal trade union rates.  If they worked only half the time they would get half the rate. I would like to see articles required in the country produced there.  I would like to see it run on ordinary business lines.  It could only be run on ordinary business lines if the difference was made up by a grant or by some other means to cover any loss from partial employment and from having to pay trade union wages to people not able to do whole-time work.</P>
    <P>Closely allied to that is what is called occupational therapy.  Dr. Duffy gave a lecture, and dealt with the problem, and other doctors are interested in it.  Dr. Duffy told me himself that some form of work of the nature of occupational therapy would be very helpful indeed.  I do not want anything I am saying now to take away from my approval of the Bill, and certainly not from the approval that I have given to the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary that he was going to try to make it easy and more beneficial from the point of view of a man who has dependents to be taken into a sanatorium in the early stages, instead of waiting until it is too late. I do suggest you would add to the satisfaction of many of these people, and that it would probably cost less money to the State as a whole if some kind of work could be found.  We have had an experiment which had many drawbacks, but which I am satisfied was not a failure at Peamount, and we have the experience at Papworth. There is a settlement in Switzerland, and others on the Continent, including the Scandinavian countries. There is one, I think, in Sweden, and with the experience to be gained from these, plus taking into account our conditions here, it might be possible to do something.  I can easily understand the actual reluctance of the Department of Health to take on this matter as part of their functions, but <Col N="1381" /> I think the Parliamentary Secretary might very well consider whether it would not be wise to get one or two enthusiastic doctors like Dr. Duffy on the medical side, and a few intelligent men with business experience, with some officers from the Department, so that they would keep in touch with Government policy to see if they could not make some proposal.</P>
    <P>They might say that it could not be done, but I think that they would make some proposals, and that those proposals might reduce the cost, not of this Bill, but of later expenditure which the Parliamentary Secretary says is an essential part of the whole scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. S.T. Ruane Mr. S.T. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, before the Bill becomes law, to make a few observations on it, not in a critical spirit, but with a desire to be helpful. My remarks are shared by practically all those in my native county who are associated with the work of public bodies, and especially by those endeavouring to arrest the spread of tuberculosis.  This Bill will lead to the adoption of many methods for preventing the spread of this disease.  In those activities, I hold that the medical inspection of schools should play a very important part.  Unfortunately, colds contracted by school-going children develop in many cases into acute tuberculosis.  If it were possible to have those colds attended to in their early stages, much would be done to prevent the spread of this disease. The medical inspection of schools should make a substantial contribution towards the success of this work. As the work is carried on in my native county, and in practically every other county, only the fringe of the question is being touched, because the officers concerned have multifarious duties of other kinds to perform.  The medical inspection of schools comes in for little of their attention, because they have not the time to give to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Britain, school children are examined twice a year by a competent medical officer.  While I should not expect to reach that standard, arrangements should at least be made by which there would be an annual medical inspection of school children. <Col N="1382" /> In my own country, there are between 360 and 370 schools, and the school-going population is 27,000. Though school medical inspection has been operating for the past ten years, only the fringe of the matter has been touched.  I am of opinion that very little has come of the inspection because of the limited time which can be devoted to it.  Instead of an annual inspection, the doctor can attend only once in five years.  With a view to more frequent inspection, a scheme was devised in my county some years ago, with the co-operation of the county medical officer of health, by which dispensary medical officers would be linked up with the inspection. The idea was that, in the initial stages, the county medical officer of health would visit the schools, and that subsequent visits would be made at least once a year by the dispensary medical officers.  These officers are in touch with the health of their districts. Oftentimes, they are present at the births of the children who attend the schools.  They see them when they are being vaccinated and at other times when they are visiting their parents' homes.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the scheme was turned down by the Department on the ground that the carrying out of school medical inspection required special training and experience and that the proposed scheme would not secure the co-ordination which was necessary for the provision of treatment and the keeping of proper records.  The keeping of records would remain with the county medical officer of health and the scheme provided for that.  We all understood that, in the early stages, there might be a certain amount of discrepancy between the opinions of the dispensary officers regarding nutrition and so forth but, after a while, coordination would be reached as a result of their consultations with the county medical officer of health.  We all fervently hope that this Act will be a success.  It will have the co-operation of every body in the country, especially those who understand the ravages which the disease is making.  Therefore I trust that a trial will be given to the scheme drafted in Mayo for linking up the dispensary medical officers <Col N="1383" /> with the county medical officer of health.  I believe that valuable information would be gleaned in that way and that that information would make the efforts for checking this disease successful.  It is the opinion of those in touch with those matters that good results would follow from adoption of the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Patrick O'Reilly Mr. Patrick O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Patrick O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I said nothing on the Second Reading of this measure, because I took it that it would be an agreed measure and that, therefore, a number of Senators would be anxious to speak on it.  I should like to make a few points on the Bill at this stage. It is generally agreed that the Parliamentary Secretary has taken the first step in combating tuberculosis.  For that reason, he has been congratulated. While this is the first step, we are all agreed that the next step should be the provision of maintenance for the dependents of people stricken with the disease.  I should like that any scheme to provide such maintenance be administered by a machine controlled by the tuberculosis officer in each county. If it were administered by the home assistance officer we would be putting the badge of home help on it and it would not have the favourable reaction we should like it to have.  In some respects, it might retard applications from people for the assistance to be given.  That would be a very bad thing, because it might prevent the reporting of cases early enough to ensure proper recovery.  I should regard it as very important that the scheme be administered by somebody other than the home assistance officer.</P>
      <P>As regards the cost, I take it that it will mean some extra burden on the local authority.  Because the Parliamentary Secretary is responsible for local government, I should like to point out that, while local authorities are anxious to co-operate so far as possible in the scheme, a number of them are reaching saturation point so far as the compilation of their estimates is concerned. In making up their estimates this year, a number of county councils had to strike a rate of around 18/- in the £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1384" /> The extraordinary fact is that these counties are very often the poorer counties.  I am aware that in County Mayo the rate is 18/2 in the £, while in County Leitrim it is 18/0½ this year.  I am told&mdash;I may be quite wrong in making the statement&mdash;that it is 24/- in Kerry.  If that is so, having regard to the extra burdens that are being placed year after year by the State on the shoulders of local authorities, I am inclined to take the view that some measure to re-distribute the burden more equitably would have to be devised.  Take the Arterial Drainage Act which was passed by this House a week ago.  In my opinion, that will place an extra burden next year on the shoulders of local authorities.  I agree that the system of raising money on a valuation basis is equitable within a county, except perhaps in the case where a widow might have a big farm and might not be able to make proper use of it.  It would be very hard for me or any member of the House to suggest an alternative scheme that would raise the same amount of money without creating greater hardship.  For that reason I say that the valuation system of paying rates is equitable within the different counties, but I am prepared to say it is not equitable as between the different counties.  A county with a very low poor law valuation has generally more commitments in the way of public health services and a hundred and one other things for which local authorities must take responsibility, than counties with larger valuations.  Such county may have to bear a greater burden in home assistance and to send more patients to sanatoria.  That is a very serious position having regard to the comparatively low taxable capacity of these counties.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary has already examined this question.</P>
    <P>In my opinion some measure will have to be adopted to arrange a more equitable distribution of the burdens between the different counties.  In the administration of this scheme, I think that as far as possible an effort should be made to enlist the co-operation of the dispensary doctors so as to ensure early diagnosis of the disease.  The county tuberculosis officer may not be <Col N="1385" /> able to get the same results as could be obtained by proper co-operation with dispensary doctors.  The dispensary doctor is called in to treat every type of case and it is he who would be normally consulted in a case of tuberculosis. It is through him that the machine should begin to work if we are to secure early diagnosis and treatment to ensure a satisfactory recovery.</P>
    <P>Much has been said or could be said on the location of sanatoria.  I myself might be inclined to take the view that all sanatoria should be situated on the east coast, having regard to the fact that the climate is more suitable, but then there would be the possibility that people might not wish to travel long distances and in the long run it might be better to have them located in areas which the patients would not regard as being too far away from their homes.  I agree that if you try to remove all the patients from the West of Ireland to the east coast you might find unwillingness on the part of people affected to go there.  For that reason the matter is one for the Parliamentary Secretary and I am sure that he will have regard to all aspects of the case in deciding where the sanatoria are to be located.  I do not think there is anything further I can add except to say that we hope that this first step forward will be followed by other steps and that the Department and the Parliamentary Secretary will meet with success in combating tuberculosis.</P>

      <P>I have only one brief point to make.  It arises partly out of the statement made by Senator Douglas to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should consider propaganda in favour of the idea that this disease is curable.  I should like to add my suggestion that he would consider propaganda to the effect that the disease is preventable.  I think that is the right place to start and I am reinforced in that opinion by a very important and interesting statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary in his reply to the Second Reading of the Bill.  Listening to Senator O'Donovan talking in this <Col N="1386" /> House as a veterinary surgeon, sometimes one feels slightly frightened about the dangers to our health by contracting disease through live stock, not that I think the Senator is as much an alarmist on that point as he was perhaps some years ago.</P>

      <P>The Senator is getting more mature and his judgment is better balanced.  The Parliamentary Secretary, however, was very definite in his statement with regard to the incidence of tuberculosis of bovine origin.  It was very comforting and I was rather surprised that the Press of the country did not make more use of the statement.  In fact it was necessary to do so to combat a great deal of the propaganda that has been going on inside and outside the country on this very vital point.  The impression we drew from what the Parliamentary Secretary said is that the origin of tuberculosis, as far as milk is concerned, is very limited in its scope.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that if he went out and told the people that thousands of cases of tuberculosis could be prevented if people drank more milk, it would be the soundest doctrine he could propagate. I am convinced of that myself. I believe that people, and especially children in farm houses as well as in town houses, have nothing like a proper realisation of the value of milk as food.  I am not speaking without knowledge of what conditions in Ireland are, or without having information or the ability to make comparisons as between conditions in one farm house and another.  I am absolutely satisfied that the health of the people could be considerably improved if more attention were paid to the drinking of milk by young people.  I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary this aspect of the question requires urgent consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad to see that the go-ahead people in University College, Cork, have taken steps to make a social survey down there.  I think if the Parliamentary Secretary would ask them to examine in their survey <Col N="1387" /> the situation especially in regard to the consumption of milk over the area, whether it be partly city or partly rural, the information we would obtain would be startling indeed.  I hold very strong views on this question.  I was greatly encouraged by the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to the purity of our milk supply on the whole, but I am satisfied that it is not as good as we could make it. I hope, on the other hand, that Senator O'Donovan and his colleagues in the profession will be given a chance to make it more pure than it is.  I believe it could be brought to the point at which we could be all sure that we were drinking milk under conditions in which it would be 100 per cent. free from disease.  In the meantime I am convinced that the soundest doctrine that the Parliamentary Secretary could preach and the best propaganda he could spread throughout the country, in order to combat the dangers of tuberculosis, would be that all the people, especially in rural Ireland, should drink more milk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I was greatly relieved by the attitude taken up by the Parliamentary Secretary to-day on this question of the voluntary hospitals.  I am very pleased to hear that he is in favour of negotiation between the hospitals and the local authorities.  I think that is all to the good.  The Dublin Corporation spends something over £390,000 per annum on public health services.  That is a very big sum for the City of Dublin&mdash;excluding County Dublin altogether.  The sum for the current year is £343,000, under the heading of public health services. I do not know whether the people could bear another £100,000 and remain solvent. Included in the £343,000 there are grants to all the voluntary hospitals totalling something in the neighbourhood of £5,939, which is altogether too small, in my opinion, and leaves plenty of room for negotiation.  I submit, Sir, that it is a matter for negotiation. I am sure the Dublin Corporation would be willing to increase those grants to the voluntary hospitals very substantially, rather than be coerced <Col N="1388" /> into contributing £100,000 per annum, or increasing the rates by 1/- in the £. I would point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that, to my own knowledge, there is very little co-operation between the voluntary hospitals.  It would be extremely difficult for anyone to initiate a conference between the corporation and the voluntary hospitals, so I suggest that he or his Department might take the lead in getting them together to discuss this matter on a friendly basis.  I was very struck by some of the suggestions made up to now, particularly in the case of the Senator who talked about bringing all the tuberculosis cases to the east coast.  I think the great bulk of the tuberculosis cases are there already.</P>

I said that should be decided by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make is that we laymen should not trespass on those matters.  Up to now, the highest percentage of tuberculosis cases in Ireland is to be found on the east coast.  I do not know what would happen if we were to bring more of them there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, there are two notable omissions from the Bill.  There ought to be more information as to what provision is to be made for the maintenance of dependents.  If satisfactory information on this point were made available, it would be possible to get after the disease in its early stages when the possibility of cure is much greater.  It is well established that this disease is preventable and curable. Senator Douglas suggested that posters might be got out telling the people that the disease is curable.  I want to relate a little experience which I had recently.  I was presiding at a lecture on T.B. by Dr. Duffy, a man who is very closely in touch with this subject.  One of the audience stood up and asked everybody present to look at him.  He had been a victim <Col N="1389" /> of T.B., but fortunately he was in employment where he was well looked after, and during the period of two years while he was undergoing treatment the company by which he was employed paid his dependents 35/- a week.  He was a perfectly healthy man as he stood up there to prove to the people present that T.B. is curable. The company which paid his dependents during all that period deserves the highest praise.  If that were done more frequently we would have a far greater number of T.B. cures.  The point I want to make is&mdash;that instead of merely telling the people that T.B. is curable, we should go around and prove to them, by photographs or personal appearances, that that is so. I am sure a great number of people who have been cured of the disease would, in their gratitude, be prepared to submit themselves to a personal demonstration that T.B. is curable.</P>
    <P>As I say, one of the things missing from the Bill is provision for dependents. In the second place, we have not been told, as far as I know, how soon any of these sanatoria will be in operation.  It occurs to me, that before the first bed is occupied, five years or so may have elapsed.  Some provision ought to be made for extra bed accommodation in the meantime.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas, in speaking about Peamount, advocated the running of industries in those institutions on business lines.  In connection with that aspect of the matter, we must not forget that at the present time we have something in the neighbourhood of 100,000 unemployed people.  If we are going to set up industries on business lines in those institutions, and allow them to enter into competition with outside concerns, I do not think it will get us anywhere.  I do not think we should lose sight of that aspect of the matter.  In Peamount, there definitely was competition with outside workers. The institution had the advantage of subsidies and so on, and the outside people could not compete with them. That is perfectly true.  I know it myself.</P>

      <P>In reading the outstandingly able and ardent speech with which the Parliamentary Secretary concluded the Second Reading in this debate, there arose in my mind a deep regret that the lessons contained in that speech were not made available for the general public.  That feeling, evidently, has been shared by other speakers.  Certainly, two or three sentences could be taken from that speech. Boiled down, it would be a most effective method of propaganda for starting off the attack which we are going to make on tuberculosis.  The lessons of that speech ought to be made available to more people than those who have an opportunity of reading the Parliamentary Debates.</P>
      <P>There are two or three statements in particular which have already received comment.  The first was reiterated by Senator Douglas that tuberculosis is curable.  That should be broadcast widely, and it should also be made known that it is preventable. Those should be our slogans, and we should also lay emphasis on the fact that tuberculosis is not hereditary. People have a great dread of it, and, accordingly, approach it in a fatalistic frame of mind, because so many are convinced that it is hereditary.  I know a splendid young girl who was engaged to be married, but the engagement was broken off because some of her people had died of consumption.  There is no trace of consumption in her, yet her life is ruined.  That should be brought home to the people, so that everyone will be convinced that it is not hereditary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking of the cure of tuberculosis as the object of this Bill, there are two or three factors that have already been stressed in this debate.  The cure of tuberculosis is not merely a physical cure.  There is a spiritual and psychological aspect that has to be taken into consideration.  I, myself, have had a rather melancholy acquaintance with <Col N="1391" /> sanatoria.  As we know them, they are very lonely places.  The patients need all the help they can get to fight against depression.  For that purpose, the influence of religion is very helpful and, therefore, I was glad when Senator McGee spoke incidentally of the desirability of associating some specially trained religious orders with the conduct of sanatoria.</P>
    <P>Another thing that the people I knew complained of was that the days seem so long.  It is most important, not from a mere economic point of view because that would not be an objection, that the time of the patients should be occupied.  There is no reason why they should not be trained to use their hands.  We all remember that during the internment period in the camps a lot of our young men acquired great skill with their hands.  They flooded the country with brooches, rings and ornaments and these were made by people who never did anything like it before in their life.</P>
    <P>When these young men come back to their homes, there may be cheap electricity, and it may be possible to repeat in rural Ireland what was one of the strengths of rural France, namely, the carrying on of occupations by cheap and abundant electricity.  The training for that is very good, all sorts of arts and crafts might be developed, but apart from that, the training would fill the long and melancholy days. When you are working, work is life, particularly when you are working with your hands.  I join with Senator Douglas in pleading with the Minister to attach importance to this aspect of the cure, and to keep it in view.  Once more, I wish, on behalf of the women of Ireland, God speed to the Parliamentary Secretary in the great task he has taken in hands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryBarniville" hpid="Mr. Barniville Mr. Barniville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barniville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid this House is very definitely affected with tuberculosis.  I am not going to deliver a lecture on the care or treatment of it, because I think that is not the point at issue.  The Parliamentary Secretary, speaking as a medical man, has put us on the spot.  When he puts up the proposition of sanatoria throughout the country for the proper <Col N="1392" /> care of tuberculosis, we must naturally agree 100 per cent.  We cannot raise our voices against it, and we all welcome it, but one of my problems is the question of the financing of this wonderful institution.  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the number of 4,300 beds.  Now, I have not got a census of the bed population of Ireland for ordinary diseases, but I would point out that there are other diseases besides tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>I am complimenting the Parliamentary Secretary on any efforts he can make in combating this curse of tuberculosis, but there are diseases like cancer, and there are broken legs to be mended.  There are patients who require urgent treatment in hospitals throughout the country.  These other diseases we shall always have with us. My point is that it is not a question of treatment, rehabilitation and rest of patients at the moment.  This is a Tuberculosis Bill to establish sanatoria for the treatment of tuberculosis patients.  I have a feeling that the Parliamentary Secretary has got the bit in his teeth with regard to this £8,000,000 he has in hands, and he is going to spend that sum on bricks, mortar, concrete and cement, rather than on staff, equipment, fuel, warmth and care of the patients for two or three years after their treatment in that sanatorium.</P>
      <P>I am afraid he is going to take too much out of that £8,000,000 for that particular disease.  I shall be unpopular if I am quoted in the Press for that, because I should be 100 per cent. in support.  Nevertheless, I say that there are other things to be considered. If the Parliamentary Secretary is going to build sanatoria with 4,300 beds, with a 500-bed hospital costing roughly £250,000, it is going to take a considerable amount out of the funds we have, and I think we ought to consider carefully the facts of bricks and mortar deficits. My hospital, I am informed by an accountant, is the cheapest hospital in Ireland, and our deficit is the lowest, considering the number of patients.</P>

      <P>Might I interrupt the Senator to give some information?  It is not proposed under the Bill to provide <Col N="1393" /> 4,000 additional beds.  The total aimed at is 4,000.  We have about 2,000 of them already, and it is proposed to provide an additional 2,100.  I might also say that it is not proposed to build these institutions in the same elaborate constructional manner in which voluntary hospitals have been built and will be constructed in the future.  We are aiming at a simple type of construction.  On pre-war figures, the average cost of a bed in a voluntary hospital would be about £1,500.  Post-war, the equivalent will be £2,100 or £2,200.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barniville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but I was just referring to previous speeches.  However, the point I am on is this.  I should like to make a plea to the Parliamentary Secretary, who has control of something over £8,000,000, to reserve as much as he possibly can of that for housekeeping money, even in the institutions that he has at present.  It is a queer thing to say, but we have an excellent hospital&mdash;I am referring to the Mater Hospital&mdash;and we have plans to build a new 500-bed hospital in the neighbourhood during the next few years.  I say that, from the point of view of the public, from the point of view of the patient and of medical treatment, it is much more important to have that patient properly fed, clothed, and kept warm in his bed, than to put him in a hospital with chromium, glass screens, and all the rest of it.  In other words, I make a plea to the Parliamentary Secretary to reserve as much as he can of the money for the proper feeding and warmth of the patient, even if it is only in a hut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point that I want to mention is that, speaking as a medical man, I do not like this term &ldquo;voluntary hospitals&rdquo; that has existed since the sweepstakes started.  Now, what is meant by a voluntary hospital?  The <Col N="1394" /> patient is voluntary; the religious people who staff the hospitals are voluntary, and the medical staffs who work in these hospitals are voluntary&mdash; they work for nothing.  I know most of my colleagues in Dublin, and I am certain that not one of them knows whether a patient is paying a shilling a week, £1 12s. 6d. a week, £2 2s. a week, or whether they are paying any thing at all.  That term &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; is completely misunderstood, and I should like to say that these sweeps &mdash;I shall not say, these accursed sweeps&mdash;have ruined us in the sight of the public.  I know that I have not made one penny as a result of these sweeps, and I am quite sure that neither has any other medical man nor any charitable committee made a penny out of them; and I think it is a pity that the public and the Oireachtas&mdash;and I am afraid that this is also true of the Parliamentary Secretary, although he is a medical man&mdash;should have lost sight of the fact that these institutions are voluntary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak on this measure, being a non-medical man, but having heard a number of other non-medical men speaking about it, I thought I might make a few remarks.  Under Section 7 of the Bill, where the Minister transfers to one county authority his estate or interest in the land on which a sanatorium has been established, he may require the county authority to pay him, for repayment to the Hospitals Trust Fund, a certain contribution, up to one-third.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary that, if there is to be a demand on the local authority, it should be for a nominal amount.  I think that the application of the Trust Fund for this purpose is a very good idea.  I have a very different view from Senator Barniville's view on that matter.  He seems to want to have it reserved to the Dublin hospitals, but I think it would be better to have it reserved to hospitals, in general, and use it for general maintenance. As has been pointed out already, the cost will be very big.  Take the case of the proposed hospital in Galway.  I understand that Deputy <Col N="1395" /> Beegan was right when he stated, in the other House, that it costs about £200 a year to maintain each bed.  In the case of a hospital, such as is proposed in Galway, with a 400-bed accommodation, the annual cost of maintenance will amount to something over £80,000 a year.  Now, that hospital, I understand, will have to deal with four very large areas, and if four hospitals were concerned, dealing with each of these areas, the cost would be very much larger.  For that reason, I think that the cost should be borne entirely out of the Sweepstakes Fund and that the local authority should have only a very nominal amount to pay towards the erection of the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ruane has referred to the question of medical examination of the children in the schools, and I agree with him in that view.  We have, for instance, a very large county&mdash;the second largest in Ireland&mdash;and to deal with that huge area we have only one county medical officer of health and one assistant medical officer.  If they were to examine every school in the county, as far as I can make out it would take them over two years to do so, and that, certainly, is not sufficient. In America, I understand, they have a very different system.  The teachers in America, I am led to believe, are given a certain amount of medical training, and every day, at a clap of the hand from the leader of the class, the children in these American schools march out and are examined with regard to their eyes, throat, and so on. I should like to see something like that obtaining here, and I should like the teachers to have the power, if they see anything wrong or suspect anything wrong with the children, to call in the local dispensary doctor who, as Senator Ruane has said, knows the family history of the child and will be able to say what is the cause of the complaint.  In that way I think we would be enabled to go about the remedying or the prevention of this disease early in life.  There is no doubt that tuberculosis is a curable disease. At least, I hope it is, because I myself had it when I was young, and I <Col N="1396" /> am now cured&mdash;or I hope I am, at any rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I hope so, but I should not like to be brought around as a specimen.  Now, there has been a good deal of talk about the prevention of this disease, and I think that that is very important.  Somebody told us the other day: &ldquo;Oh, we never heard about tuberculosis in the old days.&rdquo; No, but you heard about a neglected cold or what used to be called &ldquo;a decline&rdquo;.  I do not know whether a neglected cold might be the cause of this disease or not, but I do believe, because I have heard it from medical men, that people who have colds are more likely to be infected, and, therefore, if colds could be prevented or taken care of in time, it is probable that tuberculosis might be prevented to a large extent.</P>
      <P>I often wonder why there is not more tuberculosis or rheumatism in this country, in view of the carelessness of our own people.  We have a damp climate, and yet it would seem that very few of our people realise the necessity for keeping bedclothes or their ordinary clothes dry.  Somebody told me the other day that in some parts of this country the bedclothes are aired only once a year.  If that is the case, it really amounts to the execution of the people in that house. It would appear that people generally in this country do not realise the importance of having dry bedclothes, dry underwear, and dry outer clothing, and I think it is very important that our young housewives should be taught, as they are in other countries, that these things are very important. I think we should have more of that kind of education here, because I believe that it would have an important effect on the prevention of the disease.</P>

      <P>Like many other speakers, I had not intended to speak on this stage of the Bill but, as on many other occasions, Senator Baxter's remarks have brought me to my feet. Apart from that, however, I should like to express the opinion that we have had a very interesting debate on the subject of tuberculosis, although that is practically outside the scope <Col N="1397" /> of the Bill that is now before the House.</P>
      <P>When I spoke on this Bill I said I did not think I could add anything very new to what had been said, because we were dealing with the construction of sanatoria.  The debate, however, ranged over a much wider field than that, and to good purpose, if we have all learned something, and if the public outside learned something both in the sphere of prevention and of cure of this disease.  Necessarily, I have to intervene on account of the remarks of Senator Baxter.  I have looked at the official report of the debate, and I found that the Parliamentary Secretary has not in any way referred to the incidence of human tuberculosis of bovine origin.  He did refer to what I said, and he used these words: &ldquo;Now, it is always well in connection with such a matter that we should endeavour not to lose our bearings.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Well I have never lost my bearings in connection with it, and I want as a final word to emphasise that I do not in any way attach the same importance to human tuberculosis contracted from the bovine subject as to that contracted from other human beings. Necessarily it is in a secondary position. I never want anybody to believe that I have lost my bearings or that any of us lose our bearings in that connection, but I do know people who have taken every possible precaution against infection from tuberculosis. We all try to do it as far as lies in our power, but if you question any of these people about what is the source of their supply, you find they have never once thought of it.  I agree with Senator Baxter that there is nothing better for us than milk.  There is nothing better for the people of the country, and for the citizens of Dublin than to drink more milk, if they are satisfied that in drinking that milk there is no danger of contracting disease.  The danger is small, but it is there, and if the milk is infected with tubercular bacilli they are bound to get it.  They will know if they are subjected to the tuberculin test.  They may not become patients or clinically infected with tuberculosis, but the danger is there.  The point I <Col N="1398" /> did make is that we have no definite statistics to show what is the percentage of human tuberculosis that is of bovine origin.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to lesions in the glands.  Take the Cappagh Hospital for children.  It is full of young patients.  I can say the majority of them are there from tuberculosis of bone origin but I cannot prove it.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with that.</P>

      <P>That is so.  We should have statistics and it could easily be done by typing cases to give us statistics.  I could quote statistics from Dr. Griffiths in Britain but here we have not these statistics.  I want to say again that I have never lost my bearings on the matter.  It is secondary to human tuberculosis contracted from a human subject, but I must emphasise at the same time that it would be a pity if, coincident with the campaign against tuberculosis generally, we did not keep this matter in mind. The percentage in the bovine subject is very low.  The figure is 8 or 9 per cent. of bullocks or heifers infected with tuberculosis.  When we come to milch cows that are housed, the percentage rises.  Our cattle are healthier than cattle in England or anywhere else but that is no reason why we should not make them healthier.  The percentage in cows is about 35 per cent., which is less than in a human subject.  That does not mean that every one of the cows is secreting tuberculosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, and for the benefit of the House, would the Senator tell the House if, in fact, a very small focus in the bovine subject will give a positive reaction to the tuberculin test?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. S. O'Donovan Mr. S. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I <Col N="1399" /> was coming to.  I say that 35 per cent. of the cows infected does not mean that every one of these is secreting tubercle bacilli.  They have a focus of tuberculosis that will give a reaction but the cows are perfectly safe for the time being although they are a potential danger that the disease will spread. I will say from post-mortem examination that the lesions in the bovine subject seem to be progressive.  We get very few cases in which the lesion is calcified and healed up.  We do get this in the younger animals, but the fact is that it would seem to be more progressive than apparently it is in the human subject.</P>
      <P>I have no experience of post-mortem examination of a human subject but I know in this case it is only a potential danger.  I would not like anybody to think that when I say 35 per cent. of the cows are infected that these cows are secreting tubercle bacilli.  The percentage doing that would be .2 per cent. or two cows in a thousand.  We have had cases of cows primarily infected in the udder and there was no lesion elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I only want to emphasis that it is to be regarded as secondary and should always take second place, but we must keep it in mind in our campaign against the disease as a whole. I hope I have gone sufficiently into it so that no member of the House would think that the reaction to a tuberculin test in cattle is any more indicative of danger to other animals than our reaction of 70 per cent. means that we are a danger to the other 30 per cent. who do not react.  We react from a focus that may never give any clinical evidence that it is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other point that struck me from the various items mentioned in the debate is that I have often found that cow keepers, whether they are dairymen in the city or farmers, have only one thing that they get for nothing and they are inclined to shut it out. The only thing they get for nothing is the thing they try to exclude.  I think through the country as a whole people are too much inclined to shut out fresh air and sunshine from buildings which would be far drier and more comfortable if they allowed the sunshine <Col N="1400" /> and fresh air into rooms that are otherwise closed to daylight.  I was not going to speak but for the remark of Senator Baxter that I seemed to be far more complacent about this question than I was previously.  I have not lost my bearings in connection with it. I regard it as a very serious thing for the country and until we can get all the cattle free from tuberculosis I would not consider the situation satisfactory. That can be done by degrees. We have discussed the approach to the matter and, ultimately, I hope that we shall reach that stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary, when replying, to give us a little more light as to the nature of the proposed hospitals and their equipment.  I have been in a sanatorium for a considerable period.  So far as my observation went, the treatment of tuberculosis is not very expensive.  An eye has to be kept on patients to see that they are not developing any &ldquo;side&rdquo; illnesses but, so far as my observation went, what a tuberculosis patient wants are plenty of food, plenty of rest, plenty of fresh air and graduated exercise. None of these is extraordinarily expensive and they do not involve very much in the way of expenditure on buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have known a very successful sanatorium which was conducted in hutments. Nor is the question of warmth so very vital, either, because I have often wakened up with snow piled upon my bed.  If one is a great deal in the open, it is extraordinary how one becomes inured to cold.  I could not tolerate the same conditions now but, at that time, I was inured to cold.  The treatment of tuberculosis&mdash;I am not talking of surgical cases but of the ordinary incipient case in which there is a certain infection of the apexes&mdash; does not require very much money.  I am anxious that, under this scheme, we should treat as many people as possible as cheaply as possible.  When I say that, I do not mean that anything should be skimped but rather that a certain amount of the money available might be more effectively employed in giving necessary treatment to a large number of people than in providing expensive, <Col N="1401" /> over-elaborate equipment and unnecessarily elaborate buildings for a smaller number of people.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give us a sketch of the kind of sanatorium he envisages and an indication of the demand which it will make upon the available finances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish briefly to refer to a matter I raised on the Second Stage.  This is only one aspect of the medical needs of the country. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will have the whole of the medical services for the future examined in a comprehensive manner.  In that respect, I suggested the appointment of a commission.  I am not really wedded to a commission.  What I want to see is something in the nature of a White Paper, setting out the long-term policy as regards medical services.  I trust that, not only in the medical department but in relation to all our future activities, such White Papers will be circulated and receive ample comment in the Press.  This is the system now being employed in Great Britain.  To my mind, it is an admirable method of handling such questions.  People write to the newspapers regarding the White Paper.  The Government then come to Parliament with only a resolution, approving the principles of the scheme contained in the White Paper.  There is a discussion in Parliament and, as a result of the public discussion and the discussion in Parliament, legislation is introduced.  I hope that not only the Parliamentary Secretary but those in charge of other Departments will consider that method of approach to reform and development in the future. In that way you get public opinion prepared, you get the general criticism in Parliament and, finally, you get a Bill which is much more likely to evoke agreement than would otherwise be the case.  I press that suggestion upon the Parliamentary Secretary and I hope he will prove to be a pioneer in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Nearly everybody who has spoken to-day introduced his remarks by explaining that he did not intend to make a speech.  I might make the same remark, because I thought I had said everything necessary <Col N="1402" /> on this subject in the two very detailed statements I made in the Dáil and in the correspondingly detailed statements I made in this House.  If Senators had read those statements or if they had been present when they were made, a great deal of the discussion we have had on the Fifth Stage would not have been necessary. I do not say that in any complaining spirit, but I do not intend to go over the matters which I have already treated in very considerable detail.  Some points were raised to-day, however, which call for further elucidation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the question of a tuberculosis settlement on the lines of the Papworth Settlement in Britain.  The House, apparently, concluded from my treatment of a suggestion by Senator Duffy, that I was radically opposed to any such development here.  I rather think, from the tone of the discussion here, that I must have created the impression that I was opposed to the idea of occupational therapy.  It is well we should get our minds cleared about both these matters. I have no fundamental objection to the Papworth Scheme or to the establishment of a corresponding scheme in this country, except the objection that is rooted in the belief that such a scheme would not succeed here.  As I said on one of the many occasions on which I have been speaking on this subject recently, I do not believe that our people will ever take kindly to the settlement idea.  I may be wrong in that but it is my firm conviction that the settlement idea would not work successfully except, perhaps, in large centres of population, such as the City of Dublin, and we have not many such centres.  We hope to bring to our regional sanatoria patients requiring institutional treatment from very large areas, and I cannot picture the possibility of inducing those people to settle for ever in the sanatorium, or its neighbourhood&mdash;and not only to stay there themselves, but to bring up their families and make their homes in an area isolated from the rest of the community and looked upon as a tuberculosis colony.  The time may be reached when that system will operate <Col N="1403" /> here but I do not believe that we shall see that time.  Possibly, it would be a good thing if people could get over that type of prejudice but what we have to deal with in our plans is the probability of the people affected cooperating with us so that those plans may be successful.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy precipitated this discussion by suggesting that in connection with each sanatorium we should acquire land for the purpose of engaging patients in the sanatorium in farm work.  I indicated to the House that I did not approve of that, or that I did not believe that medical opinion would approve of it, because during the treatment stage, farm work is much too heavy for the average patient, and it entails exposure to weather, etc. Occupational therapy is a different matter.  Patients who would be in a comparatively good state of health prior to their discharge would certainly find some difficulty in occupying their bodies or their minds during that time. I should like to suggest&mdash;again, this is a personal idea that will have to be subjected to the criticism of other people who are better equipped than I am to determine what is the best line of treatment in the matter of occupational therapy&mdash;that it would be a good idea, particularly in regard to patients whom we take up from the provinces, if we trained the men, say, in such useful accomplishments or arts as the soleing of a pair of shoes, the making of a wheelbarrow, or the mixing of paints, so that if possible we would send them home to their families more useful members of the community than we got them.  That is my idea of the type of occupational therapy we should adopt, not the idea of mass production of anything, not the idea of entering into close competition with people who are legitimately engaged in the production of certain classes of goods, but the idea of training these people, in fact, of putting them through a system of vocational education.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the case of the female patients, I think we should be doing very useful work if we taught young girls how to turn the heel of a sock, if they did not know how to do so already, <Col N="1404" /> and how to cook, or taught them something about food values, something about domestic economy, personal hygiene and domestic hygiene. If, for example, we also were able to send them home with more than an ordinary knowledge, if not an expert knowledge, of poultry keeping, I think we would be doing really good work. These are my ideas, and these are the ideas I propose to submit to and urge upon the people who will be administering these schemes.</P>
    <P>They are not ideas that have been formed on the spur of the moment. They are ideas that have worn themselves into me after a considerable amount of thought on every aspect of the problem.  If it can be shown that these ideas are not sound or that there are any dangers in them to the success of the scheme, that is another question. All I can say at the moment is that I believe they are practicable and that it would be a good thing for the people concerned to put them into operation.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator Baxter&mdash;I am not quite sure; if I attribute it to Senator Baxter and that he did not emphasise this point but that other Senators did, he will understand&mdash;who made the point to-day that we should emphasise, and continue to emphasise through propaganda, that the disease is curable.  That is one of the things that I have been harping on for quite a long time.  There are three points to be considered, and I think Senator Mrs. Concannon emphasised them too. We cannot repeat them too often and we shall have to keep repeating them until certain classes of our people listen.  The first is that nobody is born with the disease, that it is not hereditary. The second is that it is curable, much more curable than a very big number of diseases that, as I have often said before, always have been looked upon as curable, and that in fact 90 per cent. of the people who contract tuberculosis get better without knowing that they have ever had it.  That is a staggering but a scientific fact.</P>

      <P>Senator Johnston has just mentioned the importance of taking the disease early.  Other Senators have emphasised the same thing.  We must concern ourselves, if we are to succeed, more with the prevention of the disease than with the cure of it.  I could not work up half the enthusiasm I have for this difficult task&mdash;and I am full of enthusiasm &mdash;if I did not feel that we were tackling something that we can do.  Tuberculosis is preventable.  That is the point that Senators should carry away with them, that if the germ of tuberculosis can be removed from infecting our people then tuberculosis is finished with.  There is no reason other than the limitations of finance why we should not reach that position.  It can be done if we have sufficient money.</P>

      <P>We get into a difficulty when we look around to see what particular stocking we are going to raid. We were warned about the Hospitals Trust Fund that we cannot go too deeply there.  Somebody told us to beware of the rates, not to raise the rates any further, and I am sure the Minister for Finance will tell us not to come to central taxation wherever we go.  That is the sort of difficulty I am going to find myself up against, but I think in the long run, by a fair distribution of the financial burden over the various sources we have available, we shall find a solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of nutrition has again been mentioned.  I fully emphasised the importance of it in previous statements, but again this is a matter that cannot be emphasised too often.  Let me once more avail myself of this opportunity to appeal to Senators, and to appeal to anybody whom my words can reach, not to over-emphasise this question of malnutrition&mdash;not that it is not scientifically sound, but the ordinary <Col N="1406" /> man in the street does not look on malnutrition from a scientific point of view.  If we talk about malnutrition in the case of tuberculosis, the ordinary man in the street will conclude that it is only people who are not well fed who contract tuberculosis. You know as well as I know the difficulties that confront us because of the prejudices that have been created as to the untouchability of people suffering from tuberculosis in the past.  It has been the one great handicap, and we have not succeeded in getting over it as yet.  If the impression goes out that tuberculosis is evidence of poverty, of failure to get sufficient food to maintain health, you are going to have a new stigma attached to it, and, as certain as I am addressing the House to-day, the tuberculosis patients of the future will be ashamed and afraid to disclose that they are suffering from tuberculosis, because their neighbours will say: &ldquo;If they were properly fed they would not get it.&rdquo; I should like your assistance in this matter.  We realise the proper setting for malnutrition, but the ordinary man in the street does not.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the question of nutrition&mdash;I am sure I mentioned this before, but I will mention it again lest some Senators may have missed it&mdash; we are looking into this question, and at the present time I am in close touch with the Medical Research Council with a view to establishing, if we can establish, nutritional standards.  If we had the nutritional standards agreed upon, I would then proceed to have some investigation made at any rate of our nutritional state, to see in how far we may be suffering from certain mineral, vitamin, or other deficiencies in our diet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Parliamentary Secretary expect a decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter of establishing standards is a very difficult and intricate problem.  As I said previously, you cannot just take up the standards that apply in another country where the conditions are different, where the ordinary diets are different, and automatically apply <Col N="1407" /> them in this country.  We have to work out standards which are applicable to our own people.  When, for example, it comes to estimating the minimum requirements of the whole host of vitamins which are now known to medical science, we realise at once that we are entering into a very complex scientific domain. I cannot then go further than to say that this big and difficult problem is at any rate being examined with a view to tackling it effectively.  It certainly will not be for want of goodwill that we will fall down on it.</P>
      <P>The importance of the inspection of school children has been mentioned. Well, we cannot have a whole, full-dress debate on general public health policy on this Bill, which is merely intended for the purpose of giving us power to provide sanatoria.  Another opportunity will be available to the House I would say within the next six months.  A Public Health Bill has already been introduced in the Dáil.  I have had to handle this measure, and I have on hands another very comprehensive measure which will occupy my attention&mdash;the Mental Treatment Bill. As soon as I get that out of the way, I will be coming along with the Public Health Bill, and Senators will have an opportunity of discussing all aspects of the question when that Bill comes before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once again I want to join issue with the people who talk about the badge of home help, the stigma of home assistance.  This is another of those things about which we ought to have more intelligent thinking.  I am not speaking in any personal sense of the Senator who raised this matter, but I think we have not yet developed the proper approach to this question of relief out of taxation.  I cannot see any stigma attaching to financial relief or relief in kind financed out of local rates that does not equally attach to corresponding relief which is financed out of central taxation.  I wish Senators would assist us in getting a healthier and a better informed public opinion on that matter.  If our poor are legally entitled&mdash;and they are both legally entitled and morally entitled&mdash;<Col N="1408" /> to sustenance, and to proper institutional accommodation and treatment when they are ill, what is wrong with calling upon local taxation to help to finance it that is not wrong with calling upon central taxation to help to finance it?  There is nothing in the world wrong with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>But instead of encouraging the patients to take that different view, we must encourage them to take an intelligent view of it.  When we come to that difficult question as to whether those various social schemes should be financed out of central taxation or out of local taxation, we get into a problem which provides material for a very interesting debate.  We need not debate it at any length here to-day. In general terms, I myself prefer the local taxation, from a social point of view, to the central taxation.  I am sure lots of people may disagree with me on that.  But can they tell me the things which ought to be taxed in order to provide the money?  Am I to tax tea, am I to tax sugar, am I to tax tobacco, in order to finance any of those schemes?  If we have to tax any of the essential commodities, that tax will fall more heavily on the poor man than an imposition which will be graded down in accordance with his valuation and in accordance with the estimated value of his real estate.  I will not develop that any further to-day, but will ask Senators to think over how it would work out for the poor man, with five or six or seven of a family, if we put a tax of 1d. or 2d. a lb. on tea or sugar, or if we put a tax on his tobacco.  I may be told: &ldquo;Put it on income-tax.&rdquo;  That may be all very well up to a point, but there are members of the House who will advance the view that there is a limit beyond which you cannot increase income-tax either.</P>

It is a very interesting matter to debate, but is not altogether appropriate to this Bill.</P>
      <P>Everybody is strongly in favour of maintaining the bread-winner and his dependents.  There is nobody more strongly in favour of it than I am.  But everybody says: &ldquo;Spend plenty; treat them generously; but do not increase taxation and do not increase the rates.&rdquo;  Now, I want Senators to consider the matter before I come here again, and tell me how I am to treat them generously.  How am I to provide for the dependents of a man who has a wife and six or seven children, and who must be taken into a sanatorium in order to save his wife and children and save the community, if I do not put on taxation somewhere?</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter emphasised the value of milk.  I do not know if he was in the House at the time, but he drew a fairly long speech from Senator O'Donovan.  By the time he had finished, I think we had got at most of the truth.  I do not suggest that the Senator gave it in any grudging way, but in any case we got down to the truth that about 2 per cent. of our milch cows are a danger to the community.  That is the important thing which we should register here. <Col N="1410" /> Do not run away with the idea that not only are human beings reeking with tuberculosis but that the cattle are reeking with tuberculosis, too.  I suppose the next conclusion that foreigners might draw about it is that it is the close relationship between the Irishmen and the cattle that accounts for the high percentage of tuberculosis. We have to get away from that offensive conception.</P>
      <P>Senator Foran raised the matter of how soon we hope to have any of these institutions in operation.  In present circumstances it is a very difficult question to answer.  I will not undertake to tie myself down to any time limit.  I can only promise the House that as soon as it is humanly possible to provide these institutions, they will be provided.  What that means when it is translated into bricks and mortar remains to be seen, but it will not be for want of pushing, at any rate.  I will be disappointed, I may say, if I have not this Dublin institution occupied within two years, although Senator Foran was giving me five.  However, I may be disappointed, but I will do the best I can to provide them with the least possible delay.</P>
      <P>There are a couple of small points left.  One of them I might not bother about, because it is a matter over which we have not any control.  It was referred to by Senator Baxter and by Senator Mrs. Concannon.  That was a note of complaint that more publicity is not given in our daily papers to such an important discussion as the discussion on tuberculosis.  I do not see that we can do anything about it, but it does seem extraordinary in this neutral country that whole pages can be given in to-day's paper and tomorrow's papers to tell us about the progress on the Eastern front and on the Western front&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is not that we want publicity&mdash;I am not a publicity man, and I do not care tuppence if they never mentioned my name in the Press.  In fact, I avoid it, but I do agree with <Col N="1411" /> the Senators who mentioned it that it is a matter of vital importance, in view of the fact that there is so much prejudice to be worn down and so many things that we cannot say often enough.  If we do not get the assistance of the Press in publicising these facts, we cannot get the message home to the people.</P>
      <P>Senator Kingsmill Moore raised the final point with which I wish to deal. He raised the question of the type of the institution and its general lay-out. Again, I can only deal with it very briefly and convey some idea.  Let us take a 1,000-bed hospital.  It will be laid out in ward blocks, say, 40 such blocks, and there will be a central hospital unit that will serve the entire institution, a proper hospital unit as distinct from the various ward blocks where the patients will rest between the periods when they will require hospital treatment.  A number of cases will require pneumo-thorax or surgical treatment.  They will be brought into the hospital unit for the treatment, but it will not be necessary to keep them there for more than a week or ten days.</P>
      <P>They will then be brought back to the ward block, and in that way the hospital unit will serve the whole institution. The unit will be staffed by the most highly qualified staff we can provide.  Similarly, we will have the unit as well equipped as it will be possible to equip it in present circumstances. If we are not able to do everything perfectly at first we can remedy it later on.  We shall have to be satisfied with the best provision that can be made, with a view, when times are more favourable, to securing better equipment that may be necessary in order to complete our scheme.</P>

      <P>I would like to make the remark that the Senator's name goes more readily into the Irish tongue than either the Minister's name or my own name.  It is possible that he is racially and psychologically the best Irishman of the three of us.  I would like to believe that the ideals to which he gave expression in his speech command a certain amount of sympathy in the breasts of many of us, though I can understand that there were certain things he said which annoyed you and with which I, personally, would not agree.  However, I approach this matter from the point of view of keeping to the facts of the case as closely as I can and, if possible, emphasising those aspects of the matter in which the debate rambled rather farther away from the point of the motion than was appropriate.</P>
      <P>The first fact to which I would draw your attention is a geographical one, that the Minister comes from County Armagh, just as I come from County Tyrone.  I suspect that he and I are willing exiles from that part of the country and willing residents in this part of Ireland, but that is about all we have in common.</P>

      <P>A well-known Irish judge said about 30 years ago with reference to County Armagh in the month of July, following Cicero, <i>Inter Armagh, leges silent.</i>  In other words, there is no such thing as law in the County Armagh.  That may be a libel on the county in question, but if there is any element of truth in that statement, it accounts for a lot of things, and it accounts, in particular, for the mentality of the Minister who is a typical product of the County Armagh, in the sense that he is incapable of appreciating the arguments and rational considerations that go to making the administration of the law.  Now, George Bernard Shaw said on one occasion, if I am not libelling that eminent Irishman, that a woman is incapable of understanding any argument except a poker and a pair of hobnailed boots.  That is perhaps a libel on the fair sex.</P>

      <P>If there is any element of truth in the statement at all, I suspect that the Minister has a somewhat feminine mentality.  On the other hand, I have no intention of coming in here with a poker and a pair of hobnailed boots in order to deal with the Minister, because I believe that I would not get the best of that form of argument with him.  May I explain the Minister's mentality by another little story?  There is in County Armagh, and especially in the southern part of it, a certain remnant or fraction of the population whose ancestors came there as Cromwellian planters, and they still retain, both in physical appearance and mental outlook, many of the qualities of those Cromwellian Ironsides, and most of them, I need hardly say, are Orangemen of the deepest dye.  Now, in the year 1918 there was a well known and very important election held in this country, and a friend of mine&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, at the time of that election, a friend of mine was canvassing on behalf of Sinn Féin, and he and others visited the house of an Orangeman in the district and tried to persuade the owner of the house that it would be sound and good policy to vote for the Sinn Féin candidate in the coming election.  My informant told me that the man of the house listened calmly to all they had to say, while they told him all about Ireland's cause, and so on, and that then he said: &ldquo;Wait till I get my stick&rdquo;; and according to my informant his heels were not visible for dust until he went down the lane and visited a neighbouring house, where, probably, he had a similar experience.  Now, I am only giving that as an instance of a typical Cromwellian answer or method of reasoning, and I suggest that if the Minister wants to see a twin brother to that Cromwellian Orangeman, he has only to look in the glass.</P>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane seemed to look at Cromwell with a certain amount of admiration.  I am afraid that I cannot share his admiration for Cromwell, and I do not think the Senator was justified in his remarks. The Senator seemed to regard Cromwell as a great advocate and defender of Parliamentary institutions, but, in my view, Cromwell was the most successful leader of a Fascist Revolution in his own or any other European country.  Accordingly, I suggest that when a man with Cromwell's temperament, such as the Minister seems to have, is on the warpath, nothing in our Constitution or in our Parliamentary institutions is safe, and he is going to decapitate the one or disembowel the other, and then what is left of our Constitution?  I suggest that there will be very little chance that our Constitution will ever be restored in its organic wholeness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me remind the House that the issue concerned here is the right of publicity of debate, which we claim to be a constitutional right of this House, and which has not been abrogated so far.  Might I ask, what is the Constitution <Col N="1415" /> for?  I think that the answer might best be given if we consider the circumstances of Great Britain and ourselves.  In Great Britain, for instance, there is, in a certain sense, no constitution&mdash;no written constitution, at any rate.  For instance it is literally true that if the British Parliament chose to legislate that every man, over six feet high, should have his right eye put out, it would be entitled legally to enact such a measure.</P>
    <P>There is no limit to the power of Parliament there and, therefore, from the point of view of our Constitution, the British Constitution simply does not exist; but there is a need for a constitution of one kind or another in practically every country in the world, because, without a constitution, there would be considerable danger that the personal, fundamental, human rights of members of a minority&mdash;not only political minorities, but religious minorities&mdash;might be violated by reason of a temporary majority holding absolute power, and we know what has happened under the conditions of modern government in other countries.  One of the principal features of our Constitution is the guarantee of the rights of minorities, with a view to putting an end to what otherwise might be the tyranny of majorities.  I quite admit that, ultimately, the only possible safeguard for the rights of minorities lies in the forbearance and the inherent decency and good will of the members of the majority parties, but, all the same, it is desirable that there should be this additional safeguard, in case tempers should arise and majority parties might be inclined to make a somewhat immoderate use of their majority powers.  We are all familiar with the distinction between totalitarian government and democratic government, and we claim to have a democratic constitution here.  I think it can be claimed that all of us in this country would deny that we have any instinctive sympathy with the various forms of government which are called totalitarian, but I may point out that it is possible, even under the forms of democratic constitutions, to work&mdash;perhaps unconsciously&mdash;towards the substance <Col N="1416" /> of a <i>de facto</i> totalitarian regime.  Where democratic or parliamentary government exists, and where such a form of government expects to be able to work, there must be at least two parties: a government party and an opposition party; and there must be a reasonable prospect that the opposition party, in due course, or in the not too distant future, may become the majority party, by a simple decision of the electorate.  Now, the present Government Party in this country, I must admit, has been so successful in putting the &ldquo;comether&rdquo; over on our people here that I see no prospect of any other party becoming the majority party here for many years to come. They have been so successful that they have practically unlimited power and can do practically what they like, and that makes it all the more important, from the point of view of the Constitution, that every effort should be made to safeguard the rights of minorities.</P>
    <P>There still remains a very important difference between our form of democratic government and totalitarian government.  We still have, in the Dáil and in this House, popular representation of all parties, and that involves, in my opinion, what I might call the constitutional right to squeal.  Now, the right to squeal about our grievances is of considerable importance, even though our squeals may not lead to anything; but our right to squeal as loudly as we can is important because it is the only way in which we can appeal to the public and ask for their sympathetic consideration of our problems and also because our squeals may, perhaps, lead to some sympathetic consideration by those members of the majority Party who are not entirely apathetic to our claims and who realise that we have a right to voice those squeals and make them heard both by the people inside this House and outside it.  Now, we claim that right to squeal about our grievances, and that is why Senator Sir John Keane's motion was put down, protesting against the way in which the Minister exercised his powers of censorship.  Undoubtedly, we certainly squealed about that, but the Minister prevented our squeals <Col N="1417" /> being published in the daily Press.  I feel that we are entitled to squeal about such matters, and it seems to me that the action of the Minister in this connection was something like that of a dentist in Northern Ireland in former days who used to turn up on market day to pull teeth, and in order to drown the noise made by the squealing of his patients while he was drawing teeth, he hired a brass band to play and thus drown the squeals of his victims.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Minister, by his action in this case, is performing the same kind of function, by trying to drown our squeals, and I suggest that that is not the constitutional way of drowning our squeals, and that, as a matter of fact, the Minister's action in this matter is entirely against the Constitution.  Not only is it an injustice to the minority but it is an implied injustice to the people of the other Parties who would possibly alter their views and join with the minority protest, but that they have never heard the arguments which the minority were trying to use, and were prevented from making themselves audible by the intolerable action of the Minister.</P>
    <P>We all know that there is an emergency on at present, and we know that in the emergency it is essential that certain aspects of the Constitution should be suspended.  The Opposition readily agreed to the suspension of these Articles or perhaps not to the suspension of these Articles but certain extra constitutional powers were given the Government which in some respects are inconsistent with the Constitution.</P>

      <P>Of course the reason given is <i>salus populi suprema lex</i>, or the safety of the State is the supreme law.  I think it follows however that every extra constitutional act done by the Minister under these powers must be definitely related to the safety of the State.  Otherwise they are not being bound by the spirit of the Constitution and are a violation of that spirit.  The Minister forbade any reference to the debate of 6th December. I was present at that debate, and I challenge anybody to prove that the public safety would have batted an eyelid if every word of the debate had been published in the newspapers and read by the people.</P>

      <P>It seems very difficult to reply to the speeches that have been made on behalf of these motions. Senator Hayes quoted Article 15 of the Constitution which provides for the Seanad to go into private session. But what has that to do with the publication of reports of Seanad Eireann?  Nothing whatever that I can see.  Senator Kingsmill Moore made some extraordinary statements and spoke with great vehemence.  He said that the Minister was ashamed of what he had done, or otherwise that he was afraid that the people would know what he had done.  How Senator Kingsmill Moore came to make that statement I do not know.  Of course the Minister said: &ldquo;I have done it,&rdquo; and did not seem to be the slightest bit ashamed that he had done it.  The Minister said that he had done it in the interests of the State.  Senator Johnston's <i>salus populi suprema lex</i> gives the whole reason for the action of the Minister in that case.  Why should he say he did not want the people to know?  It seems an absurdity. Then there is another statement that Senator Kingsmill Moore made.  He said that the Minister has power to do what he did but whenever he does that <Col N="1419" /> he ought to let the public know how often he is doing it.  Did Senator Kingsmill Moore mean that statement? I do not think he did.  I do not think he could.</P>

      <P>I thought that, if the Senator did occupy that position, he should know what the duties of a censor are.  Probably, he does know that no censor ever publishes a list of the censorships or suppressions he has made in respect of newspaper articles, letters or other such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of fact, I think that Senator O'Dea has not quite understood what I said and, because I wish to hear his criticisms, I should like to make clear that I did not suggest for one moment that the censor necessarily has to insert blanks or anything like that.  What I did say was that, if the Minister relied upon his prerogative rights, if I may use that phrase, that should be allowed to be published.  In so far as the Minister came here and said: &ldquo;I will not discuss the matter because it is of such importance,&rdquo;<Col N="1420" /> the public should be entitled to know that a certain subject had been withdrawn from discussion. I was not referring to the details of censorship.  I have mentioned that because I pay the greatest respect to anything that Senator O'Dea says, and I want him to be able to meet the point I make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Kingsmill Moore may have intended to say that but what he did say was that, when the Minister exercises his power, he should let us know that and how often he does so.  I think that those were his words. If those were his words, they could only bear one interpretation.  That is, that whenever a censor prevents a publication, he should announce the fact to the world.  What would then be the position with regard to censorship? A document is suppressed because, in the opinion of the censor, publication of it is against the interest of the nation.  He proceeds on the principle: <i>Salus populi suprema lex.</i>  Nobody will question that as a maxim&mdash;&ldquo;the safety of the people (or State) is the supreme law.&rdquo;  The Minister is charged with the protection of the State by the office which he receives.  It is his duty to protect the State.  If he did not carry out that duty, he would be unworthy of the position of trust in which he is placed.  He is the judge&mdash;not Senator Johnston or Senator Sir John Keane or anybody else&mdash;as to whether it is in the interest of the State or not that a certain document be published.</P>
      <P>When I first saw this motion, I believed that the Minister had prevented the publication of the official report of a debate in this House.  I looked up the Official Report and found that the statement made by Senator Sir John Keane and the reply made by the Minister were correctly reported.  The report showed that the Minister gave to Senator Sir John Keane the reason why the letter was not allowed to go&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In face of that answer, Senator Sir John Keane thought well to bring the matter up in this House.  I think that the motion should be one to condemn Senator Sir John Keane for having made use of his position in this House to bring up this matter rather than one of condemnation of the Minister for doing his duty.</P>

There are, probably, many members of the public and some members of this House who think that this country should not have remained neutral.  They are, probably, against neutrality.  They would, probably, like to see that neutrality broken.  It is the duty of this House to prevent anything like that from happening.  We owe a solemn duty to the people of the country and that duty we shall carry out.

      <P>As I was leaving the House last night a Deputy with whom I was discussing this matter reminded me of a saying which still prevailed in the Irish-speaking districts of Connemara. They use the phrase &ldquo;Dlí Chromail&rdquo; when they want to describe something iniquitous.  It amazed me to think that, in the House of an Irish Parliament, Cromwell, the monster of iniquity, would be held up as a model of anything.  Senator Sir John Keane, <Col N="1422" /> in dealing with his amendment to what he described as &ldquo;this innocuous motion&rdquo;, denied the accuracy of the Minister's statement, that there was any sort of a censorship of the Official Report of the debates in the House of Commons.  I am prepared to accept the Minister's statement as being accurate rather than the contradiction of Senator Sir John Keane.  Senator Sir John Keane, if he is so anxious for the truth, can test the accuracy of this statement&mdash;that there are two editions of Hansard, one for home consumption and the other for export.  The edition which is exported is subject not to a committee appointed by the House of Commons but to the censor, the Minister of Information.  When I was passing out of the House to-day, I heard Senator Kingsmill Moore question the accuracy of the statement made by Senator O'Dea regarding his position in the British military machine which held this country in thraldom up to the time of the signing of the Treaty. Senator O'Dea said that Senator Kingsmill Moore was Press censor during that time and the Senator denied that.  Senator Kingsmill Moore is right.  He was assistant Press censor.</P>

Since the Government assumed that responsibility, the people have had a chance of giving their verdict on how the Government had exercised the duties and responsibilities imposed on them in 1939.  Under the Emergency Powers Act of 1939 the Government had power to do almost anything.  I am speaking purely as a layman, giving the plain meaning of the wording of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The things which the Government could not do under the 1939 Act were <Col N="1423" /> very few, and they were explicitly laid down in the Act.  Section 2 of the Act states: &ldquo;Nothing in this section shall authorise (1) the imposition of taxation, (2) the imposition of any form of compulsory military service, (3) or any form of industrial conscription, (4) or the making of provision for the trial by courts-martial of persons, not being persons subject to military law.&rdquo;&ldquo;(5) Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorising a declaration of war or the participation by the State in any war without the assent of Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is because I am a stickler for accuracy that I challenge the statement made by Senator Kyle and by Senator Sir John Keane, that the Minister was acting unconstitutionally. We have, I may say, a united front on this motion, what might be described as the white hope of capitalism joined with the Red Star of the proletariat in a united attack on the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.  The Minister in accordance with the powers conferred on him by Parliament and the people had the right to do what he did.  There can be no question about that.  Senator Hayes in his speech agreed that he had the right and said that it was a question whether he had exercised that right with due care and discretion. That was not satisfactory to Senator Sir John Keane.</P>

      <P>In order to dot the <Col N="1424" /> i's and cross the t's of the right of the Minister to act as he acted, I shall quote again the Emergency Powers Order, 1939, Section 2, dealing with propaganda.  It is a rather long section and I will just give the gist of it.  It provides that the Minister may make provision by Order for preventing publication or unrestricted publication. Here is where I join issue slightly with Senator Hayes.  Senator Hayes's main point was that the suppression by the Censor of mention of a matter that was discussed in the House was not the exercise by the Censor or by the Minister in a proper manner of the powers given to him. I think that in this matter unrestricted publication in the newspapers might lead to undesirable controversy and because of that the Minister had the power to act as he did.  He had the power to do it and he alone was the judge as to whether it was right or not to do it.  On him&mdash;again I stress this because it is the important point in the whole question&mdash;was the responsibility and on him was placed the onus of taking action.  No one else outside the Government had the responsibility. Since these powers were given to the Government the people have had an opportunity of expressing their opinions as to whether the Government had acted wisely or unwisely in the exercise of these powers.</P>

      <P>The Minister and the Government are the judges&mdash;not Senator Sir John Keane, not even Senator Johnston, not even Senator Kingsmill Moore.  A comparison has been made with the action of the Censor in England in similar cases.  I was interested enough to jog my memory in regard to instances that were at the back of my mind for a number of years.  There were three outstanding examples of censorship in England.  In one case it concerned a publication of a friendly Government that had its headquarters in London, its own country being occupied.  The first of these cases concerns the <i>Daily Worker,</i><Col N="1425" /> and this is a matter that will interest Senator Sam Kyle.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Home Office announced on January 21st, 1941, that Orders had been made under Regulation 2D of the Defence General Regulations suppressing the <i>Daily Worker</i>, the organ of the Communist Party since 1920.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Here are the reasons given by the Minister of Information: &ldquo;The systematic publication of matter calculated to foment opposition to the prosecution of the war to a successful issue.&rdquo;  There was a paper that had a fairly wide circulation in England and a small circulation in this country suppressed.  We have the next instance which is even more important in view of what is happening at present in Europe and I would ask Senators to bear this in mind.  The Polish paper, <i>Wiadomosci Polskie</i>, the Polish News, published in London as the organ of the exiled Polish Government whose country had been overrun by Germany and Russia, was suppressed on February 11th, 1944.  The grounds given by the Minister of Information were that &ldquo;passages in the paper were calculated to stir up discord between the United States Nations.&rdquo;  The next paper, not so important&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The third paper to which I should like to draw the attention of the House, while we are on a comparison of the treatment meted out by the Censor here with the treatment meted out by the censor in a neighbouring <Col N="1426" /> country, is <i>La Marseillaise.</i>  It was the organ of General de Gaulle, the head of a friendly Government, functioning from London.  Its licence for publication was revoked on July 7th, 1943, and publication in England prevented. That action by the British censor was taken in the interests of England.  It is not my place to comment on it.  I merely draw the attention of Senator Sir John Keane, who is so anxious about the rights of the Press on all occasions, to the fact that that happened in a country which, on all occasions, he holds up as a model to us in this House.  Senator Sir John Keane persisted in this&mdash;I use the word advisedly&mdash;propaganda.  He had already been informed by the Minister, in connection with the case he had raised, that it was a security matter.</P>
      <P>Despite that statement made to him by a responsible Minister of this State, he used his powers as a Senator to raise the matter here in the Seanad. There again, the Minister's words were: &ldquo;I have already informed Senator Sir John Keane, that this is a security matter, and as it is a security matter I regret very much that I cannot deal with it fully here.&rdquo;  Senator Sir John Keane, not content with that, continues with his propaganda; he persists in his efforts to make propaganda out of this incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a time of emergency, when all Europe, I may say, is on the verge of civil war, despite the fact that the nations are described as being liberated, I submit that that is a gross breach of the privileges of this House by a member, and a gross breach of the hospitality of this country on the part of people who were formerly associated with the British military machine, which only 20 odd years ago, we were fighting, and fighting bitterly. I suggest to Senator Sir John Keane that this should end.  I may say that if Senator Sir John Keane&mdash;who behaved in this way despite the repeated statements of Ministers of State, who are charged by the Irish people with the security of this State, that certain matters are security matters&mdash;had, as a member of the British House of Commons, the Mother of Parliaments, which he holds up to us here as the <Col N="1427" /> be-all and end-all of all parliamentarianism, conducted himself there as he has conducted himself on this matter, and on the previous occasion when he raised this question of censorship, he would have shared the same fate as Captain Ramsay, who, despite the fact that he was an M.P., and a Conservative M.P., was interned by the British Government in the interests of the British people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, the Senator is not suggesting that Captain Ramsay was interned because of what he said in Parliament?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going into what he said in Parliament.  I am merely stating that he was interned because of subversive activities, and I am likening those activities to those of Senator Sir John Keane in persisting here in describing an unconstitutional and illegal, the action of the Minister and the Government in taking the stand they have taken in connection with censorship.</P>
      <P>He was a member of the House of Commons and I am sure that when Senator Sir John Keane heard over the wireless that his quondam colleague, Captain Ramsay, was interned he said: &ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo;  The Minister adverted to the fact that we have now passed through five and a half years of war. At times, the waters of that war washed the shores of our island.  At times, it looked as if those who carried guns would have to do as they did 25 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may have left the worst of the dangers behind us, but we are not out of the wood yet.  That is not my statement. It is a statement made recently by people who are charged with the control of affairs in the Twenty-Six Counties, and I think it is time that the propaganda that Senator Sir John Keane insists on making out of these censorship motions should end.  It is time efforts of the Quislings&mdash;who were Quislings before the word was invented, and of the Fifth Columnists who were Fifth Columnists before Madrid came into the news and brought a new term to the English <Col N="1428" /> language&mdash;to embroil us should cease. I will give one quotation which I think will be of interest to the House in connection with this matter:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Under war conditions, the ordinary peace time safeguards must be flexible, or liberty will be entirely destroyed.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the reference now.  That statement was made in the British House of Commons when Mr. Morrison was challenged on the matter of censorship, and that I present to Senator Sir John Keane as the basis on which we should work here.  It is the basis on which the Minister has worked, that in times of war, the ordinary peace time safeguards must be made flexible, or liberty will be entirely destroyed.</P>
      <P>I think that five and a half years of war have proved that the use made by the Government of this power of censorship, the use made of the powers granted by an Irish Parliament under the Emergency Powers Act of 1939, have proved that they have fulfilled their trust to the people.  We have escaped embroilment, and at the risk of being boring, I would like to repeat that there should be a cessation of the propaganda which it is sought to make by putting down such motions as these by Senator Sir John Keane, and his new-found ally of the proletariat, Senator Sam Kyle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is Volume 18, Seanad debates for 21st March, 1934. The quotation is from a debate on the Wearing of Uniform (Restriction) Bill, and here is what Senator Douglas said &mdash;I am glad he has come back to the House:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dictatorships have grown out of mass movements of the people...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This extract shows what Senator Johnston's friends were thinking of at the time:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There has been a great deal in these Shirt or Fascist movements which cannot be criticised.  There have been discipline, good fellowship, readiness to sacrifice and the desire to reform, which are excellent things and these have given the movements a wonderful appeal to the best of young men and women after the demoralisation of the war. I challenge anyone to deny that a great deal of good has been achieved in both Italy and Germany as a result of the Nazi and Fascist movements.&rdquo; (Column 785).</P>
      <P>That was merely drawn out of me by Senator Johnston's reference to the fact that he had no liking for Fascism. I think, Sir, and I make the statement before I sit down, that in future matters like this should not be put on the Order Paper&mdash;they lead only to interminable debate and to irrelevancies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in the beginning that there was very little in the motion with which I could not agree.  I join issue with Senator Hayes in the interpretation of the Minister's powers in the matter of publication.  The Minister has power, under the Emergency Powers Act of 1939, to limit publication, even of the records of this House. Senator Hayes does not agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It might be held that the Minister exercised that power, perhaps not judiciously, but Senator Sir John Keane goes much further, and I submit that the Minister was acting perfectly legally and constitutionally in doing what he did.  I return now to the suggestion I want to make to this House, that in future these matters concerning censorship should be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges before bringing them up here.  If the matter is one of outstanding importance it can be discussed here, but these things, in my opinion, should first be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I feel strongly about this matter, because I think that anybody who tries to use his privilege as a member of the Oireachtas to embroil or embarrass this country should be prevented from doing so, in order that the hard-won freedom that we have in this part of the country will not be jeopardised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what it is in the approach of some speakers to a matter like this that stirs one to engage in a debate in which one would prefer not to engage.  The motion itself was not discussed by the last speaker at all.  He devoted his remarks to Senator Sir John Keane's amendment to the motion.  Surely, anybody has a right to move an amendment to the <Col N="1432" /> motion, and certainly I believe that anybody who comes in here should not be criticised for exercising his rights. I cannot understand the approach of Senator Michael Hearne to this matter, because, outside the House, he is a very agreeable Senator and colleague, but something seems to change him when he comes into this House and engages in a debate with other members of the House.  That is quite an honest statement of my personal reaction to the Senator's attitude in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure the Senator does not misunderstand me. Senator Hayes put down this motion on the Paper.  He did not put it down in collusion with Senator Sir John Keane.  Senator Michael Hearne did not suggest that, and I am sure that when Senator Hayes put down this motion, he did it entirely on his own responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>And, again, Senator Sir John Keane would not have put down his amendment to the motion except on his own responsibility.  I think that the approach of certain Senators to Senator Sir John Keane's amendment is all wrong.  When I think of the Minister's decision to censor publication of the business of the Oireachtas in the Press, when I think of Senator Hayes requesting information, and when I think of the Minister's answer as to his reason for the decision he took, I find difficulty in understanding how Senator Hearne can stand behind that, since, actually, the only case made by the Minister was that he wanted to teach Senator Sir John Keane a lesson.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I only want to understand this position clearly.  Senator Hayes made his case very clear and intelligible to everybody, and we got the information from the Minister, as <Col N="1433" /> far as I understood it, that he took this action in order to teach Senator Sir John Keane a lesson.  Of course, the Minister is all-powerful in this matter, but when I heard him make that statement it seemed to me that he must be the worst psychologist in this country because, if there was one method by which to approach Senator Sir John Keane, that was certainly a wrong method.  So far as Senator Sir John Keane is concerned, I think that that was the very worst method of approach, and I can think of no more futile attitude being adopted, in regard to that Senator, than that taken by the Minister.  As I have said, the Minister is all-powerful in this matter, and nobody can challenge him, but when you are all-powerful, there is all the more responsibility on you, and particularly in regard to the powers given to you by the Oireachtas.  Now, let it not be thought that the people are happy about this thing.  They are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could quote many cases of censorship actions which I could not understand, and about which as a member of this House I should like to be able to go down to the country and explain, as a plain, practical man, the reason for the action taken by the censorship authorities and defend what the Censor had done.  There are many instances of the exercise of censorship, which would require explanation, but I think that even the explanation would not satisfy the people.  In this particular instance, however, the Minister gave as his reason for the action he took the security of the State.  Of course, the whole object of the powers of censorship is the security of the State, and to secure our neutrality in the midst of total war.  That is the purpose of the censorship, but I am quite satisfied that a great many people believe that the Censor is making undue use of his powers.  That is the trouble about the position in this country at the moment: That while you have some people, such as Senator Hearne, who seem to think that people like Senator Sir John Keane wish to destroy our position of neutrality&mdash;something that I am not prepared to accept, as I have no evidence of the fact&mdash;on the other hand, there are people who feel that <Col N="1434" /> there are others of our citizens who would be quite as ready to have our neutrality destroyed from another point of view, and that the powers of censorship must be used against both of these.  Nevertheless, the fact is that the use of these powers is, in fact, a denial of the ordinary rights of the ordinary men and women of this country to make known their views as to what is happening in this country or in the world to-day.</P>
    <P>Now, that is the rather tragic position that I and many people like myself find ourselves in to-day.  Senator Hearne, arguing in defence of what the Minister has done, quoted instances of what is being done in the British House of Commons.  They banned the <i>Irish Worker</i> years ago for its outspoken Communistic doctrines. More recently they banned the official organ of the Polish Emigre Government, but I do not know whether Senator Hearne is aware of the fact that in this country not alone would we not permit an organ speaking on behalf of the Polish Emigré Government, but Irish organs cannot say what they think about the Polish situation.  That is true.  Even some of the Lenten Pastorals of our Bishops have been censored.  It is important that people should have knowledge of these things when they quote certain arguments in defence of what the Censor is doing.  I do not want to get away from the main purpose of the motion.</P>

      <P>He is given power by Parliament to do certain things and he is utilising the power in a particular way.  A great many people remained silent and have not been <Col N="1435" /> critical of the Minister and his Department but they are anything but happy because they are doing a number of things that those with the ordinary Irish outlook would like to be able to stand behind and defend and cannot.  I say that quite frankly and honestly.  I feel very strongly on this matter.  I do not understand it at all.  It is not a question in this particular instance of Germans on one side and British and the United Nations as they call themselves on the other.  It is a question of two peoples supposed to be in alliance and a particular case where a friendly Catholic nation is being partitioned.  Our people should not like to see that kind of thing.  A good many people would not stand for it.  When Senator Hearne cites what the British House of Commons has done we should know a little more about what is done here.  The kernel of this matter is that the Minister took a decision and the case made in defence of that decision was that it was to teach a particular Senator a lesson.  Is that the sort of argument that should be used?  There ought to be an argument in defence that would commend itself on the lines of reason. Otherwise it does not teach anybody a lesson, least of all Senator Sir John Keane.  It would not intimidate somebody much less belligerent than the Senator.  The Minister knows very well what his own personal reaction would be if somebody had put that to him.  I do not know what Senator Hearne has in mind when he suggests that Senator Hayes was not entitled to put down his motion.  He also suggested that Senator Keane should not have put down his amendment.  What sort of liberty would we have if that was to be the case, that one Senator is entitled to adopt a particular line and that another is not entitled?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Douglas says if it was a gross breach of privilege he should not do it.  I do not know how this suggestion of Senator Hearne's would work.  Examining it superficially, I do not know how it would work at all.  Unless there were general agreement, I do not know that anything could deny the right of a Senator to put down a motion.  I am quite convinced that it is not by some of the methods that we had here that the atmosphere which Senator Hearne's proposal calls for will be created in order to have reasonable discussion.  I feel that it is not patriotic for any citizen to take any action the results of which might lead to the worsening of our national position, in other words, the destruction of our neutrality.  On the other hand, I would not like to see the Censor's power used in such a way as to destroy independence of thought, so that we were brought to a position in which we were afraid of voicing our opinions or, if we voice them, we do not have the courage to have them published. There is real danger by the use of the powers the Minister has used in a particular way that we can be brought to that pass.  It is all very fine talking about what was achieved as a result of an election.  You can, if you persist long enough, hammer us all down to the same dead level, but that is not going to be very satisfactory nationally, and it is not a position at which we should aim.  The House could accept this motion.  Perhaps I should not say that I am not prepared to accept the Minister's statement, but I wonder if he thought that it was going to ensure the security of the State by not publishing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we are in such an insecure and weak position that we cannot afford to publish these things.  The refusal to publish indicates fear and a sign of weakness that, even though it were a fact, we should not reveal.  In fact to have confidence in the strength of our island position and to demonstrate that confidence by action is the best way of maintaining our stand. Had we been fearful at the beginning and had we not been able to pull <Col N="1437" /> together that position might not be what it is to-day.  The Minister ought to act reasonably in these things, take a chance and see what happens.  He did not take a chance in this instance. The Minister indicated in reply to Senator Hayes that this was something that had not occurred previously and he hoped would not occur again, and he wished for the day when he would be rid of his responsibilities.  They cannot be pleasant.  They are difficult and one of the troubles about the whole position as far as the Censor is concerned is that one never knows what he is going to do.  The Censor will do one thing to-day and something different to-morrow.  People who are dealing with the Censor are always in that position.  They just do not know where they are.  I have means of knowing that.  What one would like to get from the Minister is some indication as to when his powers are going to be shed, when he is going to cast them from him.  When will he regard the situation to be such as to make him decide that it is no longer necessary to utilise these powers and when will he be able to say and do the things people normally want to do?</P>
    <P>I believe that an amendment like that by Senator Sir John Keane has its origin largely in the fear that this situation will be a continuing one for a long time.  That is the fear at the back of the minds of a great many people and it is a pity it should be so. If the Minister were able to give an indication that if the war in Europe were to end in a month or two we would have an end of the censorship, it would be an answer to a dozen motions like this which are at present in the minds of members of the House.</P>

      <P>Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon ghá mórán a rá ar an gceist seo, go háirithe tar éis an méid atá ráite ar an taobh seo den Tigh.  Dúirt an Seanadóir Baxter cupla rud agus ba mhaith liom tagairt do dhéanamh dóibh ar an gcéad dul síos.  Dúirt sé go mba cheart dúinn aontú leis an rún seo a chuir an Seanadóir O hAodha os ar gcomhair.  Is trua nár cuireadh deireadh leis an díospóireacht seo nuair labhair an Seanadóir O hAodha.

After all that has been said, especially on this side of the House, with regard to the motion before us, I do not think there is any need for me or any other speakers to take up additional time.  The Minister complimented Senator Hayes on the manner in which he presented his case. It is a pity that the matter did not rest at that.  I should like to pay tribute to the first member of the House who showed an appreciation of the motion and concerned himself with it&mdash;Senator Ryan.  I might use the happy phrase of his own and say that he &ldquo;kept his eye on the ball&rdquo; all the time.  He landed some fairly hefty kicks and each time he secured a major result.  The point at issue, apart from what Senator Hayes has said, is, as far as I have been able to gather, that the Irish people have not the right to do certain things.  There is no use in trying to put the Minister in the dock.  Ostensibly, the speeches on the other side have been aimed at the Minister.  In effect, they have been an attack not on the Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures but on Frank Aiken.  The Minister is there as the representative of the Irish people and the question at issue here is whether this Irish democracy has the right to take such steps as it thinks fit to protect itself.  Do we challenge that right?</P>

      <P>I am admitting from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; that, if the matter had rested with Senator Hayes' speech, the whole thing could have been got over by the reply of the Minister, which would have been a reasonable one.  In the circumstances, he gave a most reasonable reply.  A question further emerges as to whether the Constitution has been violated.  That question has been raised time and again and not as an &ldquo;aside&rdquo;.  Speakers have implied that the action of the Minister was unconstitutional. Senator Ryan very clearly and very simply dealt with these <Col N="1439" /> matters last night.  He stated the issues and I would have been very interested to hear speakers to-day address themselves to the points which he raised.  It would have been helpful if they had addressed themselves to each one of these points and shown us whether the Senator was wrong or not. Has the Constitution been violated? Senator Douglas thinks that at this hour of the day it would not be worth while to go into the courts to challenge the Minister's action.  I am certain that if Senator Douglas had the remotest idea that he would get away with it, he would go into the courts in the morning.  The cost would not trouble him.</P>

      <P>Another question that seemed to be worrying people on the other side was whether the Minister had violated the powers given him in the Act of 1939.  Will somebody show us whether he has or has not?  There is no use in Senators getting up and making assertions and expecting that, simply because they make these assertions, they are principles and truths and must, accordingly, be believed.  If they make an assertion, it should be possible for them to put forward arguments in support of them.  The Act has been quoted, the relevant section has been mentioned and the words have been given.  If the Minister had not power to do what he did, it ought to be possible to show that he had not that power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1440" /> There is, then, a further argument. It is urged that he has violated the privileges of the House.  In what way has he violated the privileges of the House?  Will anybody tell me that it is a privilege of any member to use the House as a platform for propaganda of a type likely to land this country into trouble?  The Minister must be the judge.  What privilege has been assailed that we need worry about?  As a further argument, it is suggested that it is not so much what the Minister has done on this occasion that matters as the probability that he will frequently act in a similar way in the future.  I am bored listening to that type of argument since I came here.  I am tired watching tears being shed about the loss of freedom in this House, and I am tired listening to the prediction that more and more freedom will be filched from us as time goes on.  Some Senators are very nervy and uneasy without justification.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to some words used by the Minister, that he was going to teach Senator Sir John Keane a lesson.  The emphasis laid by speakers on the other side on these few words is sufficient indication that they have not a leg to stand on&mdash;that they have no case to make.  Was there anything wrong with that statement? Without doubt, Senator Sir John Keane's speech was deliberately propagandist. Most of the speeches on the other side had the same object.  If members of the House think they can get away with turning the House into a publicity platform, and if the Minister declares that he will not allow them to get away with it, that he will use his powers to teach them a lesson, I see nothing wrong with these words.</P>

That was his main contribution to the debate.  Senator Johnston very aptly described the speeches that were made on the other side&mdash;and from these speeches I exclude the genuine effort made by Senator Hayes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">

      <P>There is no need to worry.  I would not be surprised if the Senator were a bit alarmed, having regard to his associations, but there is nothing about which he need be worried.  Senator Johnston described the utterances of Senators opposite as squealing.  In truth, they amounted to nothing more than squealing.  It was the squealing of people who know they have no right to speak for the people of this country.  That brings me to the point at issue.  The Minister is there as the spokesman of the people.  He is there as the spokesman of Irish democracy. By the people and by law, he is empowered to act, and he has acted in accordance with the wishes of the people, notwithstanding anything that Senator Baxter may say to the contrary.  I know there are people who are uneasy in regard to the Minister, who are not satisfied with his methods but the vast majority of the Irish people are not uneasy.  They are perfectly satisfied and have given their verdict on that matter more than once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion asks us to express concern at the action of the Government in preventing the publication in the Press of a certain report.  As Senator Ryan pointed out last night, as far as the people are concerned, the suppression of the report does not matter two hoots.  I am not going to express concern; I am going to express my confidence <Col N="1442" /> in the man who fills the position of Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.  I am not willing to subscribe to this motion that we should express concern, which in effect means that we should express our uneasiness as to the competence of the man who is in charge of this very delicate national work.  The second part of the motion requests information as to the grounds on which the Government claims the right to interfere with the constitutional provision that sittings of the House shall be public.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is quite right when he declines to fall for Senator Sir John Keane's bait.  Senator Sir John Keane wants to embroil him in a difficulty.  If the Minister, in view of the information at his disposal, in view of the responsibility that rests on him, in view of the responsibility placed on his shoulders by the Government and by the people, feels that there is certain information which in the national interests he should not give, I for one am prepared to agree that he is perfectly right in not giving such information. Listening to the debate, I thought that I might say more than I have said, but I think sufficient has been said on this side of the House to show that the House should not accept the motion.  I think in all fairness it will be admitted by the people on the other side that the only Senators who dealt with this motion in an objective fashion were the speakers on this side of the House, both yesterday and this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned with one point and one point alone and that is the challenge I seem to sense in Senator Hearne's speech and, in a slightly less definite manner, in Senator O Buachalla's remarks.  It appears to me clear that, so far as any <Col N="1443" /> member of this House is concerned, he has the right, the privilege and the duty to get up and say in this House anything he sincerely believes to be true or to put an aspect or a view of public affairs that should be considered. As to whether Senator Sir John Keane has not got that right&mdash; and so far as I can see that is purely what Senator Hearne's speech amounted to&mdash;I would remind Senator Hearne that he made a somewhat similar speech about a year ago.  It was practically on the same lines as his speech to-day, in principle.  When last August came, however, the Taoiseach did not back up Senator Hearne's view because I am certain that if the Taoiseach thought that Senator Sir John Keane was the Quisling or the Fifth Columnist that has been alleged, he would not have re-nominated Senator Sir John Keane to this House. I think that should be a sufficient answer to those who question his right as a member of the House to raise such points as appear to him proper.</P>
      <P>So far as the incident of the 6th December is concerned, I have certain views and my views are these: I did not think that the Minister could conceivably have thought that Senator Sir John Keane in the remarks that he was going to make would have been so discreet as he was because I am quite frank in saying it amazed me that Senator Sir John Keane was as discreet as he was on that occasion. If that is so, I suggest that the Minister's proper attitude should have been to take the initial step of saying to the House that this was a security matter and that if the House wanted to discuss it they should discuss it, as they were permitted by the Standing Orders, without the Press being present. If the Minister had said that to the House, I can conceive no reasonable House refusing to do as he asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that was the correct and proper way for the Minister to have dealt with the situation.  If it had been dealt with in that way, I personally would not have raised the slightest objection.  It could quite easily happen that the Minister might have thought that Senator Sir John <Col N="1444" /> Keane was going to be discreet, and found afterwards that he was not, but the Minister and Senator Sir John Keane are fairly old antagonists, and I do not think it could be suggested on this occasion that the Minister could have thought he was going to say anything so inoffensive.  I really think the Minister dealt with the matter last December in the wrong way.  If he had dealt with it in the other way I think there would have been a great deal less friction and a great deal less trouble for everybody. Be that as it may, I really got up only to say that I think every member of this House, and particularly one who has been nominated and renominated on many occasions by the Taoiseach, has the right to make statements without being assailed for making them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to occupy very much of the time of the House, but by my silence I might be taken as not being in agreement with the motion.  I want to say that I am entirely in favour of the motion.  It is a well-reasoned, well-thought-out motion.  Listening to the debate here, one gets bewildered.  Other parliaments are quoted, and so on.  Do we not all know that minorities in the parliament of every democratic country are fighting for their rights?  In this matter, we are only doing what is done in every democratic country in the world.  As I said, the motion is well reasoned.  It does not unduly condemn anybody.  The Minister met it very fairly, I think, the other evening when he said that this is the first time in five and a half years that the rights of Parliament itself have been encroached upon, and very likely it would never occur again.  Now, having said that, I am fairly well satisfied that the motion was worth while, and that Senator Hayes and the people responsible for putting it down did a very good service to parliamentary institutions in giving an opportunity to Parliament itself to voice its opinion as to its rights in order to preserve its functions.  I am one of those who object and objected all the time to the Emergency Powers Order.  I said then and I say now that Ministers given those powers are likely <Col N="1445" /> at some time to abuse them.  On this occasion, whether through a mistake or not, I believe that the Minister has abused his powers.  I think he has been chastened somewhat by the motion, because he intimated or at least almost intimated&mdash;he satisfied me at any rate&mdash;that the thing would not occur again.  Quotations from what the British did or what somebody else did are immaterial.  What we do is the thing that matters.  I believe that this motion is reasonable and fair.  I believe that every person interested in democratic government would be in favour of the motion, no matter with what politics he may surround himself. Consequently, I declare myself entirely in favour of the motion.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the motion rather than the amendment is in the second part an egregious example of what in the days when I studied logic was called the fallacy of the double question.  The classic example is when we ask: &ldquo;When did the Minister leave off beating his wife?&rdquo; The fallacy is quite evident. The motion asks for information as to the grounds on which the Government claims the right to interfere with the constitutional provision that sittings of each House of the Oireachtas shall be public.  The Government does not seem to me to have made such a claim at all.  What is meant by the sittings of the House being public?  We know that the public galleries were full, as they always are, I am glad to say, when Senator Sir John Keane puts down a motion.  There is always publicity, and striking publicity.  Also, the proceedings were embodied in full in the Parliamentary Debates.  When Senator Sir John Keane puts down a motion, we all know that the Seanad debates for that week are best sellers.</P>

      <P>Therefore, those two elements of publicity having been secured, it is quite obvious that there was no attempt to interfere with the privilege of the House as far as the public nature of the proceedings is concerned.  That is what is in the Constitution&mdash;that the sittings shall be <Col N="1446" /> public, except when the House itself, under procedure which is carefully defined, wants to have a private session.  The sittings were public, and therefore, to my mind, there was no interference, nor was any desire shown by the Government to interfere with the constitutional provision that the sittings of the House shall be public. As to the question of a report of the proceedings appearing in the papers, very often the Press never even mentions that the Seanad sits.  If the public nature of the sittings of each House of the Oireachtas depends on a report of the proceedings in the Press, I think the Press must act unconstitutionally very often.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to add a little more water to the rather muddy ocean that has appeared since this debate began.  I want to say, with reference to the remarks of Senator Foran and others, that the Act of 1939, Section 2, expressly provides that the Government shall have all-embracing powers in this emergency. What they do here is not done illegally or unconstitutionally.  The Minister is the sole arbiter; the Minister has full power.  What exactly, I wonder, is the gravamen of the Minister's offence? Is it that he has exercised the powers which he has a perfect right to exercise, or is it that he has acted, perhaps, a little recklessly?  I do not think we can condemn him on the first point, and, in view of the fact that we have had five and a half years of turmoil and of emergency conditions, during which the newspapers have from time to time suppressed various speeches, no doubt owing to want of space and so on, I think we can hardly complain of the Minister's attitude in refusing, once in that five and a half years, to allow the report of a certain speech or of the proceedings around a certain speech to be published. We cannot condemn that as an arbitrary action.  The fact remains that, under the Act of 1939, Section 2. the Government has the powers which the Minister is now exercising.  In view of that, I think a lot of this debate is not germane to the subject. In the motion, or rather in the amendment&mdash;I think it is the amendment <Col N="1447" /> we are considering now&mdash;the word &ldquo;condemn&rdquo; is used.  That is a very strong word, and I think we in this House should be slow to condemn the action of a responsible Minister who has a heavy weight on his shoulders, apart from whether he is right or not.  He certainly was right. He has the powers and can exercise them, and we should be very slow to criticise him for doing his duty.  I can understand a verbal indiscretion such as that into which Senator Sir John Keane lapsed yesterday.  One can forgive, but it is not easy to explain it away.  In viewing motions of this kind, I find it impossible to disassociate them from their movers.</P>
      <P>When I examine the motions and think of their movers, I see in a vague way their mental background, and I find myself inquiring into what might be their spiritual homes, appreciating that heredity, environment and education predispose persons to take certain attitudes.  That is what we have to avoid in these emergency conditions, and even if the Minister were tactless&mdash;and I am not saying for a moment that he was in view of the condition of the country for the past five and a half years&mdash;he was justified. During that time we walked a tight rope over a Niagara falls in Europe, and a single verge to left or right would have plunged us into the abyss. We cannot, therefore, withhold our meed of admiration for the man and men who guide us over that rope.  I should be very loth to impute tactlessness to any Minister, much less to condemn him.  The position of Ireland &mdash; Ireland, mark you &mdash; has been one of peculiar difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been in the position of the travellers in Alpine countries one sometimes reads of, where the merest whisper will precipitate an avalanche and we cannot afford to play tricks with the Constitution.  This country has faced a very difficult crisis&mdash;those conditions may or may not be lessened in intensity, and to suggest that we should modify the attitude we have hitherto taken up is cowardly.  If it is right to be perfectly neutral and to maintain our neutrality at any cost, save that of honour, that attitude <Col N="1448" /> should be maintained, and it is not because the war clouds may be lifting now, that the Minister and the Cabinet of which he is an honoured member should vacillate in the least.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter queried rather plaintively as to the cause of Senator Hearne's outburst, so to speak.  Outside the House, Senator Hearne appears to be a genial individual, according to Senator Baxter, but inside the House he is the epitome of ferocity.</P>

      <P>I was a little surprised at the conclusion of Senator Baxter's speech.  He complained bitterly that Senator Hearne is usually the mildest man unhung, but that when he heard some of the debate he seemed to have been inoculated with a microbe.  I would call that microbe a Baxterian microbe.  I think we have laboured <Col N="1449" /> this question too long, and the debate, if continued, is likely to degenerate into an acrimony that I would be glad to see banished from this House.  I believe that the Opposition have not really a leg to stand on.  They may quarrel with the Minister's manner.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made of the Minister's action in forbidding or preventing publication of Senator Sir John Keane's statement, but, really, I think he was more merciful to Senator Sir John Keane in forbidding publication and I think he saved Sir John from himself and the obloquy which would descend on Sir John's noble head.</P>

      <P>Latin tags have been bandied about freely in this debate, and I may be excused in furnishing another one for the benefit of our records: <i>Inter arma silent leges.</i>  I believe that is an excellent tag, but there is another: &ldquo;Hard cases make bad law.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It may be that Senator Sir John Keane feels himself rather aggrieved, but one swallow does not make a summer, and if the security of the State, in the opinion of the responsible Minister, who must be taken to be a man of commonsense, requires it, he must use the powers given him.  We know that all Ministers are not endowed with magnetic qualities, we know they are only human but at the same time they consult with each other and take measures to elicit public opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, above all, since this emergency, they have gone to the country and have been returned with an increasing majority.  I do not say that is proof of their impeccability, but it is a very definite endorsement of their authority, and anything which would derogate from their authority, even if that authority were exercised unwisely at the present juncture&mdash;which I do not say it is&mdash;would be very detrimental to the country.  I can tell the Seanad that not one person in the country gives a tuppenny ticket about <Col N="1450" /> the censorship; they are quite satisfied to leave it in the hands of the responsible Minister.  Farmers are doing their work and the industrialists are doing their work, and all the excitement here does not make one ripple on the ocean of politics in the country, except, perhaps, in the imagination of the movers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose that having put down this motion I should be congratulated upon having evoked the last speech, and I think that Senator Kehoe could be congratulated on being the only Senator, speaking from that side of the House, who did not devote himself to a considerable amount of abuse of Senator Sir John. Keane.  The motion, Sir, has, I think, been successful, in so far as the Minister's reply concerns the terms of the motion which, in themselves, are narrow and which were definitely framed not to be condemnatory.  The Minister met the case to a considerable degree, and I think that if the matter had been left, as it had been understood that it was to be left after the Minister had spoken or Senator Douglas had spoken, we would have undoubtedly reached a method between us which would have preserved Parliamentary privilege, and would have preserved to the Minister such powers as the Minister desires to exercise.  I think there can be no doubt about that.</P>
      <P>When I was putting down this motion I had considerable misgivings, and a political friend said to me: &ldquo;Look, when you put down that motion Senator Sir John Keane will support you, and if he does you are lost.&rdquo;  Very fortunately, Senator Sir John Keane did not support me, and, therefore, I have undergone the rather peculiar experience, for me, of finding the Minister praising my views, and absolutely cooing like a turtle dove about me, and directing himself in all his fury against our unfortunate colleague, Senator Sir John Keane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand at all, Sir, how it is that Senator Sir John Keane comes between the Fianna Fáil Party <Col N="1451" /> and the exercise of broad commonsense, common judgment, and common politeness.  It baffles me entirely.  He is a member of this House&mdash;not elected like me, but nominated by the Head of the Government and having the same rights as I have.  He has been nominated more than once.  I do not know whether I would be accused of being Cromwellian.  Nothing could be more objectionable than all this pharisaical talk we hear here from men who throw out their chests and proclaim that they alone have the national tradition, that they alone are concerned with this country's neutrality, and that other people without the same traditions have no concern for the country.  The most objectionable character in the Gospel, in my opinion, is the Pharisee, and surely, in this debate we have had a very large amount of pharisaical talk.  I was reared in a sound-Irish national tradition and I have studied it in Irish and English.  Surely we were all agreed that once this country was free every Irishman who had roots in the country and who accepted our institutions would be welcome everywhere and would not suffer harm or abuse for his previous associations.  That is sound nationalism, before Wolfe Tone and from Wolfe Tone to Patrick Pearse.  If that principle is not accepted then I do not know what freedom is for.</P>
    <P>The case made by members on the other side of the House is that if you do not agree that this Government is the best Government in the world and that the Minister is the best Minister in the world, then you are not really Irish, really responsible, or even morally sound.  A good deal of that kind of talk comes from the slave mind and from nothing else.  The Taoiseach put Senator Sir John Keane in here. I would be prepared to bet that he votes for the Fianna Fáil candidate in every election.  I say that I would be prepared to bet that but, of course, I do not know it.  I am not a bit out of touch with politics.  Senator Sir John Keane is not a political friend of mine, but I must say that although he <Col N="1452" /> has had his share of abuse here tonight, he has also his uses.  I admit that he is &ldquo;contraptious&rdquo;, difficult and stubborn but, mind you, he is always here when there is a debate on, and he is always vocal.  He certainly can be contrasted with the &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; who agree with what is said by the Government spokesmen but who never open their mouths and only use their feet to walk through the lobbies.</P>
    <P>I think it is time that we should get rid of all this ridiculous business of referring to a man's previous connections, such as whether he was a censor during the British regime.  If the records, during the British days, of the various members of the House, were examined, they might not be found to be spotless in that regard; even some of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, if their records were examined, might not find themselves entitled to drape themselves in the spotless, green mantle of Caitlín Ní Ullacháin, any more than Senator Sir John Keane.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that this matter should be brought before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges instead of being brought before this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if anybody wanted to refer the amendment or the motion, or the motion and the amendment, to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, that was open to the House, but no suggestion was made to me.  Nothing could be farther from my mind and, I <Col N="1453" /> am sure, from anybody else's mind, than to do or say anything in this House which would embroil us in difficulties, but the fact that there is an emergency should not be used as a <i>sciath-cosanta</i>, a defence shield&mdash;in other words, use the emergency to the extent of saying, in effect: &ldquo;You cannot touch me or say a word while the child is in my arms.&rdquo;  That is not good enough.  The problem here is simple enough, but this debate revealed a number of lamentable failures. If Senator Sir John Keane was going to generate heat, I think he failed, and I think that the Minister failed to generate any light at all in giving his reason for suppressing this report in the newspapers.  Certainly, if, as he said, he stopped it for the purpose of teaching Senator Sir John Keane a lesson, that was the most lamentable failure of all.  Speaking, personally, as a professional teacher, I would say that that is not a task that I would lightly undertake.  I think that Senator Ryan misunderstood the true import of this.  He said that the Minister had a right to do this thing. Nobody said that he had not.  I went to the greatest possible pains to explain that the Minister was within his rights in doing what he did, but there can be no doubt that when the Minister goes to the extent of preventing publication of the records of this House in the newspapers he is going beyond bounds, and it is certainly a matter for me or any other Senator or Deputy to draw attention to it and to ask for a reason, and also to suggest that if such a thing is to be done it should be done by a different process from that which was adopted in this particular instance.  It was also suggested that my case for Parliamentary privilege was good in normal times, but that these are abnormal times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Senators, however, will read the motion they will see that it is expressly framed in the light of the abnormal times in which we live.  I wanted to know whether there was any special reason why this particular matter should not be published.  I can see nothing whatever in it, applying my own commonsense to it, that could do us any harm; but if the Minister <Col N="1454" /> were to mark it for the newspapers: &ldquo;Hold,&rdquo; and then say to the Cathaoirleach: &ldquo;I should like to see this matter kept out of the newspapers for reasons I will give you,&rdquo; I think the Cathaoirleach would consult with some members of the House and we would all be reasonable about it.  There is a good deal of confusion here as to the rights of Ministers and the rights of members of the House.  It is a fundamental matter here that members of the House have a right to criticise Ministers, but if a Senator criticises Ministers of another State, such as Goebbels, Hitler and others, that would be ruled out of order.  The fundamental thing is that you are here for the purpose of criticising the Government in regard to certain things and that you have the right to do so, and when Senator Ryan spoke about keeping his eye on the ball, I suggest that he was keeping his eye on the courts and that in doing so he failed to see the Parliament.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan on consideration will probably find that is correct. I do not want to have an interminable debate about this matter.  At the beginning I had hoped we had a very simple question to deal with.  We have rambled off on a great many things since then.  Senator Joseph Johnston at one point ranged to the Boyne and the Ganges and when he had gone to the Ganges Senator Hearne, who is very zealous in making points of order when other people are speaking, went on a little excursion to the Vistula. Having gone to all these places, I want to come back to the Liffey which is much more our concern.  The Minister has got certain powers.  I made it very clear I did not question that he had the powers, but we are a Parliament, and in exercising his powers about Parliament he certainly would have to be extremely careful.  If it is desired to censor or delete a reference in our proceedings we should have something to say.  I do not see how any member of the House can fail to agree with that.  It was suggested that in Great Britain there is a committee.  I take leave to doubt if any such thing has happened as the deletion from the newspapers of a whole proceeding in <Col N="1455" /> the British Parliament.  Their remedy is a Secret Session.  They have held such sessions and, therefore, the fact that Senator Hearne alluded to&mdash;that the British Parliamentary Debates that are sent out of the country are censored, may be true.  That surely arises from the other fact, that the British Parliamentary Debates published in Great Britain are not subject to censorship except in very rare instances and in a particular way.  The debates for home consumption are so very free that the debates that are sent outside are censored.  There is no analogy with this country.  Britain is a big Empire taking part in a war on a great many fronts.  Naturally when books are sent out of the country they want them to be of a particular character.  I do not want to go over all the points that have been made.</P>
    <P>In this House, in spite of a certain amount of heat now and again, very rarely indeed, there is one thing that we have always succeeded in doing in a most amicable way from 1938 up to yesterday, and that is the arranging of our business.  Senator Quirke will confirm this, that we had an informal meeting before the Seanad met in 1938, which I had the honour of attending. We made certain arrangements for the first day's proceedings.  Either through certain leaders in the House or through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, since then, we have made what were sometimes very difficult arrangements for Bills, for Ministers and for motions and we have always displayed towards one another in the doing of that business the greatest possible reasonableness and consideration. No later than yesterday evening it happened that I desired to be at University College from half-past six to half-past seven.  It was a most difficult time, and I would not have been able to move my motion here but for the fact that the House, by agreement, adjourned at a quarter or twenty minutes past six.  I got that arrangement made by consultation with my friends on the opposite side of the House, and I have no doubt that the Minister was consulted.  I am very grateful for it, and I give that as the <Col N="1456" /> latest example of what has always happened in this House.  If any question of censorship of the debates or of the reports in the Press arises I have no doubt the Minister in charge of censorship would find the Cathaoirleach and such members of the House as the Cathaoirleach may consult; very sensible and fair-minded men who are willing to meet him.  I suggest if, in the future, the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures desires to do what he has done&mdash;he says that this was the first time in five and a half years, and that he hopes it may never occur again&mdash;he has a very simple remedy.  He can simply say to the Press: &ldquo;Hold that copy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is commonly done.  The Minister gets in touch with the Cathaoirleach and either the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or such members as the Cathaoirleach may consult will advise on the matter.  I think in that way, we would preserve the privileges of the House and at the same time meet the emergency situation.  We would not be denying the Minister any rights because even after that process had taken place the Minister, I agree, would probably still have the right under existing legislation to delete the whole proceedings if he liked.  I do not think he would do it.  I do not think in the circumstances he would find any difficulty.  It is because my point of view in this matter concerns the House and not any particular Party or group in the House that I put the motion down.  It is for that reason that I reject entirely the phraseology of the amendment.  I deliberately adopted my own wording because I did not want to make a matter which in my judgment concerns the House the subject of a division and, possibly, of acrimonious debate. I did not contribute anything to the acrimony, and I now suggest that in future a certain procedure could be adopted.  If it were adopted everybody would be satisfied.  The Minister would get all he wants or is likely to want, without giving up any of his rights and Senator Sir John Keane would still have the right to put down a motion on censorship.  That cannot be helped unless you abolish the <Col N="1457" /> Seanad or abolish Senator Sir John Keane and I do not think you are going to do either one or the other in a hurry.</P>

    <Title>Agricultural Industry: Wages and Guaranteed Economic Prices for Produce&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the amendment to the following motion by Senators Tunney and Smyth:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Recognising the importance to the community of the agricultural industry and the necessity for maintaining in that industry the maximum number of persons gainfully employed, this House deplores the inadequacy of the measures taken up to the present for ensuring to the farmer an adequate remuneration for his services and the low level of <Col N="1458" /> wages provided for the agricultural worker; calls attention to the unsatisfactory character of the machinery set up by statute to fix and regulate agricultural wages and requests the Government to&mdash;</P>

    <P>(b)  reconstitute the Agricultural Wages Board in such a manner as to afford to agricultural workers direct representation on the board; and to take such action as may be necessary to ensure that agricultural workers will be paid a living wage adequate to the needs of the worker and his family.</P>
    <P>Amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In sub-paragraph (a) to delete all words after the word &ldquo;legislation&rdquo; to the end of the sub-paragraph and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;for the stabilisation of rates on agricultural land at the rates prevailing in the local financial year 1914-15&rdquo;;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Patrick O'Reilly Mr. Patrick O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Patrick O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last day I had spoken at some length on the motion moved by Senator Tunney and I tried to show what the solution of the problem was, in my opinion.  I did not agree with the motion.  I did not consider that any useful purpose would be served by the House passing such a resolution.  I was going on to deal with the amendment moved by Senator Counihan.  I am not prepared to agree that that amendment would bring about a position which would be equitable to all concerned.  I am not in a position to state what the rates were in the different counties in 1914-15, as set out in the amendment.  Even though the rates might be lower in some counties, if not in all counties, in 1914-15, that was because the services now available to the public <Col N="1459" /> through the local authorities were not then being provided.  Since then, county councils, borough councils and urban councils have improved the amenities in town and country at considerable expense.</P>
      <P>Money has been borrowed by the local authorities to bring about that improvement.  Even though rates may have been at a much lower level then, as between one county and another there might not be equity if this amendment were given effect.  The rates might be lower in most counties but they might not be equitably distributed as between one county and another.  The counties with a big population and fairly large towns with high valuations would have a higher standard of social and public health services and better roads, generally speaking, in 1914-15, than counties which had not as high a poor law valuation.  Counties with a low valuation would not have as good social services, public health services or roads as the richer counties but, nevertheless, they might have a higher rate because of the limited taxable capacity of the community.  Even if we were to revert to the 1914-15 position and stabilise the rates at the figures then obtaining, I think that an unfair position would be created, though I admit that the situation is somewhat lopsided at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on the Tuberculosis Bill, a county with a low poor law valuation has at the moment to strike a much higher rate than the county with a high poor law valuation.  I am of opinion that there would have to be a levelling up as between one county and another, because the method of collecting rates on the basis of poor law valuation is equitable.  It would be very hard for me or anybody else to suggest a more equitable system of collecting the same amount of money.  I cannot think of any different system which would yield the same amount of money with less hardship.  We cannot have a perfect system in this world. The Minister for Agriculture is not the Minister who has to decide what should be the policy in regard to the collection of rates.  That is a matter <Col N="1460" /> for the Minister for Local Government. I do not agree with this amendment because, even with the reductions contemplated, the poorer counties would still pay more and the richer counties would still pay less, because they could afford to have a much lower rate in the £.  I am informed that Kerry County Council had recently to strike a rate of 24/- in the £, that Mayo County Council had to strike a rate of 18/2, and Leitrim County Council a rate of 18/0½d.  I do not know what the figures are for the other counties, but I think that the rates in Meath, Kildare, Laoighis, Offaly, Kilkenny, Tipperary and such counties would not be as high as those.</P>
    <P>Extra burdens are being placed year after year on the shoulders of the local authorities.  Assuming the poorer counties were to provide the same social services, public health services and roads of the same standard, they would have a rate not of 18/- but of about 35/-.  At the moment the Government should aim at having a fairly equal standard of service in all the counties.  That would be fair to all the people.  Because of the limited taxable capacity of some counties, they are not in a position to have as good services as the richer counties.  If they were to provide such services, they would tax their people out of existence.  I do not think that equalisation would be achieved by Senator Counihan's amendment.  All he proposes to do is to peg down the rates at the levels which obtained in 1914-15.  Even under that amendment, the rates would be higher in the poorer counties and the services provided would be of a lower standard than in the richer counties.  For that reason, I cannot vote for the amendment.</P>
