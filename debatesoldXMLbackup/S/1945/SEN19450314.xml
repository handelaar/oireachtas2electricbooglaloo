      <P>Before we enter on the business, may I ask whether it would be possible to arrange to meet on Tuesday of next week.  We shall have a good deal of business, apart from the business on the Order Paper to-day.  I understand that we shall have the Central Fund Bill.</P>

      <P>The Central Fund Bill usually lends itself merely to one-stage discussion and we should finish it next week.  The Defence Forces Bill has to be passed, I understand, by the 31st March.  I suggest, therefore, that the House should meet on next Tuesday, and I should like to know what the intentions of the Government are in the matter.</P>

      <P>Before we enter on the Report Stage, I should like to <Col N="1728" /> make a suggestion to the House regarding procedure on the amendments. Senators will observe that amendment No. 2&mdash;the Government amendment&mdash; proposes to reverse the decision reached in Committee, and to restore the Bill to the form in which it was received from the Dáil.  The amendments of Senator Douglas&mdash;Nos. 1 and 3&mdash;are, as I interpret them, amendments consequential on the amendment made in Committee.  I would suggest, therefore, that the debate on the matter involved should take place on amendment No. 2, and if that amendment be made, then amendments Nos. 1 and 3 should be regarded as falling consequentially.  If, on the other hand, amendment No. 2 be negatived, then we can take up the subject matters of Nos. 1 and 3 which, as I have said, seem to me to be consequential amendments. If the House agrees, we will proceed accordingly.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, lines 29-30, to delete the words &ldquo;the age that person will be if living on the 15th day of April next after the qualifying date&rdquo; (inserted in Committee), and to substitute instead the words:&mdash;&ldquo;that person's age on the 15th day of September, being the qualifying date&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is brought forward so that the Seanad may have an opportunity of reconsidering the question which will arise if the amendment already adopted is finally inserted in the Bill.  The effect of the amendment, it will be recollected, was to treat the age qualification as being effective on the date of the coming into force of the register instead of on the qualifying date which is six months earlier and which is the determining date for other qualifications and incapacities. In other words, an elector desiring to be registered would have to have attained the age of 21 on April 15th, and would therefore only be 20 years and some months on the qualifying date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have thought over the implications of Senator Douglas's amendment, not <Col N="1729" /> only, shall we say, from the legal point of view, but from the common sense point of view.  Apart altogether from the advice given to me by the officers from the Department responsible for the franchise, I myself have again read the Electoral Act of 1923, and the Local Government Electoral Registration Act of 1924.  I referred to the clauses of the Representation of the People Act, 1918, which still have legislative effect to-day, and as a person with some ordinary common sense knowledge of administration and business, I believe confusion will arise. I believe that the chances that confusion will arise are so great that I ask members of the Seanad to reconsider their original decision and to allow this matter to be considered separately on another occasion.</P>
    <P>So far as purely legal considerations are concerned, I should like to put forward the following observations to the House.  The method of preparing the register of electors ensures that the register will contain a list of all persons who were entitled to be registered on a fixed date previous to the coming into force of the register.  This method has the merit of being definite and free from confusion.</P>
    <P>If a qualifying date is fixed for some purposes, and in effect a different date is fixed for another purpose, the meaning and application of expressions in the rules are fundamentally altered, and the register will not be a list of persons entitled to be registered on the qualifying date, but will also be a list of persons, in addition, who became 21 between the qualifying date and the date of the coming into force of the register.</P>
    <P>In regard to the law and rules governing the legislation which in turn sets up the register, these are contained in Part II of the Electoral Act, 1923, Sections 8-16, and also in Schedule I, Rules 1-40.  The whole of this code was drafted on the assumption that a person in order to be entitled to be registered must be qualified and not subject to any incapacity whatever on the qualifying date.  Now, there are other in capacities than those imposed by age, imprisonment under certain codes, and incapacity in regard <Col N="1730" /> to residence or the occupation of premises. Each of these rules would require detailed consideration to ensure that every provision inconsistent with the amendment would be modified. For example, a person who claims to be entitled to be registered in the course of the preparation of the register, and whose name is not entered in the lists may make a claim.  The rule in connection with this would require to be varied so that a person who was not 21, but who would be 21 at a later date, can claim that he would be entitled at a later date.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the case of objection, if the lists contained the name of a person under 21, an objection may be made.  An amendment would be necessary to ensure that an objection will not lie if the person will be 21 years of age at a future date before the 15th April.  A preliminary examination of these rules shows that a redraft of the code and the orders made under these rules would be necessary.  Any extensive amendment of rules in general use is objectionable and the cause of confusion.  As the House knows, the Electoral Act has been amended in various respects, but we have managed to retain the rules governing the Dáil and the Local Government franchise, and having regard to every aspect of the matter it would be most undesirable to change these rules by shifting the dates in the registration procedure from one month to another.</P>
    <P>The electoral law was consolidated in the Electoral Act of 1923 and the Local Government Electors Registration Act, 1924, except for the Local Government Franchise provisions which are contained in Sections 3, 4, 7, 10 and 44 of the Representation of the People Act, 1918, which still apply.  Division III of the Register of Electors contains the names of persons who are registered as local government electors only, that is to say, people who have votes apart from their age qualifications, by virtue of the occupation of premises in a certain area at a certain date.  There are about 10,000 such persons.</P>
    <P>Most of the persons registered in Division III derive their qualification <Col N="1731" /> from the Act of 1918, that is a qualification from the occupation of premises for the period of six months ending on the qualifying date.  The provisions of the Act of 1918 are to be interpreted in accordance with Section 41 of that Act, subject to the expressed provision of the Local Government Electors Registration Act of 1924, an Act which directs that the register of electors prepared under the Act of 1923, should also be a register of local government electors.  In the application of Sections 3 and 4 of the Act of 1918, interpreted according to Section 41, and incorporated in the electoral code by the Act of 1924, as amended by the Bill now under consideration, a person's age for the purposes of Sections 3 and 4 will be taken to be that person's age at the end of the qualifying period of six months ending on the 15th of September, unless it could be held that the amendment to the Bill modifies or repeals Section 41, sub-section (7) of the Representation of the People Act, 1918.</P>
    <P>I could not say what is the effect of the amendment.  In order to clarify this somewhat complex matter, I should say that the Electoral Act of 1923 did not recodify the whole of the legislation affecting both local government and Dáil electors.  Portion of the legislation derives from a British Act, and that Act clearly defines that the age factor is determined on the qualifying date and not on the date of the coming into force of the register.  It immediately causes legal difficulties.  It would require very great consideration, and looking at it with the common sense which I hope I have, I have come to the conclusion that it would reduce the electoral law to a state of confusion. Before we could possibly accept Senator Douglas's amendment, we would have to consider altering the first section of the 1923 Act in which the expression is used that a person who has attained the age of 21 is entitled to vote.  An alteration would be required in the very first clause of the Act and we would immediately have to make the most elaborate investigation into the legal procedure governing the <Col N="1732" /> rules of registration and also governing the local government section of the register which is partly derived from a British Act and is not affected by the Act of 1923.</P>
    <P>It seems inevitable that results like this will flow from this duality of qualifying dates, and it is clear that these complications will all be avoided if one day is taken for all these purposes to decide whether a person has the necessary qualifications, and a register made of the persons so found to be qualified, to come in force as soon thereafter as the practical considerations of time for preparation, inspection, correction, and printing will permit.</P>
    <P>Again, putting this into simple language, one might say that although the Constitution provides that subject to any other disqualification imposed by law, people should vote at 21, in practice that should mean that they should vote as soon as possible after reaching the age of 21 and that there should not be any duality of principle whereby you take one date for one purpose, and another for another purpose, in determining a person's right to exercise the franchise or not.  Since the Electoral Act was passed, many of its provisions have been repealed in order to give effect to constitutional provisions and to extend the franchise for local government elections and to make other changes which experience in administration have shown to be necessary.</P>
    <P>The electoral law is again in need of codification for the convenience of those who have to carry out the law in relation to registration and elections, and some progress has already been made to that end.  The idea underlying the amendment which has been inserted in the Bill is, I feel, one to be noted for consideration in relation to codification of our electoral legislation.</P>
    <P>I want to say that I have no feeling of opposition to the principle of Senator Douglas's motion and if, without fear of causing confusion or of causing a doubt to arise in the minds of the electors, it is possible at a later date, when we recodify all our electoral legislation, to enable a person to vote <Col N="1733" /> after the coming into force of the register who is qualified under Senator Douglas's terms, I should be more than delighted to assist any person desiring to do it and I am sure this House would co-operate to that end.</P>
    <P>I feel that a Bill which is passed by the House should contain all the amendments which may be consequential. The one operative section in the Bill which was sent to the Seanad proposes to change the qualifying date and the other provisions of the Bill contain the necessary consequential amendments.  As I have explained, the amendment inserted in Committee involves changes in every expression of the law relating to franchise.  The rules and statutory forms would also require to be revised and amended.  The existing law and rules are clear and well-defined, but the amendment would make many of the provisions doubtful and ambiguous in meaning.  I do not believe that the Seanad will finally insist on inserting an amendment to this effect.  I suggest that Senator Douglas and those who supported him in the amendment rather desire to have the possibility of altering the law on the lines of the amendment considered at a convenient opportunity, such as would occur, as I have said, when we proceed to recodify the existing law.</P>
    <P>Once more I should like to say that I believe there is a lot to be said for Senator Douglas's proposal.  So long as we note for examination the intention of his amendment I believe the Minister for Local Government is going as far as he can, and I ask Senator Douglas to consider impartially what I have said, because I can assure the House that I am not accustomed to make complications in dealing with legislation or with matters referring to the law.  I have not come here simply for the purpose of trying to raise a number of nebulous arguments against a principle with which I agree. But I would like to repeat that I have read the electoral law and taken the advice of an officer of the Department who has immense experience in these matters.  I am absolutely convinced that this is not the time to introduce this principle, and that we should pass this Bill in its present form as a <Col N="1734" /> measures which did nothing but take the registration dates in connection with the register of electors, and advance them for a period of a few weeks for the administrative convenience of the people who prepare and print the Acts, and carry out the other purposes laid down in connection with the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I could take practically the same words as the Parliamentary Secretary if I could have noted them down in shorthand, and say that I had read the statute and understood it to the best of my ability, but I could not add that I had the advice of an officer of the Department.  I say that I am convinced that this is still the proper time to send the message back to the Dáil.  What might occur afterwards when there had been a number of expressions on it in the Dáil would be a different matter.  If there was a general expression of opinion and if it came back to this House with the statement that views had been expressed, and that it was going to be dealt with later on by the Government in another way, then obviously nobody is going to make trouble over a matter of procedure.  The Parliamentary Secretary has, to the best of my knowledge created a precedent.  I think he is the first person representing the Government who has taken advantage of the special arrangement by which a Minister or a Parlimentary Secretary can introduce an amendment for the purpose of asking the House to go back on a decision made previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was never intended.  It was intended as a facility.  It has been done before but it was always done on the motion of a member of the House.  The Parliamentary Secretary is quite entitled to do it, but he has created a precedent.  That is of very little importance. What does matter to my mind is that we have in the 1923 Act a provision which is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution.  I have not the reverence for British Acts that some people have and I am not at all alarmed at the prospect of having to amend them.  I have again and again stated my view that the sooner we can get to the stage that members of the <Col N="1735" /> Oireachtas have not got to refer to British Acts but only to our own Acts the healthier it will be.  I am glad there is a possibility of revision which will get rid of the 1918 British Act, but I also recognise that there are a great many other matters in that Act which will require consideration.  The issue is simply this: I maintain that it was intended that a person should be entitled to vote at the age of 21.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>We have never had a case like this before so I have sympathy with you, Sir, in adopting what under the ordinary circumstances has been our practice.  The Constitutions both provided that a person who has attained the age of 21 is entitled to vote, but we provided a legal disqualification, so that young people can never get the vote until 21½ and frequently 22½.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now before us a Bill which <Col N="1736" /> extends that period for a week or so, and it will be slightly worse if we regard it as worse.  This is the only occasion on which this House can satisfactorily send its views to the Dáil. On the last stage we favoured the principle that it was desirable for a person to get a vote as soon as possible after reaching the age of 21 years.  I do not need to put the matter any further, because this is a simple issue. I want a message sent to the Dáil by means of the amendment, to the effect that we would like to have that provided. I feel that no substantial number of people is opposed to this, although I have heard some people say that the age should be 25, which, I suppose, would be 26½ years.  That has no reference to the question before the House.  There is very little opposition to this principle, and I would be very surprised if the Government on finding that this was the general view did not adopt it in this Bill, or in some other way.  What the House is being asked to do is to reverse its decision and not to send this back to the Dáil.  I think that it is a mistake, and I am opposed to the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one or two points in answer to Senator Douglas.  He stated that a precedent was created when the House is asked to pass an amendment to undo on the Report Stage what was done in Committee. My experience is that that is not so.  When Deputy Mulcahy was Minister for Local Government, I moved an amendment on the Committee Stage of the Housing Bill which the House carried by two votes.  It was to give a special increase of grants to farmers of £50 valuation.  The House carried the amendment, but the Minister for Local Government brought it back on the Report Stage and had it thrown out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the motion to reverse the decision not moved by a member of the House?  I think it was.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Douglas suggested that it was a precedent for the House to be asked to reverse a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the point.  I did not say there was no precedent for reversing a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is not the point I will leave it at that.  The Senator made another point, that in view of the decision on the last day it would be better to let this go to the Dáil and get their opinion, and when it came back maybe decide otherwise.  We have our own opinions in this House.  I do not think it is a good thing for this House to wait to see what will happen in the other House, before we come to an ultimate decision.  I think that that is bad advice for the Senator to give, and I do not think we should adopt it.  The original amendment itself is not of major importance, and is a matter merely of whether we vote for April or September.  It is not of such great importance that we should stand firm against the wishes of the Minister, under the circumstances.  After all, there was no point, unless it created serious administrative difficulties, in the Parliamentary Secretary pressing his amendment, but because it does create difficulties, both legal and otherwise, he has come back to the House to put these points.  Of course, we are anxious to give the vote to the person concerned immediately after he becomes 21.  I do not think the House minds whether it is in the month of September or the month of April, so we should not create administrative difficulties in amendment of the Principal Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I can well understand Senator Douglas's difficulty in the present circumstances.  Having carried his amendment on the last day, I can see his difficulty in agreeing to the present amendment, which nullifies that of the last day.  While I do not <Col N="1738" /> want to criticise the Parliamentary Secretary for not having given on the last day the facts he gave to-day, I believe that, if the House had those facts then, there would have been a different decision.  I suggest we should accept the statement given by him to-day and vote for this amendment, and that we need not feel we have done anything wrong.  I can understand how people who voted for the Senator's amendment on the last day may feel. They may think they are showing the white feather or backing down now. But anyone has a right to change his mind; the only people who have no such right are those who have no minds to change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The business of this House is to consider legislation that comes from the Dáil and to suggest amendments which, in our opinion, are sound amendments.  We are always in the position that Senator McEllin mentions, that is, we have to wait until we hear what the Dáil says and then make up our minds.  As a matter of fact the position is even worse than that.  When we have heard what the Dáil thinks, it does not really matter how we make up our minds, as we have no power to do any more about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got such a profound disregard for a Fianna Fáil majority as Senator McEllin has. Whatever Party has a majority in the Dáil, the Dáil is there and it is the best we have at any particular moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore I think it is the business of this House to be interested in what the other House thinks.  It is very important for us. If we are to justify ourselves at all as a House, we ought to be able to give consideration to legislation and, when we pass an amendment, we should send it to the Dáil.  If the Dáil decides against it, we should then be reasonable about it and not stand upon our dignity.  In this particular instance, I think the position mentioned by Senator Douglas has not been grasped by Senator McEllin.  He did not object to the idea itself of our rescinding an amendment that we passed.</P>
      <P>I think it is objectionable that, having passed an amendment after consideration, we should reverse it on a speech by a Parliamentary Secretary or by a Minister&mdash;I am not thinking of the Parliamentary Secretary personally &mdash;without having heard a single word from any member of the House in favour of the reversion.</P>
      <P>That is our position now.  We are supposed to be a deliberative Assembly. We have heard a good and reasonable speech from the Parliamentary Secretary, the speech that it is his business to make, but he is asking us to change our mind as we expressed it last week, and not a single member of the House has delivered to us one syllable on the merits of what he proposes, except to say in the usual fashion: &ldquo;The Parliamentary Secretary is right.&rdquo;  That is all.  There is not a single word otherwise. Someone says: &ldquo;He is right, and if he had vouchsafed to us on the last occasion the speech that he made now, we would all say that he is right&rdquo;&mdash;which, of course, is not so.</P>
      <P>Without going into the merits of the amendment, I would say that this is not a very important matter.  It is interesting, in the sense that those of us on both sides of the House who voted for the amendment, and the Parliamentary Secretary and, presumably, the Minister and the Government generally, are all in agreement that this is a desirable thing to do.  That is the position we are in.  We are not disagreeing on the principle on its merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to-day <Col N="1740" /> disagrees on the question as to whether it is practicable to make this amendment to the Bill and put it into operation.  It is the question of machinery.  That being so, we might do what Senator Douglas suggested and let the amendment go to the Dáil. Let the Parliamentary Secretary then make his case to the Dáil and, if it comes back to us, having been rejected, we could let it go.  But it is quite wrong that we should ourselves take up the position that, having already agreed to the amendment and being ourselves in agreement as to its merits on the principle involved, we should now refuse to let the Dáil consider it. We should not refuse to let the Dáil consider it, but should let it go to the Dáil in a very amiable and friendly fashion, without changing our own mind.  If what the Parliamentary Secretary says is correct&mdash;and I am agreeing with him entirely when he wants to do what we want to do&mdash;let me remind him that he can never do what we want to do without amending this Bill.  Is that not correct?  I take it that the Parliamentary Secretary agrees with that.  What we want to do in this amendment can never be done by rescinding it without waiting until the Bill becomes an Act and then amending the Act.</P>
    <P>I do not follow the Parliamentary Secretary in what he says about confusion. What does he mean?  Does he mean that the people filling up forms will be confused by the two dates, as between people living in the house on the 15th September and those people coming in on the 15th April?  People have developed too much ingenuity in filling up forms.  They are not so unintelligent that they cannot fill them up, but they are rather too intelligent in doing so.  This question of 21 years of age would not arise in every household, but only in a household where a particular person was 21 years of age, or was going to be 21 years of age before the 15th April following the date upon which the form was being filled up.  The Parliamentary Secretary may rest assured that, between our natural characteristics and the assistance our people get from the Department of Education, the forms could be properly filled up, even if the amendment carried <Col N="1741" /> last week were left in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas has referred to the extraordinary reverence which Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries have for British legislation and Cumann na nGaedheal legislation when it suits them.  The 1918 Act is quoted with reverence in the Seanad, but out on a political platform during a general election, Heaven only knows what we cannot say about British and Cumann na nGaedheal legislation.  One of the things I have noticed is that any suggestion of changing anything the last Government did, or the British Government did, is regarded as absolute treason and blasphemy.  I have not the same reverence for British legislation or for the legislation of the last Government, which was going through a very difficult time.  I suggest that he did not succeed in proving that the matter was impossible&mdash; far from it.  I have some knowledge of all those Acts myself.  What he did say, in fact, was that he had read the Acts and that he had got advice.  Now, advice means advice from civil servants.  If the Civil Service wants to do something, it is always very simple&mdash;nothing is simpler.  I have had more than 20 years' experience of it. Whatever the Civil Service wants to do is the easiest thing in the world. It is the most reasonable thing; the most logical thing.  But when you want to change something which the Civil Service does not like to change, then it becomes extremely complicated, extremely difficult.  There is Section 7, there is Section 11, there is sub-section (4), there is the Act of 1918, there is the Act of 1923, there are forms, rules and statutory Orders.  They all come into it.  You may not do anything to change a scheme that they have.  That is the position here.</P>
    <P>Perhaps you will be glad to know that I have not got the last debates, so I cannot quote myself.  But I take this to my credit, Sir: I think I suggested that the only thing against the amendment which Senator Douglas proposed on the last occasion was that it would upset the scheme that the Civil Service had, and the Parliamentary Secretary has made it as clear as noonday in his speech just now that that is what is <Col N="1742" /> wrong with the amendment.  It would just be a troublesome thing, and, therefore, it cannot be done.  But, as I say, if something had to be done, then it could be done with the greatest possible simplicity.  I do suggest to Senator Quirke and to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the House that we are all in agreement with the suggestion that, since the Constitution provides that people of 21 years of age should have votes, steps should be taken to give them votes when they are 21 and not when they are 22.  If that principle is accepted, why should we not send a message to the Dáil suggesting that here is a way to do it, and leave the Dáil to solve the problem as to whether it can or cannot be done?</P>

      <P>It is not because I am in the university; it is because, like the Parliamentary Secretary, I have common sense and am applying it to an ordinary problem.  This House has a function.  Its function is no more than to suggest amendments to the Dáil.  It is our responsibility to put things up to the Dáil, and it is the Dáil's responsibility to decide upon them in the end.  Our function then, having put something up to the Dáil and having heard the Dáil's views on it, is to make up our minds what we are going to do.  What I am suggesting, in spite of Senator McEllin, is what a Second House with our powers&mdash;I should rather say lack of powers&mdash;should clearly do, and that is to put up to the Dáil this particular flaw in legislation and let the Dáil consider it.  That would be a much more reasonable and much more dignified and, I think, much more fruitful procedure for ourselves and for the Parliamentary Secretary than that we should now reverse our own decision. I think, Sir, for that reason that we <Col N="1743" /> should stick to the amendment we have passed; that we should let the problem go to the Dáil, and hear what they have to say about it, because they are more concerned about it than we are.  They have to go up for election under those conditions, and members here have not, so we should stick to our own amendment and let the matter be further considered.  I think, therefore, that we should reject the proposal of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <P>First of all I want to apologise for not having been here on the last day on which this matter was discussed.  One of my functions as a member of this House is to try to convince the Minister and/or his Department&mdash;I use &ldquo;and/or&rdquo; deliberately there&mdash;as to mistakes which they are making or about to make in legislation.  I would mention for Senator Hayes's benefit in that connection that, when a Bill came before this House in which I was very particularly interested, I endeavoured by all the arguments possible to convince the Minister and his Department of the necessity for amendments, and those amendments were duly inserted. I have followed the very same procedure <Col N="1744" /> in connection with this Bill.  I have tried to convince the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department of the justness and correctness of the object of Senator Douglas's amendment. Like other members here, I was in favour of it, but when the difficulties were pointed out to me, as they have been pointed out to the House this evening, I could not see my way to force a division in the House.  I was in the same position in connection with the Diseases of Animals Bill.  As a matter of fact, in the end there was only one point on which I was in a different frame of mind from that of the Minister and his Department, and I stood down on that.  I have tried to do the same as far as this Bill is concerned.  I will say to Senator Hayes that I have been definitely convinced that the thing cannot be done at this stage.  But I would refer to this legislation as lazy legislation because it is doing things by sections; it is piecemeal. I referred to a previous Bill as patchwork legislation.  This is patchwork legislation also.</P>
      <P>As far as the difficulties that are there at present are concerned, I am convinced that we cannot overcome them by any quick method, but I must point out again that the Parliamentary Secretary has given the House a promise to codify this electoral legislation. I hope it will be done fairly quickly.  Certain citizens are at present deprived of a vote.  I refer to the Civic Guards, and I hope the Chair will not rule me out on this.  I merely want to make a passing reference to the fact that a certain section of the community are deprived of the functions to which they are entitled by the Constitution; they are deprived of a vote.  I think the time has come when that should pass.  We gave a vote to the members of the Army, and to everybody else over 21 years of age who is not debarred through some crime, and I think the time has come when the Civic Guards should also be permitted to use the franchise.  That is one of the things which should engage the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary when dealing with the amendment of the electoral law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put the arguments which <Col N="1745" /> have convinced me that this thing cannot be done quickly at present.  The 15th September is now mentioned as the qualifying date.  There is a whole series of dates here which are simply legislation by reference, but they are consequential on that date&mdash;15th September. If we enact here that everybody who has attained the age of 21 years is entitled to vote, we should, according to the Constitution, allow them that right even if they become eligible only on the very day before the election.  That would raise a difficulty. Then, I could possibly apply for registration on the 15th September, seeing I would be 21 years on the 14th April. But somebody has the right to object to that, and all these subsequent dates are detailed in the Bill, which provides for my substantiating my claim and for subsequent claims by people whose names do not appear on the published list.  If the applicants were to be entitled to vote the very day they reach 21 years, it would involve tremendous complication.  There could be fictitious claims.  Every citizen must have the right to object to a person claiming a vote and the claimant has the right to prove his claim.  Preferably, that should have been provided for in this Bill, but we should either not have passed the Second Reading, or we should let the Bill stand as it came before us.  That is my procedure in dealing with matters in which I am particularly interested.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in other features of this Bill which we discussed the last day.  It would be out of order to discuss them on this amendment, but there were alterations of dates which lessened the period allowed to the local authority for compilation of the original lists, instead of increasing it, as was demanded by the Corporation of Dublin.  However, I am quite satisfied with the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary that this change would involve a great deal of detail, and I am satisfied that we should accept the Bill as it is.  We should, however, point out that there is a very important principle in the amendment proposed by Senator Douglas, and that there are other amendments to the <Col N="1746" /> electoral law which it would be advantageous for us to consider also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>We might all agree with Senator O'Donovan, that there is need to make other amendments to the electoral law than those included in this Bill.  Unfortunately, those amendments, particularly the amendments enumerated by the Senator, would not be in order in view of the Title of the Bill.  This is simply a Bill to change a particular date and other dates consequential on that principal change. What I find difficulty about is the disposition to discuss the matter before us now as if it were of political importance. I suggest that no political importance whatever is to be attached to this Bill or to the proposal which was before us on the last occasion.  What was done here was to decide that a person who became 21 years of age on the date on which the register came into force should be entitled to be registered as a voter.  I do not want to argue that question again but I think that it is difficult, in view of the provisions of the Constitution, to challenge the right of that individual to be so registered.  I think that there can be no doubt that the intention of the Constitution is that every person should, on reaching 21 years of age, <i>ipso facto</i> become a voter and we should devise machinery to enable that intention to be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary suggested that, while he agreed in principle with the contention made for the retention of the amendment made on the last occasion, there were mechanical difficulties in the way which compelled him to ask for the abolition of the amendment made in Committee. I should like to point out that there is no immediate urgency about the Bill. This Bill will not affect anything done in compiling the register which comes into force on the 1st June of this year.  We have ten months, if we so desire, in which to make whatever amendments in machinery are necessary to give effect to the provisions now inserted in this Bill.  What I feel difficulty about is the proposal coming at this stage that the Seanad should undo something which it thought fit to do on the last occasion.  I think that, in <Col N="1747" /> the main, if the Seanad takes a decision in Committee, it should adhere to that decision during the remaining stages.  We do not finally determine the shape of legislation.  In the last analysis, that is decided by the Dáil. If amendments inserted here are rejected in the Dáil, that determines the final character of the Act, because the Bill becomes an Act, despite anything we may do or say, in the shape in which it last leaves the Dáil.</P>
    <P>All that can be done by this House, in the event of dispute with the Dáil, is to delay the date on which the Bill becomes law.  There is no reason why we should take up that line.  There is a good case for making recommendations for consideration by the Dáil and there is much wisdom, having made these recommendations, in finally accepting the view of the Dáil when it reaches us.  That line of action should commend itself to us in this House.</P>
    <P>Therefore I think that the House would be stultifying itself if, having, wisely or unwisely, carried an amendment of this kind in Committee, it were to refuse to stand by the decision on a later stage.  Senator Hayes adverted to the fact that we are always confronted with something done by other bodies and other Governments when it comes to a matter of this kind. On almost every occasion we are told how wise the Cumann na nGaedheal Government or the British Government were.  Reference was made by a Senator to the action of the Seanad of 1929, notwithstanding that the House to which he made reference was wiped out of existence in 1936 because the Government of the day considered it was not suitable for the performance of the functions assigned to it.  I think I might say, with all due deference to Senator Sir John Keane, that it was wiped out largely because of its ascendancy character, and yet we are asked to follow the example of that ascendancy chamber in this democratic year of 1945.  I refuse to do that. Again, with regard to the difficulty of altering the old British order, in a few moments when this Bill is out of the way, we shall be asked to approve of a <Col N="1748" /> section in another Bill to repeal a section of a pre-Union statute, an Irish statute, of 1771.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely pointing out that there should be no difficulty in amending regulations made under a British Act of 1918, if we can in this House repeal a section of a pre-Union statute of 1771.  I think that is a reasonable assumption.  For these reasons, irrespective of my view as to the wisdom or otherwise of deleting the amendment which was inserted in Committee, I would be unwilling to join in undoing that decision now.  I think the House, apart from any attitude they might adopt towards the Bill as a whole, would be very unwise to revoke on this occasion the decision which was freely taken a week ago.</P>

      <P>I do not think that Senator Hayes should feel that it is because we did not consider this matter that some of us did not speak on it when it was before the House on the last occasion.  I should like to assure Senator Hayes that, as far as I and some of my colleagues are concerned, we certainly did our best to inquire into the implications of the proposed amendment before we came into the House at all.  I am sorry Senator Ryan is not here now.  He spoke on the last occasion and he put the case with regard to the amendments as concisely and as adequately as it could have been put.  Before the House met on the last occasion I remember asking one of my colleagues did he quite understand the implication of the amendment.  He replied he did not. We both adjourned to the Library where we looked up some of the statutes and regulations relating to electoral law.  We had not gone very far when we realised that, in effect, if this amendment were to be accepted, it would call for a considerable amount of modification in the existing electoral law.  We agreed then that this was not the place to make the change desired by Senator Douglas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1749" /> I, and I am sure some of my colleagues, do not disagree with the idea Senator Douglas has in mind.  If the Constitution declares that a person on attaining the age of 21 shall be entitled to vote, I accept that and I agree that it should be implemented, if it is at all possible to implement it.  But as the Parliamentary Secretary says, we have to take the commonsense view of things, and the commonsense view in this case is that it should be implemented as soon as possible, implemented as early as may be.  I was satisfied last week that Senator Douglas had served his purpose by making a statement and having the matter considered by the House, but I was convinced last week also, just as I am today, that it would be unwise to attempt to make the change he desires in this particular Bill.  One of the reasons I have given, a reason that weighed with me last week and a reason that weighed with Senator Ryan when he spoke, was the extent to which this particular amendment would call for further amendments.  It would be idle to pass this amendment now without providing for all the other amendments required in the electoral law.  Senator Hayes seems to make the case mainly that it was because the Civil Service feels that this would involve them in too much trouble that we should not reverse our decision now.  I am not at all in agreement with him that the Civil Service is a lazy, indifferent institution, as he would have us believe&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said that the Civil Service was lazy and indifferent. I have ample experience to justify an assertion to the contrary.  There is no member present in the House who knows as I do how industrious the Civil Service is&mdash;nobody.</P>

      <P>We must have regard to any difficulties we may be creating through our actions.  Reference has been made to the inadvisability of reversing the decision come to on the last occasion.  For my part I did not agree with the decision taken on the last occasion, and it will not trouble me in the least to have that decision reversed if I can, but that is not the point.  I think it is quite within our power and within our rights, and there is nothing whatever undignified or unbecoming if, on the production of further evidence, we come to the conclusion that we ought to change our mind and consequently alter the decision we came to a week ago.  I suggest that in view of the case made by the Parliamentary Secretary, we cannot do anything else but to make the change that he asks for.  Senator Hayes has expressed appreciation of the case made by the Parliamentary Secretary.  Senator Douglas also expressed his appreciation of the case made.  They agree that there is something in it.  In fact, the Parliamentary Secretary has brought forward considerable evidence as to why we should not send this Bill back to the Dáil with the amendment passed on the last day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is anything more that I can say about it, except that I want to assure Senator Hayes and everybody else that I certainly do not come into the Seanad and discuss any matter without considering beforehand the proposition we have to meet, and I can assure him that the same <Col N="1751" /> goes for most of my colleagues whom I have an opportunity of meeting.  I agree with Senator Quirke and Senator O'Donovan, and with the Parliamentary Secretary, that we are fulfilling our duty as we should by accepting the evidence that has been tendered here by the Parliamentary Secretary, and that we all realise the difficulties implied in the amendment we inserted last week, and accept the statement that it is a matter to be considered when codification of the law takes place, and that adjustments will be made as far as possible. Merely to stand on our dignity and to say that since we passed it last week, we ought to insist on sending it back to the Dáil, is not, I think, in accordance with a right sense of responsibility.</P>

That is an extraordinary statement, that people who do things which they find out afterwards are wrong are bound to persist in that wrong and that a body, a Legislative Assembly such as this, should persist in it&mdash;why, the idea is preposterous.

Are we to persist, as Senator Duffy suggests, to the very end of the Bill, or are we to do what Senator Hayes suggests, let it go back to the Dáil, and then when it comes back from the Dáil cease to persist and admit that we were wrong? What would the Dáil think of us if we sent back the Bill with this bald amendment, without any provision to amend the other Acts?  Would they not say, to say the least of it, that we were very careless and very incapable, and not fit to be here as Senators? Are we to have the Bill sent back to the Dáil and to be told when it comes again to us that we were wrong, and to be chidden in that manner?  Have we then to say: &ldquo;We have done wrong, we will accept your amendment&rdquo;?  I think that is a curious line of thought on the part of Senator Hayes, that we should wait until the Dáil tells us we were wrong.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has said nothing of the kind. The Parliamentary Secretary said that those amendments would entail a tremendous lot of recasting of former legislation which if left in its present form would be unconstitutional.  It would be putting on the register of voters persons who were not 21, although the Constitution says that a person will not have a vote until he is 21.  The Electoral Act of 1923 provides that before a person is put on the register he must be 21 years of age.  It would be unconstitutional.  Are we to put in an amendment that is unconstitutional?  Are we to show to the people of the Dáil that we are not fit to understand legislation when it comes before us?  It would take a long time, evidently to amend all the Acts and Orders made under those Acts in order to make this at all possible, but it is not suggested that we should do that.</P>
      <P>It is merely suggested that we send this back in its bald, crude, unthought-of form, and to show we are not capable of understanding what we are doing.  I for one will be thoroughly opposed to doing anything of that kind. I think it would be an insult to the intelligence of every person in this House, and that it would be unworthy of the dignity of this House that such a slur should be cast upon us.  I have a great deal of sympathy with what Senator Douglas proposes to do.  I believe he had an experience in his own house where a man was deprived of his vote for an unreasonably long time, but the Parliamentary Secretary has given an undertaking that he will have it remedied in the proper way.</P>

      <P>I am going to be brief, but I felt impelled to intervene on listening to Senator O'Dea.  I do not want to say more than I should, but I must confess that it made me blush for shame that a member of this House should describe the amendment in the terms he described it, and should try to make a party of the Parliamentary Secretary to the attempt.  To suggest that amendment of this Bill is unconstitutional can only be described as the purest nonsense.  The Constitution is quite clear when it says that everybody over 21 years shall have a vote according to law, and the Electoral Act of 1932 is quite clear when it states that the qualification date for deciding the time upon which a person becomes 21 is the 15th November.  We are altering that date and making it 15th April following.  Senator O'Donovan will agree that it is just as easy for me to decide in advance how old a <Col N="1755" /> person whom I know is going to vote against me is on that date, as it is to decide how old he was at a later date. I can decide whether a person is 21 just as easily ahead.</P>

      <P>I may not appreciate the effect of the Bill but, as I understand it, it means that the new register is going to come into force on the 15th April instead of the 1st June. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will correct me if I am wrong.  The new register is going to come into force on the 15th April, and it is on that date we ought to decide whether a person has qualified or not.  It is only a matter of changing the qualification date and I suggest that Senator O'Dea should realise that changing it in that manner can hardly be described as unconstitutional.  The Parliamentary Secretary on the last occasion stated in the House, column 1465: &ldquo;I am afraid the Government will be unable to accept this amendment because this Bill is, to a large degree, if not almost wholly, a machinery Bill.&rdquo;  As I understand him, the Government want a machinery Bill, and I am afraid I am quite at a loss to understand the labyrinth of objections on these lines. Like Senator Hayes and Senator Douglas, I have the utmost confidence in the Civil Service being able to draft regulations that will give this amendment effect.  I have sufficient confidence in the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department to be perfectly certain that if the Dáil, as well as this House, so wish, amendments will be inserted consequential upon that decision. That is the only way it can be done and the only way it is ever done. We discussed a principle.  There are consequential amendments to that principle and the Bill goes back to the other House.  If the other House wishes to accept that principle they insert consequential amendments.  To suggest that to do that is not in accordance with the dignity of this House I think comes very badly from any member of this House.</P>

      <P>I am rather indifferent as to whether a person would be slightly under or over 21.  The position I take it is this, that there is a very experienced officer in charge of electoral arrangements.  I presume that this amendment was submitted to him, and that he at once looked into sections of various other Acts that would be affected.  I presume he has put them all in a notebook and that the time necessary to assemble amendments and put them before the House would be very small.  I should say that a couple of hours would be sufficient. If he gave these amendments to the Parliamentary Secretary, assuming that the Parliamentary Secretary accepted amendments carried on the last day, all he need do is to submit consequential amendments.  Senator O'Dea complains that this House did not insert the consequential amendments. That, I think, is not so much our function as the function of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>I agree with various speakers who said that the Bill ought to go back to the Dáil to give it a chance of reconsidering the advisability of inserting consequential amendments If we are going to hold up matters I would be reluctant to do so, but it has not been said that the effect of such action would be to create any serious inconvenience. We carried an amendment to the Transport Bill and the Minister asked the Dáil to accept it.  Many Senators wanted this amendment to be accepted and even the Parliamentary Secretary seems to have a certain amount of sympathy with the idea. That being so, what is the reason why the Dáil should not be given an opportunity of reconsidering the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A previous speaker made the point that if we passed this Bill in its present <Col N="1757" /> form, when a codifying plan is submitted in the future, we will then have to undo what we are doing deliberately now.  I do not see any reason for that.  I am perfectly indifferent as to the 21 years class and the 21 years minus and would prefer to see the age three or four years more.  Taking all things into consideration, I think we ought to adhere to our decision and give the Dáil a chance of reconsidering it.</P>

      <P>I think the debate served a useful purpose in that it has enabled the House to discuss the purpose the Government had in view in resisting Senator Douglas's amendment. I do not propose to enter into a discussion as to the rightness or the wrongness of the Seanad reversing a decision, but I should point out that this is considered to be a revising House where matters of a technical nature can be discussed in connection with legislation. I see nothing in the least detrimental to the prestige of the House, if on reconsidering a matter which is wholly legal and technical, it feels inclined to change its view.  It seems that that would be serving the purpose of the Seanad rather than detracting from its prestige.  Upon that matter, one could have a long discussion, but it is not really germane to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes made an observation in regard to our implied loyalty to British legislation.  His comment was of a very cheap, political character.  The point I made in connection with the 1918 Act was that there was an Act, whether British or Irish, prior to the Electoral Act of 1923, and that the Electoral Act, 1923, recodified the provisions of that previous Act&mdash;call it either Irish or British.  However, it did not codify all these provisions; it left certain of them standing.  Following that, the Local Government Electors Registration Act, 1924, was passed. This Act sought to bring the local government franchise into administrative and legal coincidence with the 1923 Act, but again referred to the 1918 Act in respect of certain matters. Therefore, to suggest that the bringing into the discussion of this 1918 Act was <Col N="1758" /> a sort of spurious loyalty to British provisions is nonsense.  It was a prior Act which still affected our legislation. If the Party to which Senator Hayes belongs had thought fit to recodify the electoral legislation so as to make it unnecessary to refer back to the 1918 Act, that would have removed one, but only one, of the legal difficulties associated with Senator Douglas's amendment.</P>
    <P>Further comments were made regarding the administration of the Civil Service.  I have to make protest here against those comments, because the Civil Service, or that portion of it which is in charge of the franchise, is responsible to the Minister for Local Government, and any adverse reflection on the Civil Service in respect of the franchise section is automatically a reflection on the Minister for Local Government.  Speaking as a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, and looking back at the years since 1932, I can say that the Ministers for Local Government&mdash;both the past and the present Minister&mdash;in their conduct of all matters pertaining to the franchise have shown an almost unrivalled record of efficiency, zeal and dispatch. When members of this House consider the number of elections held and the number of revisions that have taken place in our electoral machinery since that date, and when they recall the absolute smoothness with which elections have proceeded since 1932, they will agree that I am justified in formally protesting against every reflection made on those in charge of that matter, which reflection applies automatically to the Minister.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question as to the Minister's intention in respect of the theory underlying Senator Douglas's amendment, I wish to make the position perfectly clear.  We go as far as to say that, in theory, it would be desirable that persons who reach the age of 21 years in a given year should exercise the franchise.  We say that there must be a date prescribed during the year after which persons who were declared to be 21 years may vote.  That is the pure, absolute theory underlying the Constitution.  Having said that, I should then say that we must make <Col N="1759" /> certain that a document, which is as unchallengeable as humanly possible, of persons entitled to vote is produced. A document that will have the respect of the people, that can be adequately interpreted in the courts or concerning which litigation could take place in the courts efficiently, and a document which can be interpreted by officers in charge of the central and local administration whatever be the pure theory in regard to the right of a person to vote at 21 years of age, the production of an unchallengeable document containing the names of persons entitled to vote must be ensured. There is a large area of doubt as to whether or not it is possible to carry out the wishes implied in Senator Douglas's amendment.</P>
    <P>As I said before, the position is that, after very serious examination, we <Col N="1760" /> prefer to have a register of persons who, as soon as practicable after the age of 21 years, all other considerations being fully examined, may vote according to law.  I might add that the very words of the Constitution clearly indicated that regard would have to be had to legislation in connection with the definition of the expression &ldquo;persons who have attained the age of 21 years&rdquo;.  I think that I have gone into sufficient detail to convince the House that there are real, legal and administrative difficulties in connection with Senator Douglas's amendment, and I hope the House, acting as a revising body and as a body particularly qualified to have regard to legal and technical considerations, will show its good sense by reversing the decision which, in its wisdom, it came to at the previous sitting.</P>

    <P>As far as I can see, the title of this Bill is inaccurate, apart altogether from the decision which the House has just made.  Even at the risk of <Col N="1761" /> again being accused of attacking the civil servants, which I did not do and which, as far as I can see, nobody did, I suggest that an error was made when the Title of this Bill was drafted. The Title says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An Act to amend the Electoral Act, 1923, and the Local Government (Extension of Franchise) Act, 1935, by substituting the 15th day of September for the 15th day of November as the qualifying date for Dáil electors and local government electors, respectively, and to provide for certain other matters consequential upon the said amendments&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not agree to anything of the kind.  The Cathaoirleach said they would be taken afterwards, as he thought they were consequential.  I had informed him that I did not think they were consequential.  However, if it is the desire of the House not to make any correction, I am quite prepared to let it go at that.  My point was that when I examined the Bill I came to the conclusion that this amendment was desirable, because in fact the Bill contains provisions which are not consequential on substituting the 15th day of September for the 15th day of November.  I think I am correct in pointing that out.  It will be found that the period of time between the two dates is longer as between the qualifying date and the date on which the register comes into force.  That is not, strictly speaking, consequential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, I doubt very much if the Title of a Bill has any legal value at all, but some members of the House last week, and particularly Senator Ryan, seemed to think that it was of considerable importance. In fact, Senator Ryan devoted a good portion of his speech to pointing out the importance of having the Title of a Bill correctly stated.  If that is so, then I think it is important that we should have it stated correctly. As I have said, to my mind, it is not <Col N="1762" /> very important because I do not think that if you came to argue a case in court it would affect the amending of the Act at all if the Title were completely different.  I admit that I am not quite sure about that, and I was shaken by the arguments made by Senator Ryan.  While I am on my feet, however, I should like to say that nothing that I have said here, or in fact that I have heard here, was intended as in any way a reflection on civil servants.  I have not the slightest doubt that the civil servants advising the Minister do advise him honestly and to the best of their ability.  So much faith and confidence have I in the honesty of the civil servants that I am sure they could draft the consequential amendments in a few days.</P>

      <P>I wish to say a word or two on this stage of the Bill, Sir.  I made a speech on the Committee Stage, and I gathered from the opening remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary, in concluding the debate, that he thought that some reflections had been made on civil servants.  I certainly referred to the civil servants, but I am <Col N="1763" /> sure that I made no reflection on them. I am well aware, and have been well aware for a good number of years, of the honesty, competency and efficiency of the civil servants, but civil servants, after all, are like farmers, skilled workers, or anybody else, in that they like their own handiwork and do not like it to be interfered with.  They feel, when they have done a job, that it is a beautiful job and that nobody should interfere with it&mdash;just in the same way as other people feel about their handiwork. That, of course, is a natural human instinct.  That is all I said, and in speaking in that way I had no intention of making any reflections on the civil servants.  As I have said, I have had ample experience of the work of civil servants, and I know that they advise the Minister concerned to do what is best in the public interest.  I was quite clear about that, and I did not reflect on the civil servants in any way, nor do I think that other Senators who spoke reflected upon them.  I would not, however, accept the Parliamentary Secretary's further statement that a reflection on the civil servants is also a reflection on the Minister concerned. I think that, both in this House and in the other House, we are entitled to attack the Minister, if we feel that he should be attacked; but, of course, always, when any of us endeavour to attack a Minister in this House, we are asked: &ldquo;Is this in order?&rdquo;</P>

    <P>The purpose of the section is to enable <Col N="1764" /> the Minister, by order, to divide the City of Dublin into electoral areas, and he is required in sub-section (4) to divide the city into not fewer than five electoral areas.  The purpose of the amendment is to fix the number at not exceeding ten, thus giving the Minister power to fix any number between five and ten that seems to him to be proper.  It occurred to me that a serious assault, if I might call it so, could be made on the system of proportional representation if the City of Dublin were to be divided into a greater number of electoral areas.  I do not know what the Minister considers is a desirable size for an electoral area in relation to numbers, but it appears to me that if there are 45 members of a municipal council the number of divisions should not be more than, say, nine&mdash;each division returning approximately five members. It seems to me that that is the most equitable and sensible way of maintaining the principle of proportional representation in regard to local bodies.  Perhaps the Minister will have no objection to accepting the number of ten which is proposed here, in view of the fact that at the moment the number of electoral areas in the city is five.</P>

      <P>I think, Sir, that this amendment is entirely unnecessary.  The section, as drafted, provides that every Order made under the section shall he on the Table of the House for seven sitting days after the Order is made.  That should give the members of the House ample opportunity of satisfying themselves that the Minister has not tried to nullify the provisions of the Constitution relating to the principle of proportional representation.  Apart from that, my objection to the amendment is that this would mean tying up our hands in exactly the same way as was done by the Act of 1930.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Act provided that the city should be divided into five divisions for the purposes of municipal elections. That, after a very long period of trial, has been shown to be a very inconvenient <Col N="1765" /> and, I think, a quite unnecessary restriction and one which has served no useful purpose, but one which, on the contrary, has created, on occasions, embarrassment.  I, therefore, ask the Seanad not to accept this amendment because I do not think that the necessity for it has been proved, and I certainly would say that, having regard to the provisions of the Constitution in relation to proportional representation, it would be, if not inconsistent with the spirit of the Constitution, at any rate, not quite consistent with its letter.  There is a constitutional provision that electoral constituencies shall not have less than three members. I think that the Seanad should be satisfied with that limitation and that what restriction is good enough for the First House of the Legislature should be good enough for the corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, might I point out that three-member constituencies would involve dividing Dublin City into 15 constituencies?  If the Minister were to bring a scheme before both Houses of the Oireachtas shortly before an election providing for 15 constituencies, each electing three members, this House might take the view that it was an unreasonable arrangement, defeating to some extent the basic principles of proportional representation and might consider that the scheme should not be ratified or, in other words, that the proposal should be annulled.  That might be a proper thing to do in certain circumstances, but if the Minister were to come here and say: &ldquo;Well, the election is due, and arrangements must be made rapidly to enable candidates and Parties to know where they stand in relation to the selection of candidates and the preparation of the machinery to contest elections&rdquo;, we might be asked, having regard to these considerations, to forgo the right of annulling his regulations.  I think if this amendment were inserted, giving the Minister a wide discretion and allowing him to subdivide the city into not more than ten areas, it would be an indication to him that the House <Col N="1766" /> desires that he should not reduce the areas to three-member constituencies. I think the Minister will agree that proportional representation does not and cannot serve its true purpose of giving representation to substantial minorities, if there are three member constituencies for the corporation or for Dáil Eireann elections.  I am quite sure that, being as familiar as any of us with the theories of proportional representation, the Minister knows quite well that the principle of securing, through proportional representation, representation in a municipal or legislative body for a substantial minority cannot be achieved if there are three member constituencies.</P>

      <P>Let me relieve the Senator's mind of any fear he may have that I propose to divide, if I am given the power, the electoral area of the Dublin Corporation into 15 electoral divisions.  That is not, in my mind, and it is not my intention. Therefore, so far as the present Minister is concerned, I think the safeguard, as he would like to describe it, is unnecessary.  He has based his argument for this amendment on the ground that in future this House would probably take the view that the representation to be allotted to any electoral division in the city should not be less than say five, and that if the Minister were to divide the city into 15 electoral areas, this House would not have the opportunity in certain circumstances of expressing its opinion upon that matter.  I am not accepting the Senator's view that they would not. He suggests that there is a possibility that in certain circumstances this House might not be able to express its view in that regard, and that, even though the House felt it was undesirable that the representation for an electoral division should be reduced to three members, nevertheless it would have to acquiesce in what would be a <i>fait accompli.</i>  The Senator forgets that, although this House might have a certain view in that regard, the other House is equally entitled to its view. Not merely that, but whatever might be the views of the present Seanad, a subsequent Seanad, the successors to <Col N="1767" /> this body, would have the right to express its views also.  Similarly, the successors to the Dáil would have the right to have their views and to give effect to them.  What the Senator proposes to do here is going to fetter not merely the hands of the Minister, but also the hands of the other House of the Oireachtas and the hands of the successors of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I think that the Senator errs from an excess of caution.  After all, we are not entitled to fetter unduly either the complementary house of the Oireachtas or to fetter unduly those who will succeed us.</P>

      <P>We have listened here to a debate for over three hours on another Bill, the greater part of which arose entirely from the fact that most of those who were advocating the retention of Senator Douglas's amendment have had no practical experience in the art of government or administration. They do not know what is involved in the preparation of legislation. They do not know how much the preparation of legislation absorbs the time, not merely of the officers of a Department of State, not merely of the draftsman's office but of the Minister concerned and of the Government as a whole.  Therefore it is not a simple matter any time to introduce legislation. We know that my Parliamentary Secretary has had to devote at least three days of his time to that Bill here, and that sitting beside him was the principal officer of the section of my Department which has to deal with electoral and franchise matters, obliged to listen to speeches of inexperienced Senators in relation to this matter.  My suggestion is to leave the hands of the other House free, to leave the hands of the present Seanad free and to leave the hands and the judgment of those who will come after <Col N="1768" /> us free, because every time legislation has to be introduced to amend an existing statute it involves a great deal of administrative dislocation.  The Seanad is supposed to be a businesslike body and I am suggesting that, in this matter, they should behave in a businesslike way and leave the matter open.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the Minister has not met the point I put to him in the manner in which he is capable of meeting it.  He knows as well as I do that anything we do here will not tie the hands of Dáil Eireann.  If this amendment is inserted by this House, and Dáil Eireann takes the view that the Minister has expressed here, it will refuse to accept the amendment and refuse to tie his hands, if that is the purpose of the amendment.  At the same time, we have a job to do and that job is to express our view, such as it is, on all legislation passing through this House.</P>
      <P>If the House takes the view that it ought to indicate to the Minister that it is undesirable to have more than ten electoral areas in Dublin, we think we ought to say that, leaving it to his successors to change the law if they think fit.  The Minister himself gave me the clue to the suggestion of the 15 members by mentioning the fact that what is good enough for the local areas ought to be good enough for the Dublin Corporation, and adverted to the fact that the Dáil has five constituencies in Dublin.  From that, I took it that three-member constituencies are sacrosanct, and I feel they are not.  I appeal to his own judgment that they are not, if we desire to give effect, in true fashion, to the principles of proportional representation.</P>
      <P>In regard to the expression &ldquo;tying our hands&rdquo; there is no such tying suggested here.  There are already five constituencies, five electoral areas in Dublin City.  I am suggesting the Minister should not create more than ten.  There is not much tying in that if there is no objection to the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going now to enter on a province which is more particularly the province of members of the Seanad than of members of the Dáil. <Col N="1769" /> I would suggest that the Seanad, having regard to its constitution, should not make amendments to Bills which are likely to be rejected by the Dáil, and that means they should not make an amendment in a Bill which comes from the Dáil unless there is an incontrovertible case for it.  Because, what happens?  The Seanad may say &ldquo;This is our right; it does not matter what the representatives of the Government may say, or the representatives of the Dáil may say, we are going to carry through this amendment because it pleases us&rdquo;.  That amendment goes back to the Dáil and is rejected by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Does that redound to the prestige of the Seanad, or enhance its reputation? I would rather take the other line, and say to myself: if a sufficient case is made to justify a proposal which comes from the Dáil and, therefore, represents the opinion of the Dáil in relation to any legislative matter, then, even though I might like it otherwise, even though I might think it better if it were otherwise, unless I can prove it to be a matter of principle, I will not press my colleagues to carry an amendment which will, almost inevitably, be rejected by the Dáil, because, if I do that, I am not going to enhance the prestige of the Seanad, and I am not going to secure for the views which it expresses the amount of consideration which, perhaps, it would be entitled to.</P>
      <P>I mentioned that because I note that Senator Duffy seems to take the other line, which is that if a proposal which has been fully considered in the Dáil comes along here, then notwithstanding any argument that may be used against the view which he puts forward, he inevitably tries to get all his colleagues into the same boat as himself.  The constitutional relationship between the Seanad and the Dáil has been designed to ensure that there will not be any conflict between the two Houses in which the Dáil will come off the worse. Therefore, I think it would be much better if the Seanad would try rather to influence, if it can, the representative of the Dáil when he comes here, to change his views, by a rather different line of approach than that which was adopted in regard to the Bill just disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1770" /> I want to say this: I feel, having regard to what is the position under the Act of 1941, in relation to the country as a whole, that having regard to the inconveniences and embarrassments which the Act of 1930 has occasioned, not to the Minister for Local Government so much as to the citizens of Dublin in regard to the present electoral areas, it would be unwise to fetter the judgment and to tie the hands of any Minister in relation to a matter of this sort.  We have ample provision in sub-section (7) of Section 3 of the Bill for the discussion of any Order which the Minister may make in both Houses.</P>
    <P>That discussion will, as I have indicated, take place in both Houses, and in relation to a precise proposition, the Seanad would have full opportunities of addressing itself to the considerations which are put forward in support of it.  If, for instance, I make, as I hope to do, the first Order under this Bill when it becomes law, and instead of providing for nine electoral divisions, as the Seanad would think desirable, I provide for 15, well, the Seanad would have an opportunity of discussing the matter.  I undertake that they will have the opportunity of discussing it in due time, and well before there is a possibility of an election taking place under this Bill, but the Seanad will then be discussing a precise proposition, something in black and white, and Senators will know whether it is wise for the Seanad to annul the Order and overrule the Minister.</P>
    <P>In relation to Section 7, the position of the Seanad is very different from what it is in relation to the amendment of this Bill, because, under Section 7, if the Seanad annuls the Order, then its decision in that regard becomes effective, and there is no possibility that its decision will be overruled by the other House of the Oireachtas.  I suggest, therefore, in all the circumstances, that it would, from the point of view of the Seanad, be a much more desirable procedure, and much more effective, to let the section go as it stands, and reserve its fire until the Order is actually tabled and before it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not attach much importance to the amendment, but I do place considerable importance on the reasons given as to why it should be rejected.  The principal reason given by the Minister is that it will not be accepted by the Dáil, and that it is contrary to the dignity of this House to pass amendments which it thinks may not be accepted.  The Minister further gives the reason that the constitutional position was so devised that there cannot be a dispute between the two Houses in which the Dáil would not come off best.</P>
      <P>I doubt very much, with great respect to him, if he has the right to tell us in this House what our duties are, and with his arguments I profoundly disagree.  If he reads the Constitution he will find it provides for the circumstances in which the two Houses disagree, and its limitation on the powers of delay of this House, clearly envisage&mdash;although I will not say it is to be desired&mdash;occasions on which there would be disagreement.  How are we to know what is likely to be accepted in the Dáil?  So far as I can recollect, we have inserted only one amendment in the past few months contrary to the wishes of the Minister in charge of the Bill, and the Dáil accepted it when it got to that House. How are we possibly, with any kind of dignity, to go on the principle that because a particular Minister, on the spur of the moment, is opposed to an amendment, that on further consideration the Government, or the Dáil, apart from the Government, will not accept it?  If we were to adopt that principle, we would, to my mind, be stultifying ourselves, and if that were the principal reason, I would be tempted to vote for it, if only to assert that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot possibly tell.  We may take the Minister's view, a cynical and absurd view, that because a certain Party has a majority in the Dáil, nothing on earth could ever prevent that Party from disintegrating, that nothing could prevent a few of its members from acting contrary to the instructions of the Whips.  We have nothing, as a chamber, to cause us to <Col N="1772" /> assume anything of the kind.  Our function, to my mind, is to propose amendments here, and to ask for the consideration of them.  If the Dáil rejects those amendments, it is not then a matter for us to decide whether they become law or not&mdash;we have no say in that.  All we can do is to decide whether we should delay the proposals for a few months longer.  In 99 cases out of 100, I would say that there was no object in so doing, but we should not allow the remarks of the Minister to pass as if we accepted them, that we should consider, before we pass an amendment or not, whether it is going to be accepted in the Dáil or not, whether the Minister in charge of the Bill accepts it or not.  If the Minister considers it, he will see that we could not at all adopt the principle that we know what is going to happen in the other House.  Actually, it is difficult enough to know what is happening in this House, and it is not always easy to see what is going to happen.  If we are to know what is going to happen in the other House, it would be suggesting that we have second sight.  None of us has that.</P>

In this House we are responsible for dealing with matters independently, matters of judgment, and we cannot for a moment be concerned with what may happen if the other House does not accept our amendments.  The suggestion is that we should abstain from certain courses of action lest our prestige should suffer in the eyes of some people in the other House.  We are the judges of our own prestige, and not the Minister.  I hope that the Minister has spoken without consideration, and that he will realise on reflection that he has no right whatever to read us the lecture he did.</P>

      <P>I do not know the attitude of the Minister towards this amendment.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon; that is amendment No. 3.  Sub-section (5) has to do with the manner in which the members to be elected in each electoral area will be determined. Under the sub-section, in assigning the number of members to be elected, the Minister is required to have regard to two things&mdash;the population of the area and its rateable valuation.  Now, the latter provision is new, so far as the legislation of this country is concerned. So far as I know, there is no provision in any other Act which imposes upon the Minister an obligation to have regard, in determining the number of persons to be elected, to the rateable valuation of the area concerned.  If that were so generally, it would create a very extraordinary situation.  It may, and would mean, in relation to Parliamentary elections, for instance, that 30,000 people in Meath would elect a greater number of representatives than 60,000 or 70,000 people in Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is quite contrary to the whole conception of our legislation in the past 25 years.  I think the Minister, on reflection, will agree that in this <Col N="1774" /> small Bill relating only to the City of Dublin, he is interjecting a new principle which will have repercussions. It will not end here.  If there is an amendment of the law generally it is bound to influence, if not the present Minister, some future Minister in relation to the representation of the people, not only in local authorities but also in Dáil Eireann.  I think the Minister ought to reconsider this matter very seriously.</P>
    <P>When his predecessor, the present Minister for Finance, became responsible for the Department of Local Government, one of his very early proposals was incorporated in a Bill to abolish the commercial register which had been set up by the previous Government for the specific purpose of giving representation to property in the corporation, as distinct from people. The Government of the day had almost universal support for their proposal to abolish the commercial register.</P>
    <P>What is being done in this Bill is to introduce, in a rather slick manner, the principle of the commercial register. The Minister, of course, will tell us that he is not going to be overawed in the division of the electoral areas or in the appointment of the number of people to be elected by the influence of property considerations, but I assume the provision in the Bill must have some meaning, when the Minister provides that he shall have regard to the rateable valuation of each area, and that it is intended to impose on him an obligation to have regard to the rateable valuation of the area in determining the number of persons to be elected in respect of such area.  I do not know whether the House would approve of that proposal.</P>
    <P>It will be argued, of course, that the Dáil has already approved of it.  I do not know if the matter was raised, or if there was a vote on it, how the different elements of the House would regard the decision, but I want, so far as I am personally concerned, to be placed on record as definitely and emphatically opposed to the principle set out in this sub-section (5).</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This proviso, that the Minister must have regard not only <Col N="1775" /> to the populations but to the rateable valuations of the several electoral divisions areas, has been put in to give the Minister, so to speak, some slight freedom of action.  If it was felt that if the Minister were confined to the one consideration in determining the electoral division, he might not be able to make a broad and simple division of the citizens, and therefore some other variant was looked for that would give some freedom of action. The difficulty was to find additional factors to which he might have regard. We know the population of the electoral areas because they happen to be based on the census.</P>
      <P>Outside that there was nothing else we could see, except rateable valuation, that would enable the Minister by taking more than one factor into consideration to make such adjustments as between one area and another so as to give a pretty simple division.  Another factor remains. How are we going to deal with this outlier which is attached to the City of Dublin in the form of Howth district? I think it would be convenient if this second proviso were not in the Bill.  I will put it no further.  If the Seanad feels very strongly in the other direction, and I have no indication that it does, I am not prepared to press the matter, but I think that it would make for administrative convenience if this second factor were left there.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (8) and substitute the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(8)  An Order made under this section shall not have effect unless or until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and has been approved by resolution of each such House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the amendment to which I <Col N="1776" /> referred a moment ago, It will be observed that in sub-section (8) which is a new section introduced into the Bill on the Committee Stage, the Minister undertakes to lay on the Table of both Houses every Order prescribing electoral areas and determining the number of persons to be elected in respect of each area.  Provision is made for the annulment by resolution of either House of any such Order made by the Minister.  The motion to annul the Order must be made in seven days. The usual practice has been that there shall be 21 Parliamentary days in which to make a proposal of that kind.</P>
    <P>In a later provision in sub-section (7) of Section 5, 21 days are allowed for a consideration of a motion to annul other Orders.  I am not going to complain about the limitation of seven days here.  I can well understand, particularly in respect of the first of these matters, that there may be little time and it would be unreasonable to hold an Order in a state of suspended animation for 21 Parliamentary days which in certain circumstances might represent two or three months.  Twenty-one sitting days might be spread out to cover two, three or four months.  If such an Order were tabled in June it is possible that nothing might be done until the following November.</P>
    <P>I am going to suggest, however, that a much better plan to ensure that the Minister would bring his Order before the House would be that he should put down a motion for its ratification. He can do that the moment the Order is made.  I think it is accepted in this House that Government business gets precedence.  I do not know if there is any rule to that effect, but I recognise that it is the practice in this House to give priority to the claims of Government business.  In the other House the Government orders the business. Therefore, there might be considerable difficulty in getting consideration for a motion moved by a member of this House for annulment of an Order.  It does not put the Minister in any worse position.  After having made his Order and having got it tabled he can immediately put down a motion in the name of the Government or the Leader of the Government side of the House <Col N="1777" /> for its ratification.  I think that this provision will be found actually in some of the earlier legislation.  I think it is in the 1925 Acts.  I may say that this amendment is actually taken from one of the Local Government Acts.  As there is such a tendency to rely on the sanctity of legislation piloted by the previous Government I assure the Minister that it was taken from one of the Acts piloted by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>I think that if the Minister looks at the section dealing with the incorporation of Howth in the city he will find that the procedure there was that the matter would be dealt with in the manner provided in the amendment, that is that the Order will have no effect unless it is approved by resolution in each House.  He will find that that has been the procedure.  I will at least certify that the actual amendment is copied out of one of the Local Government Acts of the previous Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Seanad not to accept this amendment. It would, I think, put matters into a quite unnecessary state of instability and suspense.  Notwithstanding what the Senator has said, a provision of this sort is not to be found in the 1930 Acts. In the 1930 Acts, as I explained when the matter was last before the House, the Minister had absolute power in the making of an Order.  Under the 1941 Act, which applies to the rest of the country, the Minister is in the same position.  The sub-section in the Act is an amendment of the original section which I accepted in the Dáil in order to give both Houses an opportunity of discussing the Minister's Orders.  My objection to the proposal here is that it practically amounts to a veto on the action of the Minister because the Order which the Minister makes would not be effective until adopted by both Houses.  I think that is going too far. I think that after all there must be in these matters some degree of trust. I am not pressing that very far, I am merely saying that as a matter of administrative convenience there ought to be that trust.  If the Minister <Col N="1778" /> makes an Order which either House desires to annul, I think that from the point of view of the Minister it does not matter very much whether the election had been held or not, because his position will be the same and he is not likely to make an Order which would be unfair and improper having regard to the fact that if he does make an Order which is unfair he will have to run the gauntlet.</P>
      <P>The amendment should not be pressed; it would mean this, that if next month I should make an Order, and if I did not get an opportunity of moving the resolution in the crowded state of the business in the Dáil, the Order would not become effective and, so far as the forthcoming municipal elections are concerned, the changes which everybody thinks desirable and which the Dublin Corporation have requested me to make would not be made.  In these circumstances I think it is really unnecessary to take the precaution which the Senator suggests.</P>

      <P>The Minister is under a misapprehension if he thinks that there is any absence of confidence on my part.  That was not my intention and there is nothing in the amendment to suggest it.  On the contrary, if the Minister makes an Order, it is open to either House to annul the Order within seven days on which the House is sitting.  Let us assume he makes the Order and tables it on next Friday and this House rises on Monday, the Minister will be doing a number of things under that Order, and it is open to anybody to put down a motion to annul the Order.  Probably, in the interval, it may take six, seven or eight weeks before that motion comes up for consideration.  If it is carried in this House irrespective of anything done in the Dáil the Minister's Order is annulled.  His previous actions will not be prejudiced, no doubt, but his future activities under the Order are brought to a standstill.  If the Minister makes an Order and desires to get speedy ratification he would have a motion put down confirming the Order.  In this House Government business gets precedence over any private business.  In the Dáil the Government has the ordering of the business and the <Col N="1779" /> motion can be taken as first business next day.  Instead of showing lack of trust and causing inconvenience I had in mind that we were proposing something that would expedite the ratification of the Order so that the business proposed in the Order would not be held up and the Minister would get on with his job.  If the Minister says that he does not wish that, I do not want to press him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>4.  Before Section 10 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>10.  As and from the passing of this Act, Section 70 of the Local Government Act, 1925, shall in the application of that section in the City and County of Dublin have effect as if the words &ldquo;or within twelve months after he has ceased to be&rdquo; now contained in sub-section (1) of the said section were deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a proposal to amend to a very limited extent the provisions of Section 70 of the Local Government Act of 1925.  Section 70 of that Act provides that no person shall hold any office of profit or be employed for remuneration by or under any local authority from and after the holding of the election or appointment of members to such local authority held next after the passing of this Act while he is, and 12 months after he ceases to be, a member of such local authority.  No doubt that section applies to the country as a whole, but for practical purposes its application is almost exclusively in Dublin City and County. A number of instances have arisen in which members of local authorities have resigned and ceased to hold office, and subsequently became candidates for appointment to local authorities of which they had been members.  They were debarred by Section 70.  I can understand the inclusion of this provision concerning 12 months after they ceased to be members in the year 1925 when the local authorities had wide <Col N="1780" /> powers in regard to the making of appointments and in regard to the giving of contracts and in a number of matters in which certain precautions had to be observed.  But once you have provisions which now operate in regard to city managers and county managers who have complete power to make appointments and enter into contracts it seems unreasonable to retain Section 70 at all.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to raise the case of any special individual, but it will be within the knowledge of some members of this House that a certain gentleman who was a member of the Oireachtas and a member of a county council ceased his membership of these bodies and simultaneously applied for the very menial post of doorkeeper in a county council office.  He was appointed to the post, but it was discovered he could not hold office for 12 months.  The Order was got over in the way these Orders are got over by the ingenuity of some official who found some means of keeping him in the service until the 12 months had passed, and the door keeper became an established officer. I think it is a bad system to seize upon that kind of principle, especially when all these functions which have hitherto belonged to the councils have been transferred to officials like county managers and city managers. The only kind of position that normally would arise is something like one of a doorkeeper.  In Dublin it may be a teacher, say, under the vocational committee or the agricultural committee. These committees may desire to appoint somebody who has held office, and it may not be an important post. As a rule they are part-time positions. I think one member of the Dublin City Council was debarred from holding a post bringing in something like 30/- a week.  I do not think the Minister desires to retain this position.  I think he will realise that the consideration which suggested the inclusion of Section 70 no longer obtains.  It is really the sensible thing, since we are amending the law in regard to local authorities in Dublin, that we should amend it to get rid of this provision which in at least two cases to my knowledge has caused considerable hardship.</P>

      <P>I am in rather a difficulty about this amendment.  I am prepared to consider the principle of it.  I do not say at this stage that I am prepared to accept it. Unfortunately, the present Bill relates to Dublin only, and Section 70, which the Senator proposes to amend, applies to the country as a whole. I propose to bring in a Bill to amend the Local Government Act, 1941, and I undertake, in connection with that Bill, to consider the feasibility of amending, if not repealing, Section 70.  I do not undertake to do that, but when the Bill comes before the House Senator Duffy will have an opportunity of pressing this matter on what I think will be a more appropriate occasion.</P>

      <P>I should, perhaps, be more receptive to the Senator if it were not for that.  A difficulty may arise in connection with this amendment. It is quite true that in respect of most of the officers of the local authorities the power of appointment rests with the Local Appointments Commission.  Nevertheless, there are such positions as rate collectorships, in respect of which the power of appointment still rests with the appropriate local authorities.  If, on consideration, I found it desirable to accept the principle of the Senator's amendment, I should place myself in a very embarrassing position if I were to accept it in relation to Dublin City only and not to the country as a whole. With the reservation I have mentioned &mdash;that I must consider the matter more fully&mdash;I undertake to give consideration to the Senator's proposal in connection with the Local Government Bill which I hope to introduce during the coming year.  If I find myself unable to accept the Senator's proposal, he will have an opportunity of raising the matter on that Bill.  I suggest that that would be a more appropriate occasion than the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill are, in the main, designed to furnish the State with powers adequate to deal with a problem which has, of recent years, become one of urgent importance, namely, the prevention of the illegal exportation or attempted exportation of goods which are the subject of any export prohibition.  For goods imported irregularly, whether so imported with intent to evade payment of duty or to evade some import prohibition or restriction, a comprehensive and detailed code has for a long time existed.  It is to be found in the appropriate provisions of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, as amended by later Acts.  No such detailed provision, however, existed as regards goods subject to export prohibition, as at the time that the Act was passed prohibitions of this nature were practically non-existent.  From time to time, however, starting with the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1920, such prohibitions began to appear, and an attempt to provide the legal machinery requisite for State control was made in each case by the adaptation to export procedure of certain import provisions. The powers so provided were naturally limited in scope, and it was not until the passing of the Scrap Iron (Control of Export) Act, 1938, that more extended powers were taken. Cases of irregular exportation were then beginning to arise with a certain regularity, but they were few in number and no practical difficulty arose until the wide range of export prohibitions imposed as the result of emergency conditions made the matter one of major importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prohibitions so imposed are as a <Col N="1784" /> rule based on Emergency Powers Orders made under Article 31 of the Emergency Powers Order, 1939, which enables a Minister to provide by Order for regulating, restricting or prohibiting the importation or exportation of any article.  While the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, prescribes penalties for breaches of such Orders and provides for forfeiture by Order of Court of any goods involved, the procedure thus made available was not sufficient to provide the State with such powers as Revenue practice requires for adequate control.  To remedy this defect the penal procedure provided by the Scrap Iron (Control of Export) Act, 1938, was, by Emergency Powers (No. 52) Order, 1940, made applicable to any goods being or attempted to be exported in contravention of an Order made under Article 31 of the Emergency Powers Order, 1939.  Accordingly, in such cases, proceedings, whether for penalties or for seizure of the goods, are based on the Act of 1938, as applied by Emergency Powers (No. 52) Order, 1940.</P>
    <P>This adaptation of customs law was at best an emergency device to meet a pressing need.  It has not been found unsatisfactory in practice, but it remains merely an adaptation, and there is a clear and urgent necessity for direct and detailed provisions to meet the various difficulties which the experience of the past few years has revealed for the first time, and which have increased in proportion to the constant attempts to evade the many export prohibitions which it has been found necessary to impose.  It was originally intended that this Bill should form a permanent legal code relating to procedure, penalties and seizure in the case of export goods, but in deference to the wishes of the Opposition Parties it has been agreed that the Bill should, in the first instance at least, be temporary in effect, and it is now provided that it shall continue in force until 31st March, 1950, and then expire.</P>
    <P>The general nature of the Bill will make its provisions applicable to any goods which are at present or may be hereafter prohibited, and the powers <Col N="1785" /> sought are, in the main, the counterpart of the powers conferred on the Revenue Commissioners in the case of import smuggling.  In particular, this applies to the provisions which shift the onus of proof to the defendant and which require certain persons to give all relevant information which is in their possession or knowledge.  These correspond to the powers given by Section 20 of the Finance Act, 1936, in the case of evasion of duty or evasion of import prohibitions.  It may be added that the principle that the onus of proof should be on the defendant is a well-established feature of customs law&mdash;it can be traced back at least as far as 1827.</P>
    <P>It was found necessary, after the introduction of the Bill, to insert two amendments, viz: Clauses 9 and 10. The position as regards Clause 9 is this: Under Section 8 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, an appeal lies by both parties from a decision of a Justice of the District Court in all cases other than criminal.  In the latter type of case an appeal lies only by the person against whom the Order of Court shall have been made.  In the case of O Croinin v. Brennan (1939) I.R. 274, the High Court held that in a case which was concerned with evasion of customs duty the proceedings were civil in nature, and, accordingly, it seems clear that in customs cases which relate to non-payment of duty such an appeal lies.  In a recent case&mdash; The State (Francis Gettins) v. Circuit Court Judge, North Western Circuit&mdash; the Supreme Court has in effect held that a breach of prohibition imposed by Emergency Powers Order is a criminal matter, and that in such cases the State has no right of appeal.  There is a third type of case, namely, breach of prohibitions imposed otherwise than by Emergency Powers Order.  In this case, there is some doubt whether an appeal by the State does or does not lie.</P>
    <P>All these three types of cases, whether relating to evasion of customs duty, to a prohibition imposed under an ordinary statute, or to a prohibition arising out of the emergency code, and whether civil or criminal in essence, are subject to the same administrative <Col N="1786" /> procedure, namely, search, seizure, detention or charge of the person, and prosecution.  It would be illogical that where a dismiss is given in the District Court the procedure would take different ways so that the State would have the right of appeal in some cases but not in others, and it is considered that this procedure should be unified as well, beyond dispute.  Such a unified procedure exists in the law relating to excise, as under Section 82 of the Excise Management Act, 1827, there is a general right of appeal from the District Court.  In this respect, therefore, the clause merely assimilates customs procedure generally to that which has long obtained in all excise prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Clause 10 is designed to facilitate references by way of case stated from the Circuit Court to the Supreme Court by making it competent for either side to apply therefor, instead of, as hitherto, making such application dependent on the consent of all parties.  Customs law is in many instances intricate&mdash;its operation is far-reaching in effect, and it is desirable that no facility for its proper elucidation should be hindered or withheld.</P>
    <P>Opportunity has also been taken to effect some improvements and to supplement some deficiencies in the existing law.  Thus, a general provision has been made bringing goods prohibited to be imported within the terms of Section 42 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, which enumerates a list of prohibited imports.  The effect will be that the mere fact of prohibition will automatically apply the existing provisions dealing with irregular imports to any goods at present prohibited or which may hereafter be prohibited. This will make for simplicity of drafting in future legislation.  Again, in the case of certain goods, weight per given superficial area is a determining factor in deciding liability to duty or the application of the Control of Imports Acts.  Ordinarily, no difficulty arises, but it is felt necessary that in cases of dispute there should be the power to make regulations prescribing the method by which weight is to be ascertained in any particular case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1787" /> There are also a few minor points which are largely matters of form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that we all have every sympathy with the Minister in his endeavour to defeat smuggling, and that we have every sympathy with the Revenue Commissioners in their endeavour to collect all the taxes that have been legally and properly imposed, but it must be remembered that there is a general tendency to give more and more power to the State and its officers, and that legislation, regulations, Orders, and so on, tend to weigh more and more heavily on the individual citizen.</P>
      <P>This Bill, as the Minister stated, replaces an Emergency Order.  It differs, I think, in two respects, however, from the Bill which was brought into the Dáil.  As has been pointed out, it has now been made a temporary measure, valid until 1950.  That is to say, the Minister will give it a run for five years in order to see what will happen under it, and I think that it will be generally admitted that we would be in a better position to discuss it after having seen it run for a certain number of years.  Another difference is the insertion of Section 9 in the Bill. Section 9, on the face of it, seems to provide for a very drastic change in the ordinary criminal law, that is to say, that where a man is arrested on a charge of this kind and acquitted by a District Court, the State can appeal against that decision&mdash;not to ask to have a case stated, but the State can take the accused to another court and have a second effort at trying to prove him guilty of the offence with which he was charged.  Now, those powers are very drastic, and in spite of the Minister's statement that similar powers existed previously, it is quite obvious that the powers which existed formerly were not the same as these powers, because, otherwise, the Minister would not want the Bill at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, however, has very skilfully glossed over the really important thing in this Bill, and that is that it gives to principles which may have been already in the law a very wide and drastic scope.  It extends very <Col N="1788" /> much the principle, which was very much restricted before this Bill was introduced, that in connection with violations of the customs code, a person is deemed to be guilty until he can prove himself innocent.  That is a very bad principle, but it is all over this Bill.  Now, there are very elaborate provisions in this and other Customs Bills to catch the culprit. Nobody objects to that.  Nobody would object to the taking of all possible precautions to catch the culprit, but we should be very careful that in endeavouring to catch the culprit we do not catch innocent people and cause trouble, worry and expense, to innocent people, and I think this Bill is bound to do that.</P>
    <P>Let us take this Bill in connection with other measures that have been introduced. We have had a case recently where a decision got by a litigant in the court was taken from the successful litigant by means of a very elaborate, detailed and careful section introduced into a Bill, whereby a Parliamentary majority took from a litigant the right which he had.  We also had a case last year, in connection with the Finance Act, where the Minister took power to deal with people who were getting away with certain things in connection with the excess profits tax.  I think the Minister himself said that he was not quite sure how it would work out, but that the object was to catch those culprits and that it would take some time to find out how it would work.  We all want to catch such people, but my point is that such powers can be used against perfectly innocent people.  The Minister, on that occasion, expressed the view that he would be better able to tell the House what he thought about it after a few years' experience of its operation, although he admitted that the power then sought was very drastic.  This seems to me to be very drastic also.  It might be a matter of very great difficulty for one to prove one's innocence in a case such as is envisaged here, but the position we seem to be getting into is that certain principles of law are acknowledged as between citizen and citizen, but not where the State is concerned; in other words, as between two citizens, the principle is acknowledged, but that <Col N="1789" /> when an individual finds himself prosecuted by the State for an infringement of Orders made by the State, he is placed upon a different basis and has to prove his innocence.  That is to say, if you are arrested and tried, whether guilty or not, for any offence against the customs code, there is going to be a presumption, as against the ordinary law, that you are guilty until you can prove yourself innocent.</P>
    <P>We can examine that matter later on, however, but it seems to me that there is no limit to the meaning of the word &ldquo;prior&rdquo; as used in this Bill.  The word &ldquo;prior&rdquo;, to such-and-such a date, is frequently used in the Bill. Does that mean that in the case of goods found in Clones in June, 1944, and found in my house in June, 1942, I would have to prove that I was not concerned in illegal exportations? It seems to me that that is what is meant by the word &ldquo;prior&rdquo; in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Now, like the Minister himself, I am a Dublin man and I have absolutely no interest in smuggling, and I have every desire that the Revenue Commissioners will be able to catch every individual who engages in smuggling.  I have every sympathy with the Revenue Commissioners in that, because I am not a shopkeeper or an industrialist, am not likely to be tempted to engage in smuggling, and all my undertakings are over and above board; and so I cannot quarrel with the Revenue Commissioners. But I do feel and I know that the Revenue Commissioners are anxious to do their job.  But people who are anxious to do their job are very apt to be put in blinkers.  They want to make the doing of the job something much more important than the observance of any set of principles. One defence made in the Dáil was that this Bill was being passed by a majority.  I should like just to say on that question that democracy will not work at all unless a majority recognises that there are certain things which ought not to be done.  That is a fundamental point, that certain things which ought not to be done, and that the majority itself is not necessarily right. Parliamentary Government works on a certain set of conventions.  One of the most important of these is that there <Col N="1790" /> are certain things Parliament will not do.</P>
    <P>In this country we have adopted British law because, in the first place, I think we could not have done anything else, and, in the second place&mdash; apart from the then political conditions in this country&mdash;it is quite good law and it has good, sound principles. It has given to the ordinary citizen a considerable degree of liberty.  Our tendency in legislation of this kind all along has been to restrict the individual's liberty, and to go farther than the British in restricting liberty.  I think this Bill goes farther than any British Customs Act.  I wonder whether, even since the war, anything so drastic as this has been introduced in England.  I suspect not.  I can be told that they have not any land frontier. That is true.  But our position really is that, in order to govern ourselves, we have come to the conclusion that we must be more drastic than many other peoples.  It may very well be that this is necessary.  I am striking a general note.  In every single instance where this kind of legislation is brought in, a good case can be made.  But the cumulative effect of the instances and of the legislation is that we find ourselves transgressing certain principles and getting into a position in which more and more the individual citizen is engaged in a very unequal combat with all the forces of the State&mdash;prosecutors, commissioners, officials, and so on, of all kinds.</P>
    <P>The tendency is natural for all Ministers&mdash;it is not peculiar to a particular set of Ministers&mdash;to take the short cut, to say: &ldquo;This is a bad state of affairs; our regulations are being evaded and we will take the most drastic steps to stop the evasion.&rdquo; That is what is being done in this Bill. That is something which I feel we should object to and something which the House as a House should be very careful about, because if we have any function at all, any use at all, it is to see that, while the law is observed, the individual citizen should get fair play in the courts.  More and more the courts are being ousted.  We really should go right over to the French position and say that we will have a <Col N="1791" /> special administrative law for dealing with certain kinds of offences.  What we are doing is, instead of establishing a special set of courts to deal with these offences, really ruining, to a certain extent, the ordinary courts, imposing a minimum penalty or prescribing, as is prescribed here, that a man who is tried once and acquitted may be tried immediately again.  It is quite obvious to everybody that the ordinary individual who has to go through the courts and is tried in a District Court and acquitted is in a much worse position when he goes to another court.  It does not mean anything to the State.  The State has any amount of money and any amount of machinery, but he is in a different position.  It may be said that one has sympathy with the wrongdoer.  I have no sympathy with the wrongdoer, but I have great sympathy with the rights of the citizen.</P>
    <P>In the two respects I mentioned, namely, that it places so emphatically, with such elaborate care, and in such enormous detail the onus on the individual to prove that he is innocent or else he will be deemed guilty, and the other, that in the case where, having been acquitted of a criminal offence, it gives an appeal against you, the rights of the citizen, who is not a criminal, who is not a rogue, and who has not contravened the code, are being very seriously interfered with by this Bill.  Of course, the defence will be&mdash;it is not in the last 12 years I have heard it; I have heard it for the last 20 years&mdash;that the administration will be just, that this will never happen. There is always the danger that it will happen.  There is always the danger &mdash;it is increasing every day&mdash;that under the forms of Parliament and by the operation of measures such as this you will get into exactly the position of a citizen in a totalitarian State who has no remedy at all against his masters.  It is for that reason that I make these remarks this evening.  I do not begrudge the Minister the Bill; I do not begrudge him the ample powers sought; but I do think that considerable amendment of the Bill is necessary to preserve for the ordinary inoffensive <Col N="1792" /> citizen certain rights which I think are being taken away from him.</P>
    <P>This is my last point.  This Bill is only symptomatic of an attitude of mind in Ministers, an attitude of mind not even of one particular political brand of Ministers&mdash;it gets into every Minister once he becomes a Minister and it is, of course, natural in people who have to do administrative work, not being Ministers at all&mdash;that they want to get their job done, they want to do it rapidly and perfectly, and they do not care two hoots about anybody's liberty or about the particular infringement of good principles that takes place in their individual case.  If that goes on, our last case is likely to be worse than our first.  We are departing considerably from English principles. Senator Hearne quoted something about &ldquo;dlí Chromail&rdquo; from Irish, but there are a great many sayings in Irish not so relevant as this. There is a saying in Irish &ldquo;Tiocfaidh an lá a mbeidh an Gaedheal ag gol ar uaigh an tSasanaigh ná faghaidh sé aon dlí chó maith leis&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The day will come when the Irishman will be weeping on the Englishman's grave because he will never get as good a law.&rdquo;  I do not want that day to come or that particular imputation to be laid against us, and for that reason I do not like the Bill, even though I may have to agree to it in the wind-up.</P>

      <P>I largely share the views expressed by Senator Hayes, though he has some kind of strange idea, apparently, that he has no interest in smuggling outwards, because he is neither a shopkeeper nor an industrialist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think my reference was to my capacity for evading income-tax, not to smuggling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a suspicion that the Minister for Finance will agree with me in at least one thing, that is, that the capacity to evade income-tax is not confined to any one class of the population.  However, I should be glad to give Senator Hayes the full benefit of any doubt that may exist as far as he is concerned.  In this case particularly, the industrialists and <Col N="1793" /> shopkeepers do not want prohibited goods exported.  At the present time, they are short enough of stocks and there would certainly be no temptation whatever to have any sympathy with them, even if there were such a tendency at other times.</P>
      <P>I think it is perfectly true that there is a mentality in this country which regards the evasion of taxation as not being robbery and smuggling as a petty offence.  I was enormously surprised to find the Minister suggesting&mdash;I do not think he could mean it&mdash;that he had a grievance because the courts had held that the exportation of prohibited goods was a criminal offence. I always thought it was a criminal offence and should be regarded as such. I am speaking now of the systematic and deliberate exportation of goods necessary for the welfare of the people, particularly at a time like this. It is an anti-national and anti-social offence and should be so regarded.</P>
      <P>Holding those views, I feel a good deal of reluctance in criticising a Bill of this kind.  I have read it two or three times and, notwithstanding certain similarities in it to other Acts, I cannot help feeling very uneasy regarding certain of its provisions.  It is possible that the provisions may not be serious in this case, inasmuch as they are not to be put into effect.  If they were fully put into effect, it would be disastrous.</P>
      <P>I am very anxious to catch smugglers of the type dealt with in this Bill, particularly those who send out of the country goods which are essential to the welfare of the people.  I may have some sympathy even with their objects. When I say &ldquo;their objects,&rdquo; I still believe Ireland to be one and might have some sympathy with hardships across the Border; but I cannot see how one can possibly carry on a State without doing everything that is proper to prevent smuggling.  It seems to me, however, that the Government, in their laudable anxiety to catch the culprits, are prepared to take the risk of accusing and finding guilty persons who may be perfectly innocent, just because they cannot prove to the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions seem to be extraordinarily <Col N="1794" /> drastic.  Under sub-section (5) of Section 3, a person may be charged with the offence of bringing or sending, on or about a particular date, any goods to any place for the purpose of exportation.  I ask the Minister to consider a particular case.  I happen to possess two watches, though I have not both of them here to-day. One of them, which was given to me, is somewhat ornamental and possesses a sentimental value; and I have a second one which I do not want to get rid of because it happens to keep good time, which the other one does not. Now, I know that they are articles the exportation of which is prohibited.  If I had brought those watches here, and this is a place as defined in this Bill, the Minister's officials could accuse me of having brought the watches here for the purpose of putting them in a packet and posting them from here, this being a less suspicious place than an ordinary post office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>More suspicious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hayes thinks it is more suspicious, but I have given him credit for good intentions, and he may at least give it to the rest of the House.  I ask the Minister how I can prove that I did not bring them here for that purpose.  I can say I did not. If I were not a well-known person, there might seem to be a <i>prima facie</i> case, since I had two watches.  I suggest that the section is too wide in saying that, if a person brings an article the export of which is prohibited to any place, he has to prove that he did not bring it there for the purpose of exportation.  I suggest that a perfectly honest person could not prove that.  Of course, he can tell the court or any official that it is absurd to suggest it, but that is not proving to the contrary.  He might easily satisfy a justice that no case has been made that he intended to export it, but that is not proving to the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me take another case, which might be more serious in its effects. Sub-section (3) of Section 3 says that where a person is charged with the offence of exporting on or about a particular date any goods in contravention <Col N="1795" /> of any enactment or statutory instrument and it is proved that the goods were previously in his possession and that they were actually exported, that person is deemed to have exported them.  If I were a shopkeeper who had had possession of them, I could tell the Minister that I was the owner of a retail business establishment and that I was greatly surprised at what had happened.  I could say that I did not give credit, that I did not know the names of my customers and that some of them might have taken the goods across the Border.  I could say I had no knowledge of it and would not have given out the goods if I had suspected that that would happen.  The customers could come in in the ordinary way of retail business and, if the goods were identifiable, it could easily be proved that I had prior custody and ownership of them in my business.  How on earth could I prove they were not exported or that I had not exported them or that somebody connected with my business had not done so?  If the dates were not too wide apart, I might be able to give a full account of my movements during the time and prove that I was not anywhere near the Border.  However, I do not mind telling the Minister that I do business in Belfast, and cross the Border from time to time.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that there should be none of these provisions, but I am suggesting that, if such drastic action is being taken, which affects everybody in the retail trade who does not know his customers, there should be some safeguarding provisions.  That possibly could be done by an amendment. There should be some definition of &ldquo;place&rdquo;, so that it should not mean &ldquo;anywhere&rdquo;.  It should be necessary for the prosecution to satisfy the court that the place was a suspicious place to bring those goods.  If I brought such goods to a particular place on the Border where there was no authorised customs station, I quite agree that it would be suspicious. But, as it stands, a person might properly bring goods to some place and get mixed up with someone who was a <Col N="1796" /> suspicious character, and unable to prove that he was innocent.  The only possible answer the Minister can give is that his officials would not be likely to prosecute that person.  I believe that is true, but here it is not a case of a particular person that I am dealing with, but rather of a particular class.</P>
    <P>There is no provision at all in the Bill to cover the person who travels across the Border or out of the country.  When this Bill was brought in to tighten up the position, the least the Government might have done was to include a section which would set out and make legal the present practice in such cases.  I have to go to the Six Counties quite often and I go three or four times a year to England.  I have my luggage examined on both sides and watch what happens in regard to other people.  The Minister knows that the ordinary person, taking small quantities of things in his baggage, does not know what is or what is not prohibited.  Generally, the customs officials are very courteous and, unless they see something like an obvious attempt to smuggle things, they allow the small quantity to go through; or, if it is more than they can allow, they say: &ldquo;We are sorry, but this is more than we can allow and we must take it.&rdquo;  My experience is that they are always courteous, but they are dealing with people who should not be brought under this Bill.</P>
    <P>It might be extremely difficult for such people, having brought those goods to that particular place, to prove that they were not trying to smuggle them.  Any person who has a prohibited article in his baggage when going out, should be exempt from these provisions if he has been shown a list and has produced the articles there and then to the official.  As the Bill stands now, if he produces the articles to the official, he can be charged immediately with smuggling.  That is not the intention of the Bill, which is intended to tighten the regulations, so I suggest that there should be some safeguard for individuals who are going about their ordinary business.</P>
    <P>I am always a little bit afraid of very drastic legislation for an emergency.  I <Col N="1797" /> am glad this is only for five years, but I do share Senator Hayes' view in one respect and that is that I think five years too long, and if you are going to have the abolition of the principle that a person is innocent until proved guilty, it is better that it would be done by a special court for that purpose only, which would not introduce the principle generally into the ordinary courts.</P>
    <P>I would be very glad if, in reply to this debate, the Minister&mdash;if it is not too much to ask of him&mdash;will explain to us the meanings of the Schedule. It may be that I have been lazy, and I should have looked up the lists of Acts in the Schedule, which on the face of it looks a little bit peculiar.  We can see the Air-Raid Precautions Act, the Fisheries Act, the Pigs and Bacon Act, the Dangerous Drugs Act and other Acts, all coming under this Schedule. No doubt there is a simple explanation, but perhaps when he is replying the Minister will set us right on that and save us the trouble of going through all these Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>My education is proceeding apace.  I am delighted to learn that I have at least one colleague who is not like unto any other, being neither shopkeeper nor industrialist, who has sources of income putting him beyond the realms of temptation open to the rest of us.  But I do join with Senator Hayes in hoping that the Minister will, perhaps, give some assurances that shopkeepers and traders will seek to have in this Bill.  I have read the Bill several times and I am wondering whether Section 3 (3) is needed at all, whether the position would not be adequately safeguarded in sub-section (7), where it is laid down &ldquo;where a person is charged with the offence of being knowingly concerned...&rdquo; There is the distinction that makes all the difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with the two previous speakers in expressing grave doubts as to the wisdom of having so arbitrary a section which permits the authorities to decide who, prior to such exportation owned, possessed or had any of these prohibited goods.  I doubt if any member of this House has not got <Col N="1798" /> the utmost sympathy with the Minister and does not desire to see the Minister perfect machinery that will stop this pernicious practice of the smuggling in or out of these prohibited goods.</P>
    <P>As Section 3 (3) stands, I join with the previous speakers in suggesting that it is unfair to the trading community. We have to watch the wording of our legislation.  This particular sub-section subjects them to dangers to which they should not be subjected, and I submit, in all humility, that perhaps the Minister might be able to agree that the sub-section could be deleted entirely and that the safeguards he is seeking are embodied in sub-section (7).  I do wish the Minister, in his efforts to stop this practice, every success, and I hope at the same time that he will see some sense in the suggestion I make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister, when in the other House he was defending Section 9, took it in a rather unfortunate way because he gave there as one of his reasons for that particular section that some of the courts had not been as helpful to him as he thought they should be.  It seems to me that if that is so&mdash;I have no knowledge whether it is so or not, but I am perfectly prepared to accept the Minister's word that some of the courts have not been reasonable&mdash;the Minister is going about the matter entirely in the wrong way.  If the Minister feels that certain district justices are making fractions decisions, are not deciding cases in accordance with the law, his attitude should be that he would go in the proper way and dispense with the services of those justices rather than throw, so to speak, an aspersion on the courts of law as a whole, because that is what the effect of his attitude has been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister also to make it clear&mdash;I am not quite clear on the position at the moment&mdash;whether, in the event of a person who is prosecuted being acquitted in the District Court, the State having then appealed and the person again being acquitted in the Circuit Court, the Circuit Court judge will have any power to award the costs of the appeal to that successful <Col N="1799" /> defendant against the Revenue Commissioners. It certainly appears to me to be only fair that if the State, with all its resources, is able to bring a small man, not merely to one court but to a second court for the purpose of proving his innocence&mdash;because that is what it amounts to under this Bill; it is not a question of the State going to prove his guilt but of the State asking the defendant to prove his innocence &mdash;it should pay his costs.  If the court has not power to give him his costs, I think the Minister will agree with me that it would be reasonable that such power should be provided, now that an appeal is being provided.  I do not know quite honestly whether the power is there in regard to these particular Acts, but if it is not, I suggest that it certainly ought to be.</P>
    <P>The whole difficulty about Section 3 is that it deals entirely with the case of the Revenue Commissioners suspecting that a person is about to do something; in other words, it deals with the suspicion that there is a germ of thought in somebody else's mind and that suspicion is being made guilt until it is upset.  I suggest that it ought to be dealt with.  I am entirely with the Minister in giving him every reasonable power that he possibly can have to prevent illegal export, but I suggest to him that the matter might be got round in some way by ensuring that there would be a specific provision, a specific safeguard, that the Revenue Commissioners would have to prove that they had reasonable grounds for that suspicion and, if they were able to prove that, then it would make the defendant guilty unless he was able to prove his innocence, but not until that had been done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a good deal about sympathy with the purposes of this Bill, and dislike and reprobation of any smuggling.  But I suppose we have an equal reprobation of the act of murder, and yet nobody has ever suggested, in the code of law as applied to murder, that the accused should have to prove his innocence.  I feel that there is inadequate justification for that complete reversal of the <Col N="1800" /> code of law, that a person is assumed to be guilty and has to prove his innocence.  I have no sympathy with customs offences, but I do not feel that customs offences, which in a way are not as serious as many other offences which I could name, should be put in this, as one might say, privileged position.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given us no instances of the evasions which have made this necessary.  One does not naturally know, but there is in the minds of some of us a feeling that a lot is happening about which we never hear.  I do not want to go into that, but everybody knows that things are happening every day which are excluded from the public Press.  I have not seen anything in the Press which leads me to believe there have been mysterious evasions of the customs regulations.  I have no doubt, however, that the Minister will tell us there have been these evasions, and that that is the reason for this Bill. Or, is it purely precaution?  Is it that the Minister is afraid that things will be done in the future which have not been done up to the present?  In fact, I put this specific question to the Minister: What is the need for completely departing from the sacred principle of law which governs practically every offence we know of, except, I believe, house-breaking?  I know that, when reading law in my young days, I was always led to believe that the only offence in which guilt was assumed was that of being found in possession of house-breaking appliances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that only latterly has it been necessary to prohibit exports, and that hitherto the customs were mainly concerned with import protection.  Is this principle of assuming guilt enshrined anywhere in the import regulations?  There is the Customs Act of 1872, about which the only thing I know is that it touches on a matter, censorship, with which I am very much concerned.  The Act of 1872 is used to justify the seizing of books coming into the country when apparently censorship cannot be carried out by any other means.  That is the only kind of intimate acquaintance I have with that Act, but I should <Col N="1801" /> like to know whether this departure from the ordinary presumption of innocence is embodied in that Act, and to what extent is it there embodied.</P>
    <P>I feel very much in agreement with Senator Hayes that it is very tempting to take far wider powers than are necessary.  It is the lurking desire of everybody to get power and be a dictator if he can.  In a democracy where majorities are pretty well under rule and order, it is a great temptation, and it is our duty to be very vigilant about these matters, and even if it does mean an occasional evasion of the law, to put that in the balance against the danger of accusing innocent people. I hope that, when the Bill comes to the Committee Stage, it may be possible to get the Minister to make some modification, some concession, in regard to these drastic powers he is taking.  I should also like to see the life of the measure much shorter.  I think five years is an unnecessarily long period for which to give these powers.</P>
    <P>We have a right also to ask the Minister if these extreme powers have been found necessary in any of what I call the freedom-loving countries.  I know that in totalitarian States anything can be done and one is liable to be put into a concentration camp if one opens one's mouth too wide, but, in democratic countries, do these powers exist?  It is very hard for us to make adequate research, but have they ever taken such powers in England, in America, in the Scandinavian countries, or in Holland or Denmark, all of which are what I call freedom-loving countries, where popular freedom is respected in a way in which it is not in certain other countries? What is the reason for this long Schedule?  The Minister may say that we should have examined the statutes, but there are some extraordinary repeals, such as the repeal of the Musk Rats Act, and I think we might ask the Minister, who can get the information very readily from his officials, why that long list of repeals is necessary.</P>

      <P>Senator Sweetman made an extraordinary statement.  He said <Col N="1802" /> that the Minister had complained that some district justices were not giving him the results he wanted, and suggested that, if that were so, he ought to get rid of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Senator suggested anything of the sort. What the Senator suggested was that if some district justices were being fractious and were not fairly interpreting the law, the proper way to deal with that situation was to remove them and not to criticise the entire administration of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the point. We complain about the powers the Minister is taking in the Bill, but we are to give him a power which is not given in this or any other country in the world, according to the Senator's suggestion.</P>
      <P>I am in thorough agreement with the discussion up to now, because, like the other speakers, I notice a tendency on the part of Ministers to assume and to accumulate power.  They will tell us it is because of the emergency and that the powers are necessary, but, having got them, they are anxious to use them now and again, although we get assurances that they are to be used only in case of emergency and in extreme circumstances. I am very reluctant to give this power.  The question has already been asked&mdash;and I hope the Minister will deal with it&mdash;in the event of a citizen being brought before the court and getting a discharge&mdash;in other words, being proved innocent&mdash;and the State taking the case further, what redress has that citizen against the State in respect of expenses incurred and the stigma of a prosecution?  Is there any provision, or would the Minister be prepared to adopt any provision, to compensate such a person?  There ought to be provision for that.  I do not think there is any need to go into the other point raised by Senator Sir John Keane as to the number of repeals in the Bill, but I should like the Minister to give us some information on the two points I have referred to.</P>

      <P>Coming from a Border county, one hears so much for and against a measure like this that it is <Col N="1803" /> rather difficult to express a view on it at all.  I frankly feel in the position of one who regards the Minister as asking the House to give him very extraordinary powers, and, on the other hand, who knows that his officials would probably say that he is asking for these powers five years too late.  I am wondering what the Minister seeks to prevent being exported now and why it is that this illicit traffic was not stopped years ago.  That is what puzzles a great many of us.  I would like to have some enlightenment on what the Minister hopes to achieve at this time of the day.  Stories of smuggling can be told in any of the counties along the Border which are so amazingly fascinating that probably one of the most interesting books of modern times could be written on some of the escapades of these people.  I see Senator Johnston smiling.  I am sure he could tell some interesting tales himself.  We all know the ingenuity and the marvellous ability to plan shown by those people who have engaged in the traffic of exporting prohibited goods.  The degree of success they have apparently achieved has been a revelation to all of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is terrible, but I do not know what you would say if you saw a farmer prepared to pay £5 or £6 for a bag of sulphate of ammonia, the <Col N="1804" /> export of which is prohibited, and saw a good crop of potatoes after using it. I am not going over the measure as a whole, but I want to draw the attention of the Minister to Section 4 and to call the attention of the House also to the fact that Section 4 gives power to an officer in the customs whenever he reasonably suspects, to request any person in whose possession or control or in whose land or premises, or in the immediate vicinity of whose lands or premises the goods are found, to give certain information such as the name and address of the owner and so on.</P>
      <P>I want to point out to the Minister, and I am sure that Senator Johnston will agree, that the use of that power is likely to create very considerable complications.  If you happen to be the owner of a farm of, say, 100 acres along the Border, when the nights are long...</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>...and particularly favourable for those who know the byways and keep off the highways, it is very easy for a farmer to be put in the position of having goods stored on his land of which he will have no knowledge whatever and cannot possibly have.  Some of us know there are corners in our fields that we do not see for months at certain periods of the year.  I am sure that Senator Hearne will bear me out that he does not look in all the nooks and corners of his farm after he has gathered in his harvest and abandoned his fields to the winter and the weather.  The people who carry on this sort of traffic are very observant.  Not only are they observant of the habits and beats of the customs officials, but it is their job, too, to be observant of the habits of the farmers whose lands they have to traverse, and I can easily see farmers put in a very difficult position by that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to hear the Minister on it because I can assure the Minister that a great many things happen along the Border, and a great many people make use of the land of farmers without permission, and the farmers have very little sympathy with what is going on <Col N="1805" /> at all.  If the farmer is to be held responsible for everything found on his land, it is very easy for somebody who does not like me very well, to have me brought before the court and obliged to give an account of something found on my land.  The quantity may not be very large, but it may be prohibited goods.  I will have more to say about it when the Committee Stage is reached.</P>
    <P>Of course, a good deal depends on how it is going to be interpreted.  I would like the Minister, if it is possible for him, to tell us something about the proposed repeal of Section 30 of the Agricultural Produce (Potatoes) Act of 1931.  I have not discovered the meaning of Section 30 of that Act, but I may infer that it is something which will prohibit me, as a neighbouring farmer, passing a sack of potatoes to a man across the fence in Fermanagh.  It may also prohibit the exchange of seeds, an exchange that often takes place, and I would like to hear from the Minister what exactly is meant by it.</P>
    <P>Generally, however, I say to the House, that the problems of the customs officials are so great and the ingenuity of the people with whom they come in contact by day and night, mostly by night, is so amazing, that I doubt very much if any law this House can pass will enable them to circumvent the activities of these people.  I do not think it will.  They will beat you every time.  They have ways and means of assuring the success of their ventures.  I think the Minister will have to make investigations of a character other than what he will be able to achieve by a Bill like this, but there is the grave danger that the passage of such an Act as this may cause innocent people to be found guilty of offences of which they have no knowledge and no sympathy whatever.  I would not like the Bill to pass and be committed to the principle embodied in it without indicating my fears in that regard.  Too much of our territory runs along the Border for me not to know very well the difficult position that a few people, prepared to engage in any reckless escapade, can create for a great number of law-abiding <Col N="1806" /> people who have no desire whatever to engage in this sort of business.</P>
    <P>There are not so many people engaging in this illicit trade at all.  The number is limited, but, apparently, they have it very well organised and they are really efficient in the way they go about their job.  You would have to have some admiration for the skill with which they execute their task. They have been really effective.  It is conceivable that the net result of the Bill will be to impose penalties, not on those who help them at all, but on unwilling victims.  It is an aspect of the matter to which I should like the Minister to give some attention in his reply.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Baxter, I come from a Border county and although I have no personal knowledge of smugglers I know smuggling is going on.  I say without fear of being accused of exaggeration that it has been brought to a very fine art.  I do think that the Bill is very, very necessary, and I do agree with Senator Baxter about the provision that a person with land upon which something is caught or near which something is caught, may be liable.  I think there is danger there.  My own opinion is that at the present time nothing is got from over the other side of the Border without something being put over from this side.  There is our big trouble.  Good foodstuffs, particularly butter, are being put across the border.</P>

I do not begrudge the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners whatever powers they may need because, in my opinion, if there were a preventive officer in every field from one end of the Border to the other it would not stop it.  I think as Senator Baxter said, they would find some better way of hoodwinking. It was common in the economic war and it is common now for somebody to put out an old pig or something, allow that to be caught and then get over a whole drove of cattle in some other place.  Farmers are getting hundreds of thousands of pounds by giving access to the lands on this side and <Col N="1807" /> the other side of the Border to drive cattle over.  That was the position and the present position is that hardly anything is being got from the other side without valuable foodstuffs being put over which we want for ourselves.</P>

      <P>Judging by the speeches I listened to with interest, I would suggest that it is a good job for me that I was not the British Minister responsible for introducing in an atmosphere anything like the atmosphere here to-night, the customs provisions now in operation under the British laws for which Senator Sir John Keane has such a very high regard &mdash;the sacred principles of British law. There is not in this Bill one new principle that is not already in British law, not a shadow of one that does not exist in the law for the last 75 years, which is longer, I expect, a good deal even, than the life of Senator Sir John Keane.  We heard a lot about the code of law, and I thought Senator Sir John Keane said he knew something about the law, and he spoke about the sacred principle of the right of people to be tried before being found guilty, which he said is enshrined in British law. There is not a single principle of any kind introduced into this Bill that has not been in existence in the code of law dealing with customs since it was established and formulated by the British Parliament.  The Senator spoke of the reversal of the code of law.</P>

      <P>I am using the general statement Senator Sir John Keane made.  I hope I am quoting him exactly.  If I am not I am prepared to be corrected.  I wrote down here the words he used.  If I did not hear them correctly I would not want to misrepresent him.  But here in the note it is &ldquo;a complete reversal of the code of law&rdquo;.  That is one phrase. Another is: &ldquo;completely departing from the sacred principles of law&rdquo;. There is not a word of truth in either one of these statements.  The same applies to the remarks of other Senators that this is a most drastic <Col N="1808" /> measure.  It is admittedly drastic.  So is the code of law at present in existence relating to customs, the code relating to smuggling inwards.  Some people here, probably Senator Sweetman might know something about it, because he is a lawyer.  It is a drastic code, but drastic and all as it is, it has not stopped smuggling.  As Senator Baxter has said, probably smuggling will go on to the end.  It may be that the law will be amended now and again by innocent Ministers like myself who come here and try to get this House to pass some measure.</P>

Certainly I do not want to put any innocent citizen in a wrong light before the law or before his fellow citizens.  But smuggling has grown to an enormous extent.  Those on the Border, like Senator Baxter and Senator Johnston know a good deal about it because they are probably asked on frequent occasions to interfere with the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners to try to save a smuggler who has been caught.</P>

There are piles of correspondence from Deputies and Senators, influential people, clergymen and others, trying to save these smugglers from the consequence of their acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the year ended March 13th last there were 13,000 seizures of smuggled goods.  There were a good many cases where we could not prove their offences because in the case of smuggling out of the country our law had not contemplated such a state of affairs.  British <Col N="1809" /> law did not contemplate it.  Until recent times they had not very much use for it.  As Senator Douglas said, they had no land frontier, but there is exactly the same drastic law in operation in England to prohibit export smuggling as well as import smuggling, as we are asking the House to give us. There is not in the Bill any new principle that there is not in the modern British code since the war.</P>

      <P>Very well, we will have that on the Committee Stage. The principle that we ask for here is in existence in British and very modern British law.  As a democrat I do not wish that the rights, powers, and liberties of any individual citizen should unnecessarily be restricted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are struggling through a very bad period of the emergency.  Even though the war in Europe may end, as some hold, in the course of a few months, the emergency, so far as the difficulty of getting supplies is concerned, will not end for a long time after.  We will still have great difficulty in supplying our people even with the essentials&mdash;clothes, boots, and other things, as well as foodstuffs.  The fact is that things that were in short supply here were being exported.  We know that.  Amongst the seizures made last year were sugar, and other essential goods that are required here. Medicines of different kinds and drugs are very difficult to get, but when some supplies happened to be brought into the country they were smuggled out.  In all cases we were not successful in getting the people concerned convicted. I do not want to see innocent people convicted any more than any Senator does.  But it has been the experience of the British Government, and of our own officials here, officials with long experience in regard to <Col N="1810" /> smuggling into and out of the country, that smugglers are very able people. They are able to get round, over and under all the rules and regulations of the officials.  You would want to have an official watcher on every 50 yards of the Border in order to prevent this smuggling, and even then you may not succeed.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes and other Senators referred to the onus being put on the individual to prove himself innocent. That is enshrined in the British customs law.  It is nothing new.  It is not new in our law because we adopted British law.  It is not right, as Senator Hayes said&mdash;I know he was referring to me in my official position as Minister for Finance&mdash;that I do not care two hoots about anyone's principles.  I really do care about people's principles and about the principles of democracy, and it is because I was so impressed by the case made against the provisions of this Bill in the Dáil&mdash;drastic as I know they are&mdash;that I agreed to change its character from a permanent to a temporary measure.  The Bill, as introduced in the Dáil, was intended to be a part of our permanent legislation. I think that was going a good part of the road to meet the criticism that was put up against the Bill.  With regard to a point made by Senator Douglas, the position previously was that normally smuggling was not regarded as a criminal offence, but as a civil offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

      <P>In November last that point was determined by the Supreme Court.  The court held that an offence of export smuggling committed under the Emergency Powers Orders was a criminal offence.  Previous to that, smuggling had been regarded as a civil offence.  Senator Douglas also raised a question about defining &ldquo;place&rdquo;.  I do not think that we will find it possible to do so.  We will have to leave it wide, and very wide.  I do not think that any definition that we might get would be satisfactory.  Any restriction on it would, I suggest, only <Col N="1811" /> play into the hands of the smuggler. We shall probably discuss that further on the Committee Stage.  Senator Sweetman and Senator Foran raised a point about the awarding of costs. I am not sure, but I do not think there is power to award costs in the District Court, and I am doubtful about the Circuit Court.</P>

      <P>It is the best news this country has heard for many a day. Senator Douglas raised another point about shopkeepers being put in difficulties as regards selling goods innocently to people who export them afterwards.  There are shopkeepers who make a business of that. Of course, they are watched, but their customers are not always caught. Unfortunately, we are not always able to catch the people who made these purchases in shops here.  I wish we could.  We are anxious to get extra powers so that we may be put on an equal footing with those shopkeepers and their customers, who are mostly from the North.  They break the law by taking away goods that are urgently required by our own people. Some Senators appeared to be mystified about the long list of items <Col N="1812" /> in the Schedule which are being repealed. The sections which are being repealed apply to the provisions of the Customs Acts and, in specific cases, to various classes of goods subject to export or import prohibition, as the case may be.  These will be superseded by the present Act, and it is desirable that they should not continue to cumber the Statutes.  The proposal is just to make the law simpler and does not take away any power that we already have.  When the House passes this Bill, the powers in the Statutes that are being repealed will no longer be required.</P>

      <P>We have had a lot of time to think over the speeches that were made on this debate, which commenced on the 7th December.  Senator Tunney must be gratified to have drawn such a long discussion and especially to have got Senator Duffy and Senator O'Reilly to engage in such research on the subject. They gave us very lengthy speeches, which included many quotations and figures, some from a congress of standing and others that I never heard of before, and they drew various conclusions.  I agree with very few of them.  I had an opportunity of reading the printed report of the debate which took place here on the 7th December last, and it struck me that Senator O'Reilly of Leitrim&mdash; I am sorry I do not know the initials&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who made a speech which contained no quotations and very few figures, came to very sound conclusions drawing on his own observations and his own experience.  I would commend that speech to any Senator who wants a sensible point of view of the question under discussion. I took a few notes from Senator Duffy's speech.  The House will remember it was very lengthy.  One thing he said, as far as I remember his words, was that in Great Britain, despite a decrease in the area under grass, they have succeeded in increasing the number of cattle during the war.  There are people in this country &mdash;I did not know that Senator Duffy was one of them but apparently he is&mdash; who have a great regard for what they are able to do in other countries, and especially for what is being done by our powerful neighbour, and they do not go to the trouble of finding out whether or not we have done just as well, as we have in this particular case.  Despite 1,000,000 acres less under grass in this country, we have increased our cattle during the war. Senator Duffy did not know that but he knew that England did it.  I do not know whether that is the international outlook or not, but at any rate, it appears that there are certain people who are prepared to study what other nations have done and to come here and lecture us on what they have done and what we should do.</P>
      <P>Before giving us a lecture like that again, let them at least find out whether or not we have done just as well here.  We hear from time to time in this country, and we read from time to time in the daily papers of the splendid achievement of the British Government in their tillage programme. I have seen that mentioned in some of the daily papers; I have heard it pointed out by speakers in the other House&mdash;I do not remember it here&mdash;and I say that if we compare the percentage increase in tillage, or the percentage increase in output, we again, have done just as well as they have in Great Britain, or for that matter, I daresay we have done just as well as any other country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a great deal about Denmark, <Col N="1815" /> and undoubtedly Denmark has done very well.  They have a very fine up-to-date system of agriculture in Denmark, and evidently the farmers work very hard there.  Our farmers work hard also.  The one mistake, in my opinion, that is always made by people who compare the Danish figures and the Irish figures is that they always quote the gross output; they never quote the net output, and it makes the greatest difference.  You could have practically any output in a country if you bring in enough feeding stuffs and feed them to your animals and turn them out, but I think if our country does not bring in so much feeding-stuffs, if they engage more in the production of their own crops, feeding these crops to their own animals and selling these animals, and if they do comparatively well in that way, that is, in net output, then we should not be, as it were, put on a very low stool as compared with Denmark. Denmark, of course, would beat us even on that basis.  I admit that they would beat us in net output, but it is the net output figure that should be taken when comparing the two countries.</P>
    <P>We were invited by Senator Duffy last night to consider the enormous export of Denmark compared with ours.  That does not impress me at all. I do not think exports are any criterion of the standard of living of a people. As a matter of fact, probably any country that could afford it would have less exports and would use more themselves.  Therefore, if we are keeping more in this country, if, for instance, as I have often heard&mdash;I cannot vouch for it&mdash;we consume more butter here than they do in Denmark, then, if we are going to be lectured on the great position of the export market for Danish butter, I say that is one matter in respect of which I do not agree with the policy of the Danes, if they are exporting butter and leaving their own people less butter for themselves.</P>
    <P>Years ago, when I was reading Irish history, I read that during the great famine here almost 100 years ago, there was a very prosperous export business <Col N="1816" /> from this country.  Surely we do not want that sort of thing.  Senator Duffy went on to deal with another matter. He quoted an economist to show that the amount sold off a small farm in some country&mdash;I do not remember where&mdash;was higher per acre than the amount sold per acre off a large farm. Again, I should like to know the full circumstances because I am very suspicious, if a small farmer is selling more per acre off his farm than a big farmer, that there is a certain amount of compulsion in it, that he has to sell in order to pay his way.  It must be obvious that a small farmer who has a growing family will need a greater proportion of his output for his own family than, say, a farmer who has 100 acres.  If it is a fact that in that particular place to which Senator Duffy referred&mdash;I did not get the name &mdash;the small farmer was actually selling more off his farm than a bigger farmer was off his farm, I should like to know if that small farmer had as good a table as the bigger farmer.  The output per person in this country is higher off the big farm, but the yield per acre is higher off the small farm.  These are two facts that I think Senator Duffy did not grasp exactly when he was quoting some other figures.</P>
    <P>Another economist quoted by Senator Duffy calculated that before the war every person in this country, to have a proper standard of living, would need 10/- worth of food per week.  That may be correct; probably it is.  Senator Duffy then did a fairly simple calculation.  He multiplied 10/- by 52 and said that that represented the value of the food that a person would need in a year.  He then multiplied that by the number of people in the country and he got a sum of £60,000,000 odd.  I am not saying that his arithmetic is not correct, but I am coming to the part I cannot understand. He said that our agricultural output was £61,000,000 and therefore, he said, we had not enough to feed ourselves.  I think there is the greatest fallacy in that statement.  Obviously the economist Senator Duffy quoted must have been aware that the person who is buying food for his family has to buy it at retail prices, but our output <Col N="1817" /> of agriculture is estimated at off-the-farm prices.  In other words, Senator Duffy made no allowance for the difference between the price of 1 lb. of wheat and the price of 1 lb. of bread. He made no allowance for the difference between the price of the bullock selling at 5d. on the bone and the beefsteak selling at 1/10, which, of course, is all wrong.  Senator Duffy should have kept that in mind.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy is pillorying the farmers for not turning out enough food to feed ourselves, and he proves that by quoting figures that are not comparable&mdash;the off-farm prices with the retail prices in the shops.  I do not know whether any producer here has had the experience of bringing vegetables to the Dublin market.  I had; I had such an experience that I gave it up.  In my time I brought lettuce to the Dublin market.  I got 3d. a dozen for it, and afterwards I saw my lettuce, or lettuce that was no better, selling at 3d. per head in the shop.  Senator Duffy ignores these differences in his calculation.</P>
    <P>Going back a little, I want to correct another point made by Senator Tunney.  Senator Tunney said that beef was selling on the Dublin market at 5d. a lb. and that beefsteak was costing about 1/5 per lb.  I think that in the first place Senator Tunney was talking of a second-class bullock when he spoke of 5d. per lb.  Secondly, he was talking of 5d. per lb. as the price when the bullock walked over the scales.  That second-class bullock when killed would only give a yield of 50 per cent. of its live weight.  It would take 2 live lbs. to make 1 dead lb., therefore the bullock would cost 10d. per lb. dead weight for a start off.  Another fact, as I am sure Senator Tunney is well aware, that the whole of a bullock is not beefsteak.  There are a number of gaps to be covered in that instance.</P>
    <P>In the last note I took of Senator Duffy's economic facts, he quoted a farmer who had four cows and who had a great mortality, so much mortality that, as Senator Duffy says, the man ended by going into the poteen business.  The Senator need not have told us that, because it was evident that the man was in the poteen business before he met Senator Duffy.  I <Col N="1818" /> do not think any man could have suffered a mortality of 200 per cent., no matter what business he was in.</P>

      <P>He had four cows and eight died in two years.  The poteen in that case was fairly good.  Senator O'Reilly, who spoke last night, made one observation which I think every Senator should keep in mind.  That is that when we talk about agricultural wages and compare them with urban wages, we should remember the conditions that apply in both cases. Senator O'Reilly went into it in detail but I want only to remind Senators of the importance of that fact &mdash;the difference in rent and the difference in the cost of fuel for instance. The agricultural labourer gets fuel free or very cheaply.  There is also the difference in the cost of vegetables.  If he does not grow them himself, he gets them free from his employer.  There is also a difference in the cost of milk. These things should be kept in mind and certain allowances should be made when we compare wages in the country with wages in urban districts. Senator O'Reilly made the point that under vocational organisation wages would be settled in a sensible way.  I do not think that under any vocational organisation you could have a board constituted on a more vocational basis than the present board.  I, therefore, fail to see how any improvement could be made under vocational organisation.  I intend to deal with that point in more detail later.</P>
      <P>Senator McCabe in speaking last night told us about the 30-acre farm, and said that there was a very small margin left in that case for the owner. He gave us the expenses of the farm and the receipts for 12 months. Amongst these was one item I took a note of.  The farmer he said had five cows and his receipts from the creamery were £50.  Assuming the worst conditions&mdash;that the milk was sold during the summer months when milk is only 10½d. a gallon&mdash;the Senator's figures would show that the yield from his cows was about 230 gallons each.</P>

      <P>Senator Counihan might buy a cow for 30/ but he knows the difference between a good milker and a bad milker.  This motion opens with a statement deploring present conditions and calls for adequate remuneration for the farmer and a fair wage for the labourer.  I was speaking about output and the difference between gross and net output.  If the Seanad does not mind, I should like to go back to that point.  Senators know that &ldquo;output&rdquo; means that part of the total production sold off the farm and not used for further farming purposes &mdash;the feeding of animals and so forth. Net output is calculated by deducting from the farmer's gross output what he may have purchased in the way of seeds and manures for the production of his crops or materials for the feeding of his animals.  These gross outputs are given in index numbers.  The index number is taken at 100 for 1929-30.  We are told in the statistics that, if we take the gross output in 1929-30 as being 100, then in 1942-43 it was 89.3.  That is a misleading figure, because farmers in 1942-43 purchased practically no feeding stuffs.  One farmer might have purchased from another but that does not count. Therefore, the net output would be really much more favourable in the latter year.  In 1938-39, the value of feeding stuffs, fertilisers and seeds purchased was £8,698,000.  In 1942-43, it was £2,596,000&mdash;about £6,000,000 less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The value of the net output is also given in these statistics and it is no harm to refer to it.  In 1929-30 it was £52,237,000.  In 1938-39, it was £44,783,000 and, in 1942-43, it was £83,607,000.  Senator Duffy was trying to get at the volume of the output rather than the value.  That is very important, because the fact that prices went up may have given the farmers a bigger output value.  What we want <Col N="1820" /> to know is whether they actually turned out as much stuff as they previously did or not.  The statisticians arrive at the volume of net output by calculating what the value of net output would have been in 1942-43 if prices had been the same as in 1938-39. In that way, they find the volume of net output.  In 1942-43 it was 9.1 per cent. greater than it was then and 10.3 per cent. greater than it was in 1929-30. That is the important figure.  The figure for net output is the figure we should take if we want to find whether our farmers are doing better than they were doing ten or 12 years ago or not. It is also the figure we should take if we want to find out how our farmers here compare with the farmers of other countries.  Were it not for Senator Duffy's speech last night, I would not go into this aspect of the matter.  I had not time to get the net output figure for Denmark or any other country but, when we compare the gross output here and in Denmark, the comparison seems to be very much against us.  If we take the net output, the comparison is more favourable to us but, even in net output, the Danish farmers beat us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect they will appear. The Senator himself can work the matter out in the way I suggest.  But if he wants to get the volume of net output, he must take each item separately.  If he works the matter out in the way I mentioned, he will get the same figures as I got.  Now, I come to the question of the remuneration of farmers and farm <Col N="1821" /> labourers.  The farmers' income in 1929-30&mdash;that is, the value of the output which was distributed amongst all the farmers of this State&mdash;was £52,232,000.  In 1942-43 it was £83,607,000.  That is to say, it increased by 62½ per cent.  That would go to show that every farmer's income has increased by 62½ per cent.  There is one factor which I did not take into calculation.  Everybody knows that there were fewer people engaged on the land in 1942-43 than there were in 1929-30.  Therefore, the income of each person engaged on the land must have gone up by more than 62½ per cent. The agricultural wage in 1929-30, according to our figures, averaged 24/9 per week.  In 1944, it was 40/3 per week.  That is an increase of 61½ per cent.  It appears, therefore, that the farmer's income increased by 62½ per cent. and that the farm labourer's wage went up by 61½ per cent.  That would show that the farmer treated his labourer as fairly as he could be expected to do.  The cost-of-living index figure in 1929-30 was 174 and, in 1944, 295, an increase of 60 per cent. The position is: from 1929-30 to the present time, the cost of living went up by 60 per cent., the labourer's wage went up by 61½ per cent. and the remuneration of the farmer by 62½ per cent.  That is to say, the three moved almost <i>pari passu.</i>  If it had been laid down in 1929-30 that the farmer's income was to increase exactly in accord with the increase in the cost of living and that the labourer's wage should similarly increase, we could hardly have done better.</P>

        <i>Agreed that the Seanad sit later than 9 p.m. to enable the Minister to conclude his speech.</i>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a discussion on that matter in the Dáil recently and I take it that some Senators read the debate that took place there.</P>
      <P>This question of guaranteed prices is a very important and a very interesting subject.  There are two factors, in my opinion, that we must have in the situation before you can guarantee a price for an agricultural product, and I suppose the same applies to other commodities also.  The first is that you must have uniformity, and the second is that it must be sold on the home market.  I think it must be obvious that it is extremely difficult to guarantee prices unless you have uniformity. For instance, I think it is obvious that it would be impossible to have a guaranteed price in the case of store cattle.  I know that in England they have very intricate and elaborate classifications in regard to beef, such as first-grade, second-grade, third-grade, and so on, and then there is also a classification with regard to deadweight.  Possibly, we could do that also, but Senators know that the greater part of our cattle are store cattle for export, and I do not think you could possibly guarantee a price for these stores.  Every Senator knows that you may have two beasts on offer for sale in the Dublin market, each of them weighing 10 cwt.&mdash;good stores&mdash;but that even though they are the same weight there may be a difference in value, as between the two beasts, of £2 or £3.  So you cannot have a guaranteed price unless you have uniformity and, in order to have uniformity, the produce concerned must be sold on the home market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, what agricultural produce would be best calculated to qualify under those two tests?  Well, creamery butter, for instance, is of a uniform character.  I do not believe that there is an expert in this country who, if two <Col N="1823" /> samples of butter from different creameries were offered to him, could say whether the product of one creamery was different from that of another; and, of course, the ordinary consumer who buys butter from one creamery or another does not see any difference.  Bacon, I think, could also be regarded as uniform, within the limit of weights&mdash;a system which we had here at one time.  We had bacon weighing between minimum and maximum weights going at a certain price, and so on.  Wheat, of course, is also uniform and we have a guaranteed price for that, if it is within a certain bushel weight, because that is a way of ruling out wheat which is damp or inferior in any way.  Beet, because of its sugar content, is also a commodity for which we can guarantee a price.  Eggs which are of a uniform weight could be sold at a guaranteed price, and I think the same would apply to poultry.  But there is only a limited number of such commodities which can be sold on that basis because, where there is a big surplus of other commodities, then, naturally, the export price will fix the price to be paid here, and we cannot control the export price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless you control the price at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a proposal that has been put up occasionally.  It can be said that you can deal with exported articles also by means of control by a single agency dealing with export and that, if that single agency has to export the article at less than the fixed price, the loss can be made good through the Exchequer or in some other way, but that is very difficult to do.  In the case of butter we can fix the price of creamery butter for export, but that would be only a very small amount. Where you have a large export, it would be ridiculous to have any fixed price because, in a case of that kind, where the amount exported is much more important, quantitatively, than what is used at home, it would be impossible to guarantee a price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no objection to this fixation of prices, but I do say, as I said in the <Col N="1824" /> Dáil, that although I see no objection to the theory of it, when you come down to the practical side of it, it is a very different matter.  It begins to get difficult to decide what is the level of the prices.  We would all agree that the farmer should get the best possible return and that the consumer should get the best value that he can get.  In order to do so, we should fix the price at the best possible level, but, in doing so, we should endeavour to give a fair return to the farmer and also give the commodity to the consumer at a fair price.  In that connection, I invited the Dáil to give me some machinery for dealing with those prices, and I was told that as I was in charge of that matter they should not be expected to tax their brains in dealing with it.  Now, what we have done in the fixing of the prices of wheat and beet and, during the emergency, of the prices of milk, eggs and so on, is that we have fixed the prices at the level which we thought would give the farmers a proper return, but we have to admit that we had not proper costings and did not have the machinery to enable the farmer to produce more wheat and beet or to be certain whether the prices were fair or not.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should say that I am not against the idea of the fixation of prices, but I want the Seanad to realise that there are certain difficulties in connection with it.  I was misinterpreted in the Dáil, and it was held that I was against the idea because I said that I did not want to be tied down to it.  I did not say that I was against it.  All I said was that I did not want to be tied to it, although I was in sympathy with it. That, again, is a difficult matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy last night spoke about the type of representatives we have on some of these agricultural committees. He made the complaint that they were not exactly representative of agricultural labourers.  I do not know whether Senator Duffy has very much cause for making allegations like that or not.  In the beginning, when these committees were set up, we went to a considerable amount of trouble, a great deal of trouble, in trying to get both <Col N="1825" /> representatives of labourers and farmers on these boards.  As far as my recollection goes, the county committees of agriculture, in nearly all cases, made recommendations in regard to the men who would represent the farmers or the employers.  But, in nearly every case, the county committees said they were not in a position to make recommendations in regard to the representatives of labour.</P>
    <P>Inspectors working under the Department of Agriculture were also asked to make recommendations, and eventually in some way or another these men were appointed.  I would like to say that since these committees were set up, and since the board began its work, they have worked smoothly and very happily together.  Senator Duffy said last night that we could not imagine the representatives of the farmers and of the labourers agreeing on any particular question that might come before them with regard to fair wages.  The strange thing is that they nearly always agree, practically every year, since the system started.  The board makes the final recommendation. If they do not agree, the chairman has to come in and make an award.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, I should have started by saying that it should be described as arbitration machinery.  You have representatives of the employers and of the labourers on these committees throughout the country.  All of them hold their meetings about the autumn, or the end of the autumn season, to make recommendations for the coming year.  The recommendations come before the board.  Again, the board is composed of representatives of the farmers and labourers with what are called three neutral members and the chairman.  It is laid down in the Act that if the representatives of the farmers and the labourers agree, then their agreement goes, and nobody can alter it.  That is a system of arbitration where the chairman goes to the committees, brings back a recommendation, takes it before the board and tries, as far as he can, to get agreement. So far as I can recollect, he has always got agreement.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong, but so far as I can recollect he has never had to give an <Col N="1826" /> award himself&mdash;he has always got agreement.  The three neutral members are called in only when the employers and the employees cannot reach agreement and when the chairman has to make an award.  It is a very good system, and it has worked very well. The whole matter was discussed very fully in 1936 when the Bill to establish the board was brought before the Dáil and the Seanad.  I do not think that anybody at that time, whether representative of farmers or labourers in either House, ever made a suggestion of appointing persons other than those provided for in the Bill.  The Bill provided that the Minister would appoint them.  They all realised then, as they do now, that there is no organisation in this country of farmers which represents, let us say, even 50 per cent., and no organisation of agricultural labourers that represents 50 per cent. of labourers or even 30 per cent. of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is as far as Senator Tunney goes in his resolution, but Senator Counihan comes along with an amendment, and the first thing he asks for is the stabilisation of rates on the basis of the first year of the last European war.  I am surprised that Senator Counihan seems to be departing from complete derating.  There is a certain volume of intelligent opinion now moving towards derating.  I think that Senator Counihan should have stuck to his guns, because one never knows what this new movement may effect, and it would be a pity that they should succeed in getting derating at a time when Senator Counihan had left them altogether.  But, at any rate, there is no good reason for Senator Counihan's amendment about fixing the rate as it was in 1914, unless, as it was said last night, he was going to bring the whole lot back to 1914&mdash; agricultural wages and farmers' prices. We cannot have one thing picked out and left at the 1914 rate while keeping the rate of wages and the price of farmers' produce at the 1944 rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>My idea was that it would be done in the way of subsidising the farmer rather than giving it by way of fixed prices for cattle, pigs, sheep, butter and everything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be something to be said for the view that it is better to cut the farmers' cost in any way you can, instead of trying to help him by putting up prices.  I cannot understand, however, why the 1914 basis should have been taken.  Senator Counihan says that the workers should get &ldquo;the highest wage which the industry can pay.&rdquo;  That is, of course, the whole kernel of the discussion, I am sure, &ldquo;the highest wage <Col N="1828" /> the industry can pay,&rdquo; and it is really the point that the Agricultural Wages Board keeps in mind, because I think that anybody will come to that conclusion without being present at a meeting of the board.  I was never present at a meeting of the board, but I assume that the representatives of the labourers there are always pointing out to the board that it is very difficult for a labourer to live on his present wages.</P>
      <P>I am sure the representatives of the farmers are also always saying: &ldquo;We are paying as much as we can possibly afford,&rdquo; and you have to reconcile those two views as best you possibly can.  Senator Counihan's amendment, therefore, proposing to pay what the farmer can afford is what everybody is looking for, and there is hardly any necessity for an amendment of that kind.</P>
      <P>There is a lot to be said for certain ideas in the motion, but the implications of the motion and of the amendment are objectionable, because it is implied that the farmer is not getting fair play and that the labourer is not getting fair play.  I think the figures showing the farmers' income and the labourers' income and the cost of living in 1929-30 and in 1944, will show that farmers and labourers are getting a fair do, taking everything as it goes.</P>
      <P>The terms of the motion, in some respects, are impracticable.  They could not possibly be carried out, and on that account, not because I am out of sympathy with the line of this motion, but because it is impossible to implement the motion at the moment, in the terms in which it is drawn up, and because it is impracticable to carry out its terms, I would have to disagree and to say the motion is not acceptable, so far as I am concerned. I think that every practical thinking Senator would have to vote against both the amendment and the motion.</P>
