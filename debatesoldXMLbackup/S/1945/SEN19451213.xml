      <P>As Senators are aware, the Expiring Laws Bill is an annual measure.  The Acts which it is proposed to carry on for another year were explained in the memorandum circulated to members of the House with copies of the Bill. Therefore, I think that there is no necessity for me to deal with them in detail.  Senators will have noticed that, from year to year, the number of Acts included in the Expiring Laws Bill is getting smaller.  As provision is made to continue in permanent legislation such portions of these Acts as are required, the list will get even smaller.</P>

      <P>The note which I have got from the Department of Local Government and Public Health is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;As regards the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1883, the position is somewhat anomalous, but to make the Act permanent after 62 years would require more justification than its continuance as a temporary Act for a further period.  It is not <Col N="1304" /> opportune at present to promote a new measure to replace it, but the first suitable opportunity will be taken to review the position.  In the meantime, the Act must be continued, as it is the basis of the Labourers Act code.&rdquo;</P>

    <Title>Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1945&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The objects of this Bill are to permit the funds of the Post Office Savings Bank to be invested in stocks of local authorities having trustee status and to assist local authorities, out of the Local Loans Fund, in exercising an option to pay off a stock issue on or after the beginning of the redemption period.</P>
      <P>Under the law at present, investment of the bank's funds is restricted to Irish and British Government stocks and funds and to securities guaranteed as to principal and interest by the State.  It is considered desirable that there should also be power to avail of stock issues of local authorities for investment of moneys of the bank and provision to this end is made in Section 2 of the Bill, the additional power of investment being confined by sub-section (2) to such local stocks as enjoy trustee status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of Section 3 is to facilitate a local authority by the provision of accommodation out of the <Col N="1305" /> Local Loans Fund in connection with the redemption of a stock issue on or after the first date at which the stock falls to be redeemed.  The general intention is that such accommodation should be on a short-term basis pending flotation of a new stock issue, when conditions are favourable, by the local authority concerned.</P>
    <P>While it is reasonable that the Local Loans Fund should not, ordinarily, be available to local authorities as a source of borrowing for the repayment of existing loans, I consider that, where a funding operation in respect of a stock issue is involved, there should be power to assist the local authority in carrying through such an operation, if the necessity arises.  This section will permit the Local Loans Fund to be utilised for the purpose. The terms attaching to any loans made will be settled under the general statutory powers applicable to issues out of the fund.</P>
    <P>As many Senators are aware, particularly those from Dublin, the Dublin Corporation gave due notice to the holders of nearly £800,000 worth of 5 per cent.  stock due for redemption that they intend to redeem it on the 1st of next month. This Bill will enable me to come to the assistance of the corporation in redeeming this stock.  The Finance Committee of the corporation have been considering for some time the issue of a new stock to enable them to convert this 5 per cent. stock into one carrying a much smaller rate of interest.  The negotiations in connection with the matter were somewhat drawn out owing to the anxiety of the Minister for Local Government and myself that the terms of issue of the new stock would be in line with current interest yields and in keeping with the corporation's strong financial position.</P>
    <P>It would be inconvenient for the corporation to float a new long-term loan before the beginning of January but, if this Bill is enacted, I will be in a position, assuming the corporation has not raised the necessary finance from any other source, to have a short-term loan made to them out of the Local Loans Fund on the 1st January, <Col N="1306" /> to be utilised for the redemption of the 5 per cent. stock on that date, thus enabling the flotation of a long-term loan to be postponed for a while. When the Bill has been enacted, it will, of course, be permissible for me under Section 2 to invest part of the funds of the Post Office Savings Bank in the long-term loan on its flotation if this is deemed to be desirable.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Seanad to support the amendment in the law proposed in this Bill.  I ask them to do it so that I will be able to come to the assistance of Dublin Corporation on the 1st January next and in order to enable me to do that it would be necessary and desirable for the Seanad to pass the Bill through all stages in its present session.</P>

      <P>I would like to make most of my arguments on the Committee Stage but I do wish to protest against the bringing in of this Bill at the end of the session in such a manner that it has to be rushed through all its stages in one sitting. There is no necessity in my opinion for this haste.  There are important principles embodied in this Bill and it should receive much more deliberate consideration than it is possible to give it in one sitting.  The whole question of this investment of Post Office funds in local authorities' securities was the subject of comment by the Banking Commission and the legislative process regarding it should be much more deliberate than it is.  That is all I wish to say on the Second Reading, because I can argue the principle more concisely and satisfactorily on the amendments which I have set down for the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>If the Senator wants to come back next week to finish this Bill, I am sure the House will agree. Will he propose that?  There is nobody rushing through this Bill and I do not think there is any other suggestion of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quirke as usual suggests the threat that if we do not finish the Bill to-day, the House will have to be brought back next <Col N="1307" /> week at the usual expense.  That is not really the criticism made by Sir John Keane.  I agree with him that substantial changes in the law of this kind should not be brought in at the end of the year in another House and taken here to be passed through quickly.  So far as passing the Bill through this House quickly is concerned, we may as well be realists. This House does not approve of the Finance Bill; the most it can do is to make recommendations or suggestions. It has no other powers under the Constitution. I have always advocated in connection with Finance Bills that there should be a Committee and Report Stage and no First or Fifth Stages because both are misleading.</P>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, I do not see that anything would be gained by coming back next week, because this, I take it, is a Certified Money Bill.</P>

      <P>I am sorry&mdash;I was under the impression that it was.  I got the Order Paper only before coming into the House.  The argument made by the Minister is that he wants to give facilities to the Dublin Corporation for the redemption of a loan which becomes redeemable on 1st January next, and that is a matter of urgency.  I do not think we could gain anything by postponing the Bill until next year.  I think that much the best thing to do is to face the situation as it is and to take the Committee Stage now or later on.  It is not a Bill which can be discussed adequately on the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>Before Section 3 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>This Act shall continue in force until the expiration of twelve months from the date of the passing thereof, and, unless the Oireachtas otherwise determines, shall then expire.</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment to limit the duration of the Bill to one year. The Bill has been introduced in such a hurry that we are starting hastily on a new and untried sphere in legislation. I think we should at least have an opportunity of reviewing this matter at the end of one year.  We then shall have experience of this Bill and there will be no harm done.  I think it is only wise to approach this matter with caution and deliberation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill does two things which are easily understood from a simple perusal of the Bill as circulated to the House.  It proposes to modernise in some little degree the position of the Post Office Savings Bank fund by enabling the Minister for Finance to <Col N="1309" /> invest the small savings which are collected in the Post Office Savings Bank in the trustee stocks of public authorities.  As Senators are aware, there is presented to both Houses every year a list of the investments in which moneys from the Post Office Savings Bank fund have been placed in the previous years.  Surely we ought to have elbow room in the present day which would enable us to invest these funds at home?  As the law stands, we are limited to investing the funds either in the funds of our own Government or funds guaranteed by them.  The only alternative is British Government funds.  The issue of home stocks was so limited in recent years that they were not sufficient to enable us to invest all the Savings Bank funds.  We were compelled, therefore, to invest them in British Government securities.  I think it is preferable, from that point of view, that these small savings should be at least open for investment in stock issued by local authorities which has a trustee status.  I think that is a reasonable proposition not only for 12 months but that it should continue. Unless the Oireachtas otherwise deliberately decides, if we pass this Bill, the publication of the list of investments will continue, and if at any time Senators desire that the law should be changed, the matter can be raised and debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no reason at all for limiting the powers granted under this Bill for 12 months.  The powers are good in themselves not only for dealing with the situation which will arise in relation to the redemption of the Dublin Corporation Stock on the 1st January but also for any such other transaction in the future if they are required.  I think it is a good thing to extend, as we propose to do in this Bill, the type of advance which can be made out of the Local Loans Fund.  Our powers are curtailed in that regard so much that we could not advance out of the Local Loans Fund a sum which would enable the Dublin Corporation, in addition to any other sums it might itself raise otherwise, to redeem the stock which they have given notice to redeem on the 1st January.  The delay <Col N="1310" /> in the flotation by the Dublin Corporation of their new loan was due to existing circumstances but even though exactly similar circumstances might not arise in future, other circumstances might arise in which a local authority, proposing to reedem an existing loan, might think it well to postpone the flotation of a long-term issue until more favourable circumstances arose.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that the burden of interest on the ratepayers of Dublin and of this State is very considerable. If the ratepayers of Dublin City, or of any other county or city which might be affected by this Bill, want our help to enable them to raise loans at a reasonable rate of interest, in relation to the conditions that prevail at the time, the Minister for Finance should be in a position to help them.  Although the immediate reason for introducing this Bill at this time is the situation relating to the redemption of the 5 per cent. interest stock by the Dublin Corporation on the 1st January, the Bill is a good one in itself, apart altogether from that situation.  It is like a lot of other things in life.  There are many good things that should be done but they are not brought forward until there is some pressing or immediate need for them.  That is the case in relation to these Post Office Savings Bank funds; the steps which we propose to take are altogether reasonable and very desirable not only in the interests of the ratepayers of the city but of the taxpayers of the State as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Bill will be worsened in any way by agreeing to the amendment suggested by Sir John Keane.  The case he has made is a good one.  The Bill is a timely one, but the House is not being treated fairly.  I think it is hardly fair to ask the House to pass a measure of this importance at one sitting.  The Minister has certainly <Col N="1311" /> made a very good case for the Bill, but he has not made a case which would justify asking us to rush it through at one sitting.  Nobody will deny that it is a good thing to utilise the Post Office Savings Bank funds to save the ratepayers of Dublin from the exorbitant interest they are paying on present loans.  That is a laudable thing, and would certainly get the support of this House, but again I say that it is not fair to the House to come in with a measure of this kind and ask us to pass it right away. Senator Sir John Keane suggests that the measure should operate for one year only.  The principle contained in the Bill is new; it is an experiment; at the end of a year we would all be much wiser on the subject.  The case made for rushing the Bill is based on the position of the Dublin Corporation. Well, that would be met by passing the Bill and giving it a life of one year.  After a year we would be in a much better position to judge the matter, and I certainly hope that we would get more time to consider it at the end of the year.  I think the amendment proposed by Senator Sir John Keane is a reasonable one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of facilitating the Dublin Corporation in this matter is an important one, but in my opinion it is not the all-important one.  The position of the funds of the Post Office Savings Bank has been somewhat of a burning question for many years.  Long before the Banking Commission was established many people argued that it was unreasonable that those funds should be restricted to such a limited number of openings.  During the Banking Commission's proceedings the question was fairly thrashed out, and following the issue of the commission's report very many people still raised the question as to why a wider field was not opened up for the investment of those securities. I can see quite clearly that Senator Sir John Keane, speaking for the bankers, would be somewhat uneasy.  Naturally, they do not like to see anybody entering into their field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, <Col N="1312" /> surely my amendment is confined merely to limiting this Bill to one year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree that the aim of the amendment is to restrict the Bill to one year, but I am arguing that the principle is so sound that there is no reason why it should be limited to one year.  The purpose of the Bill is to widen the field for the investment of those securities&mdash;to enable the securities of certain well secured authorities to be available for the investment of those funds.  That is a simple issue.  Whether or not people are capable of appreciating that issue within a few hours, or within the time since this Bill was introduced in the Dáil, is not the question.  As far as I am concerned, I have thought of it long enough, and I am convinced that it is quite time that this arrangement was come to.  In effect, in this country certain institutions have dominated the monetary field.  I am not saying that they have had a monopoly.  I am not attacking the banks.  Even here, I suppose nobody has been more generous in paying tribute to the work of the banks, and to the way they were conducted, but the authorities controlling those funds have had, in effect, one of their hands tied behind their backs.  I think that is unfair to the fund, and unfair to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, if the operation of this Bill &mdash;and I believe this is what is at the back of Senator Sir John Keane's mind&mdash;is likely to affect interest rates in the country, then as far as I am concerned I have no objection, because I do think that interest rates need some kind of overhauling.  If this Bill acts in such a way as to bring certain authorities to their senses, and to cause them to bring their rates to something within reason, I think that is a further very strong reason why we should accept the Bill as it stands. The issue in the amendment is whether or not the Bill is to operate for 12 months only.  The only argument which has been brought forward in favour of the amendment is that the Bill is one of short notice.  Well, I think anybody who is interested in the matter must have been following <Col N="1313" /> the proceedings in the Dáil, and that is as good a preparation for consideration of the Bill as one could get.  To that extent, it cannot be argued that the Bill is being suddenly forced upon us without reasonable notice.  I should like to say much more on this question, but I quite understand that I would be raising issues which perhaps should not be raised on the Bill.  I think I have said enough to indicate that it is unreasonable to ask the House, in view of the aim of the Bill, to restrict it to 12 months.  The principle is so sound that it ought to be accepted without question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to support the amendment, but only on the grounds that the Bill is being rushed. It would not solve the problem if we had another Bill in 12 months.  It would be necessary to bring in a permanent Bill very much earlier.  I am not altogether out of sympathy with what Senator O Buachalla has said. I certainly do not want to oppose the principle of utilising those funds for the benefit of the country.  I certainly think it would be undesirable that they should be left solely to be invested in British funds.  The only point on which I do not agree with him is that because the principle of the Bill is right it is not necessary that adequate time be given to consider it.  On the contrary, it seems to me that that is the kind of Bill on which full time should be taken.  The Senator also said that those who are interested in the Bill would have been following the proceedings in the Dáil.  As far as I am concerned, something went wrong with the postal arrangements yesterday; I did not get my copy of the Dáil Report until this morning, after I had started a series of engagements.  Consequently, I could not even look at it until lunch time, and I have not been able to follow the proceedings.  I do not think that is a sound reason why the Bill should be made a Bill for a year, but I think when the Government finds it necessary to bring in a new principle in a hurry&mdash;because this Bill was rushed in the Dáil as well as in this House&mdash;it would be a good thing to limit the operation of the Bill in order to allow for adequate discussion. <Col N="1314" /> To my mind, that is the whole case for the amendment.</P>

      <P>Personally, I know very little about this business, but I really think there is nothing unreasonable in the amendment proposed by Senator Sir John Keane.  If the acceptance of that amendment would in any way tie the hands of the Government, as Senator O Buachalla suggested, I should like to know in what way.  I think, to use Senator Foran's argument, that after a year we will all know more about this matter. I do not think the acceptance of the amendment would in any way impair the efficacy of the Bill or interfere with the purpose for which it has been drafted and introduced.  Personally, until I hear a stronger argument than that advanced by Senator O Buachalla, I would support the amendment.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been under discussion for a considerable time in the other House, and no reasonable argument has been put up here as to why the Bill should not be passed.  The only argument that was put up here to-day was that it should not be rushed through.  If there is anything wrong with the Bill, then we should not pass it at all, but if there is nothing wrong with it, the question of rushing it through does not hold water.  The suggestion made by somebody was that it should be held over for another year, and the proposal in the amendment is that the Act shall <Col N="1315" /> continue in force for another 12 months and shall then expire, but I do not think it is fair to the Minister to ask him to do so, if there is nothing wrong with the Bill.</P>

I do not think that the Senator means that, but that is what is implied by what he has just said.</P>

      <P>Senator O Buachalla, Senator Quirke, and Senator Douglas agree with the principle of the Bill, and so do I&mdash;I do not know about Senator Sir John Keane&mdash;but it is not true to say that the Bill has been under discussion for a very considerable time, because it has not.  It was discussed at great length in the Dáil on Second Reading.  The Minister then asked to be given the further stages, but did not get them because it was suggested by a member of the Front Opposition Benches that they might want to put down amendments, and therefore he wanted the later stages to be postponed.  The Minister, to give him his due, agreed to that procedure, but the result was that it was not until yesterday that I could get a copy of the debates.  As Senator Douglas has pointed out, something went wrong in the post, and the report of the Second Stage only reached me last night.  As a matter of fact, whatever may be thought of it, I read some of it in bed last night; but it seems to me that we should be given more opportunity to discuss it.  There was a very wide range of discussion in the other House, whereas, so far as we are concerned, we only get the Bill to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, because of the nature of the Bill and the anxiety of everybody here, irrespective of Party, to facilitate the Minister to get the Bill through before the 1st January, we are anxious to pass it.  We do not want to hold it up and I, personally, would <Col N="1316" /> have voted for the Committee Stage to be taken to-day in order to facilitate the Minister.  The only thing that we do think necessary is that the principle involved, as well as other things that may be involved, should come up for discussion here, and the only method by which we can do that is, unfortunately, by restricting the operation of this measure to one year.  I do not know of any other method by which we could do so.  If I knew of any other method, I should be glad to avail of it, and it is only for that reason that we advocate the acceptance of this amendment.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the Bill was brought in in the Dáil on the 5th December and discussed there for two days on Second Reading, and that the remaining stages were taken a week later, and now it is brought in here and we are asked to pass it, practically without discussion.  Now, since 1922 I have been in the habit of seeing Ministers of various Parties bringing in Bills, to this House or the other House, and invariably the Bill is always an urgent Bill.  I do not want to be offensive, but it would seem that Ministers, irrespective of Parties, always happen to bring in Bills which, somehow or other, for excellent reasons, they must have to-day. Apparently, the moment you become a Minister you have this marvellous case: that here is a Bill, that it is a good Bill, and that you must have it to-day.  All that is suggested here is that the matter must be discussed again before the expiration of 12 months.  I do not think that what the Minister suggests would happen: that the Bill would not be passed in 12 months' time.  I think that it would certainly be passed, but one would be given an opportunity of discussing its implications, and I think it would be a good thing if this House could be afforded the opportunity of discussing the Bill with the same width and scope as was afforded in the Dáil.  I am not anxious to have it held for 12 months, but with all the considerations involved I do not see any other way of doing it, nor do I see, except for whatever extra printing might be involved, that there would be any <Col N="1317" /> particular difficulty in doing so.  I admit that this amendment is not a very satisfactory one but, in all the circumstances, it would help us to do our job.  I should like to conclude, Sir, as I began, by saying that it would be a very bad thing for this House and the Legislature of this country if we were to accept the suggestion of Senator Quirke that when a Bill is brought in here, after it has been discussed at some length in the other House, we should pass it without discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say, Sir, that I do not want this Bill until the 1st January? I tried to suggest to the Dáil that we should be given all stages of the Bill earlier in order that the Seanad should have a better opportunity of discussing it, but some members of the Dáil asked that the Committee Stage should be postponed for a week in order that they might have an opportunity of putting in amendments, and I could not see how I could ask the Dáil to deny themselves the right of having it postponed for a week.  That is the reason for the delay in bringing it in here.  As far as I am concerned, if the Seanad wants me to consider or discuss the Committee Stage later on, I would be quite happy to come along and discuss it, but I understand that the Dáil is adjourning to-day, and that means that if we pass any amendments here to-day, I do not know where we would be in the matter. As members of the Seanad know, if amendments to the Bill are passed in this House, I shall have to go back to the Dáil and ask them to consider these amendments.  I should like to examine carefully the question, and see whether or not this would continue or affect legal investments that are made in the coming year.  I am not a lawyer, but my recollection is that in Bills of a temporary nature sections are often included which provide that whatever is done will continue afterwards. I do not know whether Senator Sir John Keane's amendment fulfils that or not.  I am not sure.</P>

If, after such study, it occurs to them that this Bill requires amendment, why could not such amendment be sought for by means of a motion tabled here and discussed?  In that way, these people would achieve what they want to achieve, instead of by now inserting this amendment limiting the operation of the Bill to 12 months.</P>

      <P>There is one reason why I should like to see this Bill limited to a period of 12 months.  It might be possible, as a result of the experience of 12 months' operation of the Bill, to enlarge and widen the scope of this matter of interest on loans for public bodies throughout the country.  I have in mind the funds of certain Irish trade unions.  They are restricted in the field of investments, and from the experience of the working of this Bill over 12 months, it might be found that an opportunity would be afforded of availing of the provisions of the Bill to increase the field or scope for their investments.  As Senators know, certain Irish trade unions are very restricted and very limited, in the words of the Minister, in this matter of investment, and are inclined to look outside the country for fields of investment.  When I say &ldquo;inclined&rdquo; I do not mean that they do so as a rule, but they may still be forced to look for investments outside instead of putting their money into investments here that they would like to put them into.  That is one reason why I think that we ought to give this Bill an opportunity of operating for one year. Other causes for extending the operations of the Bill might then be found.  I am aware that one union gave the use of £50,000 to the Government during the emergency free of interest.  I think that spirit is there of investing funds at home so long as the object is for the common good of the country.  That is the motive that inspires me to object to the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the reason why Senator Sir John Keane requires 12 months to consider the implications of this Bill, but I say that it is most unsatisfactory and wrongful to introduce temporary legislation giving authority for the investing of public moneys.  Section 2 of the Bill empowers the Post Office Savings Bank to invest money in any one or more of the stocks to which the section applies. The section says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;State moneys may be invested in any one or more of the stocks.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It may well be held that the words &ldquo;may be invested&rdquo; would mean &ldquo;may continue to be invested&rdquo;, so that at the end of 12 months, if another Act should not be passed, these investments would no longer be authorised by law.  Accordingly, I think whatever Bill should be passed should be of a permanent nature.  I do not know of any Act of a temporary nature which has been passed, authorising the investment of moneys in trustee securities.  Furthermore I think a temporary measure giving authority to invest funds would only produce insecurity and anxiety in the minds of local authorities, which might be called upon to repay these moneys to the Post Office at the end of 12 months.  I may be wrong in all that, but the fundamental principle is, that legislation giving authority to invest funds in certain securities should not be of a temporary character.  For these reasons, I oppose the amendment. It may be possible by some amendment to secure that the redemption of Dublin Corporation stock could be effected in other ways.  If Section 2 were deleted, and if Section 3 were allowed to remain, the redemption of Dublin Corporation stock could be effected by this measure.  The Minister mentioned another difficulty, that the Dáil intends to rise to-day, and if so it leaves this Bill on our hands, as it left several Bills last July.  For that reason it might be difficult to amend the Bill if it is required on January 1st.  On the question of passing temporary legislation on financial matters, I think it is improper and for all these reasons I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan said everything that I intended to say on this measure.  I believe the position would be very insecure and that local authorities would hesitate before taking a loan under a Bill passed for 12 months.  People invest money in the Post Office and there is a contract between them and the Government. There is a change and the change continues only for 12 months.  What is to happen at the end of that period? Senator Sir John Keane says that another Bill could be brought in.  That is so, but what guarantee have local authorities which are borrowing that the other Bill will be passed into law? Is the Senator entitled to assume that a new Bill will be passed making the law valid and continuing the loan for 35 years or whatever period is fixed? It would be most unsatisfactory to have that position.  If legal advisers of local authorities had any doubts, they would advise local authorities not to go to the expense of taking a loan from these funds.  It would be dangerous.  With regard to what Senator Foran said, I think it is a Trustee Act we would have to pass to provide for loans.</P>

I have no views as to whether the amendment should be passed or not.  I want to get rid of the air of unreality which crept into the discussion until it was brought down to earth by Senator Hayes.

It is, undoubtedly, true that if something has been done and completed under an Act which has been repealed, then that act is good and valid, but if there is continuous operation under an Act and the Act is repealed, then that continuous operation comes to a sudden end.  In this case, the authority to invest money in the stocks mentioned in Section 2 comes to an end.  Therefore, the investment is no longer authorised in law.  The authority to continue the investment will come to an end automatically in 12 months.  By limiting the operation of the Act to 12 months, you merely give authority to invest and continue the investment for 12 months.</P>

I should like to know what rate of interest it is proposed to charge, because that appears to me to be very relevant to the entire Bill. The reason I want to know that is because I think that the present Local Loans charge of 4¼ per cent. is much too high.  If local authorities are to expand their activities in respect of housing and other matters, that rate must come down.  If the Minister will give us an assurance that the rate will come down from the Local Loans figure, I shall support the Bill.  I want to know, in the next place why, if this is the very good principle which he says it is, it was only discovered by him and the Government on the 5th December, 1945, that it was a good principle.</P>

The impression which will be left upon them will, obviously, be that the House is very doubtful about the Bill and is only prepared to give it a trial for a year.  In that event, a great sense of insecurity will develop.  No public authority would be advised by a sensible lawyer&mdash;Senator O'Dea has practical experience in this connection&mdash;to invest their funds on the strength of an Act which will have only one year of certain life.  We do not know what will happen after that year. It would be very regrettable if this amendment were to pass.

We all agree that one of the most pressing social civils with which we have to contend is the shortage of houses and the appalling slum conditions which obtain.  One of the arguments used by the Minister in furtherance of the Bill was that, provided he gets facilities from the Legislature, as from the 1st January money will be made available to Dublin Corporation at a lower rate of interest than that which they are paying.</P>

The Minister has said&mdash;and I am impressed by his statement&mdash;that we would have had this Bill earlier if he could have had his way.  As a practical business man, I join with Senator Kingsmill Moore&mdash;this is the first time I have found myself in agreement with him&mdash;in his plea that we come down from the clouds and deal with the realities.  What are the realities of the case, as put before the House to-day? On the one hand, the Minister wants to be given power to do something within a certain time, his time being limited.

      <P>No.  I am not a lawyer, but I know that, when a permanent Act is being repealed, care is always taken to insert a provision that nothing done under the Act would be capable of being called in question from the legal point of view after the repeal.  In the case of a temporary Act such as is contemplated by this amendment, unless you inserted a clause declaring investment in long-term loans permissible, I should have doubt about the advisability of engaging in that form of investment.  Apart from the question of law, the Minister for Finance is trustee for deposits placed in the Post Office Savings Bank. The depositors make their deposits under certain conditions and we publish a list of the investments in which the funds of the bank have been placed.  I have been described as &ldquo;Sir John Keane's slave&rdquo; but if I were to accept this amendment I should be known as his &ldquo;ticket-of-leave&rdquo; man, because I might be called back at any time.

      <P>After the passing of this Act there shall be submitted to the Oireachtas each year formal accounts of the Post Office Savings Bank, including a balance sheet, made up as at the previous 31st December, and duly audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
      <P>I hope the House will realise that I am under a very considerable handicap as regards these amendments.  I trust that I shall not be held blameworthy for the amateurish character of the amendments but that the Minister will bear the blame.  It reflects great discredit on the Legislature when we get this rushed legislation.  I learned only this morning that we were to take all stages of this Bill to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not profess to be competent to draft an amendment of a character which will stand legal scrutiny.  In ordinary deliberate legislation we have <Col N="1325" /> a Committee Stage where the principle of amendments is discussed, and where, if the House and the Minister favour the legislation, it is referred to the Parliamentary draftsman.  In due course legal amendments are brought forward, and ultimately embodied in the legislation.  That is why I consider the whole thing most unsatisfactory, and I hope the Minister realises it is most unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Here I have an amendment which I am prepared to justify up to the hilt. The principle in it is recommended by the Banking Commission.  The Banking Commission examined the whole principle of these Savings Bank deposits, and it recommended that there should be a proper profit and loss account embodying the income and capital of these deposits.  The Minister will tell you that the securities held against these deposits are set out. That is something, but I submit it is totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>Look at it this way.  There is an obligation to pay 2½ per cent. on post office deposits.  What assurances have we now, especially with falling rates of interest, that these deposits are earning 2½ per cent?  Interest rates are falling every day.  Money is getting cheaper and cheaper.  It is more than conceivable that we may drift into a position where these deposits fail to earn 2½ per cent., and where the State will be called upon to subsidise the Savings Bank deposits.  Has not Parliament a right to know, and has not Parliament a right to demand that the Savings Bank rate of interest should then be reduced?  As it is now, we do not know that, and, therefore, we should have a proper balance sheet and profit and loss account.  That is the object of this amendment.</P>
    <P>I admit that it may not be a fully legal amendment.  If it is not, I think the Minister ought to take it away this afternoon, and refer it to the Parliamentary draftsman, and bring it back in a form which satisfies the draftsman. Then let it be put into this Act. It was partly because I had that in view that I wanted this matter held up for another year.  I submit we should not calmly acquiesce in a position where we may be unconsciously <Col N="1326" /> subsidising out of revenue 2½ per cent. interest on post office deposits where they are not earning that amount on the investment of the deposits.  Therefore, I move this amendment.  I have the recommendation of the Banking Commission, and in all conscience it is common sense and financial prudence.</P>

      <P>At the moment, the Comptroller and Auditor-General examines the accounts of the Post Office, and if Senator Sir John Keane would look at the Appropriation Accounts he will find some reference to them.  He will find for the year 1943-44 that the Comptroller and Auditor-General had a paragraph in his report stating that he had the accounts of the Post Office Savings Bank for the previous year submitted to a test examination, with satisfactory results.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, the Post Office Savings Bank does something which the ordinary commercial banks do not do.  That is, they publish a list of their investments and anybody who is interested in it can get that publication of the exact investments and the exact amount which is being invested from the Post Office Savings Bank Fund.  That is available to the ordinary person for two pennies at the Stationery Office, and is circulated free to members of the Oireachtas in the Library.  I do not think there is any necessity for this amendment.  I had not time to go back to examine the arguments put forward by the Banking Commission, in the old days, in the far away days, before the recent war, but I certainly think there is no necessity for it at this moment.</P>

I was almost surprised that Senator Quirke did not say at once that this is such a good principle that we can pass it without further examination. He suggested that about the Bill, but evidently, he did not apply it to the balance sheet.  The plain truth of the matter is, as was hinted by Senator Ryan, this is a Bill we are presented with&mdash;take it or leave it, and if we are not prepared to pass it, defeat it.  That is the old practice again, the practice which got our backs up when it was used in the past.  We are not willing to try a 12 months' experiment.  I would take complete exception to the veiled suggestion of Senator Summerfield that a balance sheet presented by the Auditor-General could easily mislead.</P>

      <P>I thought he was speaking to the amendment which asked for the presentation of a balance sheet audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  He may not have meant it, but he seemed to think that a balance sheet might be a misleading one.  My opinion is that it would be a healthy thing if more of our Government accounts were made up in the form of balance sheets.  Whether it <Col N="1328" /> would be in the form of a trade union balance sheet or a business man's balance sheet, it would be a good thing for democracy generally to be able to see whether there was a profit or a loss.</P>
      <P>That is done to a certain extent in the Post Office&mdash;having been chairman of a Postal Commission I know it&mdash;but it does not give any figure showing that the Post Office as a business concern has made a profit or not.  I am in favour of a balance sheet in all matters which involve trading.  That applies to a certain extent to the Post Office Savings Bank.  As I say, I am glad that Senator Sir John Keane has raised this question of publishing a balance sheet.  I think the principle is a good one but our hands are really tied and there is no use in going further at the present stage.</P>

      <P>One of the difficulties arising in connection with the amendment would be whether the Post Office organisation could really be regarded as a trading organisation or not in the sense that the banks are trading organisations.  Incidentally, I may remark that if an organisation like the Post Office Savings Bank or the trustee savings banks were to be compelled to publish detailed reports of their investments, one might equally argue with greater energy that the ordinary banks should be made to publish similar things.  In this case it seems to me that a balance sheet can not be published&mdash;at least a balance sheet in the strict sense of the word.  It would be something akin to those sinking funds or pension funds in relation to which the most one can expect is that every year or five years one would get a valuation and leave it at that.  I do not think there is any point whatever in the amendment so far as this particular organisation is concerned.</P>

      <P>We are all, of course, entitled to our opinions, but if ever there was a case where a proper <i>bona fide</i> balance sheet could be prepared this is one.  Agreed that in cases of certain Government activities it may not be done but here we have a perfectly straightforward case.  We have the accrued liabilities, and the depositors; we have the capital, we have the known investments and their valuation, so that a commercial balance sheet on all fours with the balance sheet one might get in any commercial undertaking or bank could be prepared.  I put my opinion on that to any commercial auditor as against that of Senator O Buachalla, although I believe he is a professor of economics.  I say that we as guardians of public money ought to ensure that we are not drifting into a position where we are allowing the State to subsidise Post Office depositors.  That is what they are going to do unless we insist on proper commercial accounting and a balance sheet.  This document costing two-pence&mdash;I do not know why the Minister stresses the twopence so much&mdash; is valueless for that purpose.  The Banking Commission, who after all were experts, went into this matter and recommended commercial accounting. They also recommended&mdash;and the Minister might direct his attention to this matter&mdash;that the bank should be put into a statutory position and should get a recognised status.  Perhaps now that the Minister is extending the activities of the bank, he might address himself to this question and give this bank something more than the name of a bank&mdash;give it a statutory position. Perhaps the Minister might also tell us is there any limit on the amount of the assets of a more or less fixed character that he proposes to invest in the funds of these local authorities.  I take it that he is going to retain a fairly high percentage of liquidity in the funds of the Post Office Savings Bank.  I think it is deplorable that the House does not realise the importance of having businesslike accounts where businesslike accounts are feasible and where they are recommended by experts who went into this whole question.</P>

I only say that people have, in relation to these funds, information which they could not get in relation to commercial banks.  If we are going to go into that whole question I think we should not confine ourselves to the Post Office Savings Bank but that we should go into the whole matter of how far there should be publication of investments of one kind or another.  The Post Office Savings Bank was set up under statute.  It is an old statute of 1863 or thereabouts but it is still continuing and the bank has a legal status. It publishes a statement of its receipts and liabilities which is duly examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is also certified by the Accounting Officer of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the Department of Finance comes into it too, because it is signed by the Secretary of the Department of Finance.  In addition the accounts are subject to examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

      <P>I move to delete the section.  My approach to this amendment is of a different character. I move the amendment, if I may say so, more in sorrow than in anger.  Since the State was formed, this is the first occasion, so far as my experience goes &mdash;and it is a pretty long one&mdash;in which the Government has deliberately invaded without any previous consultation, the accepted and legitimate province of the joint stock banks. Hitherto, this matter of short-term finance has always been recognised as the legitimate function of the commercial banks.  I do not say that it should always be so accepted.  If it could be proved that the banks have not been co-operative, if the banks have not recognised their responsibilities, if the banks, after due approach, have failed to appreciate their responsibilities, then other parties should perhaps do the work that the banks have hitherto done.  But in this case there is no question of that kind.  If we look back over the history of this State, it will be seen that there have been two deliberate and expert inquiries into the banking system.  The banks have come through those inquiries with high commendation.  I may be said to speak with bias, but I think any fair-minded man is bound to say that the banking system has served the State well.  It is not in accordance with the traditional practice of our rulers that the first the banks should know of this invasion of the functions they have always hitherto enjoyed is the introduction of a measure of this kind.  If the banks were to be treated according to traditional practice, they should have been told that the Government were not satisfied with the way they had behaved.  This savours far more of the methods we have been seeing for years <Col N="1332" /> past in other countries&mdash;totalitarian countries.  As I said, I moved this amendment more in sorrow than in anger.  It does not make for true co-operation between all sections of the State that a measure of this kind should be suddenly introduced without notice.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any reason for me to elaborate.  I have said all there is to be said.  I feel that the banks have always done their work, and done it well, and that they are prepared to do it again and to do it as well as they did it in the past.  The Minister made certain references, veiled references, and I am afraid I cannot follow him there.  I know, of course, a good deal more than he referred to.  I am not in a position to state all I do know, and I do not think he would expect me to state all I do know.  I think what I have said is a fact, that there was no previous consultation either with the banks or&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong &mdash;with the monetary authority before such a drastic departure from tradition was made in this matter.  I do not think I can usefully say any more at the present time.</P>

I do not know whether or not I am entirely misreading the section, but it appears to me that this section is to give the Minister power to make not short-term loans but long-term loans out of the Local Loans Fund.  I think there might have been perhaps more justification for saying that the second section was more a transitory section, dealing with short-term investments.  I should like the Minister to make clear beyond yea or nay what the section exactly means, because as I read it first&mdash;perhaps I am entirely wrong&mdash;I thought it referred to long-term loans from which the banks were not exactly prohibited but against which they were very strongly advised by the Banking Commission.</P>

If you are going to lend money to a local authority for a long time, out of the Local Loans Fund, it would be by way of long-term local loan.  This will enable us to make short-term advances.  We have the power at the moment to make long-term advances, but not for the redemption of stock.  Under Section 2, it is proposed that if we want to invest moneys directly in the trustee stocks of local authorities it would be done in stocks which were issued publicly by the local authority.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to make advances for the repayment of stock after the first repayment date, after they have given notice, in such a case as the 5 per cent. loan of the Dublin Corporation. In regard to Senator Sir John Keane, I do not want to follow him into this whole question.  I am quite prepared to co-operate with anyone in the country, no matter who it is, so long as he will co-operate with me for the general interest, and I am hoping that we will be able to get co-operation between Senator Sir John Keane and myself for the general good of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My general attitude in regard to the interest rates, as the Senator has raised the matter, is that our people are entitled to get money on no worse terms than neighbouring countries which are not in as sound a situation. We have here a country which, under the grace of God and the good sense of our own people, kept out of the disaster which has occurred.  We have a very small dead-weight debt in comparison to our national income. It is only a fraction of it.  In other <Col N="1334" /> countries not so far away their dead-weight debt is many times their national income, and my belief is that we should be able, for the purposes of building up this country, to get money at the same rates as neighbouring countries are getting it.  I believe that the Dublin Corporation, for the purpose of building the houses which are so very badly required, should get money at reasonable rates of interest. I hope I get the co-operation of all concerned in achieving those things.  I am too old to go looking for rows, but the long-term interests of this country depend upon our building it up quickly and building it up on a satisfactory basis.  If we were to build it up, or to attempt to build it up, on an interest structure or interest rates that are very unfavourable as compared with those of neighbouring countries, the net result would be that our people would be attracted to help in the building up of other countries instead of this country.  We want to provide opportunities for our people to use their energies to build up this country, and I hope that we shall have the co-operation of all concerned in seeing that the local authorities will be facilitated in offering remunerative employment to our people so that they may stay at home.  That depends in some measure on the interest rates involved.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, other factors that we must not overlook.  There is also the factor of what the employers and the workers are prepared to do. There is no use in getting very cheap money for houses if either the master builders or the employees decide that they are going to take a very much bigger slice of the cake than they have been contented with heretofore.  I hope to get the co-operation, not only of people with money, the commercial banks and others, in getting money at the right rate, but also the co-operation of the trade unions and the master builders, with a view to providing houses and seeing that everybody will chip in and do his share of the work to provide our people with houses at a reasonable cost.  If we do not provide houses at a reasonable cost, somebody has to bear the burden.  We may, by <Col N="1335" /> means of subsidy, take the burden off the actual incoming tenant, but by doing so we distribute it over the rest of the community.  We must face that, and if we want the community, as a whole, to prosper, the less of such burdens we put on their backs, the better.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has many demands for the development of social services, but the fundamental and true basis on which the country can distribute more in the line of social services is by getting more produced.  You cannot distribute things that are not there, and all our energies should be devoted to seeing that everything that the nation requires for a higher standard of life is produced at the cheapest possible rate.  Again, I want to say on that, that it depends on three things: that there are at least three factors in it, one of which is the rate at which capital is forthcoming, and, equally important, the rate at which people employed upon this matter are prepared to work, both the master and the employee, and I hope that, as materials become available, they will all cooperate to build up our country and give the people of our country public health facilities, and produce more from their factories and from their farms so that, as time goes on, we can raise the general standard of life of our people as a whole, and, if it is necessary, guarantee a higher standard of life for everybody.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to embark upon a very wide discussion on this question of rates of interest, but I feel that I must say something in reply to the Minister.  It seems to me that the Minister rather suggested that the banks should be the source of credit, but I think that if he goes to any accepted authority he will be told that that is wrong and unsound finance.  Borrowing from the banks is the most dangerous and the readiest source of inflation.  The sound method of borrowing is borrowing from the savings of the people, and at what rate does the Minister think he can borrow from the people?  That, I think, <Col N="1336" /> is a fairly good test, and it is afforded by the price of existing securities. Whether that price is good or not is a matter of opinion; but it is doubtful if the Minister could make a long-term issue at less than 3 per cent., and that is about the same rate as prevails across the water.  I think that the long-term rates are pretty much the same in the two countries, but when you come to short-term rates, it is a very different matter, and that is where the banks come in.  Now, let me develop that.  I think that the Minister saw the other day where certain short-term borrowings were effected across the water at a very big reduction.  I think I am correct in saying that the Chancellor of the Exchequer made certain short-term borrowings at five-eights per cent., but mark what happened; the deposit rates in the bank dropped immediately by ½ per cent., and all deposits in current accounts stopped straightway. Now, there are certain difficulties in applying a remedy here that would apply across the water. After all, the banks must be allowed to manage their own business.  If it were suggested that such a rate as applied in England should be applied here, I feel, speaking as an individual, that the banks here would not be able to apply the same remedies as were applied on the other side.  There are certain difficulties in reducing the deposit rates in this country, and the banks must be left free to deal with them.  I shall not go further into that matter, but I say that that is why the banks here should not be held to the same short-term rates as apply across the water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into this matter again at any length, but the people in this country will certainly want to know why they cannot get short-term loans at the same rates as they can be got in England.  I could not explain that, if I were asked, and there would be no excuse for it. Financially, our resources are as sound as those of the British State or any other State, and we are entitled to get as good a service from our bankers as the British people got from theirs.  We <Col N="1337" /> are entitled to get short-term rates, if we want them, at the same terms as they can get them.  There are very many more expedients, if we want to go into them, that the banks could adopt here for cutting down expenses rather than the deposit rate.  It is true to say that in relation to the amount of their deposits, the majority of the banks operating here make twice as much per £100 of their deposits as their confreres in England do.  That being the case, and looking at it from that point of view, this community, if it wants short-term accommodation, is entitled to get it at no worse terms than the British Government get it, and I do not believe that our people would stand for one minute for any higher rate.  I would not ask them to do so.</P>

      <P>I had the whole point inquired into the Attorney-General's office.  The Parliamentary draftsman is quite satisfied that Section 15, as it stands, brings prohibition Orders made under the Act of 1929 within the scope of Section 8.  He considers that Section 15 is apt and unambiguous and that there is no reason for changing it.  Section 15 (1) (ii) is most explicit in its terms.  Every provision, other than Section 13, relating to Orders made under Section 7 is to apply equally to Orders under the 1929 Act. Section 8 is such a provision.  Therefore, it applies to Orders under the 1929 Act.  Incidentally, amendment No. 8, which the Seanad have accepted on Report, is not intelligible on any other reading.  No new prohibition Order would be made until after the Act came into operation.  Consequently that amendment applies to books prohibited before this Bill takes effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this question as to the right to appeal to the new appeal board, constituted under this Act, against an Order which had been already made under Section 6 of the Act of 1929.  In the course of my speech on amendment No. 9, which Senator Magennis moved, I merely expressed that opinion in a passing way, because I submitted that Senator Magennis's amendment was unnecessary, as the words &ldquo;prohibition Order&rdquo; in the Bill, as defined by Section 1, meant an Order under Section 7 or Section 9 of the Bill.  I stated, as far as I could see, that that was the only right of appeal given by <Col N="1339" /> the Bill.  I was reminded that Section 15 of the Bill gave the right of appeal to the new appeal board against an Order already made under Section 6 of the Act of 1929.  I stated that I had not fully considered it, but that I thought it did not.  I am still of opinion that it is by no means clear from the Bill we have in front of us that a right of appeal to the new appeal board against an Order already made under Section 6 of the Act of 1929 is given by this Bill.  It has been laid down in several cases, and is well established in law, that there is no right of appeal from any tribunal unless that right of appeal is given expressly by Statute.  A right of appeal cannot be given by implication.  It has been submitted here that a right of appeal against an Order made under Section 6 of the Act of 1929 is given by Section 15.  It is not so expressly stated in the section, and if not, it could only be given by implication.  I submit that that is not sufficient.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Section 15 of this Bill states</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the provisions of this Act, other than Section 13, shall apply in respect of the Order as if it were an Order under Section 7 of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of excluding Section 13 of the Act in respect of an Order made under Section 6 of the Act of 1929 is that, even assuming that a right of appeal to the appeal board exists, a revocation of that Order cannot be made effective, because the revocation of such an Order cannot be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> under Section 13 because Section 13 does not apply, and no order made by the appeal board revoking a prohibition Order can have effect except so published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, and takes effect only from the day it is published.  Therefore, I merely expressed the opinion that there is a doubt that a right of appeal is being given by this Bill.  Personally, I am in no way concerned whether a right of appeal lies or not. I am merely expressing my opinion for what it is worth.  The Minister has been advised by his advisers.  I am <Col N="1340" /> giving my opinion, free, gratis and for nothing and it may be worth only what I shall get for it.  Mr. Justice Cardozo, an eminent member of the Supreme Court of the United States, formerly a chief justice of the Courts of Appeal of New York State, in a book written by him, reproducing a series of lectures, entitled &ldquo;The Nature of the Judicial Decision&rdquo;, says that &ldquo;Law never is but always will be&rdquo;.  In this case it will be impossible to say what the law is until the law will have been decided by a court.  Until a court gives a decision the whole question is merely a matter of opinion.  Therefore, the question is: Whose opinion is correct? In order that the matter should be placed beyond doubt, the Legislature has full power to insert in the Bill express words.  While having no feelings as to whether a right of appeal should be given or not, I express my opinion for the assistance of members of the House, so that those members who desire an appeal should make that desire bear fruit by having express provisions inserted giving such a right of appeal.</P>

      <P>When I first read this Bill, my opinion was clearly in consonance with the opinion of the Attorney-General.  I was considerably affected by the arguments of Senator Ryan yesterday and I took the opportunity to-day, with the aid of Senator Ryan, to go into certain decided and reported cases which have some bearing on the subject.  It is beyond doubt, in the case of an appeal from one court to another, and I suggest, by analogy, in the case of an appeal from one Censorship Board to another, that a right of appeal must be given expressly and clearly.  I am still of opinion that it is probable that a court would so construe this Bill as to say that there was an appeal to the appeal board, but I am equally clearly of opinion that no person could lay down for certain that a court would do so. It is not, I submit, a question as to whether the Parliamentary draftsman or the Attorney-General is of opinion that a court would do so.  It is not even a question as to whether the Parliamentary draftsman or the <Col N="1341" /> Attorney-General is sure that a court would do so.  If two lawyers in this House are of opinion that there may be some doubt about it, I imagine that the Attorney-General would be the first person to say: &ldquo;Although I hold by my opinion, yet if two lawyers, accustomed to practising and having had a certain amount of experience, are of the opposite point of view, I may be wrong and they may be right.&rdquo; If that is the position, surely it is the business of this House so to clarify the Bill that there will be no doubt.</P>
      <P>The doubt arises in this manner.  The Bill is not consistent with itself in drafting.  Section 7 does not, in the body of the text, use the term &ldquo;prohibition Order&rdquo;.  It states that if the Censorship Board, having duly examined a book, are of opinion that it comes within (a) or (b) and that &ldquo;its sale and distribution should be prohibited, they shall by order prohibit such sale and distribution&rdquo;.  These are ordinary words to which no particular signification is attached by any definition contained in the Act.  When you go to Section 8, you find that the wording has been changed and that there is a provision that the author or the publisher may appeal from a &ldquo;prohibition Order&rdquo;&mdash;not from an Order prohibiting the sale and distribution. When you find the phrase &ldquo;prohibition Order&rdquo; used there, you have at once passed from ordinary English words to words which have been given an artificial meaning by the definition section and which cannot mean anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition section&mdash;Section 1&mdash; states that &ldquo;prohibition Order&rdquo; means not an Order prohibiting a book but an Order under Section 7 or Section 9.  With that in mind, if you get to Section 15, you will find in regard to books which are now ornamenting our index, (i) &ldquo;The Order shall continue in force&rdquo;; (ii) &ldquo;the provisions of this Act other than Section 13&rdquo;&mdash;about which I shall have a word to say in a minute&mdash;&ldquo;shall apply in respect of the Order as if it were an Order under Section 7&rdquo;&mdash;as if it were an Order prohibiting sale and distribution and not as if it were a prohibition Order.  Section 8 gives <Col N="1342" /> only a right of appeal from a prohibition Order, which is defined as an Order under Section 7 but not an Order which is deemed to be under Section 7.  Therefore, I think the most charitable interpretation one can put on this matter is that it is a bit of loose drafting.  It can, I think, be put right very simply by deeming an Order which is in existence at present to be a &ldquo;prohibition Order&rdquo;.  Then, everything will naturally flow.  The difficulties to which Senator Ryan and I have called attention are reinforced when you consider that, from the operation of Section 15, the provisions of Section 13 are excluded.</P>
    <P>The exclusion of Section 13 means that an Order under Section 15, when revoked, shall not be recorded in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> as revoked.  Section 13 again refers only to prohibition Orders. It is perfectly reasonable that Section 13 should be excluded from the provisions of Section 15 (1) and (2) if the existing Orders are not to be regarded as prohibition Orders, because Section 13 refers to prohibition Orders.  But it reinforces Senator Ryan's contention that you cannot regard an existing Order under Section 15 as being a prohibition Order, and, therefore, the appeal provisions of Section 8, could be held not to apply.</P>
    <P>Or, if you look at it the other way, if it is a prohibition Order, and the provisions of Section 8 apply, then Section 13, would provide for publication&mdash;the only section which provides for publication &mdash; and you would have no method inscribed by the Legislature whereby there was any obligation to let the people know whether a book had or had not ceased to be a prohibited book.</P>
    <P>Those matters do show that the drafting of this Act is inconsistent with itself, and unless the Minister was prepared to adopt the amendment which I suggested unofficially yesterday, namely, that after the words &ldquo;the Order shall continue in force&rdquo; in Section 15, and in the sub-sections (1) and (2), you should add after the words &ldquo;the Order shall continue to be in force and shall be deemed to be a prohibition Order&rdquo;, I would feel that <Col N="1343" /> if Senator Ryan would move to recommit this Bill I would certainly support him and would feel it would be necessary to do so.</P>
    <P>I do feel that this Act is not in harmony with itself and that when doubts arise&mdash;they may be small doubts &mdash;if they can be resolved, they should be resolved by this House.  It is our business so to pass legislation as to ensure as far as possible that it will not raise future questions in the courts.  The argument that the Attorney-General and the Parliamentary draftsman consider a thing to be clear and free from doubt assumes its due proportions when you remember that no Bill would pass unless the draftsman and the Attorney-General did think it was clear, and yet, over and over again, the courts have had to condemn Bills as either meaningless, or because they did not carry out what was the admitted intention.  Therefore, I remain profoundly unimpressed by the consensus of opinion.  Although they are two great persons, I am sure that they would be the first people themselves to disclaim any such absolute knowledge of law as would warrant the Minister saying that because they were in agreement with a certain view, that view must necessarily be one the courts must adopt.</P>

      <P>I think it would be rather dangerous for the ordinary Senator to disagree with the various Senators who have such a very fine legal training.  I intended only to refer to some remarks made by Senator Ryan, regarding Section 13.  He seems to feel there would be a difficulty as regards prohibition Orders made under the Act of 1929.  I suggest that that <Col N="1344" /> section might be altered to read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Censorship Board shall as soon as maybe cause to be published <i>in Iris Oifigiúil</i> every prohibition Order whether such Order is made subsequently to the passing of this Act or is made under the Act of 1929.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think these words would cause the difficulty envisaged by Senator Ryan to disappear.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment appeared on the Committee Stage and I proposed it with full cognisance of Section 15.  I consider that Section 15 in its effect&mdash;although Part II of the Principal Act is repealed in Section 23, 24 and the Schedule&mdash;enables prohibition Orders issued by the Minister in virtue of the powers given him under the Act of 1929 to be made the subject of appeal to the new appeal board.</P>
      <P>To my mind&mdash;I may be presumptuous &mdash;it is absolutely clear that is the intention of Section 15, to bring the prohibition Orders issued by the Minister under the Act of 1929, within the ambit of the appeal to the new board. Paragraph 2 of Section 15, ordains, that section shall apply in respect of appeals as if they were appeals under Section 7 of this Act.  It seems undeniable that that is so.  Section 7 is very clear.  If the Censorship Board have found against a book on one or other of the two grounds that it is a case for prohibiting sale and circulation, they shall by order prohibit such sale and circulation.  Consequently, by Section 15, the parts I have cited, the old prohibition Order becomes a new prohibition Order to all intents and purposes and my amendment has no meaning at all unless that were so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment, if Senator Ryan were right, would be superfluous as redundant, but under my interpretation of the intentions of the Bill, my amendment has some part to play for there are two types of prohibition Orders to be dealt with, the prohibition Order now to be &ldquo;deemed&rdquo; an Order under Section 7 and the prohibition Order actually issued by the new Censorship Board to be <Col N="1345" /> appointed under this Bill when it becomes an Act.  I, therefore, put in my amendment to distinguish between those two, and I try to persuade the Minister to have no appeal permitted on Orders &ldquo;deemed&rdquo; to be new, and to allow appeal in respect of prohibition Orders issued by the new board.</P>
    <P>Thus it becomes a question whether the Minister will persevere with his intention of giving the right of appeal to all, whether old or new.  My point was made in another amendment already, which I take the liberty to repeat, that in regard to prohibition Orders issued by the Minister under the Act of 1929 there had been an appeal possible to the Minister.  While a prohibition Order could not be issued by the Minister unless he had received a report from the Censorship Board of a certain character, yet the Minister could, of his own volition, revoke or vary a prohibition Order. My case was that inasmuch as there was that remedy provided in the Principal Act for all who felt aggrieved by a prohibition Order, it was not fair, when they did not use that remedy, to provide them with an opportunity to rake up old matters after the board concerned had been changed in personnel, frequently as the Minister pointed out, through death or retirement.  When I was a law student a long time ago I learned a principle of equity: <i>Vigilantibus non dormientibus lex succurrit.</i>  Equity provides a remedy for a wrong but the wronged person must be awake about his rights and not fall asleep on them. I suggest that those who did not appeal against the wickedness of the old Censorship Board when they could have appealed, and when the appeal to the Minister was provided, are the <i>dormientibus</i> and it is not our business to legislate for their relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 5, Section 8, sub-section <Col N="1346" /> (4), lines 34 and 35, to delete the words &ldquo;the joint application of any five persons (each of whom is a member of Dáil Eireann or Seanad Eireann)&rdquo; and to insert instead the words &ldquo;any of the persons set out in sub-section (5) of this section&rdquo;; and to add to the section a new sub-section (5) as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(5)  Any of the following persons may appeal to the appeal board from a prohibition Order in respect of a book&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any Archbishop or Bishop of the Holy Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church;</P>
    <P>(b)  any Archbishop or Bishop of the Church of Ireland;</P>
    <P>(c)  any person acting on the authority of the governing body of any religious denomination existing in Ireland;</P>
    <P>(d)  any person acting on the authority of any association in Ireland, which, in the opinion of the Minister, was formed for the promotion of culture or the study of literature;</P>
    <P>(e)  any person acting on the authority of a trade union.</P>
    <P>This amendment is one of some importance.  The Minister indicated very definitely that the two things with which he was most concerned were to get himself out of the position in which he was placed in having anything to do with the censoring of books in his individual or Ministerial capacity, and, secondly, with the wish to avoid any dissatisfaction that might arise.  I think he stated that yesterday.  I am presenting him with an amendment which does that for him even more completely than the Bill as it stands.  It is true that in the Bill as it stands he gets rid of it in its Ministerial capacity, but he holds on in his capacity as a member of the Oireachtas to the right to be one of the five members who can make an appeal.  It may be that that is very dear to him, but I do not think it is.  I think he is not any more enthusiastic about it than I am.</P>
    <P>On amendment No. 7, Senator Professor Magennis was good enough to <Col N="1347" /> read my remarks on the same subject during the Committee Stage.  If he had read them to-day he would save me the necessity of repeating them.  I think perhaps, as they will appear in the debates, and as I stand over everything he read, it will possibly be sufficient to say that I am still of the same opinion.  But the fundamental difference between us is that, while he was using these remarks against the proposal to have members of the Oireachtas as persons, in addition to the author, editor and publisher, who might institute an appeal, he wanted to abolish that without putting anything in its place.  I am not satisfied with abolishing it unless something is put in its place.</P>
    <P>For my part, I do not believe that the Minister will get rid of the legitimate dissatisfaction which must arise in regard to a measure of this kind&mdash; when I say legitimate dissatisfaction I do not say that it is necessarily right&mdash; if he still retains a form of words that may make the appeal virtually impossible except by an author, editor or publisher.  If there is nobody other than the editor, author or publisher&mdash; he may be in England, in America or in Timbuctoo, though I do not think there is much editing done there&mdash;I do not think that is sufficient.  There would be no one then who could express an Irish desire for an appeal. I would much prefer, though I dislike the proposal, to have five members of the Oireachtas empowered to institute an appeal.</P>
    <P>This amendment, as distinct from the amendment of Senator Magennis, is designed to remove the five members of the Oireachtas as they appeared in the Bill&mdash;I agree that if it is carried it will entail some consequential amendments which I have not provided for here for reasons which I need not go into now&mdash;and to provide a substitute. The question arose what could be a substitute.  I do not claim for one moment that my suggestion is the wisest or the best and I think it quite possible that, if the Minister were to accept this amendment, in the other House might make some <Col N="1348" /> changes.  The amendment which I put down indicates the kind of person who to my mind might be the proper person to institute an appeal and who would be definitely preferable to members of the Oireachtas.  I have put them under the headings (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e).  Those included under the headings (a), (b) and (c) are intended by the wording to be persons acting under the obvious and undoubted authority of one of the Churches existing here.  Incidentally, I heard that some members objected to my description of the Catholic Church in this amendment.  The only thing I can say in that connection is that I referred to the Constitution and used the words exactly as they are given in the Constitution.  The wording of (e) is also copied from the Constitution. As regards the wording of (c), if there is anyone offended I am responsible, but I do not think there will be.  These three headings are clear and need no explanation.</P>
    <P>The heading (d) raises a point of some difficulty.  I had in mind the Royal Irish Academy or Royal Dublin Society or bodies of that standing, if they thought fit, to have the right to institute an appeal.  I did not want to set out a list and I felt that if I were simply to say, bodies formed for the promotion of culture or the study of literature, the Minister might say that that was not sufficiently definite.  I therefore decided that the wisest course was to leave it to the Minister to decide what bodies could be so included and so prevent any abuse of that particular sub-paragraph.  Some people have been puzzled by (e), that is any person acting on the authority of a trade union.  I had two reasons for that.  One was that if by any chance there was any case in which organised labour might wish to institute an appeal&mdash;it is most unlikely to occur&mdash;I think they would be proper persons to act.  My second reason was that if the Irish authors wished to form a trade union, under the law they are quite entitled to do so.  That would not cover, of course, authors who reside outside, with whom I am not concerned, other than their own individual rights which are safeguarded <Col N="1349" /> under the Bill.  I suggest to the Minister and to the House that that would be very much preferable to the provision of five members.  I think Senator Sir John Keane likes the five members provision.  I think I heard one other member of the House say he rather liked it.  There are possibly some members, other than the Minister, in the Dáil who like it, but so far I have not met anyone else who really thinks that the provision in regard to five members of the Oireachtas is a desirable provision of itself.  Many think that it will prove embarrassing and difficult.  Some dislike it altogether. A good many, like myself, are prepared to submit to it.  I do not regard it as a privilege; I regard it as an unpleasant duty to be placed on members of the Oireachtas, and for which I do not think they are peculiarly suited.</P>

What I do want to make clear, if not to Senator O'Donovan at least to other Senators, is that this is an opportunity by which the House can decide against the five members but after providing for an alternative.  Obviously, if you do not approve of the alternative, you will not vote for the amendment.  I am not suggesting that anyone should.  On the other hand, if you want to get rid of the five members, and you see this as a suitable alternative, then the amendment should be voted for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering the merits of this amendment it is perhaps desirable to cast our minds back to what has happened in the past and what has been said in the past. We are all of us aware by this that, in regard to one set of publications which fell under the disapproval of the Censorship Board, an Archbishop considered it his duty to make a public protest.  Therefore, we may assume with a certain amount of assurance, that if power had been given to him to appeal he would have appealed.  I think we might also even take the not very rash step of assuming that a Bishop or an Archbishop of any Church is a responsible person, acting responsibly and under a sense of duty. In as far as the clerical gentlemen are concerned then, we have already had an example of the desirability if not the necessity of giving some such right of appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Passing next to the last class, the trade union, it may or may not be within the knowledge of Senators that there is a strong feeling&mdash;whether it be right or whether it be wrong I do not know, but that it exists I do know&mdash; that certain books have been banned ostensibly under the head of indecency or obscenity but actually because the doctrines put forward were considered to be so far to the left as to be subversive from a political point of view. <Col N="1351" /> I want expressly to state this, that I have no view whatever on that subject.</P>

      <P>If I am allowed to make my point the Senator will understand that I am doing no such thing.  What I am saying is this, that if such statements are made, and if they are believed, it is exceedingly important that an opportunity should be given for removing any such impression.  You will get that opportunity if you allow members of a trade union to make an appeal, if they should be under that impression.  So far from casting aspersions upon Senator Magennis or upon his colleagues, I appear here&mdash;although he is not willing to recognise it&mdash;as a person who is anxious to provide a method whereby their fair name may be rendered or may remain spotless, and whereby anybody who is under the impression that they are in any way influenced by any unworthy considerations will be able to test the matter and, by having his appeal refused, disabuse if not his own mind at least the mind of the public.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that I have heard a person suggest that a questioning of his judgment, with the result that his judgment might be upheld, or anyhow that the grounds on which it was questioned could be dispelled, was a reflection on his fair fame.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for his attendance and devotion to duty.  It seems to me, however, that that great body which is represented by the trade unions, who, after all, do represent, not only an enormous number of people, but a stratum of people, should, if they desire, be entitled to appeal against the banning of a book, because, from their particular outlook, that particular book should not be banned.  Now, that leaves only one of the classes which, as was suggested by Senator Douglas, should be considered by the House from the point of view of whether it is worthy or not of being given this privilege, and the mere wording of the sub-clause referring to the remaining class is the best answer to that.  Is there anybody in this House who will seriously contend that &ldquo;an association which in the opinion of the Minister is formed for the promotion of culture and the study of literature&rdquo; should not be allowed, if it considers that the Censorship Board has gone wrong, to promote an appeal to the appellate board?  If there is one class of persons more than another who should be capable of forming an opinion on that question, where the Act itself says that the literary value of the book is one of the matters to be taken into consideration, I, personally, am unable to think of a more suitable type of appellant.</P>
      <P>On all those grounds, then, looking at it from the point of view of the experience of the working of the Act in the past and from the viewpoint of the people who, however erroneously, or as Senator Magennis might think, from the phantasmagoria of their minds, might have a grievance, I would press for this appeal because the object is to do away with any feelings of grievance, however imaginary. If grievances, however imaginary, are felt, then let us do away with them, and let us introduce this in the interests of such people.  I also say, if this further provision is introduced, let us take out the five members of the Oireachtas who, after all, are only a substitute for the other bodies specifically mentioned by the Senator in his amendment.</P>

      <P>I think that, <Col N="1354" /> after Senator Magennis's challenge, issued quite properly, and after Senator Kingsmill Moore's obvious embarrassment on the issue of the challenge, we are all pretty well of the mind that Senator Kingsmill Moore was a complete failure in his arguing of the case for this amendment.  I think that there is not much need to waste time over it.  Yet, when we came to amendments Nos. 6 and 7, if I remember rightly, the Cathaoirleach, more than once, drew our attention to a certain relationship that existed between these amendments and amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 10.  Some of us felt that we could dispense with the idea of giving authority to the five members of the Oireachtas to lodge an appeal.  While we felt that that was a power that we did not like to take, or would rather not take, still we were influenced in favour of leaving it in the Bill for the reason that we could not get or suggest any better alternative.  I, certainly, in coming to a conclusion as to whether I should support Senator Magennis's amendment or not, fully adverted to the proposals contained in amendment No. 10. I dislike the amendment for a variety of reasons.  I do not need to go into them in detail, but the first one of them I would state simply in this way: that I think we would be wise to leave the churches out of this matter altogether.  The idea contained in paragraph (d) definitely decides me against the amendment: that is &ldquo;that any person acting on the authority of any association in Ireland, which, in the opinion of the Minister, was formed for the promotion of culture or the study of literature&rdquo;, may appeal. Exception was taken here to certain suggestions that definitions might be improved by the addition of certain words, and we opposed them because we felt that we were casting our net too widely, and that the definitions, in fact, would not be definitions by the inclusion of those words.  The same defect applies here.  What is &ldquo;an association for the promotion of culture&rdquo;, or what is &ldquo;an association for the study of literature&rdquo;?  We are asking the Minister to undertake the responsibility of deciding what societies are legitimate societies <Col N="1355" /> for the promotion of culture or the promotion of the study of literature. With regard to the last one, I cannot think of its being any thing more than a bait for certain people in this House. If they bite, well and good, but I doubt if they will, and I certainly hope &mdash;as a matter of fact, I am quite sure &mdash;that the Seanad will have no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that this is not an advisable amendment.</P>

      <P>I desire to speak against this amendment.  I objected altogether to the idea of a third factor being introduced into the censorship scheme.  It ought to be adequate for all purposes, for all the needs of the State, to have a Censorship Board and to have an appeal board, if these are properly constituted and the Minister's regulations with regard to them are, as I am sure they will be, proper likewise, and if the requisite machinery has been provided. I spoke on this yesterday on my own amendment to the effect that when the Minister had appointed five persons it was to be presumed that he had confidence in those five persons, and if there were no challenge of his selection of the personnel of the board, in this House or the other House, we might presume that the public approved of his selection, and that, consequently, it was quite a work of supererogation on the part of the Minister to provide, as he said, a safeguard against the Censorship Board. I can enter sympathetically into his position if the Minister considers that there ought to be some minimum power of Parliamentary control or Parliamentary interference in view of the fact that the direct responsibility for the issue of prohibition Orders, formerly held by the Minister, is being withdrawn. There would be a good deal to be said for his attitude in that case. I am quite willing to concede that, but I hope my friend, Senator Douglas, will forgive me if I describe it as window-dressing to put in, as one of the persons who would be allowed to lodge an appeal, &ldquo;any Archbishop or Bishop of the Holy Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church&rdquo;.  Now, I state quite frankly, and without any intention <Col N="1356" /> of being offensive to my friend, Senator Douglas, as I have said, that I regard that as being merely window-dressing. He knows perfectly well that any dignitary of our Church is not at all likely to be called upon to exercise it.  As to a person acting on the authority of a trade union, I believe the only purpose that could serve would be window-dressing, because a member of a trade union is a citizen of the State and he would be provided with books otherwise than through trade unions.  Senator Kingsmill Moore has chosen to give as justification for the trade unions a charge that I already described as a calumny.</P>
      <P>I have been for 11½ years on the Censorship Board.  That board has functioned since 1930.  There was a period during which I did not belong to it and for which I have no responsibility whatever with regard to it.  I remember that one of the members of the board, before I was a member, was the late Provost of Trinity College, Professor Thrift.  The charge made applies to Senator Fearon, who has left the board, as well as it applies to those of the surviving members.  I think if Senator Kingsmill Moore claims that he is entitled to slander the board here under his privilege as a member of this House, because he praised me, it is to assume that I am absolutely childish, and to treat a man of my years as a child is to declare me suffering from senility.  His compliment gives no licence to make the deliberate charge of having broken the law and of being dishonourable.  What is it but a charge of dishonourable conduct? I think the Senator should be asked to withdraw that charge.  I can speak of what happened over 11½ years.  No book was ever condemned as indecent or obscene while I was on the board because it spoke disrespectfully of trade unionism, or because it advocated some doctrine of which the members of the board did not approve.</P>

I am still of opinion that it is not a desirable method, whereby persons of the class referred to generally by the Minister, and which I tried to cover, should first go to five members of the Oireachtas. I think that principle is very bad.  It is a principle that has grown up, with the result that if a person wants a licence for anything he must get a T.D. or a Senator to intervene.  There is scarcely a thing in which people have not to go to a Senator or a T.D.  I am still of opinion that some such group of persons should be there, but I do not intend to press the amendment to a decision or ask it to be put.

If I had done anything else it would be highly improper, and I venture to suggest that Senator Magennis would be the first to point that out.  That being the case I think it is unworthy to suggest that something was done for window-dressing.  I believe it to be desirable that the churches should have the right to ask for an appeal.  I do not think any church would oppose that.  The request would be rarely used. I am entitled to that opinion.  If I left out any one of the churches I might be accused of window-dressing. I have made my case for this amendment. The Minister does not like it. Senator Magennis and Senator O Buachalla do not like it.  I suggest that the amendment be now put.</P>

The Minister himself offered to change the figure to seven but that was not agreed to.  I think that the question could now be discussed on this amendment.  It is similar to the amendment which was defeated on an earlier section but that did not govern this amendment.  I think that the Seanad should again consider the question of replacing the figure &ldquo;five&rdquo; by the figure &ldquo;ten&rdquo;.

      <P>In page 6, Section 11, to delete paragraph (c), lines 37 to 40, and substitute therefor the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  a prohibition Order shall not be made unless at a meeting at which a quorum is present, and the majority of those present and voting vote in favour of it.  In the event, however, of a tie, the chairman, or acting chairman, may exercise a casting vote.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (c) of Section 11, as it stood in the Bill, provides that a prohibition <Col N="1361" /> Order by the Censorship Board shall not be made unless at such meeting three members at least are in favour of making the Order, and not more than one member votes against it.  At the time I set down this amendment, the Minister had not changed the appeal board as he has since done.</P>
    <P>In the interval, I had an opportunity to study in the report of the debates of the House the reply which the Minister made on my amendment, and I was more impressed on reading it a second time than I was on hearing it in the House.  He pointed out, for example, that the procedure prescribed here in the Bill is just what we followed in the board all along: but our report had to go to the Minister, and, if the decision was arrived at in the absence of any member, that member had to be communicated with by registered post.</P>
    <P>On reconsidering this position, I arrived at this conclusion: there are to be two boards, the Censorship Board and the appeal board, made up of the same numbers, and the number of members provided as forming a quorum is the same for the appeal board and the Censorship Board, so we might proceed advantageously to have the entire regulation of both boards on the same lines.  If the Minister will look favourably on that, I will withdraw my amendment, and leave paragraph (c) as it stands in Section 11.  I submit that for the Minister's consideration. Otherwise, I would argue in favour of this amendment as regards the Censorship Board.</P>
    <P>It means briefly, that the two boards of five members have a quorum of four each.  One requires certain voting to issue a prohibition Order, and the other should require the same voting to revoke a prohibition Order.</P>

There was also the right of an absent member, in case only four were present, to be informed of the decision and he could exercise his right to express his view.  If <Col N="1363" /> he agreed with the one in the minority, a recommendation to the Minister could not be made.

When Senator Duffy makes a point about the Standing Orders, Senator Magennis makes some comparison between a bushel of wheat and the censorship&mdash;in other words, insinuates that Senator Duffy is a Labour man who is interested in bushels of wheat and not in spiritual things.  I want Senator Magennis to stop this nonsensical and pharisaical attitude of his being interested in spiritual things in which others have no interest.  We are just as interested as he is.

      <P>Yes, to this extent: the charge of introducing new amendments I want to refer to incidentally. The Minister has been good enough to put down an amendment, No. 14, and that amendment has its impact on the one which I repeated from the Committee Stage of the Bill.  In view of that, I propose to withdraw my amendment if the Minister will make this change.  I do not see that that should be the occasion of great heat. My intention was to help the simplification of the proceedings, and to get the Bill dealt with without unnecessary delay.</P>

      <P>On a point of order: there has been an interval between the Committee Stage and the Report Stage.  The Minister made his view clear upon a similar amendment, I understand, on the Committee Stage. Senator Magennis is a member of the Minister's Party, and has easy access to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am sorry if I have insulted the Senator by suggesting that he is a member of the Minister's Party, but those of us who are not members of the Minister's Party have easy access to the Minister, and therefore, a <Col N="1366" /><i>fortiori</i>, as Senator Magennis would say, Senator Magennis has access to the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is a simple one. Without being a lobbier or a haunter of corridors, it is not difficult to meet the Minister for Justice.  It is quite simple to meet the Minister for Justice and it is common form in this House and in the other House for people who are in the Minister's Party and for people who are not in the Minister's Party&mdash;whether it is this Minister or a Minister of the previous Government &mdash;to say to the Minister between the Committee Stage and the Report Stage: &ldquo;Look, we had a disagreement about this amendment; will you take this on Report Stage?&rdquo; Does not the Minister for Justice know and do not we all know that that is quite commonly done?  You can do that without being a fawning suppliant of the Minister at all.  You can do it by exercising your ordinary rights as a member of either House.  If this is a matter of importance, Senator Magennis should have approached the Minister privately instead of doing it in this particular way in the House. I submit that, after all the discussion we have had and all the liberty Senator Magennis has had, neither Senator Magennis nor indeed the Minister should be allowed at this stage to bring in any new amendments, and I think the Minister will not be sorry if you rule in that particular direction.</P>

      <P>No, Sir.  It is not withdrawn.  I still say that this amendment by the Minister was not present to my mind.  I had no knowledge whatever of it until it appeared on this paper, and its impact upon my mind was to make me see a differentiation perhaps between the two bodies which were the joint machinery for the better censorship of books.  It occurred to me that I could simplify matters by letting Section 11 stand.  My idea was to simplify matters and to get on with the work.  I had no idea that all this personal attack was going to arise out of it.  I submit the amendment to the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no justification whatever in the case of a board which has penal powers; as the Censorship Board has, for making a provision which gives one member of the board two votes.  I think the lawyers present will agree that it is quite unheard of in the courts.  I suppose I will now be accused of being entirely against censorship, but the position is that five members of the board have to consider whether a book will be banned or not. What is provided here is that at least three members will have to be in favour of banning it.  What Senator Magennis seeks to provide is that, if four members are present and if two&mdash; including the chairman&mdash;are for banning the book, it will be banned. If the chairman happens to be one of those who wants to ban the book, the book will be banned.  That is contrary to the spirit of the Principal Act.  It is contrary to what the Minister has brought in under this Bill.  It is contrary to all practice, because you are <Col N="1368" /> imposing a penalty and the penalty should be imposed by the majority of the court sitting and hearing the evidence.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, Section 16, to delete sub-section (5) and insert instead the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5)  From time to time the Censorship Board shall cause a list of all prohibited books and prohibited periodical publications to be printed and shall have copies made available to whom and in such manner as the Minister may by regulation prescribe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tried to study this Bill as far as lay in my power, and I have already proposed some amendments which were not agreed to.  I think that if the House studies the wording of sub-section (5) it will be seen that, no matter what good opinion we may have <Col N="1369" /> of the draftsman, it is not quite correct.  I put it to the House that there is only one register and the word &ldquo;register&rdquo; in Sections 4, 7, 8 and 9 refers to the one register which is kept, I presume, at the headquarters of the Censorship Board.  But sub-section (5) says that the Censorship Board shall cause a register to be printed, published and made available to the public.  I am not a lawyer, but I have heard some of the lawyers talking here in divers tones to-day, and when a thing is published I cannot understand why it is necessary to provide that it be made available to the public subsequently.</P>
    <P>The register, to my mind, reading the other section, is the book kept at the headquarters and in which the various entries are to be made.  I would point out that in sub-section (6) it says that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall be the duty of every officer of customs and excise examining the baggage of incoming travellers to exhibit on demand a list of all prohibited books and prohibited periodical publications&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;register&rdquo; is not used there, and my suggestion to the Minister is that a similar phraseology should be used in sub-section (5) The sub-section would then read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From time to time the Censorship Board shall cause a list of all prohibited books and prohibited periodical publications to be printed and shall have copies made available to whom and in such manner as the Minister may by regulation prescribe.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So far, I have dealt with the wording of sub-section (5) and I suggest an alternative therefor.  The remainder of my amendment deals with what I referred to on the Second Stage, and that is the proposed restriction on the method of publication.  I spoke on the Committee Stage against having this list, as I shall call it now&mdash;I do not use the word &ldquo;register&rdquo;&mdash;being made available for general purchase anywhere throughout the country, and by the amendment I only want to leave it in the Minister's power to prescribe to whom and in what manner the list <Col N="1370" /> would be made available.  The Minister may prescribe that by regulation, and I suggest, as it may be offered in criticism afterwards, that the list should be available to all newsagents, as the register is available at the headquarters of the board.  That would be done according to regulations prescribed by the Minister, but I should not like the list to be placed on the counter of every bookstall in the country so that anybody could come along, buy it, and scrutinise it, if they wanted to do so.  I am simply leaving it to the Minister to make regulations prescribing the method under which the list can be sold and to whom it can be sold.  That is the power I am proposing to give him to act on.  How he does it is another matter, but I would not have it a matter for general publication as it is at present.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other point, I think that the phraseology of sub-section (5) is not very apt.  There is only one register, and that is the one at headquarters in which alterations are made from week to week or from day to day.  There must be alterations. If, on appeal, a prohibition Order is reversed, there must be an alteration in the register, and that goes on from day to day or week to week.  Nobody, of course, would have an opportunity of examining the register from day to day, but it should be possible to publish a list, such as I have suggested, which does not purport to be the register or a copy of the register.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I could agree to this amendment at all.  If the board have banned books I think that the public are entitled to know that these books are banned, and I cannot see how you can get out of that.  I do not see either to what extent a citizen by buying a book that was banned, could be held to have committed an offence.  Distributing such a book is the main offence, and if a citizen should lend himself to the circulation of a banned book he could be held to have committed an offence, but I do not think it would be right to hold that because a citizen had bought a banned book he had committed an offence, <Col N="1371" /> since the average citizen might not be aware of what is wrong.  Consequently, I do not see how the publication of this list would help people in the matter of buying books.  You might have the case of, say, a father who was buying a book at Christmas for his children and who would want to make certain that the book was not banned. That could happen.  I think it would be impossible for people to know that they were breaking the law if they were not in a position to know what the law was.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is quite right, and, frankly, I am puzzled to know what is meant by the amendment.  Under the Bill itself, the Minister can enable these things to be done in such manner as he may direct. I have not the remotest idea of the names of the books that have been banned&mdash;I think there were 12, but if there were a question time here and I were asked to give the names of the books I could not do so, because I cannot remember them.  I suppose I could look up the records later, but the ordinary general public would not know the names.  Newsagents, of course, have to watch these things generally and particularly in the cases of people who buy up second-hand books.  I suggest that nobody wants to buy a list of such books, and certainly if anybody wanted to buy the list from purely pornographic motives they would be disappointed.  In any case, there is no evidence that this list is being abused, and I suggest that the Minister already has that power and that he can make it available at such times and in such manner as he thinks fit.  If he found that they were being bought in shops for, say, 6d., then he could charge £5, and so on.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the difficulty Senators have is to try to discover what is the difference between the amendment proposed and the section which is suggested should be amended.  Senator O'Donovan went to some length in trying to explain the difference between a register and a list, <Col N="1372" /> but, as far as I am concerned, I am not convinced.  It seems to me that all that he wants is available in the section as it stands, where it says that the Censorship Board shall cause the register to be printed, published and made available to the public in such manner and at such times as the Minister may direct.  What more the Senator seeks than that I cannot make out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The important thing is that the list should not be freely available for purchase by people who want it for improper purposes, and I cannot see how this amendment would give the Minister any more power than he has already under sub-section (5).

      <P>Nobody who has spoken, with the exception of Senator O Buachalla, has referred to one of the principal points, and so far as I am concerned I am fairly convinced that my case is just.  A list can be published from time to time, but the register cannot be published and circulated from time to time.  If that were so, then why did we not use previously the same terminology, where it speaks of a list of periodical publications?  Therefore, when the Minister publishes what purports to be a register, which may be altered in two days' time, it is not the register.  I am pointing out that to describe it as a list would be correct, as it could not be a register, two or four days after publication.  As I have said, I am not a lawyer, but I have heard lawyers argue over points that were less important than this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" /> The principal reason why I put down this amendment on the Report Stage is that I want to know from the Minister what is the position now that we are placing the responsibility on five members; how they are to be entitled to get a book for the purpose of reading it, and to decide whether they will appeal or not.  The book will be censored, so that it will be illegal to sell it or to import it.  No doubt, application could be made to the Minister for a licence, but in principle I consider that to be highly undesirable. I object to telling the Minister about every book I may be asked to read, to see whether it should be censored or not.  I do not see why he should know whether I decided to sign an appeal or not.  If he insists that I must write to him for a licence he will know whether or not I have decided to appeal.  I am drawing attention to the position, if he maintains that five members are to decide whether there should be an appeal or not.  Senator Magennis and I agree that in the majority of cases a book has to be read before deciding whether there should be an appeal or not, but the book must first be obtained.</P>

If all we hear about people wanting these books is a fact Senators and Deputies would have a nice time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that this is a very important measure?  We have to consider it in the form in which it came from Committee, after we passed certain amendments.  The history of censorship here is that an Act was passed in 1929 about which there was considerable discussion, during which there was considerable misrepresentation of certain people.  I was not one of them because I was in the Chair. They endeavoured to amend the Bill in certain particulars.  That Bill was in the nature of an experiment.  It was recognised that it could not be entirely satisfactory, that no Bill of the kind could be entirely satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But what actually happened was that, in respect of periodicals and newspapers, the Act of 1929 was entirely satisfactory and successful. With regard to books, there was a complaint from certain people on various occasions and on various grounds.  I should like to put it that there is no reflection whatever on any Censorship Board when some citizen &mdash;I never did it myself because I was not interested in the matter&mdash;asserts that a book has been censored which ought not to have been censored. When a citizen says that, he is not in any way reflecting on the members of the particular Censorship Board at the time.  The great difficulty the Minister and the Minister's predecessors have experienced in administering the Act has been in securing suitable people to act on the Censorship Board, people whose opinions were worth having, people who had leisure to do the work and sufficient public spirit to undertake it.  I think that a tribute should be paid to the members of the board <Col N="1377" /> who, during all that time, under various Ministers, undertook that very distasteful task.  I, in my position, happened to know quite a number of them because they were chosen&mdash;perhaps naturally&mdash;from amongst my colleagues at University College&mdash;some of them lay and some of them clerical. Every one of them rather unwillingly performed the task but they had the public spirit to undertake it, under successive Ministers, by way of service to the State.  I think it can be said that Ministers, no matter who they were, did make an honest effort to get the best kind of people for the board.</P>
    <P>The present Minister determined to make certain changes and these changes are embodied in the Bill which we are now about to pass.  There are two main changes: the Minister removes himself from the position of being the censoring authority and, in order to satisfy certain people, he provides an appeal from the decisions of the board.  The Minister has said &mdash;we are all in agreement with him&mdash; that the provision of an appeal is a difficult thing.  He provided an appeal board of three members, one of whom was to be a legal personage.  I suspect that the Minister had in mind for that position a judicial personage.  One could say quite a lot, from the logical point of view, against having five members of the Censorship Board and three members of the appeal board.  On the whole, the view I took was that it was better to accept the Minister's <i>bona fides</i>, let this new provision stand and see how it would work.  For that reason, with the exception of the one point dealing with personal luggage and the action of the customs authorities in relation to it, my inclination was to let the Bill through.  I felt that it was a difficult problem and that I could not really be of much assistance to the Minister.  I thought the best thing to do was to let the Bill through and, as in 1929, see how it would work.  That was, perhaps, the view taken by a great many members of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I think that the Bill, as we find it before us on the Fifth Stage, is not as good a Bill as that which the Minister introduced.  He inserted a very good amendment with regard to personal <Col N="1378" /> luggage entering the country, and the rights of customs officers to search for and take books, but I think that, in accepting the amendment to make the appeal board consist of five persons&mdash;however logical that course may have been&mdash;he rendered the Bill more difficult of working.  I heard a predecessor of his say, many years ago, with regard to a particular amendment: &ldquo;Under duress of long speeches, the Government is accepting this amendment.&rdquo;  The Minister was not well advised, under the duress of long speeches in the Committee Stage which we have just finished, to accept an amendment to make the censorship appeal board consist of five members. It would be difficult to find five members, it would be more difficult to find eight, and still more difficult to find ten suitable persons to work this Bill, and what I am concerned with is that the Bill should work.</P>
    <P>The Committee Stage of the Bill, which resulted in the insertion of these amendments, gave me considerable pause, and made for me certain considerable difficulties.  The attitude taken up was that nobody could exercise his right to say that certain books had been censored which should not have been censored without insulting the board.  I do not think that the average member of the board would take up that attitude at all.  It was suggested here&mdash;quite wrongly&mdash;that those who tried to amend this Bill were in some way assisting in the spread of indecent and obscene publications. In fact, the suggestion was made, at one point&mdash;as it seemed to me and to the Minister&mdash;that the Minister himself was in league with certain foreign publishers who wanted to flood the country with indecent publications. That kind of advocacy can do nothing but harm to a cause, even when the cause is good.  I suggest that it was very ill-advised.  We are in the position now that we have before us a Bill on the Fifth Stage which, I think, will give the Minister very considerable trouble.  In this small country, there has been difficulty in finding a board of five, and now the Minister will have to find two boards of five, which will be more difficult.  It would, I think, have been better if we had made provision <Col N="1379" /> for an appeal board of three members, instead of yielding to the argument that, on logical grounds, it should consist of five members.  If we had recognised the Minister's difficulties and his <i>bona fides</i>, allowed the Bill, as it was, to go through and seen what would happen, it would have been better.  I think that the Bill was worsened, and that the Minister was ill-advised to accept the amendment to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>We are all in agreement that censorship, in principle, is good, but the working of a censorship, particularly a censorship of books, is very difficult, indeed.  Anybody who could help in the work of making this Bill a proper Bill should have been encouraged, instead of its being suggested that he was interested in the spread of obscene publications.  Periodicals stand in a class by themselves and the Act has been very successful with regard to them.  With regard to books, it can be said that this type of Bill is but a very small contribution towards keeping people morally right.  It is only one of a great number of things that could be done and should be done &mdash;on the material side, the giving of a good living to people, the creation of interest in the country, the creation of a natural spirit of interest in national affairs.  It is rather more important that people should read good literature than that they should be prevented from reading a certain quantity of bad literature, because there are many things which many of us would like to ban but which no conceivable Bill could ban.  There are certain types of printed matter&mdash;for example, murder stories, which do not come under this Bill&mdash;which, if constantly read, have an evil effect on the mind.  Although this Bill is necessary, it is of much greater importance that positive steps should be taken to encourage people to read good matter than that elaborate steps should be taken to prevent them from reading evil matter, such as is dealt with in this Bill.  I accept the <i>bona fides</i> of the Minister and his Department and I wish the Bill well.</P>

      <P>When this <Col N="1380" /> Bill came up for Second Reading I took it upon myself to say that I recommended the House to pass it, and I indicated that I thought it would be a better Bill if the House at the same time accepted certain amendments which it was my intention to introduce.  I regret very much that, with the exception of the two most unimportant of those amendments, the House has not seen fit to accept them, and I think the Bill is a much worse Bill than if they had been accepted.  It is in fact, a worse Bill for the reasons given, but also a worse Bill than when it came before the House.</P>
      <P>There is one matter which I might make clear, because certain misapprehensions did arise on the Second Reading, and very probably, I am responsible for those misapprehensions. I may have used phrases which in the atmosphere of the law courts would not be regarded as provocative but which produced a most surprising reaction&mdash;to me at any rate &mdash;among my friends in the Seanad.  I want to safeguard now my position, and to make it clear that although I approve of this Bill in so far as it improves the censorship method, I do not want to be considered now or at any time, as lending my voice to the principle of censorship.</P>
      <P>I want to say that now in a way in which no one can object to it.  On four different occasions in my lifetime, it has fallen to me to make certain investigations into censorship from the point of view of the science of legislation and the theory of politics.  I had to do it in 1915, in 1918 and again last year.  What I compressed into one paragraph of the Official Report as the general objections to censorship were merely the truisms of the textbooks written by people who had studied and who had written on abstract political science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I confess I was surprised&mdash;more than surprised; I was astounded&mdash;by the reaction which that drew from certain members of this House, and I read very carefully through the speeches which had been made to see how I had provoked that reaction, and also what arguments had been used against me.  After carefully reading them through and discovering there had <Col N="1381" /> not been one single argument used addressed to the intellect, but merely repetitions of highly coloured words which are not only no argument but merely indicate that the person using them cannot find an argument, I came to the conclusion that I had not been so far wrong as possibly I thought I was.  I became determined that before I again addressed this House on general principles, I would make it my business to try to read everything that had been written on the subject of censorship from the time I made a considered study of it in 1915 and 1917 to date.</P>
    <P>The best bibliography of censorship is issued by the University of Oregon and is not available in Ireland.  There is a subject index in the London Library catalogue and there is a bibliography in the Encyclopedia of Social Sciences, and in many other books.  Since the Second Reading, I have read every book that is available in the big libraries in Ireland dealing with censorship from the abstract point of view, and I can assure the House that from 1916 onwards, there is no book which is available in the public libraries in Ireland, Trinity College or the National University which has one word to say in favour of the principle of censorship.</P>
    <P>I go somewhat farther than that.  I had occasion to consult all the League of Nations publications that were available.  As you know, the League of Nations has a special committee for dealing with obscene literature, and you will find in the National Library these reports, the latest of which available is 1932.  You will find there the legislation of other countries.  You will find statements that pornographic literature is decreasing, that it is a dying traffic and that countries have had no difficulties in dealing with it by the ordinary police procedure.  You will not, as far as my recollection goes, find any recommendation of censorship procedure.</P>
    <P>You will find certain difficulties, among them being the extraordinary difficulty of getting an adequate definition of these words &ldquo;indecent and obscene&rdquo;, but I think I am correct in saying that nowhere in the proceedings of the League of Nations, or in any other book available in our <Col N="1382" /> recognised public libraries, will you find a word to be said in favour of the system of censorship we have here.  I am, of course, aware, although at the time I was not able to consult continental works on the subject, that since 1916 articles have been written in favour of censorship in Germany, since the Nazi régime was instituted, and in Russia under the Bolshevist régime.  So far as I know, those are the only countries which have upheld this system.  I am also aware that in Spain there is a doctrinal censorship.  Before the passage of this Bill I got a 15-page letter from a very prominent Catholic in Spain, complaining of the working and effects of the censorship there.  From a Catholic point of view it is a doctrinal censorship, but the writer regarded it as disastrous.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to put those facts before the House.  I am not going to attempt to give the arguments against censorship because they are so well known and it would take some time, and I could not hope to convince the House.  But I ask the House to realise that those who have gone into the matter, in the majority, do not think this is a good way of dealing with obscene literature. I ask the censors-to-be, the ten just men who are going to operate this Bill, when they are so doing it, to familiarise themselves, as I am sure they have done and as Professor Magennis has done, with the dangers and disadvantages of the system, because only by keeping within very rigid lines can you ever avoid the result which I indicated to the House at an earlier stage, that though it may do some good in the ultimate analysis, yet in ways which are not obvious when you are working it, it will do more harm than good.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, the natural thing that everybody thinks of when he sees something he wants to stop.  He takes the easiest way of stopping it. You can find an analogy in prohibition legislation in the United States.  It was felt that the easiest way to stop people getting drunk was to stop the sale of liquor.  Those familiar with the history of prohibition legislation foresaw clearly what was going to happen in America, and everything that was <Col N="1383" /> prophesied did happen, and I would only say this: if you want to avoid similar evils I would strongly recommend to those who are going to be censors a study of the history of censorship of the past and the evils which it was introduced to avoid, and the evils which were produced when they came to put it into operation.</P>

      <P>I feel there is a sinister suggestion in Senator Kingsmill Moore's speech that the only three countries in the world where there is censorship are Russia, Germany and Spain.

Are their censorships rather not on the economic side than on the moral side?</P>

      <P>May I make it clear that there are two types?  You can have police interference <i>ex post facto</i> or you can have prohibitive censorship, such as here.  This type of prohibitive censorship beforehand exists, I believe, in those countries but I think it existed also in Massachusetts. I have not been able to get recent information as to foreign countries.  I prefer the old method, the prosecution of offenders in the matter of obscene literature and confiscation by the police.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to say that I think the Minister has gone out of his way to give consideration to the various points that were raised.  I think that he at any rate has endeavoured to treat this Bill as I think it should be treated &mdash;a non-Party measure, a measure which everybody was anxious to see worked in the most effective way without abuse and without undue interference.  I feel like Senator Hayes that he has made one or two mistakes. I take it that this Bill is also regarded in the Dáil as a non-Party measure and, that when our amendments go back, <Col N="1384" /> they may be liable to reconsideration there.  There is no certainty that they will be accepted or that they may not come back here for reconsideration. Senator Hayes has referred to one amendment which caused him some concern, namely, the increase in the Censorship Board of five.  I am inclined to agree because I think it will add to the difficulties of getting suitable members but I do not know that it is a very vital objection.</P>
      <P>There is one amendment which the Minister accepted which I think requires further consideration before the Bill becomes law because I think it may cause a decidedly complicated position.  That is the decision to take out the words &ldquo;in its general tendency&rdquo;. I have been making inquiries but for the life of me I could not discover whether that narrows or widens the terms of the Bill.  I am rather inclined to think that it will have the effect of letting more books through but I suggest that it may lead to serious complications and that the Minister might very well go back to the old phrase for this reason.  We have for a long period a pretty fair measure of consent as to what the phrase means and it has been pretty effective.  When you start introducing a new phrase, it will take quite a long time to find what is the difference between the new phrase and the old phrase.  The board will have to consider whether there is a change or whether there is not and, if so, what is the effect of that change &mdash;is it a widening change, has it the same meaning as &ldquo;in general tendency&rdquo; or has it the effect of narrowing the measure and making more books liable to be censored?  The appeal board will have to consider the point and quite a considerable time must elapse before we know the recognised meaning of the phrase.  The Minister will appreciate that it is not a question of getting a dictionary to know what it means, but that it is a question of practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a further point.  As the Bill stands now, unless by any chance our lawyers discover a flaw in it, books that have been censored up to the present are liable to be made the subject of appeal.  Such books were censored <Col N="1385" /> because in their general tendency they were obscene.  Is the appeal to be taken now on the question of whether they were in their general tendency indecent or obscene or is the appeal to be taken according to the new wording of the Bill?  The Minister, no doubt, has given that point serious consideration and I should like to get an answer from him because it is not clear to me.  It seems to me to create a rather peculiar position.  The old board operated on the phrase set out in the Act that if any book was in its general tendency indecent or obscene it was to be censored.  The appeal is now going to be made to a new board. Surely the new board must have regard to the same phrase as that on which the book was first censored?  If they are to operate merely on the new phrase &ldquo;indecent or obscene&rdquo; the board will be in a quandary in regard to the older books.  It is quite possible that books which were quite properly condemned under the old phrase will become uncensored because of the new phrase.  The Minister, no doubt, will be able to tell me under what term the appeals will be considered.  I suggest to him that there is a situation there which requires careful consideration and that wisdom would have dictated the retention of the same phrase in this Bill because it has worked quite well over a long time and there is no evidence that books, which were really improper and that should have been censored, were not censored.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just one or two remarks to make.  Firstly, I should like to say that I am not quite happy concerning the alteration we made with regard to customs inspection. I still feel that we were unwise to alter that section in the way we did. Our aim is to prevent the circulation of a certain type of literature which the Censorship Board and the appeal board may consider unsuitable.  One has only to think of the many ways in which passengers enter this country and one has only to reflect on the enormous numbers of people coming and going, to realise the danger there is of a large importation of such books and the possibility of their circulation.  I <Col N="1386" /> think Senator Fearon suggested that the difficulty might be got over by a person's signature being written into the book.  That would not make any difference because books could be distributed as secondhand.  In any case, if people have the desire to get rid of them, to circulate them, they will find a way of doing that.</P>
      <P>I can be optimistic enough to hope that the great majority of the Irish people are not interested in that type of literature but the aim of the Bill is to prevent the accumulation or the circulation of such literature.  I am afraid that having altered the section relating to customs inspection in the way we have, we have undermined to a very considerable extent an otherwise very commendable Bill.</P>
      <P>I should like now before we send the Bill on its way to appeal&mdash;perhaps Senators will feel it is uncalled for and still I feel it a kind of duty that the appeal should be made seeing that we have given ourselves the right to institute appeals&mdash;to every member of the Oireachtas to take that responsibility in the most serious manner possible.  I can see quite easily the danger of members of the Oireachtas being approached. I can see these people quite reasonably agreeing to endorse a requisition for an appeal and so holding up the whole work of the appeal board.  As I said yesterday, it is possible, if we find that happening, to have the Bill amended, but this is the main reason I have for making this appeal.  We have done something here which if it is not unusual is certainly something I do not like and it is this; that as legislators we have given ourselves a certain privelege.  We have given ourselves the right to initiate these appeals.  That is a right we have not given to any other body and it is a right that I do not think we should have given to ourselves but since we have taken that right, I hope that by its conduct in the matter the Oireachtas will prove worthy in every respect of having taken such a step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might appear from the discussions that our attitude here was one of hostility to the general body of Irish writers.  In fact, some of the Irish <Col N="1387" /> writers feel that they have been &ldquo;put on the spot.&rdquo; in a most uncalled for manner.  I think it is not an inopportune occasion to pay a tribute to the excellent work of the general body of Irish writers.  I think they will be glad of the discussions we have had here; that we will have given them a line as to what we consider to be reasonable; and, I think above all that, having now got their appeal board, writers will feel themselves relieved of any stigma which seemed to have been attached to them arising out of certain comments and certain discussions here.</P>
    <P>Except to join with Senator Hayes in paying tribute to the members of the old board, I have nothing more to say.  They certainly deserve well of us. They had to map out the course.  They had no previous experience to guide them.  I am not going to say that they made mistakes&mdash;I do not know that they did&mdash;but one thing is certain, that the new boards will have every reason to be grateful to the old board for the work that they did, and for the way that they charted their course for them.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister.  The Bill is now a very much better Bill than it was when it was brought into the House.  It has been amended in certain important respects, and very much to its improvement. It will make censorship easier, more effective, and more acceptable even to some of the disgruntled critics of the past.  If I were to particularise, I would say that if we had done nothing more than put in the amendment dealing with books which, under the appearance of condemning those practices, make a case for what I can only call the taking of human life, we would have effected an enormous improvement. On the other hand, I was one of those who looked forward to the introduction of an amending Bill, and hoped that the opportunity would be taken to do away with the disabilities &mdash;and there were many&mdash;under which the board had laboured.  The Minister is aware of that himself, and I have disclaimed any intention to put the blame for their continuance on the Minister for Justice.  There is a certain <Col N="1388" /> restriction on expenditure, and members of the Dáil, when the Bill was passing through that House, demanded to be assured that the new measure would not add to the expense on the State.  I am sorry that the opportunity has not been taken to do away with that restriction.  In this I am speaking on behalf of the future board, for when the amending Bill becomes an Act I pass out automatically.  As regards the tributes paid to the work of the old board, the tributes belong to the men who undertook this work in the first years.  They had a very difficult problem.  They had to create traditions, as well as to create procedure. What very few critics of the Principal Act bear in mind is this: that it was a fine attempt to do one of the most difficult things that a Legislature could undertake.  In England, the task of dealing with books and similar matters was part of the criminal law, and the publishers and the authors were living within the jurisdiction of the British Law Courts.  But the difficulty here was that the chief offender&mdash;the British and foreign publishers&mdash;was outside the jurisdiction of the State, and the whole criminal procedure had to be adapted to confront that factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the principal factor in the whole problem.  It was idle to declare certain things illegal, or to attach penalties to the publication or circulation of indecent literature or literature advocating what I can only call murder. It would have been like passing a resolution abolishing the devil.  The devil would go on just the same.  That was the trouble.  There was a deluge from the foreign Press not alone of periodicals but of books.  Some of the periodicals were of that low type that in the United States are called pulp magazines.  They are printed upon what is not really paper but a kind of pulp, and sold at a lower price.  The board had, as I say, to manufacture&mdash; if that is a permissible word&mdash;the censorship, in face of the fact that they were substituting something like civil procedure for criminal procedure.  I think they deserve well of the State, those men who made censorship a practical reality.  There were tributes paid to the members of the board, but the value of them is detracted from <Col N="1389" /> by the personal accusations that have studded this discussion of the amending Bill from beginning to end.  I will not pursue that, but I do say that we are going to be faced&mdash;by &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean the people of this State; I do not mean the Censorship Board, because I know I am going out of office the moment this Bill becomes law, so I am speaking dispassionately and impersonally in that regard&mdash;with a flood of this foul literature.  Senator Kingsmill Moore says that the word &ldquo;filth&rdquo; applied to it has no meaning.  That simply means that he knows nothing at all about the works that come our way.</P>
    <P>One further word, and I have practically finished.  Senator Summerfield said that the board, which has been praised for what it did, did not do as much as was expected from it, and he was right.  I have admitted it already. Of 990 books that ought to have been stopped, about 90 came our way.  That is the fact.  When Senator Johnston, in the course of the debate, proceeded to show that sexual crime had not been diminished, he failed to take account of the fact that, even if it were conceivably possible to make the process of dealing with books an effectual stopper of the sort of crime to which he referred, it was not possible for the board to do that work because, as I said, they were not in touch with the books.  They could not get them.</P>
    <P>That is why I laid stress upon this, that the board does not claim to have done everything that might have been done, but it has done as well as it could, in the circumstances, what it was possible for it to do.  The country will have to face up to the fact that if they want to keep the countryside clean, and the little country town shops pure and undefiled, they will have to be prepared to spend more money in the defence of the fatherland.</P>
    <P>Now, as regards the complaints of fine works being kept from readers, I ask if those readers read all the good literature that is already within their reach?  We have excellent Irish authors. Do these people read those Irish authors?  The opponents of censorship choose to regard as Irish&mdash;authors who are penalised by an unconscionable board&mdash;people who are not Irish authors at all.  A man who is a personal <Col N="1390" /> friend of a friend of mine is put down as an Irish author because he has an Irish name.  He never was in Ireland, nor was his mother, nor was his father, nor was his grandfather; and yet he, supposedly, is an Irish writer whom we have forced into an unwilling exile in the United States of America.  The man has never come here at all.  He is an American.  So it is with a lot of the others.  I had not the time to go into the list of all the banned books written by people, possibly, bearing Irish names, and for whose exile we were held to be responsible, but so far as I could get information from biographies, and so on, a large number of them are not Irish authors at all.  That is a fact that ought to be taken into account when we are charged with these iniquities.  In the case of another author&mdash;I shall not name anyone, so as not to incur the Chairman's displeasure&mdash;there is alleged our guilt of forcing into exile an Irish writer.  Now, the book by that author which we banned was one of the foulest books which could be imagined, and her departure from the three English-speaking countries was due to the fact that if the public prosecutor in England could be certain of getting a verdict, he would have instituted proceedings.</P>
    <P>It is well, then, when generous tributes are being paid to the board, to remember that a great many of the accusations that are launched against the board&mdash;tributes of another order altogether&mdash;are made in a spirit of hostility and not with any judicial calm or with any sense of fairness or justice, and I say that especially, I repeat, on behalf of the first board.  I do not want to appear unfair in any way to anyone.  I have said that the board has suffered from lack of funds and from lack of an office staff, but I in no sense impute that disability to the Minister for Justice or his predecessor. It is simply due in some respects to the fact that the enormity of the problem has not been sufficiently realised.  I shall end by saying that I congratulate the Minister on going out from this House with a very much better Bill than he came in with.</P>

They have done a very good piece of work and I wish to pay my tribute to them. Although it was a very thankless job, they did it very well.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I should not like to have any impression created that the work of the board was curtailed in any way by any reluctance on the part of the Government to advance money. As I say, I am not aware that any request was made for money which was not granted.  I do not want to make a particular point of that, but I feel that an impression might be created that there was an attempt to starve the board, and I think that the very fact that the money granted was not spent is a sufficient answer to that.  At least, it appears to me to be a sufficient answer.  Again, I want to pay my tribute to the work of the board. I am satisfied that the board as a whole has done very good work; that as regards periodicals it has been a complete success, and that there is very little reason or ground for the complaints that have been made in certain quarters in this country about the operation of the book censorship. I think that it is highly desirable that, as far as we can, we should get acceptance of the principle of censorship. Senator Kingsmill Moore objects to the whole principle of censorship, and I suppose everybody would object to it if it could be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, personally, would not be in favour of censorship if it could be avoided at all.  I think that none of us like censorship generally, but there are circumstances in which it cannot be avoided.  During the war, for instance, we had another form of censorship, which could not be avoided, and <Col N="1392" /> although nobody may like it, nevertheless it is a necessity.  At any rate, I think that it is very necessary, and the Bill was brought in on the understanding that the Oireachtas accepted the principle which, of course, it has done.  The Act was passed in 1929 and on this Bill there was no objection, except the one made here by Senator Kingsmill Moore to the principle of censorship.  As I have said, we should all be pleased to do without it, but we cannot do so.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Hayes's point about the five members, I thought that three would be better on the appeal board.  I came in here with a fairly open mind, prepared to hear the case for five members or for my own proposal of three members and, unfortunately for Senator Hayes's point of view, I got nobody to speak in favour of my proposal and I accepted it as the view of the Seanad that five would be a proper number.  I saw the difficulty of getting 10.  I hope we will be able to get over that.  I do not think it will make the Bill any worse but I should not like it to go forth, as seemed to be suggested by some speakers, that if we had three on one board and five on the other board the three would be regarded as better than the five or people of a superior type.  I do not think there was anything in that point, but it was made and it was suggested that when it came to getting people to act on that board they might have felt that and it might have been difficult to get people to act.  That point weighed with me.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point about &ldquo;general tendency&rdquo; raised by Senator Douglas, I imagine that the board will act on the wording in the new Act.  I do not see what else they can do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I understand it, the Act will lay down what books are indecent. We will have to see how it works.  Like <Col N="1393" /> every other Bill, if we find that there is a call for its amendment, we will have to meet that situation when it arises.  As Senator O Buachalla stated, I would not like any writer to think that his work was not appreciated.  We are aware that the vast majority of Irish writers are worthy people, and that they have done good work for the country.  I would not like the idea to get abroad that there was any question of maligning them in any way.  I should like them to know&mdash;and I think Senator Magennis said so&mdash;that the Censorship Board appreciates the work done by the vast majority of Irish writers. The amendments to this Bill which I have accepted in this House I shall recommend to the Dáil.  A more satisfactory debate took place here than in the other House.  There was less attention paid to the Bill in the Dáil.  I think some of the discussion might have been shortened, and that some amendments seemed rather frivolous, but, on the whole, I think the Seanad gave the Bill a far closer examination and was more helpful than the House to which I belong.  There is no doubt about that.  I did not try to rush the Bill in the other House, but there was very little debate on it there.</P>

      <P>This Bill is evidently designed to afford facilities to tenants with grievances, to call attention to them and that they can avail of these facilities with more case than those afforded by earlier rent restriction Acts.  The impression has, however, gone abroad that this is really a Bill where the odds are very much against landlords in favour of tenants, because of the facilities afforded tenants in the matter of costs that are not enjoyed by landlords.  A tenant who has a grievance can bring his case before a court and if he sustains it the landlord has a right to defend the position he got in earlier legislation his costs are paid, but the landlord, as far as I understand the Bill, has to fight the appeal out of his own resources.  It has been alleged that because of that unfair differentiation, since rent restriction legislation was introduced, the tendency on the part of the private landlord who owns property is to cease letting these premises and to cash in on them by putting them up for sale.  It would be a pity if any legislation passed for the benefit of tenants should interfere with the beneficial work that private enterprise, in the way of building new houses, confers on the community.  I hold that every house, whether it is to let or for sale, does to an extent relieve the rather acute housing problem that prevails, not alone in the cities but throughout the country. There is another provision in this Bill which I regard as a flaw, namely, that bad tenants&mdash;and there are such, just as there are bad landlords&mdash;with vexatious grievances could make the lot of their landlords an impossible one. Some means must be found on the Committee Stage of the Bill to rule out the possibility of vexatious appeals, or attempts on the part of such tenants to make the lot of landlords impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am acquainted with many landlords and tenants, and I know that they live on the very best of terms, being helpful in many ways to each other.  In <Col N="1395" /> these instances the landlords are anxious to meet the reasonable requests of the tenants as regards improvements, but there are other tenants who are never satisfied.  In such cases I am assured that the repairs which some tenants require to have done to their houses would often cost twice the amount of rent that their landlords collect.  As matters stand, an investor who continues to build houses either to let or to sell is certainly a public benefactor.  At the same time, we have to consider the position of a large number of people who, owing to economic conditions, will never be able to purchase their homes in the open market.  That class of people must depend on the efforts of public bodies to provide them with decent houses, with all the modern amenities that they are entitled to, but these are houses that no private builder could provide and let at rents that the tenants could pay.  The difference between what they are able to pay, and what public bodies must collect, so that there would be a fair return on the capital invested, must be met out of State funds.  I have experience of cases in which public bodies, in their desire to provide sites for houses, have not treated the owners of those sites fairly.  Members of public bodies who themselves owned land that would make suitable sites for building schemes never offered those sites, but they acted aggressively on the public bodies with a view to confiscating, more or less, from other people sites considered suitable for building.  Those bodies compulsorily acquired those sites at a fourth of what they would realise in the open market.  That is not fair.  Where people have property considered suitable for building schemes, it should be acquired only in the ordinary way, and the owner should be given the equivalent of what it would realise in the open market had he an opportunity of putting it up for sale.</P>
    <P>Senator Sweetman made what I considered a very good point last night in the brief remarks he addressed to the House on this Bill.  He urged that the Government should encourage private enterprise in building but he stressed <Col N="1396" /> that the Government should exercise some supervision over the class of houses built, so that those known as &ldquo;jerry builders&rdquo; would not be allowed to cash-in on the necessities of people who are prepared to take any house in order to have a roof over their heads.  Something should be done to stop that abuse, which is not confined to the cities.  It should be possible to amend this Bill in such a way as to rule out the possibility of tenants with vexatious claims pestering landlords who are discharging their responsibilities in the best possible manner.  If provision were made whereby tenants of that unreasonable type would be prevented from coming forward with frivolous claims, this Bill would be a very good one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a Bill on which one can expatiate at any great length.  The Minister rather anticipated the discussion on it by his very helpful memorandum.  It is a very welcome Bill for what it contains, but the omissions are significant and important. So far as it co-ordinates the laws dealing with rents, it is very welcome. It simplified that question and brings it, perhaps, within the purview of the ordinary man, who has not to go back to scores of references to ascertain what the law is.  Rent law will now be found in one Act and, to that extent, I welcome the Bill.  However, a number of matters of great importance and urgency, which might have been dealt with in the Bill, have received very little attention.  One of those is the scarcity of houses in the cities and, particularly, in Dublin. This Bill is not going to do anything to relieve that scarcity.  Incidentally, I may mention that one speaker dealt very largely with the scarcity of houses and was not pulled up for doing so.  On that precedent I assume I have the same liberty to deal with this matter.  He should be an authority on the scarcity of houses.  To illustrate the fact, he said that people in very good circumstances were compelled, owing to the shortage of houses, to seek houses that, in the ordinary way, would be occupied by the working-classes. It is a fact that a member of this House, in good circumstances, had to pursue his case in the courts to be <Col N="1397" /> allowed to live in a labourer's cottage. That, in itself, is some evidence of the scarcity of houses.</P>
      <P>There are good and bad landlords. Unfortunately, Senator O'Reilly is not here, because he made a good case for the landlords.  I can speak as a landlord and as a tenant, and I think that landlords have some grievances.  I shall mention one.  I happen to be a landlord, in trust, of certain property of which a letting was made about 50 years ago.  The letting provided that the tenants would have occupation at certain rents, the owner to pay rates and taxes.  At that time, the rates and taxes were between 9/- and 10/- in the £.  To-day, they are 21/- in the £.  Consequently, the unfortunate landlord in that case has been losing money for a number of years and is likely to go on losing money until the lease falls in four or five years hence.  I do not know whether or not there are many other landlords in the predicament in which I was in in connection with that letting but, if there are, they ought to get some relief.</P>
      <P>No provision is made in this Bill in respect of ground rents.  The ground rent on the property to which I have referred is owned by an absentee landlord&mdash;the representative of a family who made their money in this country and, having made their money, had no further use for the country.  They are living outside the country and drawing their ground rents regularly from here.  It is time that steps were taken to deal with this question of ground rents, which is a very important and serious matter.  There is a great deal of talk about the nationalising, in another country, of certain essential industries.  I do not know of anything which it is more important to nationalise than ground rents in the City of Dublin.  The ground is almost valueless until a public body comes along to erect houses.  Then, it suddenly becomes an El Dorado, although the owners did nothing to improve it. It is the public body which makes the improvement, but the enhanced value goes to the private owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, of course, good landlords. There are the Iveagh Trust, the <Col N="1398" /> Artisans' Dwellings Company and St. Ultan's.  There may be other such organisations, but with those three I am very well acquainted.  As landlords, I think that they could not be improved upon.  If those people could get any relief under this Bill which would induce them to persevere on the lines on which they have been going for a long number of years, it would be very helpful.</P>
    <P>The Iveagh Trust were the first people to embark, as far as I know, on a very big housing scheme.  That induced the corporation to carry on.  The Artisans' Dwellings Company was there before the Iveagh Trust and as landlords, I think they are models.  I know their properties very well, and I know a number of people who work for them and they are up to a high standard as employers.  St. Ultan's is a new society with the object of giving healthy homes at reasonable rent. They are doing that fairly well, and given relief or encouragement from the local authority or national body I am sure they will continue their good work.</P>
    <P>One matter which is not dealt with under this Bill is the flat system.  This has been exploited to an extraordinary degree.  In addition to high rents, children are banned, and I suggest to the Minister that under the Censorship Act or some other Act, he would prohibit the publication of advertisements of flat lettings which specify &ldquo;Adults only&rdquo;.  That is a suggestion from me that no paper should be permitted to publish advertisements of that kind. Such advertisements are quite common and regular in the papers.  It is an audacious thing and the censorship or some other authority would serve a useful purpose if they stopped it.</P>

      <P>It is extremely indecent in a Christian country to bar a family where there are children, or to forbid letting in the case of newly-married couples.  A man not unconnected with the Labour Party secured a house and let it in flats, and not a child has been allowed to enter it ever since.  One newly-married couple got a flat at a fairly high rent and when there were signs of children coming on, the couple were told they had to get out.  We have protection in many ways, but here is one scandal crying out for action.  This Bill makes no effort to give any protection whatever in the matter of preventing this kind of prohibition on having children in the house.</P>
      <P>I would like to welcome Part III of the Bill because it gives the tenant an opportunity of cheap law.  It is a step in the right direction and a recognition that the tenant should have access to the courts at the cheapest possible rate without engaging a lawyer to plead his cause and make his case.  I welcome the Bill for what it contains, but I regret the omission of many of the other things I have referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, but I would be better pleased if it had no limitations whatever.  In Section 3 it increases the valuation to £60 in the city, and in other places to £40 per house, but I would like to see these limitations disappear.  I do not know why we follow the 1915 and other Acts in that respect.  I would like to see this Bill applied to every house and every premises not covered by the Land Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Imagine if a man has a valuation of £60 10s. he has no protection under this Act if he lives in the City of Dublin.  In the country, if he has a valuation of £40 1s. he has no protection either, whereas the man with £40 is protected.  One shilling thus deprives the man of protection.  It reminds me of the old days when they passed a Workmen's Compensation Act in 1897 and made certain limitations. One of the provisions was that if a man was working in a house 30 feet high, compensation was given to him for injury, or to his widow and <Col N="1400" /> children in the case of his death from a fall.  Similarly, if he worked in a quarry 30 feet deep he could get compensation, but if he worked in a house only 29 feet 11½ inches high, or in a quarry the same depth, he got no compensation whatsoever, whether for injury or death.  Those limitations disappeared gradually in 1900, 1906, and 1934, when they were abolished.  We should not have to wait for the next 30 years to have all these limitations swept away in the case of houses when certain people are deprived of rights enjoyed by their more lucky neighbours whose valuation differs from theirs by only a few shillings.</P>
    <P>There is also a provision that it applies to houses with land attached if the valuation of the land does not exceed a quarter of the valuation of the house.  That can work very grave injustices.  I had a case some time ago where the valuation of the land exceeded that of the house by about 3/-.  Fortunately, I found out that the man was rated for land he did not own and I was able to get a revaluation of the house before proceedings were taken.</P>

      <P>Under the 1906 Act a man who owned three acres was held to be entitled to the benefits of the Act.  That was the first Act of its kind passed in Ireland and it arose out of the famous case of Martin Ward of Loughrea.  Mr. Tanner, the agent for the famous Lord Clanrickard, on seeing that Mr. Ward was acting as secretary of the United Irish League, sent him an <i>argumentum ad hominem</i> in the shape of a notice to quit, and he was duly evicted from his house and premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the provision which exempts business houses held for a year or more.  I know they are protected to a certain extent by the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931, but I can imagine slips occurring which will deprive tenants of their rights under that Act.  Certain notices must be served at least three months before the expiration of the lease, and in one <Col N="1401" /> part of the Act there are powers given by which a judge may abridge the time, but in another part of the Act dealing with ground rents, there is no such provision, and if the tenant forgets or neglects to serve the notice within the period he loses relief.</P>
    <P>There is a very great difficulty that certain people will fall between those Acts and will have no remedy at all. That is why I would like to see everybody protected in every house in the towns unless he has sufficient land to bring him within the Land Acts. Another difficulty I see is that this Bill follows the 1923 Act.  It says that a statutory tenant may not sell.  There will probably be great objection to my statement in this respect that a man cannot sell his house if he is a statutory tenant.</P>
    <P>A statutory tenant is defined as a person retaining possession under the Act.  I do not know how every judge would construe that section.  Some judges may hold that the tenant is protected by it only where an order is made by the judge stating that the landlord would be entitled to possession were it not for the fact that this Bill was passed.  I do not know whether such a person would be the only person who is a statutory tenant.  Assuming that every person within these limitations is a statutory tenant, then nobody whose valuations come within the prescribed figure can dispose of what would be a very valuable property. That would particularly apply in cases where a man lives in one portion of the premises and carries on a business in another portion.  That person's property may be worth £7,000, £8,000 or £10,000 but, even if he is served with notice to quit or with an ejectment order and is merely allowed to retain possession under the Act, he is completely deprived of the right to dispose of his interest in it.  That is a matter that should be remedied.</P>
    <P>There is also a difficulty where a tenant dies.  I know that his wife or his child, if living with him, has the right to continue as tenant but if the child is not living with him that right does not exist.  The tenant's right ceases on the death of the tenant.  That is different from the law that existed <Col N="1402" /> before this Bill was introduced.  A man who had certain rights under the 1906 Act, before it was repealed to make room for the 1931 Act, may lose these rights now.  There is a danger that certain people may lose very valuable rights if the Bill is passed in its present form.  If anybody serves notice to quit knowing that he cannot get possession of the property, permission should be given to the Circuit Court judge to dismiss the case on the merits and not make the order that is intended to be made under the Bill.  There are certain other matters which will arise on Committee but these are the broad points of objection which I have to the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is rather pleasant, after a Bill in which it was apparent that there was a certain imperfect sympathy between the views of members of the House, to come to a Bill with the principle of which I think nearly every member of the House would be prepared to agree.  On the general working out of that principle I think most members would also be prepared to agree.  In so far as differences make themselves visible, when we come to the Committee Stage, I think they will be merely differences in detail.  In some respects, I will submit to the House, the Bill goes too far and, in other respects, it does not go far enough.  In order to understand the reasons why I shall make these submissions, it might perhaps be desirable to refer very shortly to the underlying principles which make this Bill justifiable and necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will probably agree with me that there is nothing disgraceful or dishonourable in owning or investing in house property.  Senators may even go so far as to agree with me that landlords as a class have a right to live&mdash; that is to say, landlords of house property.  I realise that if I were dealing with landlords of agricultural property, these propositions might not seem so self-evident! In fact, as we are all aware, the majority of houses are not held by rich landlords.  House property is a rather favourite method of investment for a person who has saved a certain amount of money, who <Col N="1403" /> has retired from active business because he is no longer strong enough to attend to it, and who feels that he would like to invest his money in something to give him an interest in life.  There are also many widows and spinsters dependent for an income on small investments in house property.</P>
    <P>Therefore we can approach this Bill from the point of view that, although owners of house property may have to forgo a certain amount of what they expected or what they would be entitled to get if there was a completely free market, yet they have a right to a return upon their capital and that a case has to be made out to justify a diminution of that return.  What that case is, it is not difficult to find out.</P>
    <P>In ordinary times the current level of rents is determined by what economists call the &ldquo;higgling&rdquo; of the market, by the combination of supply and demand.  In ordinary times, it is always desirable to let economic conditions operate freely because if you do not do that, you are setting up a state of unstable equilibrium.  But we are not dealing with ordinary conditions. We are not dealing with conditions in which, if the rents are high, it is going to pay people to build houses to let and so bring down rents. We are dealing with a condition in which house property partakes to a certain degree of the nature of a monopoly.  There has been no building for some time.  There are frankly not enough houses to go round and the economic laws and the considerations of justice which apply are very much those which apply to a monopoly commodity. In other words, in the interests of the public, the landlord should not be allowed to make as much money or to get a rent so high as he could if there was no interference whatever.</P>
    <P>While admitting and endorsing that principle, it is necessary in the application of it to see that we do not go too far in some respects and not far enough in others.  It is right because of the shortage of houses that landlords should not be able to get as much money as they otherwise might, in fact that the landlord should come in for a few economic kicks but, of course, <Col N="1404" /> there is always the temptation to give the landlord a few more kicks while the kicking is good.  When we come to deal with this Bill, I think you will find that what I might call the non-1923 landlords have not been fairly treated.  On the other hand, I deprecate very much the absence of interference with what I regard as the biggest ramp of the whole lot, that is the utterly exorbitant prices which are, and under this Act can continue to be, exacted in respect of flats.</P>
    <P>It is a common thing for a house which is within the ambit of this Act to be let at, we will say, £50 a year, and for the person to whom it is let to expend perhaps a couple of hundred pounds on construction into two flats, for each of which he gets £100 a year, securing for himself a profit rental of about £150.  Speaking generally, a two- or three-roomed flat rents at rather more than what would be the rent of the whole house, if it was undivided into flats.  Perhaps that is a rather wide proposition; but in certain districts that state of affairs does exist. I shall propose for the Minister's consideration an amendment to the effect that where, after the passing of this Act, a house is divided into two or more self-contained flats, the tenant shall be enabled to go to the court in order to have the rent of those flats fixed, and that in fixing those rents the court shall have regard to the rent paid for the whole house, to the money expended in converting the house into flats, and to the comparison which can be made between the accommodation and the rent for that flat and the accommodation and rent of separate houses.  I do not see why that should not be introduced.  I do not think it will stop the conversion into flats. There is no reason why the court should not err upon the generous side in their desire to increase the number of flats.  I think such an amendment would go a long way to stop what I consider to be the extremely exorbitant rents which are demanded for flats.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I think the Bill is considerably too harsh upon the owners of houses which did not come within the 1923 Act but come within the limits of this Bill.  The rents of <Col N="1405" /> those houses are fixed at the rent which existed at 7th May, 1941.  First of all, rents have gone up very considerably since 1941.  I am not suggesting for one moment that those landlords should be given a free hand any more than the 1923-Act landlords were given a free hand, but as the 1923-Act people were given a percentage increase&mdash;not the full percentage; nothing like it&mdash;in respect of the rise in rents, I think it would be only fair that a percentage increase should be given in respect of the rise since 1941.  I would suggest that rents in the open market have probably risen by something like 50 per cent., and that the landlord should be given at least 10 per cent. automatic rise.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I would ask you to consider is the question of repairs. Remember that those landlords themselves have to live.  In many cases they may be civil servants who have retired, commuted their pension, invested it in house property, and have to live on it.  Their expenses have gone up.  Everything they have to buy has gone up.  Yet they are not allowed to make any commensurate increase in their rents.  But it is not only that. This Act puts very stringent repair obligations upon the landlords.  It has already been mentioned and I know it to be a fact, that the cost of repairs has gone up considerably.  Somebody mentioned 400 or 500 per cent.  I think that is probably excessive, but anyway it has gone up.  Therefore, the landlord who is under an obligation to repair, not only is not enabled to raise his rent so as to approximate it in some way to his own increased cost of living, but he is obliged to carry out repairs, the cost of which has gone up considerably; so he is very much worse off now than he was in 1941.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other matter which has already been mentioned, but I should like to give my own experience to back up what other speakers have said.  There is quite a number of cases which I have come across, in which landlords, who would have been entitled to raise the rent because they were <Col N="1406" /> outside the ambit of the 1923 Act, refrained from raising the rent, especially to old tenants.  I know a number of cases where tenants who were in there in 1914, even in yearly tenancies, did not have their rents raised.  Not only did they not have their rents raised to the unlimited extent to which the landlord could have raised them, as he was not controlled, but they did not have their rents raised even to the extent to which the rent of houses controlled under the 1923 Act could have been raised.  The curious position now is this: that whereas a landlord who is under the 1923 Act can get 20 per cent. on the 1914 rent, those landlords who were not under the 1923 Act but who would not raise the rent upon old tenants, even though they were utterly unencumbered, are not now in a position to raise the rents upon the new tenants even to the extent that the 1923 Act allowed.  That also seems to be unfair. Those are the only points I want to bring before the House.  I do think we should make an effort to extend it to flats, and I think we might make some modifications.</P>

      <P>I think most of the points that were raised were really Committee Stage points.  Senator Sweetman said that we had not implemented all the agreed recommendations of the tribunal. I can tell the Senator that we certainly considered every one of them, and that we have given effect to those to which we thought we could very well give effect.  We did not think it practicable, after full examination, to appoint the official recommended by the Report, to deal with what are now called Part III cases.  We thought, and I hope rightly, that by giving cheap access to the courts in the manner proposed under Part III we would overcome a lot of the difficulties experienced by poor tenants up to the present in having their cases dealt with.  A couple of Senators&mdash;I think Senator Ruane was one, and I am not sure whether Senator O'Reilly also referred to it&mdash;mentioned that we are paying all the expenses of the tenants.  What we are proposing to do is: where the landlord takes an appeal <Col N="1407" /> against the rent that the court fixes in a Part III case and brings the tenant into the Circuit Court, the judge may order the costs of the tenant to be paid out of State funds. I notice that in a circular which, I think, everybody has got from the Houseowners' Association, the same thing is said, but that is not correct. This only refers to the case of a poor tenant who avails of Part III and gets the rent fixed by the judge, and where that is appealed against by the landlord. It is only in that case that this would apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, perhaps not, but at any rate I am prepared to accept an amendment, such as was suggested by Senator Kingsmill Moore, in connection with these new flats.  Of course, the reason they were exempted is that they were created since 1941, and because of the extra costs involved.  The intention was to encourage people to continue making flats available and also to encourage builders to continue to build houses. I may say, in that connection, that it was brought very clearly, indeed, to my attention by builders and by those societies which have been building houses for rent, that if the emergency Order, which is now incorporated in the Bill, were to apply to houses built after 7th May, 1941, they would simply have to cease building.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard taken was that of 7th May, 1941.  That was the date of the standstill Order&mdash;I think it was Senator Duffy who referred to it as a standstill Order.  The Senator is right, in so far as rents and wages were concerned, in saying that the Government tried to stabilise what was considered an economic rent at the time, because I think it is a well-known fact that houses that were not subject to the 1923 control were being let at such a rent as the landlord was satisfied would give a reasonable return, and we all know that there was very keen competition for them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, I think that an adequate return was given to the landlord.  There may be cases of some benevolent people who did not charge that rent, but we cannot deal with these exceptional cases.  If they wished to do so, I suppose they could have got a higher rent, but we are satisfied that those who were setting non-controlled houses on that date were getting a fair return for their money.  Not only that, I am satisfied that, having regard to the experience of house owners, under the 1923 Act and earlier Rent Restriction Acts, they took into consideration also the possibility of this recurring in the future.  Perhaps not, but I have no doubt that that was the idea, and I am also satisfied that the fact that there was rent restriction during the last war had a bad effect on the building of houses for letting. People tried to sell their houses.  We are all well aware of that, but it could not be helped.  Some Senator went into the history of rent restrictions yesterday, but I think it will be realised that, in England, in the last <Col N="1410" /> war, there was such an influx of people into the cities and towns, where munition factories, and so on, had been set up, housing accommodation became so insufficient that any rent that was asked for had to be given. That situation had to be dealt with. I think it was about 1915 when rent restriction was brought in.  I resisted as long as I could the extension of rent control, but when Senator Duffy says that I am apologising in this Bill, I certainly am not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, I want to see as many houses built as can be built, and I subscribe to the idea that the people building those houses are public benefactors, that they are supplying something that is badly needed, and I do not look upon them as anything but people who are conferring a benefit on the community.  There was evidence, however, that on account of the scarcity of housing accommodation&mdash; the demand for houses and so on&mdash; people, undoubtedly, were being put out of their houses, if they were not prepared to pay increased rents.  There is no doubt about that, and on two or three occasions in the Dáil when I was asked to bring in this Order, I was not prepared to do so until I was satisfied that that was occurring.  I found that people with fixed incomes, such as civil servants and others, were being asked to pay exorbitant rents and, therefore, I advised the Government to bring in that Order, and one of the reasons for this Bill is to prolong that Order.  Everybody knows that the Government are anxious to get away from this matter of Emergency Orders as soon as they can, and this obtains in this particular case until this Bill is passed.  This particular Emergency Order will now be incorporated in the Bill, which has a limited life of five years, but if it were not there, and if the Emergency Powers Act is not passed next September or October, there will be the question of the control which applies to the non-1923 cases.  Consequently, it was thought necessary to bring in this Bill, and when it was thought necessary to bring it in, I did not see why we should have so many Rent Restriction Acts.  I thought it would be better to have them <Col N="1411" /> all in the one Act, and improve the position of the 1923 Act, especially by not making it necessary to produce evidence of what the rent was in 1914.  I also took advantage of the opportunity to bring in a new provision dealing with the poorer class of tenants.  Senator Duffy said the Bill was not as good as when it was introduced, because Part III was to apply then to all houses of £10 valuation or under.  I am satisfied that the Bill, as introduced, would bring in people who did not require the benefits that are being given to the very poor in Part III.  I refer to the type of person who can well afford to pay the legal expenses if they want to go to court.  They are not slum dwellers. Plenty of small houses are occupied by people in fairly comfortable circumstances, and they do not want the special conditions of the 1923 Act. These conditions were intended for the very poorer classes of the community. I asked the Dáil to agree to an amendment of that provision.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Iveagh Trust or the Artisans' Dwellings Company want.  Senator Foran seems to think that they want encouragement.  If they want to build new houses now, the Rent Restrictions Act does not apply to them.  There is nothing to stop them building if they can get the materials.  I suppose they are not going to charge exorbitant rents. They do not.  As the Bill stands, any house built after 7th May, 1941, is not subject to control.  I do not know what encouragement these bodies want.  On the Committee Stage in the Dáil I stated that I had not heard of any case where a clause existed which provided that adults only could live in some houses.  Since then I got one such case sent to me, and the advice I have been given is that such a provision could not be enforced.  In that case the person concerned left the house.  What I mean by saying that such a provision could not be enforced is, that the court would not enforce it.  If people leave a house or sell, that is their look-out.  I am satisfied that the advice I got from the Attorney-General is sound advice, that the provision would not be enforced if <Col N="1412" /> people wished to fight.  Of course, if they do not wish to fight the case, there is no obligation to do so.  It is their look out.  My advice is that if they want to fight they cannot be put out.  I know of no way in which we could force people to take in children if they do not want to do so.  They could make all sorts of excuses without putting that in the agreement.  I imagine that the number of agreements of that kind is very few.  I have no power to stop advertisements.  As far as I am informed, anybody who tried to put tenants out because there were children in the family would not be able to succeed.  Senator P.J. O'Reilly spoke about people sub-letting rooms. Such cases are covered.  The people concerned must not know the law.  All we can do is to pass Acts, and if people do not avail of the rights given them under these Acts, that is their business.  We cannot make them do it. If the Senator knows of any such case he should tell the people that they are fully protected.  I did not follow Senator O'Dea's point about statutory tenants not being able to sell houses.</P>

I went into the whole matter.  It is too difficult.  The Government went fully into it and decided that they would not bring in any legislation dealing <Col N="1413" /> with ground rents.  The question does not arise on this Bill although Senators are entitled to raise it.  An effort was made to raise it at the wrong stage in the other House, but I did not follow the Deputy who did so and evaded the question.  The matter was brought up here at the proper time and I might as well tell the House now that the Government, having gone carefully into all the implications, decided not to bring in any legislation dealing with ground rents.  It can be dealt with by a motion in the Dáil.  That is the Government's decision on the matter.</P>

      <P>The Seanad considers that in view of the large number of Irish citizens who have been working temporarily in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, especially during the past six years, the Government should renew their efforts either by direct approach to the British Government or through the machinery of the International Labour Organisation to secure the entitlement to unemployment insurance benefit of Irish citizens who may have unemployment insurance contributions to their credit in the Insurance Fund maintained in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>At this late hour, I shall not take up much of the time of the House in dealing with the question to which this motion is addressed.  The Parliamentary Secretary will observe that it is not submitted in any acrimonious spirit.  It is submitted primarily to secure from the Government a statement as to what is the position in regard to insurance benefits to persons who left Ireland temporarily during the past six years.  These people may, on their return to this country, find themselves without employment.  Of course, this question is not new.  It has been raised in one form or another over a period of 20 years.  In the main, previous discussions related to the position in Northern Ireland.  Clearly, the position of workers in Northern Ireland differs materially from that of our workers in Great Britain.  During the past six years, a large number of people left Ireland to work in Great Britain.</P>

    <P>In reply to a question in the Dáil on the 18th October last, the Minister for External Affairs stated that travelling permits were issued to, approximately, <Col N="1415" /> 193,000 persons to take up work in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Of that number, about 6,000 went to Northern Ireland.  That is a large figure but it does not cover the whole field of migration.  I can illustrate that by saying that, whereas we issued travelling permits to only 6,000 persons for the purpose of entering Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland authorities say that they issued residence permits to 20,000 persons, the great majority of whom are now being told that they must get out and come back here.</P>
    <P>So far as those who went to Great Britain are concerned, it is difficult to know what will happen.  Many of them believe they will be asked to return to Ireland.  I do not want to detain the House by quoting correspondence which I received from persons on the other side but the impression conveyed to me was that many of them, particularly those who are not skilled in any craft, will be repatriated in large numbers in the immediate future.  They will not be entitled to unemployment benefit, in most cases, on their return. On the other hand, they have contributions to their credit in Great Britain and of course, in Northern Ireland.  I have been trying to make a calculation as to the sum involved and I have come to the conclusion that, if you take the contributions paid by workers and the contributions paid on their behalf by employers, the sum involved would be not less than £3,000,000.  While that sum is to the credit of our people in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, they have no claim to it once they cease to be resident in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the question to any considerable extent beyond urging that we ought to give some indication to these people of what their position will be and what will be done for them when they return.  I desire to draw attention to a statement, published recently, indicating the attitude adopted by a number of persons in Great Britain, including a large number of the workers concerned.  This is contained in the London Letter of <Col N="1416" /> the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 28th November:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nearly 80 people, described as certain British Irish and Anglo-Irish citizens', are signatories to the memorial presented to the Prime Minister, requesting him to take steps to avert hardship on Irish men and women who would forfeit unemployment benefit rights when they returned to Eire.  The memorial points out that Irish men and women who entered the British armed services or engaged in civilian war work are believed greatly to exceed 300,000.  On demobilisation, they are entitled to full benefit under the United Kingdom unemployment insurance code.  If, however, they return to Eire, they forfeit these rights, which they became entitled to as a condition of their service and by reason of their own contributions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What affects me most in that connection is that the persons concerned, who are citizens, are being asked to turn to the British Government to protect their interests when they return home. Mainly for that purpose, I desired to have a very brief discussion here, so that we might ask them to turn their attention to this Government and this country to protect their interests. While I do not expect the Parliamentary Secretary to say much on the subject now, because I understand that discussions are proceeding between the different bodies concerned, I do hope he will be in a position to give an assurance to the 300,000 people concerned, who are our citizens, that their rights will be amply protected if they return here and find themselves unemployed. So far as the position in Northern Ireland is concerned, there is, in my opinion, a very strict legal right to secure an improvement in the conditions of our insured persons in the Six Counties.  This question was raised by Senator Campbell and myself at international labour conferences in the past.  We based our claim on the unemployment convention ratified by the British Government, on behalf of Northern Ireland, and by our own Government.  I shall read the relevant provision of that convention.  Article 3 <Col N="1417" /> of the Unemployment Convention of 1920, which was adopted in Washington that year, makes this provision, which is, I think, very important:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The members of the International Labour Organisation which ratified this convention and which have established systems of insurance against unemployment shall, upon terms being agreed upon between the members concerned, make arrangements whereby workers belonging to one member and working in the territory of another shall be entitled to the same rates of benefit of such insurance as those which obtain for the workers belonging to the latter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>While it is true that the agreement is observed, so far as the British Government are concerned with Irish workers in Britain, it is definitely not observed in relation, to our citizens working in the Six Counties.  There is a complete violation of that convention by the Government in that area.  In the constitution of the I.L.O., Article 411 confers on our Government certain rights to secure the enforcement of the convention so far as it applies to Northern Ireland.  I do not think they have utilised the provisions of that article of the I.L.O. constitution.  At least, so far as I am aware, the Government representatives who attended the conferences of the I.L.O. have not on one occasion intervened to assist those of us who desired to ensure that the I.L.O. would bring pressure to bear on the British Government to secure respect for the convention from the Government of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to detain the House any further on this question, but I hope to secure from the Parliamentary Secretary an assurance that the matter is receiving immediate attention and that advantage will be taken of the position, so far as I have referred to it, in relation to the workers in the Six Counties, and that an early effort will be made to secure agreement between the Governments concerned so that this very large sum of money lying to the credit of our workers in England and Northern Ireland will be made available to provide the benefits for these men to which they are entitled on their return to Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Grady)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must, first and foremost, assure the House that this matter has had the active consideration of the Government over a long period, and I would also like to state that in so far as this Government could do it, the interests of these workers have been protected.  Under the 1943 Act, their existing rights have, as you are aware, been protected, whenever they choose to return here within a certain period of time&mdash;I think it is 12 months after the termination of the emergency period.</P>
      <P>It would take too long to go into details and to outline the various steps taken over a long period of years, to try to bring about reconciliation in respect of this matter.  The Department has been in constant touch with the corresponding Departments across the Channel with a view to bringing about a settlement in this matter and at no time has the matter been allowed to rest.  On every conceivable occasion, steps have been taken to bring about a decision but, up to the present, they have not met with success.</P>
      <P>At the moment, there would seem to be better hope of reaching a settlement than in the past, for various reasons, which I need not enter into now, but which I think will be present in the minds of Senators.  The latest development, as possibly you are aware, is that the matter was raised by a Conservative member in the British House of Commons, who received a reply from the Prime Minister. This, I think, appeared in the daily Press of Tuesday last.  Mr. Attlee replied:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The matter is still under consideration, but it is hoped to reach a decision at a very early date.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That shows that the people on the other side are actively considering this matter, which, in my opinion, has been too long drawn out, but I can assure the House that the delay has not been of our making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every opportunity that presented itself was availed of and active steps have been pursued along these lines to the present moment, and will be continued, and it is hoped that in the near future we will be able to bring <Col N="1419" /> the matter to a successful conclusion. Everybody appreciates the position of these workers who, according to law, have been forced to make contributions for the past six years while their employers had also to make them.  The amounts to their credit would be considerable and it would, of course, be a grave injustice to them if they were, as a result of a change of residence, to be deprived of these benefits to which they are legally and morally entitled.</P>
    <P>On our side, we have gone as far as we could to protect their interests by the enactment of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1943.</P>

      <P>That is so.  It began in July, 1923, when they terminated the existing agreement without notice and instituted a clause requiring three years' residence.  Later on, that was extended to five years.  We are fully aware of that fact.</P>
