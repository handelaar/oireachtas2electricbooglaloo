    <Title>Irish Legal Terms Bill, 1945&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">

      <P>This Bill is intended to provide for the publication of Irish translations of legal terms and to guarantee that such translations will be accepted as having the same meaning, force and effect as the corresponding English terms.  The translations will be published by the Minister for Justice after consultation with an advisory committee.  The Bill provides also for the publication of Irish versions of legal forms and precedents in legal instruments.  At present there is a difficulty in the way of any extensive use of the Irish language for legal purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole of the law, with the exception of the Constitution, is contained in the English language only and numerous words and phrases used in the law have been given technical meanings, as distinct from the ordinary meanings, by statutes and judicial decisions.  It is necessary to have corresponding technical terms in Irish, in order that Irish may be used for legal purposes.  There is no difficulty about finding Irish translations for technical legal terms; but, on account of the very nature of technical terms, a dispute may arise as to whether any particular translation conveys the technical meaning assigned to the original English term. No doubt, if people used Irish extensively for legal purposes, a standard vocabulary of Irish technical legal terms would be established in course of time as a result of judicial <Col N="2380" /> decisions.  That process would take a very long time, however, and people are unlikely to use Irish extensively for legal purposes until an authoritative vocabulary of technical terms is available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill about which there ought not to be very much controversy, but I think it is preeminently a Bill about which there ought to have been consultation before it was drafted.  I am unable, however, to find if there was any such consultation. For example, I do not know if the Minister consulted any member of the judiciary, any district justice, any county registrar, or any Irish language specialist.  On the face of the Bill, I would think not, and the Bill itself, at first blush, appears to be trying to do something which, in fact, it could not do, although it may very well be that the way in which the Bill is worked will improve the situation. In fact, however, if you take the Bill on its face value, that is, that a committee&mdash;a rather extraordinary committee, it seems to me&mdash;is to sit down and frame Irish translations for English legal terms, that is a procedure that might take at least 20 years to accomplish anything, and even then it could only produce a very small result. Even if the committee could produce in that time proper Irish translations of legal terms, it would be still very difficult because, if anybody thinks that you can just take English words and translate them into Irish, thus getting the proper legal terms, it simply cannot be done.  In order to translate an English legal term into Irish, you would have to have the whole context before you, and there is no such thing as just taking English words and putting Irish words beside them and saying: &ldquo;This is the word to be used.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Quite properly, Section 3 of the Bill provides that&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;whenever the Minister makes a legal terms Order declaring that the equivalent in the Irish language of a specified term shall be the word or words specified in the Order, then the said word or words shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as having the same meaning <Col N="2381" /> as, and have the same force and effect as, the said specified term.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, no matter what kind of imprimatur the Minister gives to particular terms, the judges will still have the power to construe them as they please.  That is quite natural, and it would be fantastic if the Minister were to try any other scheme but that.  However, I think that is not the way in which it will be done, and I take it that it will not be, because there is already a very considerable body of translations of various Orders and legal enactments.  What, I take it, will be done is that the vocabulary of official terms hitherto used by the official Translators will be furnished to the committee, and they will be asked to go through it.  I take it that that is the intention because, if there is any other intention, it seems to me to be cracked.</P>
    <P>It will be appropriate in this connection to mention the work already done with regard to getting a legal terminology in the Irish language. It was very fortunate that, in 1922, when the Oireachtas was being set up, we had the services of the then Clerk of the Dáil, the late Colm O Murchadha.  He was a very accomplished Irish scholar; he was a man of tact, and a man who had the gift of being able to get others to work willingly with him.  He had scholarship, patience and thoroughness, and he also had what a great many scholars lack: a practical capacity to get particular things done.  Now, the translation of all Government documents was centralised in the Translation Department of the Oireachtas, in Leinster House, at that time, and a very determined effort was made to equip the translation staff with the very best people available.  Those who were transferred from the old Dáil were, without exception, Munstermen. The Munster man was prominent and dominant in Dublin at that time.  Through the instrumentality of the Professor of Irish in University College, Galway, a Connaught man, who has since been seconded to another Department, was got.  A Donegal man, a teacher in Dublin, <Col N="2382" /> was taken in in order to provide the Donegal dialect.  A number of other people like Liam O Rinn, who died recently, were taken in.  Although he was a Dublin man he had an extraordinary knowledge of Irish and a great experience of translation.</P>
    <P>The staff was further recruited for the Department in a manner which rent the heart of the Department of Finance.  Special steps were taken and special salaries offered.  Very early an officer of that translation staff was directed to prepare a vocabulary.  I take it that the vocabulary is still being prepared and I hope it will be made available.  It seems to me that before this Bill was offered to us, and certainly before this committee can go into action, that particular vocabulary should be available. The procedure was that a Bill was passed in English and was then translated into Irish.  The only exception is alleged to be the present Constitution. That, of course is humbug. The Constitution was framed in English and translated into Irish. The only competent body was not, in fact, the body that did it.  It was handed over to another body.  I do not exactly know who they were.  The document on the face of it shows that they were not always in agreement.  They produced what is a very unsatisfactory document.  Then the extraordinary step was taken of making the Irish, which is really a translation, and not a very good translation, the document which was valid in law.  When it was seen that the thing was not satisfactory, an effort was made to bring the translation staff to the rescue.  That did not prove completely satisfactory either.  Recently a new copy of the Constitution has been issued in Roman script with a new standard spelling.</P>
    <P>The success of this Bill will turn entirely upon how it is worked. I cannot believe that the Attorney-General could possibly entertain the view that you can put down a list of English terms and then go and put down a list of Irish terms instead of them.  You could not do that.  All you could do is to examine the translations over a period and adopt the <Col N="2383" /> terms in them.  If there are discrepancies, and there have been discrepancies, the committee can correct the discrepancies, but you must examine the terms in their full context.  You would have to put your imprimatur not on particular words but on whole texts.  At the present moment there is a law suit in progress which turns upon Irish words used in a contract drawn up in Irish.  Two specialists have already given evidence. I do not want to go into the merits of the case, but I want to indicate that the words that are causing all the trouble are not legal terms.  They are very common words and the question is, what do they mean when combined with a particular preposition?  You cannot possibly discuss words by themselves.  It seems to me all that can be done now is to take the work that has been done by the Translation Department, to put it before the committee, and to take steps to see whether it can be adopted and whether there are any discrepancies which would need correction. When that is done certain progress will have been made.</P>
    <P>As I am on this particular point now, and will not have an opportunity of dealing with it again, I may say that to those of us who read the Irish on the Order Papers there has been obviously in recent times tinkering with the spelling.  I am a tolerant person with regard to Irish spelling.  I am not particularly enthusiastic for a particular system, but I do feel that you ought to have a system, and if the official Translation Department is adopting a new system of spelling we ought to be told what it is.  A simplified system was adopted subsequent to 1922.  I do not know whether members of this House are aware that there are people who would be willing to go before a firing squad for the silent g in the middle of the Riaghaltas.  I am not one of them, far from it.  One of the things that happened in 1932 was that Riaghaltas was spelt with a g and the change-over of Government was indicated by putting in the g and a number of silent d's.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one change. I do not wish to go into the Constitution except on the linguistic side. The Constitution was framed without anybody being in charge of it as somebody was in charge of the Official Translation Staff; therefore, it varies in the terms and so on.  These I feel are the only lines on which this Bill could work.  Even if it does work it will still leave you in the position that, to know what the Irish form of the word means, you must have a legal decision.  I do not believe that people who are enthusiastic for the language should be allowed to labour under the delusion that a Parliamentary decision can establish the meaning of a word.  One of the things we have been doing since 1922, when we first had a Parliament of our own, is that we have been trying to make Parliament do things it cannot do. People like Senator Kingsmill Moore and Senator Ryan make quite a good living interpreting English terms that have been used for hundreds of years. The meaning causes disputes in the courts and it takes trained lawyers to find out precisely what they mean. Another point I want to make is a committee point.  I think the Minister in Section 2 restricts himself far too much with regard to his committee. He has on the committee a judge of the Supreme or High Court.  The trouble about the judiciary is that the higher you go the less Irish you find.  There are some excellent district justices, and a couple of Circuit Court judges who have very good Irish, but when you go beyond that I do not know where you are going to get much Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this committee the Minister has a judge of the Supreme Court or High Court, a judge of the Circuit Court, a district justice, a practising barrister, a practising solicitor, a member of the translation staff and one other person. I think the Minister is very foolish to restrict himself.  This should be a person or persons nominated by the Government.  This is not a political committee.  It does not matter what <Col N="2385" /> representation Fine Gael or Labour get on it.  There are no jobs given out and no money distributed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, even if there is a job the Minister will find it very difficult to get a satisfactory member to act when you come to the persons other than judges practising barristers or solicitors.  I can suggest one person but possibly he would not act.  There is one well-known professor in University College, Dublin, with a very good knowledge of modern Irish and an excellent knowledge of ancient Irish, and I do not think there is any other person living with a better knowledge of old Irish law generally.  He is an obvious person, but he may not act.  Why should the Minister be restricted?  I think that the Minister should put himself in the position in which he could have one paid person and could nominate more.  That would be a solution.  He might choose one person to do the work and another person to give advice, but that is a point I will argue in committee.  In the meantime I only want to say one other thing.  I do not understand how this can be done in the absence of the publication of the vocabulary prepared in the Translation Department.  I do not know any other way the committee could work except by taking the words in the Irish texts in a Bill.  If a committee of this kind had been established in 1922 no legal documents would ever have been translated into Irish.  That is to say <Col N="2386" /> this kind of committee never gets work of this nature done.  What happened in 1922 was that the job was done in the Civil Service with greater speed, greater satisfaction and greater accuracy.  The time may now be ripe to look back on that work, but this committee can only be a revisionary committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have much pleasure in supporting this Bill.  I think it is a pioneer effort to implement the Constitution so far as the use of the Irish language in the courts is concerned. I think it is really the first serious effort that has been made to put the Irish language on a secure foundation so far as the courts are concerned.  Up to the present we have had a number of members of the legal profession who assumed a knowledge of Irish in legal matters, but there was no person who had the authority to say whether these people's use of the Irish language in connection with legal terms was right or wrong.  In fact, I believe that a number of, I will not say, language adventurers, but a number of people who to other views seem very shallow people indeed, are able to impress the public by their knowledge of the Irish language but, in fact, that knowledge in the opinion of the people who know, is very shallow indeed.  This Bill will put an end to such adventure in the realms of the Irish language so far as the law courts are concerned, because the first part of it deals with the provision of standard equivalents to legal terms in the Irish language.  I take it that there are several reasons why standard equivalents are necessary. Apart altogether from the several dialects in the different parts, there may be a number of people in the legal world who have their own views as to the translation of legal terms and, therefore, the making of an Order by the Minister will make a term binding so far as the Irish language is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was told some time ago of a person with a knowledge of the Irish language who was asked to translate the word &ldquo;prescription&rdquo;, meaning the legal doctrine of prescription, which goes back to the time of Richard I.  I was told by a very well-informed professor, who was well known for his knowledge of the Irish language, that the translation given was the translation of the word &ldquo;prescription&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;prepared by a chemist&rdquo;.  It shows that the person really took the word &ldquo;prescription&rdquo; out of a dictionary, the word meaning &ldquo;a chemist preparation&rdquo;, and applied it to the law.  This will, at least, put an end to this type of translation.  The advisory committee will really have very little to do, because Section 3, sub-section (1), provides that the Minister, by Order, may, whenever he so thinks proper, declare that the equivalent in the Irish language of any specified term shall be such word or words as he thinks fit and specifies in the Order.  Sub-section (2) provides, with reference to the advisory committee, that even having had a report from the committee, he may well adhere to his original Order, because he has discretion in the matter.  The preparation of these standard equivalents will be largely in the hands of a member of the Oireachtas translation staff, nominated from time to time as the occasion requires by the Government, and by a person nominated from time to time as the occasion requires by the Government in accordance with Section 2, sub-section (2) (g).  I would like to see a person having legal experience nominated by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Bill as it stands, the Government could appoint a person who had no knowledge of law whatever. That person would be one of the joint secretaries of the committee as provided in Section 3 (2) and would assist the Minister in the preparation of the legal terms, so that, so far as the Bill goes, it is open to the Government to appoint a non-legal person to prepare the standard equivalents of legal terms in the Irish language.  I think that that requires some amendment. If the Minister intends to <Col N="2388" /> appoint a person having legal qualifications under Section 2 (1) (g), I think it should be set forth in the Bill, because he is a person who will be nominated from time to time, as occasion requires, by the Government. When this matter is fresh in the minds of everybody, it may be taken for granted that the person appointed will have legal qualifications, but that person may go to the High Court or Supreme Court.  If he is nominated under Section 2 (1) (g), he may become a judge, and it will be necessary to appoint somebody else in his place. Therefore, that provision would require some amendment.  In Section 3 (1) the Minister is empowered to declare, by Order, the equivalent in the Irish language of any specified term.  That might mean a medical term or an engineering term or any other term.  I think that the word &ldquo;legal&rdquo; should be put before the word &ldquo;term&rdquo;.  However, these are matters which can be dealt with in Committee.  I welcome the first part of the Bill, because it will, so to speak, standardise the Irish language for the purpose of its use in the courts and in legal forms.</P>
    <P>The publication of legal forms and precedents in the Irish language is dealt with in only one section&mdash;Section 4.  It is left very much at large, and rightly so.  I suggest that the Minister, who is the sole authority in the matter, should have regard to the existing forms and precedents in the English language.  I have no doubt that he will have such regard, so that there will be no disparity between the two versions.  I think that this is an excellent idea and, as the Minister said in the Dáil, the preparation of these forms and precedents is long overdue.  We are now only at the beginning of the work.</P>
    <P>The Minister will, no doubt, implement this Bill at a later stage by bringing in legislation to arrange for the provision of legal textbooks in the Irish language.  At present, notwithstanding all the talk about Irish in the courts&mdash;I think that I said this five or six years ago before the Law Society&mdash; and notwithstanding that our statutes have been translated into Irish from the beginnings of the State, not a single legal textbook in the Irish language is <Col N="2389" /> available.  I ask those who are talking about Irish in the courts to remain silent until we have those standard equivalents, those forms and precedents and those legal textbooks in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>A great many people are talking about the want of Irish in the courts who know nothing whatever about the difficulty of using the Irish language in legal work.  They forget that the law which we took over from the British is the common law.  All legal forms, so far as the common law is concerned, have at all times been in the English language.  The Brehon laws ceased to function about the year 1607, when English law became, so to speak, a fixture.  Since then, the law has always been administered in the English language.  Now, we are trying to fight back.  We have a long road to travel and there will be many difficulties which some people do not foresee. If we had a code in this country, that code could be translated into Irish, as the Code Napoleon is in French, as the code of Quebec is in French, and as the codes of other countries are in their own languages. Here, we are trying to operate a system of law which is not our own, which was forced upon us at first and which we have taken over.  The difficulty will be to reconcile the language of that foreign law with our own native language which we are trying to revive. Therefore I say that the work before the people of this country in the setting up of a thoroughly Irish system is very great indeed.  This is only the merest beginning.  I wish it every success and I trust that the Minister will lose no time in operating this Bill and in making all the Orders he can possibly make so far as the revision of standard equivalents of legal terms are concerned.  I trust that he will also get to work regarding the forms and precedents, so that he may reach the stage at which he will be able, with the financial assistance which the State will no doubt give, to supply lawyers and the public with legal textbooks in the Irish language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ryan that it is a desirable matter that standard equivalents should be dealt with as soon as possible, and I think that perhaps the Minister has approached the subject in the only practical way in which it can be approached. I have some doubt, how ever, as to what the effect is going to be on the ordinary person who is obliged to have recourse to the courts even without much legal assistance.  I notice that in referring to the Bill in the Dáil the Minister used alternatively the expressions &ldquo;legal terms&rdquo; and &ldquo;legal phrases.&rdquo;  I take it&mdash;I am now guided by the lawyers&mdash;that what we are dealing with are legal terms, not legal phrases which I assume would mean something different.  In that connection I am at a disadvantage inasmuch as I am neither a lawyer nor a professor, nor have I the qualifications to discuss this matter in the manner in which it has been discussed up to the present.  I think, however, there is a number of legal terms in use in the legislation of this country, legislation enacted by ourselves which are not English terms.  I remember we <Col N="2391" /> had an argument on the Transport Bill about the use of the expression <i>ipso facto.</i>  I remember Senator Sir John Keane protesting against the use of these words, but the Minister was adamant, and the House retained the expression <i>ipso facto.</i>  If it is necessary to retain words foreign to the language in a Bill; I do not see what is the point of endeavouring to get Irish equivalents for English phrases when you will not accept English equivalents for Latin phrases.</P>
      <P>Nobody has pointed out what is aimed at.  Nobody has told us what is meant by legal terms.  I do not know what is meant by legal terms, and apparently it has not been thought necessary to say what they are.  One phrase frequently met with in legislation is &ldquo;<i>Mutatis mutandis.</i>&rdquo;  Is that a phrase for which you desire to have an Irish equivalent?  These are the points that occur to me in connection with this Bill.  I should like to say that from the point of view of the plain man who cannot afford the services of expensive lawyers to guide him through the maze of legislation it is of tremendous importance how a matter of this kind should be approached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember reading many years ago that when the Workmen's Compensation Act was being introduced in 1906 the British Minister in charge of the measure pointed out that this was legislation intended for the benefit and the betterment of the plain people and that therefore he was going to avoid the use of legal terms and keep to plain English words.  What was the result?  The opening sentence of the Act, if I remember correctly, runs something like this: &ldquo;Every person injured in an accident arising out of, and in the course of, his employment shall be entitled to compensation under the provisions of this Act&rdquo;.  I think I am correct in saying that that sentence has carried litigants to the House of Lords on at least 140 different occasions.  Of course it is not the plain man who has gone there.  It is the wealthy corporations and the trade unions.  If a man is a member of a trade union which has plenty of <Col N="2392" /> money he can rely on his union, if necessary, to take his case to the House of Lords or to the Supreme Court for an interpretation of the words, but the ordinary Pat Murphy who may be cutting oats next autumn, whose leg or arm is cut off by a machine, and who is not a member of a trade union, cannot go to the Supreme Court for an interpretation of the words &ldquo;arising out of and in the course of his employment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, I remember years ago having pointed out to me how much one could change the meaning of a simple phrase by the judicious use of punctuation marks.  The story was told in that connection of an inspector who paid an unexpected visit to a primary school.  The teacher was not expecting this gentleman's visit on the day in question and would prefer if the inspector were somewhere else.  He passed a comment on the matter to a junior teacher in the school and the inspector overheard the remark.  The acoustics of the school must have been something like the acoustics of this House.</P>

In any event the inspector heard the teacher say to a subordinate: &ldquo;What brings that fool here to-day?&rdquo;  Later the inspector asked one of the boys to write a sentence on the blackboard, and the sentence was: &ldquo;The teacher called the inspector a fool.&rdquo;  After it had been written, the inspector asked the boy to punctuate it and the boy did so by inserting two commas, one after the word &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; and another after the word &ldquo;inspector&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I imagine that we are dealing here with a subject which can be altered to the disadvantage of the ordinary layman unless we are careful.  I have said that I do not know what is intended because we have not been told what is meant by the use of the expression &ldquo;legal terms&rdquo;.  Therefore I am not in a position to say whether what the Minister aims at will be a good thing or a bad thing for the plain people who are bound in their own interests and for their own protection to have <Col N="2393" /> recourse from time to time to the law courts, but I am drawing the Minister's attention to some of the snags which he may come up against.  As he is not a lawyer himself, I have no doubt he will appreciate the need for having regard to the layman's interest when terms in the Irish language are being substituted for terms in common use in documents, in statutes, and in regulations. I am one of those who long ago faced the fact that we are bound to move in the direction of having all our work done eventually, and I think perhaps at an early date, in our own language.  I think it is a foolish thing for people to set themselves against it and say: &ldquo;No; by one dodge or another we will avoid that issue.&rdquo;  I do not like that attitude and I do not subscribe to it, but I should prefer that in aiming at that goal we would adopt, or shall I say invent, terms and expressions of our own, common to the language, rather than take up expressions which, used in another language, have a variety of meanings.</P>
    <P>I remember seeing a comment recently on a word that is commonly used in legislation even by ourselves&mdash; the word &ldquo;virtue&rdquo;.  It was pointed out by an authority on the English language that that word is entirely misused. We say that &ldquo;the Minister by virtue of the powers conferred upon him by this Act&rdquo; shall do so and so. The authority I have been reading says that the word should be &ldquo;consideration&rdquo;; that the word &ldquo;virtue&rdquo; means in that connection &ldquo;force&rdquo;, which is entirely foreign to the proper use of the expression.  I would, therefore, urge the Minister that the best approach to the matter he has in mind is to devise regulations, statutes, and forms of contract, entirely in the Irish language, rather than adopt phrases used elsewhere.  I believe there is some difficulty&mdash;I am not an Irish scholar; therefore, I do not profess to speak with authority&mdash;in getting equivalents in the Irish language.  For instance, it has been brought to my attention that there is a very considerable difference in meaning between the Irish and the English versions of the Constitution, in Article XII. According to the English version, a candidate for the Presidency must be <Col N="2394" /> 35 years of age.  According to the Irish version, if he is 34 years and one day he qualifies.</P>

      <P>We know that there have been difficulties in the law courts in considering wills and contracts by reason of the different expressions that may be used in those documents, and we also know that certain English words have got certain meanings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, when a person is drawing a deed or conveyance in English the words used are that the vendor or assignor assigns or conveys as &ldquo;beneficial owner&rdquo;.  The words &ldquo;beneficial owner&rdquo; mean that the person assigning guarantees that he has a perfect title to the land or <Col N="2395" /> house he is assigning.  He guarantees that if anything further is necessary to be done to verify his title, he will do so, and he guarantees that the land or house as the case may be is free from mortgages, charges, incumbrances, or things of that kind.  So that, by putting in those two words, you save all that terminology, and that, in itself, is a great advantage in drawing these conveyances or deeds.  Now, if you are drawing such a conveyance or deed in Irish, in the absence of some such phrase as that, covering the matter, you will have a very long deed or conveyance, because you must put in those four extra clauses, and that would make Irish deeds rather unpopular with the people who have to draw them or read them.  It is very necessary, therefore, that we should have equivalent clauses in Irish that would have the same meaning as the English words.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy referred to the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1906. It is true that that was drawn in the belief that it could be construed readily by any layman and that lawyers would be unnecessary, but as he says, at the very start, some of the phrases used there were the cause of numerous cases being brought to the House of Lords.  For instance, the words &ldquo;arising out of&rdquo; gave rise to a very large number of cases, many of which were contradictory cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Were there not also cases brought as to the interpretation of the word &ldquo;workman&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there were, but the words &ldquo;arising out of&rdquo; were the cause of very many more cases being brought.  I heard of one case where a man working on the road was struck by lightning, and brought a case to the courts, but it was held that the accident did not arise out of his employment, and he lost his case, whereas, in another case, a man who was working on a high pole was struck by lightning, and in that case it was held that he did come within the meaning of the Act, the idea being that, in the latter case, his work brought him within <Col N="2396" /> the danger zone.  All these words and phrases have now been defined, and we have taken them over, and I think it would be well if we could have, in Irish, an equivalent meaning, so as not to have to go all over the same thing again.  For that reason I welcome this Bill, and I think it will be welcomed all around.  As I have said, so far as Galway is concerned, most of the court work in Spiddal and other places is done entirely through Irish, and very often not a word of English would be heard in these courts.  All the summonses are issued by the Civic Guards in Irish, in Con nemara and Spiddal.  Sometimes, however, they are issued by different people, and that may create a difficulty in getting the meaning of the summons, because of the different ways in which it is issued.  If we had certain definite meanings assigned to different words and phrases we would have uniformity in the issuing of these summonses, which would make things much easier all around, for the lawyers, the Circuit Court judges, and everybody concerned.  From that point of view alone, I think that the Bill is very important, and I am sure that it will do a great deal of good.  I think it was Senator Hayes who mentioned that there were different dialects.</P>

      <P>Well, if there is any thing that would tend to help to unify the Irish language, it would be a Bill of this nature.  There was a time in France when there were so many different dialects that it was very hard to know which language or dialect would predominate, and I think it was in the reign of Henry IV of France that they finally adopted the language of the <i>Ile de France.</i>  Accordingly, a Bill of this kind which would provide us with standard terms should have a great effect in doing away with any differences in regard to dialect.</P>

      <P>Although the suggestion I am tempted to make has no direct connection with the Bill we are considering, I hope, A Chathaoírligh, you will not call me to order for venturing on it.  It was suggested by Senator Hayes's mention of a certain professor of the National University, who combines a unique knowledge of Roman and common law with an expert knowledge of Old Irish.  Why should the professor not be put at the head of a commission for the publication of a proper version of the Brehon Laws?  As we all know, the version with which we are familiar was produced at a time when Irish scholarship had not reached the level it has attained to-day.  It is, therefore, defective in many respects, and the translation is, too often, guesswork.</P>
      <P>If we had a proper version of the Old Irish laws, those charged by the present Bill with the framing of proper legal terminology would have a regular mine from which to quarry satisfying legal terms.  This fact was impressed on me by the example of the late Professor Tomás O Maille&mdash; beannacht Dé ar a anam&mdash;whose marvellous knowledge of Old Irish&mdash;and the native Irish point of view, which was hereditary with him&mdash;made his contributions to modern phraseology of vital importance, because they all had the ring of the genuine metal.</P>
      <P>I ambition for the National University the honour of giving us the desired version of the Old Irish laws&mdash; and with the professor already referred to, whose qualifications for the task are self-evident, I should like to see associated Senator Hayes himself, for no one has a more scholarly knowledge of the Irish language, while his long experience of the framing of Bills in Irish since the inauguration of this State gives him special authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it might be said that Senator Hayes would not be of much use on the Brehon Laws, but apart from that the most knowledgeable man on that subject is at present engaged on it.  This is not a subject on which you could gain knowledge in the street, so to speak, and I think it is a question of considerable doubt whether information could be got in <Col N="2398" /> that way on the framing of legal terms in Irish, even if you had a good edition of the Brehon Laws.  At least, so I am told.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the case made by Senators O'Dea and Ryan was much better than any case I could make, because both are men of practical experience in the courts.  The fact is, however, that, as Senator Ryan stated, this is a mere beginning.  A Deputy in the other House referred to this Bill as a fraud, and all the rest of it, and I think we all know who he was.  This Bill, like every other human instrument, may prove to be defective, but it is a genuine effort to help people who want to do their work in the courts through the medium of Irish.  Already, as Senator O'Dea pointed out, a great deal of work in the courts is done through Irish, particularly in the West of Ireland, but there is a great amount of difference in the phrases used, and the purpose of this Bill is to leave beyond all doubt the meaning of legal terms which have already been decided so far as the English language is concerned. I agree that it would be impossible to say what any particular court would agree upon as to the meaning of a particular word, whether in Irish or English.  All we are trying to do is to catch up on the English words that have already been defined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to join with what Senator Hayes has said about the late Clerk of the Dáil, Colm Ua Murchadha. I knew him, personally, and was aware of the great work he did.  He laid the foundation in this matter of the Irish translation of the various Acts passing through the House, and I think we cannot do better than to avail of the services of some member of the translation staff in giving us the proper legal terms in Irish.  What I think will take place is that terms that are already there in the Acts will be drawn up, and the intention is to have a person with a legal knowledge as well as a good knowledge of Irish appointed to assist the secretary.  They will be like joint secretaries and between them they will draw up a list of legal terms and present them in due course to the committee.  I take it also that representatives of the judges, and <Col N="2399" /> others acquainted with court procedure, will be there to see that the thing is carried out in a proper legal way.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, this Bill will do a lot of good.  There will be, of course, imperfections in it just as in the case of other Bills, and, if so, we shall have to come back and try to improve it.  With regard to the question of the number that should be on the committee, no Minister likes to have his hands tied, but we thought that seven would be a good committee. As a matter of fact, I think there are fairly good Irish speakers amongst the judges.  I am fairly sure that there are at least two good Irish speakers in the Circuit Court.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 3, Section 2, lines 35 and 36, to delete the words &ldquo;either or <Col N="2400" /> both of the Governing Bodies&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;a Governing Body&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment arises out of a discussion during the Committee Stage regarding the definition given to the expression &ldquo;a governing body&rdquo;.  It will be observed that on page 4 &ldquo;governing body&rdquo; means any body being (a) the Irish Turf Club or (b) the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee. Strange as it may appear when we come to deal with other aspects of the measure in which specific definitions are given, we find that instead of using the title &ldquo;governing body&rdquo; which has been defined to mean either one of two bodies, the expression defined on page 3 is &ldquo;governing bodies&rdquo;.  In relation to racecourses the expression &ldquo;authorised racecourse&rdquo; means a racecourse at which race meetings are held with the sanction of either or both of the governing bodies.  That appears to me to be completely inconsistent with the subsequent provision dealing with the definition of &ldquo;a governing body&rdquo;.  The matter arises again, as I pointed out yesterday, in a later section.  There are two courses before the Minister, either to continue to use the expression &ldquo;governing body&rdquo; to which he has given a meaning or not to define it at all.  The only two occasions on which, as far as I can remember, the expression is used, is in the definition section and another section.  That it should be used in that manner surprises me.  I think it is wrong.  I suggest to the Minister that the definition is wrong and that the one I am suggesting here is reasonable.  I am suggesting that the definition should be read like this: &ldquo;The expression authorised racecourse means a racecourse at which race meetings are held with the sanction of the governing body&rdquo;.  As a matter of fact the present phrasing seems to me, apart from every other objection, to be meaningless. What is meant by &ldquo;either or both of the governing bodies&rdquo;?  What is implied is that in order that a racecourse may be authorised, the sanction of the governing body that controls the events over that course is wanted.  I believe that if the Minister reads the <Col N="2401" /> section as I propose to amend it he will agree that it is less obscure than the phrasing of the Bill and gives him the definition that he requires.</P>

    <P>This amendment arises out of a matter which was raised on the first amendment.  Again, I am perfectly satisfied that the phrasing here is incorrect. I consulted a member of this House last evening, who happens to be a very active practising lawyer, and he confirmed my view that this draft is incorrect, and that it is necessary and proper to make the amendment I suggest.  I agree that the Minister, like myself, is at a disadvantage.  He takes the views of his officials.  On this point I want to make one emphatic protest.  It has been my experience that in many Departments officials cling to something which they <Col N="2404" /> know to be wrong, just because they did not do it in the first instance.  I discussed with an official of a Department some years ago certain amendments which were proposed to a particular Bill.  He told me that in his opinion the amendments should be accepted, but that it was not proper for officials to point out to a Minister that an amendment suggested by others should be accepted, because the Minister or Ministers usually asked why, if those people could see it, the officials could not see it.  And so an error is allowed to remain.  I had the experience of asking a member of this House to move an amendment to a Bill some years ago, and the Minister pointed out that he could not accept the amendment, and gave his reasons. But within six months the same Minister came to the House with an amending Bill to give effect to the proposals which he was so emphatic in resisting.  I urge on the Minister to use his own judgment, and to ask himself a straight question&mdash;whether this looks better than the original draft and not to take the view of the drafts men or officials who have drafted it, whether it was right or wrong.  Of course, the Minister will have been translated to another sphere, and someone else, perhaps, will come into the House asking for a new Bill, and saying that it was due to an oversight when the measure was originally before the Oireachtas.  It is pathetic that this should happen, and I am perfectly convinced that it has happened, because the people responsible for the drafting of a Bill refused to admit they made a mistake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It may, I think, happen that both the draftsman and the Senator may be wrong.  It could happen because in this particular case it appears that the people responsible are not really the governing body, but the stewards who are appointed by the governing body.  Rule 17 of the Rules of Racing sets out the powers of the Stewards.  It reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Stewards of the Turf Club have full power to sanction or prohibit any meeting to which these rules apply: to grant and to withdraw <Col N="2405" /> licences of officials, trainers, jockeys, and racecourses, to grant and to withdraw permission to ride to gentlemen riders, to approve of the dates on which all meetings shall be held; to make inquiry into and deal with any matter relating to racing, and to warn any person off the Turf Club lands of the Curragh&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Considering this rule and the powers given there it is quite possible that it is the stewards should be there and not the governing body.  But the draftsman insists that he is right.  He is not exactly of the type that Senator Duffy suggests.  The Senator may, of course, be correct in his references to some officials who are afraid to admit mistakes.  I am not afraid to admit a mistake.  I committed many of them in my time, both as a Minister and an ordinary individual and I suppose I will go on committing them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under sub-section (2) of this section, a mental hospital authority <Col N="2406" /> is required to keep affixed in a conspicuous position a list of names of the officers and servants employed in the institution whose names are entered in the register maintained under this section.  I was wondering whether, as a matter of practice, it will be convenient to have a list of that kind maintained in a conspicuous position in an institution.  I imagine that the number of persons in Grangegorman or Portrane to whom the section would apply would be very considerable. I have no objection to the list being kept in a conspicuous place.</P>
      <P>The question is whether it would not be better to make an arrangement whereby the list would be available in convenient form for anybody who wished to see it.  It might be better if the Parliamentary Secretary would consider placing an obligation on the committee to conform to any regulations he may make in regard to that matter.  In the case of a smaller institution, where the number of persons employed would not be great, it might be convenient to have the whole list exhibited in a particular place, but, if the list is very large, I can see difficulties in doing that.  I notice that, in certain factories where the proprietor is required to keep exhibited extracts from certain Acts of Parliament, these extracts are not exhibited in such a manner as to convey any meaning to anybody.  The type is very small, and the abstract is in a frame, hanging high on a wall, where nobody could read it.  I want to avoid that in this case.  The intention is that the persons interested shall have access to the list or document, so that they will know what names are inscribed on it. Having regard to the practical difficulties, I suggest that it might be better to have the names entered on a register which would be available to everybody interested.</P>

It ought to be possible to have a list of the registered officers exhibited in a convenient. place in the institution, where any interested officer can scrutinise it, so as to ensure that his name appears on it.  It is rather important that <Col N="2407" /> officers and servants should have every facility to assure themselves that they are registered.  In the event of an officer or servant not being registered by a mental hospital authority, and claiming that he ought to be so registered, the Bill provides for appeal to the Minister.  I realise that Senator Duffy is concerned only with simplifying the machinery, but if we simplify it too much, it may have the effect of depriving an officer or servant of the fullest facility for ascertaining whether he is or is not registered.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), page 29, line 41, to delete the word &ldquo;one-eightieth&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;two-eightieths&rdquo;; and to delete subparagraph (ii) in paragraph (a), lines 44, 45 and 46.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment and the amendment which follows deal with the same type of person but they cover separate groups.  This section provides for the payment of pensions to registered officers and servants who are incapacitated. The effective provision is sub-section (2), which states that an officer or servant of a mental hospital authority to whom the section applies who ceases to hold office or employment on account of having sustained or contracted physical or mental injury, otherwise than through his own misconduct, <Col N="2408" /> will be entitled to certain compensation provided that the appropriate medical officer certifies that his incapacity is permanent in so far as it incapacitates him from taking care of patients.  The compensation provided is a life pension of one-eightieth of his annual salary and emoluments, plus a lump sum calculated at the rate of one-thirtieth of his yearly salary or wages in respect of each completed year of service.  The persons concerned will be what might be described as short-term employees&mdash;those who are less than 55 years of age and who have less than 20 years of service with the institution.  Had they 20 years' service and attained the age of 55, compensation would be a pension at the rate of two-eightieths of the yearly salary in respect of each completed year of service and a lump sum in addition.  The persons concerned will be comparatively young.  They will be incapacitated in respect of the work they are employed to do.  They may be mentally affected.  It is not uncommon to find that people engaged in mental institutions themselves become mentally affected under certain conditions.</P>
    <P>I feel in that case it is a mistake to pay a lump sum and that it is a far better plan to pay the maximum which in reason one would suggest by way of an annual allowance.  Take the particular case I have in mind, a person who has, let us say, 12 years' service. That person may be 32, 33 or 35 years of age, but he is no longer capable of performing the work on which he was employed.  He retired within the meaning of, and under the conditions prescribed in, this section.  Assuming his salary and emoluments were £120 a year he would be entitled to a lump sum under the section of I think £48, and to an annual payment of £18&mdash; a shilling a day.  What I am proposing here in respect of that kind of case, the person with a short service, is that no lump sum would be paid, but that instead the annual pension would be increased so that taking the case I have given as an illustration, the person of 12 years' service receiving £120 a year and retiring permanently incapacitated, would retire with a pension of £36 a year or approximately 2/- <Col N="2409" /> a day and there would be no lump sum whatever.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear to the Parliamentary Secretary that in this case I am not representing any interests whatever.  It is not my function.  There are people, members of this House, who have the function of representing interests in that regard.  The fact that they do not think it necessary to attend to make these representations does not concern me.  I am making this case as a citizen who takes a particular view as to the conditions which should prevail when people retire from their employment. I agree that the principle of the Bill should be that when a person comes to the full retiring age&mdash;in one case here it would be 60 years of age and in another 55&mdash;after they have served a long term, that they should get a lump sum and that they should get a pension.  I think on the whole, the proposals in the Bill, which approximate very closely to those applied in the Civil Service, are reasonable, but I am putting up what is my own view in regard to short-term employees, people who retire, let us say, under 40 years of age.  In my view it is better that they should get a reasonably good pension than they should get a small pension, plus a lump sum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Duffy made it very clear that the viewpoint he has expressed is his own view.  I should like to make it clear that the fullest consideration has been given to the financial framework of the pensions scheme incorporated in the Bill and that the fullest consultation has taken place with the interests concerned.  I do not suggest that every employee in the mental hospital service is satisfied that the scheme under which a certain annual allowance will be provided, plus a lump sum, is a better scheme than a larger annual allowance without any lump sum.  Clearly if we were to adopt the plan of giving an annual allowance without any lump sum, we could give a larger annual allowance than we can give if a lump sum is to accompany that annual allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Duffy has suggested that in the case of certain registered officers retiring owing to ill-health who have <Col N="2410" /> less than 20 years' service, we should abandon the lump sum idea.  Certain people may agree with him, but from the amount of consideration I have given to the matter, and the amount of consultation I have had, I am satisfied that the majority of the employees at any rate would prefer an annual allowance, plus a lump sum.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, Senator Duffy's plan would not work out equitably.  It would upset the entire relationship of the finances of the pension scheme.  If we were to abandon the lump sum and give an annual allowance at the rate of 2/80ths a year for each year of service under 20, you would find that an employee with 19 years' service would get 38/80ths of an annual allowance. When we turn to the person with 20 years' service, we find that under the scheme in the Bill, the man with 20 years' service receives an annual allowance of 20/80ths plus 20/30ths of a lump sum.  In this whole matter of the value of the lump sum, the persons concerned have to take a certain amount of risk.  If the employee who receives a lump sum lives for a very long time, he probably would have fared better if he did not get a lump sum, and if he had got a larger allowance, but should he die within a short time of retiring, the lump sum will go to the benefit of his dependents.  That, at least, would be saved out of the social wreck caused by his death.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There is one other consideration of vital importance in relation to this matter to which Senator Duffy has not adverted.  That is that in Section 71 of the Bill, provision is made for an addition of years if a person retires permanently incapacitated, so that we can in fact within the limits laid down in the Bill, a ten years' limit, add years to his service. Suppose a person retires after nine years' service, under the terms of the Bill that person, if permanently incapacitated, can receive a pension and a lump sum calculated at the rate of 18 years, not at the rate of nine, as suggested by Senator Duffy.  The same <Col N="2411" /> applies, of course, to the higher rates of service.  Under 20 years, the maximum addition would be ten years, so that a person with 18 years of service who becomes permanently incapacitated can be pensioned as having 28 years' service.  That is coming up very closely to full pension.  Full pension can be acquired after 30 years' service, and the full pension and lump sum payment after 33 years' service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, of course, but the practice has been and the practice always will be where the breadwinner in such circumstances is permanently incapacitated, to grant an addition of years.  There is another radical change.  We cannot very well discuss any one item of the whole pension scheme without adverting to the general scheme, and there is a very far-reaching change in the whole outlay of the superannuation scheme provided in the Bill inasmuch as under the law as it stands at the present time, in order to secure an addition of years it was necessary that the incapacity should be shown to be due to the nature of the employment.  Now, in fact it was very difficult to establish, and rarely did a claimant succeed in establishing, that the incapacity, or the illness that caused the incapacity, was in fact due to the nature of the employment. Take, for example, pulmonary tuberculosis. When the responsible medical officer came to certify, it was very difficult definitely to certify that such person might not have contracted pulmonary tuberculosis had he never been in the service.  That is the type of administrative difficulty with which we were faced.  Under the terms of the Bill, there is no such restriction at all.  If the incapacity is contracted in the service, it does not matter whether or not it is attributable to the nature of the service; the person gets the full benefit of the scope of the Bill.  In the light of those considerations, I think Senator Duffy and every other member of the House should feel satisfied that the superannuation code embodied in this Bill is in fact a very generous one. <Col N="2412" /> There is no doubt that it is the most comprehensive and most generous superannuation code that operates in this State today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not question one view which has been expressed by the Parliamentary Secretary, and I accept entirely the statement that the superannuation code is a generous one and is fair to the employees of those institutions. My amendment, as the Parliamentary Secretary recognises, is related to a particular group of people. I should like to know what proportion of the staffs of mental hospitals retire prematurely owing to ill-health.  In other words, is there a very big proportion concerned, or is it merely a small number that retire before completing their full pensionable period in the institution?  I was approaching this matter from the point of view of deciding whether it is better that a person retiring, let us say at 30 or 35 years of age, should have the largest sum by way of annual payment we can afford to give, or whether it is better that he or she should have a smaller annual sum and take the difference as a lump sum payment on retirement.</P>
      <P>That is a matter of opinion.  The Parliamentary Secretary has a view about it.  I have a view which differs from his, but I am not so sure that he quarrels entirely with my view.  I think he bases his argument largely on the fact that a scheme covering the whole field of superannuation in relation to this service has been prepared, and that all parts of the scheme must fit into one another.  I think that is his argument.  I did not hear him argue that it is better in the case of young people who retire to give them the lump sum and the smaller annual payment as an alternative to my suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I am on the subject, perhaps I should say&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary probably knows this too&mdash;that so far as the two institutions in Dublin City and County are concerned, the staff are not likely to avail of this scheme.  I made some inquiries, after the Bill passed the Dáil, as to what were the reactions of the staff in Grangegorman and Portrane.  I happen <Col N="2413" /> to know a number of them, as I served some years as a member of the committee of management, and while I do not feel any obligation to take instructions or even to take advice on a matter of this kind from the persons immediately concerned, I was anxious to find out their views.  Two or three of them to whom I spoke said that, so far as they knew, none of the staff intended to come under this Bill; that they intended to continue under the Act of 1909.  I cannot say whether that is a fact or not, but I would regret it, because this is an infinitely better scheme than the scheme which existed heretofore under the Act of 1909.  I mention that as a matter of interest. I realise that people sometimes do not recognise what is best in their own interests; that, for one reason or another, people often make serious mistakes of judgment in relation to their own interests, and I should be sorry if it were to happen that the persons concerned would not avail of the provisions of this Bill.</P>

In connection with the statements made by Senator Duffy, that he interviewed some of the employees in both Grangegorman and Portrane, employees in both institutions may, naturally, have different views, but we here ought to apply to the matter whatever little common sense we have.  In my opinion, the common sense view is that the small lump sum plus the larger pension would be the ideal thing, because as the employees get on in years they will, naturally, be more in need of the higher annual income which would be available if the lump sum were small.  That is the only point I want to make.</P>

      <P>There is not much argument about this amendment.  It is a question of whether the time prescribed for making the application is reasonable or otherwise.  It applies to the position of a female officer or servant of a mental hospital authority who leaves the service of the authority to get married.  The section provides that she is entitled to a gratuity if, within three months after so leaving, she produces to the mental hospital authority whose service she has left a marriage certificate showing that she has been married within that period.  I am just wondering whether that is a reasonable interval.  I can appreciate that a girl from some rural part of Ireland who is employed as a nurse in Portrane might very reasonably leave the institution three months in advance of her marriage, and that, in fact, it would not be practicable for her, therefore, to produce a marriage certificate within three months.  The proposal I am making is that she will come within the provision of the section if she produces the marriage certificate within six months of having left the institution.</P>

It appears to me, however, that there was submitted to me the case of a person who was not aware of her rights, or who was unable to exercise them, within some such short period as this and, as a consequence, was deprived of her rights.  I think that the laying down of such a short period as this causes hardship sometimes, and I would press this on the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no rooted objection to the principle of the amendment, otherwise, this provision would not have been made in the Bill at all. We are anxious that gratuities will be made available to female nurses who retire on marriage, but there is one aspect of this to which I should like to draw the attention of the House. Senator Duffy's amendment might not work out so much to the advantage of the female attendant, who desires to retire on marriage, as appears on the surface.  If the time within which she must produce the marriage certificate is reasonably short, it assures, at any rate, that she will be sure of the marriage arrangements before she leaves the service, which is a very important point.</P>
      <P>If, on the other hand, she is given a long time to make the arrangements, the nurse concerned may find herself in the position that she has sacrificed her employment in order to get married, and if there should be a breakdown in the marriage arrangements, she might find herself with neither a husband nor a position.  That is the only aspect with which I am particularly concerned.  If we retain the three months period, the nurse will be sure that there is finality about the matter before she resigns, and I would ask the House to consider that aspect of the matter before pressing this amendment. I feel that, on balance, it is more in the interest of the nurse to retain the short period than to give her a long period.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that if the Minister has power to extend the period, you might as well extend it by Statute because, if there is a danger of any degree of carelessness arising out of the longer period, the giving of such a power to the Minister will not minimise it.  I rather think that that is really a matter of the application of worldly wisdom.  There is no other principle involved in it, but from my experience of the service I know that quite a proportion of nurses who retire in order to get married, do not get married.  We know that in everyday life there is sometimes a breakdown in marriage arrangements, even within a week, and there are great disappointments resulting, and I want to make sure, if I can, that the nurse will not find herself stranded as a result of arrangements which do not materialise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 45, to delete the word &ldquo;one-half&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;two-thirds&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an instance in which we are dealing with a ceiling that is imposed on all pensions and lump-sum payments. The section provides that an allowance shall not exceed, in the case of an allowance under Section 77 of this Act, one-third of the yearly salary or wages, and, in any other case one-half of the yearly salary or wages.  So that, in the great majority of cases the ceiling in respect of the pension is a half of the salary and wages and, in the case of the lump sum, an amount equivalent to a year and a half's salary.  I think that the merit of this amendment is in the attempt we are endeavouring to induce trained and experienced people to continue in the service of the mental hospital authority as long as possible.  The Minister himself is taking power to fix a retiring age later on.  He may, for instance, consider that an attendant must retire at 60 or 65, but under the Bill an attendant who has 20 years' service may retire at 55 and secure a full pension. The actual amount of the pension, of course, would depend to some extent on the age at which that attendant entered the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was hoping that it might be possible, if we allowed a pension to soar somewhat above the 50 per cent., to induce people who are skilled and have been highly trained, very largely at the public expense, to remain on in the service beyond the age of 55.  I know that there is a difference of opinion on <Col N="2418" /> that subject.  I know that many of the attendants, particularly in the Dublin institutions, are disposed to think that there should be compulsory retirement, or at least some inducement to retire, at 55 or, certainly, under 60.  I find that point of view, however, expressed mainly by the younger people, who are naturally anxious that their seniors should retire and make way for the younger people.  That is a quite natural and understandable point of view.  I remember that when I first started to work many years ago there was a strong feeling that people over the age of 40 should retire, but once you yourself reach the age of 40 you begin to take a different view of things.  In that connection, I noticed some years ago that we passed special legislation in order to allow a judge to continue in office beyond the age of 70.  Different points of view are pressed in connection with this matter of the proper age of retirement.  What I am endeavouring to make clear is that if we permit a higher rate of pensions for a person who retires at 55 years we are doing a good thing for the public service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again the House is faced with the proposition that we should combine the advantages of the 1909 Act with the advantages of the Bill as far as superannuation is concerned. Under the 1909 Act an officer or servant of a mental hospital, having given a certain number of years' service, can retire on reaching the age of 55, on a maximum pension of two-thirds of his salary plus emoluments. We cannot have that maximum pension of two-thirds of the annual salary and emoluments and have a lump sum in addition.  We must have it one way or the other.  I am providing for the other way in the Bill.  I am providing for an annual allowance of half the annual salary, plus the value of the emoluments, and a lump sum reaching to a maximum value of a year and a half of service.  I thought that we had more or less disposed of the principle involved on the previous amendment but apparently we have to continue to pursue the relative merits of the 1909 superannuation code versus the relative merits of the structure in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2419" /> I do not need to mention to Senators who have looked over this portion of the Bill that existing officers and servants in the service of mental hospital authorities have the right to opt for the terms of the 1909 Bill.  We are putting no pressure whatever on them to accept the terms of this Bill.  The terms of this Bill will apply to future entrants into the service.  Senator Duffy has stated that, so far as he knows, officers in Grangegorman and Portrane will opt for the terms of the 1909 Act in preference to the terms of this Bill.  That remains to be seen, but I would say in regard to that matter that the officers and servants employed in Grangegorman and Portrane have been more generously treated in the matter of salary and emoluments than the officers and servants in the general service throughout the State. Consequently, the standards that can be applied to them in the consideration of this matter cannot with full propriety be applied to the general proposition that we have to face.</P>
    <P>As I said in the Dáil when this matter was under discussion, the aspect of this whole problem that concerns me most&mdash;and I said this in this House on an earlier stage of the Bill&mdash; is the wide divergence of conditions of service in the different institutions, anomalies as to valuation of emoluments and as to salaries for corresponding services and duties and so on.  My energies have been directed towards getting rid of these anomalies and towards securing uniformity of remuneration for corresponding services rather than creating any privileged class within the section of the community we are concerned about here. I mention this matter, although it is not strictly appropriate to the Bill, for the reason that such an improvement as we may bring about in the salaries and emoluments of the employees throughout the general service will be reflected in superannuation in the future.  We have to turn our minds to that.  For the benefit of the House I want to give Senators an idea of how that is going to be dealt with.  During the past 12 months I have been in close negotiation and consultation with the Irish Transport <Col N="2420" /> and General Workers' Union as the representative of the vast majority of mental hospital employees in the State and directly with members of the staff.  They pressed very properly for this uniformity of valuation of emoluments and for some uniformity in the matter of salaries.</P>
    <P>We have practically reached agreement in that matter, so that we can assume that the basis of the remuneration and the consequential basis of superannuation that I intend referring to now will, in fact, operate throughout the State within the next 12 months. Taking four of the district mental hospitals in which salaries are lowest, namely, Letterkenny, Monaghan, Enniscorthy and Ennis, in order that the House may have an idea how the superannuation code embodied in this Bill will operate, we find that under the 1909 Act a male attendant in Letterkenny Mental Hospital would on 35 years' service get a retiring annual allowance of £80, in Monaghan £82 13s. 4d., in Enniscorthy £83 6s. 8d., and in Ennis £100.  When the new scales become operative a male attendant in each of these institutions after 35 years' service will get an annual retiring allowance of £97 10s., plus a lump sum of £292 10s.</P>
    <P>It is well that the House should realise that the superannuation code is not the only thing that we have to consider in relation to this matter.  We have to relate it to the changed conditions of service that may be brought about when the uniform scales of salaries and emoluments come into operation.  The cost of that uniform scale of salaries over the entire State, with the consequential reflection in the cost of superannuation, will amount to £80,000 per annum. That has to be raised out of the rates, for all practical purposes, because while this scheme is nominally contributory in fact the 3 per cent. that is contributed by the officers and servants towards the pension only represents about 16 per cent. of the cost of the superannuation scheme.  In the light of all these considerations I think the House will be satisfied that we have dealt with this particular class of officers and servants in a very generous way.  As I have already stated, <Col N="2421" /> there is no superannuation code in operation in the State to-day that is as generous as the code that is incorporated in the Bill.  It is more generous than the Civil Service code, and it is more generous than the prison officers' code, and the prison officers include the officers in Dundrum Lunatic Asylum.  People ought to be reasonable, and when the Government goes a very long way towards redressing existing grievances, and towards creating proper social conditions, they ought to get credit for what they are doing.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 41, before the word &ldquo;amount&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am endeavouring here to cover a point which needs clarification.  This is the section which makes provision for contributions to the superannuation fund to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred, and it is provided that the contribution should be at the rate of 3 per cent. of the salary or wages of the employee concerned.  In sub-section (1) it is provided that the amount of such contribution shall be deducted from the salary or wages.  I am endeavouring here to make it clear that the deduction will be of the appropriate amount.  I am not quite sure whether the phrasing is good, but I want to make the point clear.  In certain circumstances I can visualise the deduction of a substantial amount.  I want to avoid that.  Under the Health Insurance Acts and the Unemployment Insurance Acts, there is a specific provision that the deduction in respect of insurance must be made at the time the salaries or wages are being paid. If, for instance, an employer paying weekly wages omitted to deduct health insurance contribution he could not mend his hand in a fortnight's, a month's, or six months' time and deduct all contributions that had accrued <Col N="2422" /> in one lump sum.  I do not imagine that mental hospital authorities are likely to do this kind of thing deliberately, but if there is provision in the Bill or in the Act making it obligatory on them to make deductions as the wages are paid there will be no risk of it being overlooked, because I take it that it would be the duty of the Department's auditors to see that the regulations are carried out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any point to meet in the Senator's representation. Sub-section (1) of Section 85 states that an officer or servant of a mental hospital authority shall contribute in each year for the purposes of this Part of this Act 3 per cent. of his salary or wages for that year, and the amount of such contribution shall from time to time be deducted from his salary or wages.</P>
      <P>Senator Duffy suggests that we should say the appropriate amount, but the amount is the appropriate amount.  We have not Senator Kingsmill Moore here, but I see we have Senator Ryan and Senator O'Dea, and I see these lawyers nod acquiescence in my interpretation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I would explain if the Senator would allow me to continue. This amount for this contribution is deducted from the employees' salaries from time to time.  In fact, it is not collected from the ratepaying community at all, because the mental hospital authorities do not touch this 3 per cent.  It is not collected and set aside in a special superannuation fund.  The superannuation is paid out of revenue from year to year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we have legal assistance here I would like this point cleared up.  The deduction is 3 per cent. per annum.  The way I read this provision is that if an attendant is paid in salary and emoluments the sum of £150 per year his contribution which would be £4 10s. may be deducted at the end of a year.  I may be entirely wrong.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any necessity to insert the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; here because the deduction will take place when the wages are being paid.  The deduction is 3 per cent. of the salaries or wages and that is to be deducted from time to time. There is no necessity for the insertion of the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; because the appropriate amount is the amount of the contribution deducted from time to time.  From time to time means when the wages are being paid.  Sub-section (2) deals with the case where the deduction from the wages is not made.  In that case the authority may recover the amount in question by retaining it out of any sum due by them to the officer or servant or by withholding any allowance or lump sum payable by them to or in respect of the officer or servant.  The whole form indicates that the deductions shall be made from time to time as each payment of wages is made.  The amount to be deducted in one year is specifically stated in the Bill at 3 per cent.  I do not see any necessity to insert the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;.  That is my opinion.</P>

If the amount is deducted why is it necessary to have the sub-section making provision for the case in which it is not deducted?</P>

      <P>This section provides for an appeal to the Minister within six months of the resignation of the officer concerned.  That may result in hardship. I know that the same provision is embodied in the Local Government <Col N="2425" /> Act, 1925.  Before the Act of 1925, the appeal could be taken within six months of the granting of the pension or allowance.  If the authority delays the granting of the pension for more than six months, then the officer will have no appeal at all.  Even though the provision follows that in the 1925 Act, I think that the wording of the 1925 Act was unfortunate and that we should revert to the old system.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would look into the matter before the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would give us some indication of what he has in mind in relation to the fixing of the retiring age.  There is a suspicion amongst some of the people to whom this Bill applies that the tendency is to fix an earlier retiring age.  In some cases, it is thought that the retiring age will be fixed at 55.  I do not know whether the Minister has that in mind or not. It would be a pity if regulations were <Col N="2426" /> made which would necessitate the retirement of people who have acquired a good deal of skill in their work while they were still capable of discharging their duties.  I do not want to express any view as to what the age of retirement should be, because the Bill deals with many classes of people. In the case of craftsmen, the full rate of pension is payable at the age of 60. Nobody would suggest that a carpenter or plumber should be required to retire at 60 merely because he is an employee of a local authority.  He certainly would not retire from active work at that age in the ordinary course.  Somewhat different considerations would apply in the case of those who have constantly in their charge mental patients of a different type. Then the question of the clerical and medical staffs of those institutions arises.  Different considerations would apply in each case.  Therefore, I do not say what the retiring age should be, but I should like to get some indication as to what the Parliamentary Secretary had in view when inserting this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will appreciate that the section merely empowers the Minister to make regulations declaring the age at which officers and servants shall cease to hold office or employment.  No firm decision has been arrived at as to what the appropriate retiring age should be.  Before reaching a firm decision, I propose to take steps to ascertain the general feeling amongst the bodies of workers concerned.  That may seem an unusual line of action.  At the same time, I think that it is useful to know how the people concerned are thinking and feeling about these matters.  It does not necessarily follow that we shall do exactly what they would wish to be done.  So far as the registered officers and servants are concerned&mdash;the officers and servants who are engaged entirely in the care and treatment of patients&mdash;Senators will realise that theirs is a very trying type of employment.  I do not think that any public employment is more trying or more difficult or calls for a higher degree of character or a more humane outlook.  Those people have to be <Col N="2427" /> specially selected and they are a very special body of men and women who give tremendous service to the community and lead a very difficult life. If any of you ever went through any of these institutions&mdash;I often did in an official capacity and otherwise&mdash;I think that you would be glad to get out as quickly as possible and that, if you had any alternative, you would not stay there for any money.  In fact, the people who devote their lives to that service almost require a vocation. Those who are constantly, by reason of their occupation, closely associated with the patients in these institutions ought ordinarily to be retired at an earlier age than people employed in other walks of life.  When I say that, I think that common sense ought to be applied.  While the Bill provides that an officer or servant can retire on full pension at the age of 55, it is, undoubtedly, true that a considerable proportion of officers and servants might, at the age of 55, be still capable of very good service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they were physically and mentally suited for continued employment, I personally would not be inclined to push them out of the service by sole reason of the fact that they had reached the age of 55 years.  On the other hand, the usual age for retirement for officers and servants of local authorities has now been fixed at 65 years.  I rather think, so far as employees in these institutions who are devoting their entire time to the care and treatment of patients are concerned, that the compulsory retiring age should be about 60.  I do not want to be held up to ransom on this matter. I am not giving any firm decision; I am merely indicating my present line of thought on the matter.  With the information at present at my disposal I would be disposed to fix 60 years as the upward limit for retention in the service of attendants and officers who are devoting their time to the care and charge of patients.  Other officers would be in the same category as officers of other local authorities&mdash;I mean the clerical officers and the administrative staff who have nothing to do with the care and treatment of <Col N="2428" /> patients.  The retiring age in their case would be the same as that applying to officers and servants of any other local authority.</P>

      <P>May I inquire what is the position of members of a joint board in relation to the holding of public contracts?  In the case in which the county council is the mental hospital authority, the existing law covers the holding of contracts by members of the county council, but, so far as I can discover, no provision is made here relating to members of a joint board, and the provisions applying to ordinary members of the county council do not apply to them.  I agree that circumstances are not quite what they were in 1898, and that in the main the contract is placed not by the joint board, but by the county council.  At the same time, I think it is worthy of note that cases will arise in which, although the contract is placed by the county council, the council is influenced by members of the committee.  I have heard of one case actually in which a contract was placed by a joint committee to which the board was the successor with a member of the committee of management and was placed very largely because the person interested was a member of the committee of management.  I draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to this matter because I think there should be some uniformity in the law.  If it is proper that the placing of contracts by the county council with members of that body should be prohibited by law, then it should be prohibited also in respect of members of the joint committee.</P>

I am not quite certain, therefore, whether the Senator is quite accurate as regards the present state of the law, which may prohibit a member of a local body such as a county councillor entering into a contract with the county council, the contract being made on behalf of the county council by the county manager.  I am not quite certain of that, but I have a feeling that the position is as I have stated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg leave to move amendment No. 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 63, to insert before paragraph (a), line 31, the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2433" />&ldquo;(a) approve the certificate of a registered medical practitioner who has been attending the person to whom the application relates,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>After that, there is the word &ldquo;or&rdquo;, which unfortunately is dropped out of this printing, and then it continues &ldquo;visit and examine the person to whom the application relates&rdquo;.  There is a certain amount of difficulty in presenting that, because, in distinction from the amendments presented this afternoon to this House, this touches a professional and rather technical subject&mdash;the relations between the general practitioner and the authorised medical officer.  Of course, as we know, this Bill has been very carefully considered by the Parliamentary Secretary and his advisers, and I am pretty certain that this thing may have arisen already.  The attitude of the House might easily be: &ldquo;Here is something which really is too technical and professional for us to discuss,&rdquo; especially after a rather tiring afternoon.  At the same time, I hope my colleagues will allow me to raise this amendment, which is really linked up with amendments Nos. 16, 17 and 18, and I do not propose to discuss each of them separately.</P>
    <P>If this amendment falls, the other amendments fall with it.  The reason why I ask your indulgence in raising the amendment is that I think it touches commonsense, and touches the interests of all of us.  Whether or not this amendment be accepted by the Parliamentary Secretary, I feel that in the interests of all of us the arguments in favour of it should be put before the House and go on the record, because subsequently, when possibly the Act will be examined and analysed, somebody may say: &ldquo;Have these arguments ever been brought forward?  If so, why were they not accepted, or why were they accepted&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, the progress of all our social developments and medical developments in legislation in this country has been to increase the functional utility of the dispensary doctor.  He is now being provided with a very well organised Civil Service, and a very devoted Parliamentary <Col N="2434" /> Secretary, who seems prepared to take no end of pains; so he is going to be a very much more important servant of the State.  But, in addition, his duties are being increased very much indeed. We are expecting a great deal more of him, and among the things we are expecting him to do is to give a decision as to whether or not a person will be certified as insane.  The hope underlying this amendment is to make it easier for the authorised medical authority to avail himself of the services of such a person who is in a position to aid him in giving information about the state of his patient on examination.  Mental disease is unique in many ways.  It is the only disease which may be very seriously affecting a person while he is showing no physical indications of it.  Secondly, it is an extraordinary disease in that there are lucid intervals, so that very often it requires a period of observation. The person who perhaps best knows the condition of the diseased person's mind is whatever medical practitioner has been looking after him.  In addition, the adjudication is rendered all the more difficult because there are so many varieties of mental disease.</P>
    <P>That point was touched on yesterday by Senator Duffy and by Senator Baxter.  There is really no satisfactory definition of insanity.  It is now, I believe, spoken of as a disease of behaviour, and we, thinking our behaviour is normal, regard certain deviations from that behaviour as abnormal.  In other words, sanity is the madness of the majority.  To acquire the power of recognising mental disorder is very often a matter of very considerable experience and very considerable training.  In this case the medical officer has a terrific responsibility.  It must be realised that the medical profession is the only one in which the judge is also the hangman. The medical officer is called on to make a very serious decision.  By framing this amendment and presenting it to the House, I should like to make it possible for the medical officer to avail himself of whatever knowledge there may be as to the patient's welfare, which is already in the hands of his appropriate medical practitioner. <Col N="2435" /> I should like it so arranged that the authorised medical officer will be helped as much as possible.  I think that we may save him time, I think we may save him a rather laborious examination, I think we may save him an examination which, in certain circumstances, may give ambiguous results, if we make it possible for him to have the certificate of the medical practitioner who has been attending the person to whom the application relates.  I am not going in any way to relieve the authorised medical officer of any responsibility in the matter. His responsibility remains.  He has to approve of the certificate.  He will receive his customary fee for approving the certificate.  He will do work, and he will be paid for the work he does. If he considers that that certificate is satisfactory, he can act forthwith on the certificate.  If he considers that the certificate is not entirely satisfactory, he can visit and examine the person to whom the application relates. In many cases, of course, there will not be a registered medical practitioner attending the person, and, consequently, there will be no question of a certificate.  In some cases there will be.  I think the most important cases are those of the temporary patients.</P>
    <P>I can quite see that, if a patient has been treated by his own practitioner, and the practitioner wishes to persuade that patient to undergo the proper institutional treatment, it would be very much easier if the registered medical practitioner, who knows the patient, is able to arrange for his reception.  I can quite see conditions arising where the appearance of an outsider, however sympathetic he may be, might easily precipitate a serious disturbance in the mind of the patient.</P>
    <P>One of the great features of this Bill is the getting of the borderline case. If I may say so, that was very effectively brought up here yesterday, on the question of those clinics which will make it possible for a person to receive treatment before his condition has become too far advanced.  An exactly similar point arises in connection with cancer.  The treatment of cancer is very often a question of <Col N="2436" /> early diagnosis.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has several times rightly emphasised, the treatment of many forms of insanity is a question of early diagnosis.  It would be very much easier for the early diagnosis to be effected by the practitioner who has been treating the patient, and is able to certify his case, than by the authorised medical officer who may be a complete stranger, who has to come in and make an examination, and who may possibly get rather misleading results from it.  Of course, I am only making a case and taking a point of view that may be necessary, but I realise that there are very great dangers there.  We are all concerned either directly or indirectly with some of those problems, and I think that the people who are mostly affected here are the relatives.  Those are the views I wish to put forward, and my main lines are, first, that I believe this would be of help to the authorised medical officer by making information available to him, information which he need not necessarily act upon unless he wants to do so, but which he can act upon, if he thinks necessary. I think that it will help the medical practitioner by providing a better liaison between him and the dispensary doctor, and I am certain that it will help the patient, because, very often, people consider that the doctor they know is better qualified than the doctor they do not know.  I think that this would be very important in leading the patient across that rather sinister threshold, and that it will afford him the means of fair and satisfactory treatment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to ask the House to oppose the amendment put down by Senator Fearon.  I do that with a certain amount of reluctance because of the convincing manner in which Senator Fearon presented his case. Unfortunately, he did not present all aspects of the matter, and it is my duty to point out to the House the flaws in his argument and the points against the amendment that, of course, Senator Fearon did not present to the <Col N="2437" /> House and could not be expected to present to it.  Now, I would remind the House that the class of patients we are dealing with here are chargeable patients.  We are not dealing with any class of patients in this particular setting, or this amendment, other than chargeable patients, and Senator Fearon asks us to presume that a chargeable patient will have a private doctor other than the dispensary medical officer of the district.  It seems to me that if a patient has a private doctor in attendance, that patient is not and cannot be a chargeable patient.  In the definition section, a chargeable patient means a patient who is receiving mental hospital assistance and who, with the persons, if any, liable to maintain him, is unable to provide the whole of the cost of such assistance.  Now, the term &ldquo;chargeable patient&rdquo; is a new term in substitution for the term &ldquo;person entitled to assistance under the Public Assistance Act&rdquo;, but the definition of &ldquo;chargeable patient&rdquo; is exactly the definition of the corresponding person under the Public Assistance Act.</P>
      <P>I felt, when this Bill was being drafted, that with all the talk we have had about the stigma of being in receipt of public assistance, it was better to have a new classification. Otherwise, a term other than this would have been used in this classification. In order that we may thoroughly understand it we may refer to these people as dispensary patients. Dispensary patients are entitled to the services of the dispensary doctor, and for the purposes of this Act the dispensary doctor will be the family doctor.  Senator Fearon puts a scheme before the House under which such a patient could call in a private doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see how that scheme could operate at all.  The dispensary doctor is under a statutory obligation to attend such patients.  Suppose for a moment that we did make this concession to Senator Fearon, who, undoubtedly, is very sincere about the matter.  The position might arise that the dispensary medical officer who, in fact, will also be the family doctor and may have been attending the patient over a long period without <Col N="2438" /> payment, perhaps, would be displaced at this critical time in the patient's history by an outside doctor, because it is inconceivable that there would be a private doctor in normal attendance on the case.  If the case was a private case, the machinery for admission is different altogether.  Two private practitioners recommend the patient for admission to an institution if the patient is a private patient.  I do not know if it is necessary to pursue the matter any further. In fact, under the existing law&mdash;I do not know whether that is a thing that should be taken as an example of how things should be done&mdash;the dispensary medical officer is the only person who can certify what is prescribed under the existing law as &ldquo;a dangerous lunatic.&rdquo;  You know the system of committal, and we need not waste any time upon it.  It may be suggested that there are borderline cases that are not altogether public assistance cases and that, on occasion, they are able to pay a doctor for attendance and that a private doctor should be permitted to recommend in such cases, under the certification of the dispensary medical officer.  There are such cases, but I think it is rather unfair that we should adopt such a scheme under which a person, who ordinarily could pay for his medical attendance, as soon as it becomes a question of his being maintained in an institution, becomes a full charge on the rates.  I do not think that that is logical or reasonable.  If he is entitled to free maintenance in this institution at the expense of the ratepayers, well, then, he should be a person who ordinarily could not afford to pay a private medical practitioner as his family doctor.</P>
    <P>One other point I should like to make is that the dispensary medical officer has full authority, under the Public Assistance Act, to call to his assistance any medical practitioner for consultation on any case where the patient is entitled to medical assistance. Similarly, if there is any doubt in the mind of the doctor, if the relatives are not satisfied, and if he indicates his readiness to make a recommendation or, alternatively, indicates <Col N="2439" /> his unwillingness to make a recommendation, there is nothing to prevent him, under the Public Assistance Act, from calling in another doctor and the local authority will pay the doctor's fee.  All that is provided for in the law as it stands at the present time.  I, personally, apart from these arguments which, I think, are rather overwhelming, would not take kindly to the principle of any doctor recommending a person for detention in a mental institution without having seen the patient. Of course, Senator Fearon may tell us that, under his amendment, he can either countersign or examine the patient.  I do not think that under any circumstances we should recommend the admission of any patient by a doctor who has not seen the patient. While I have no doubt of Senator Fearon's sincerity in proposing this amendment, I do not think it fits into our existing scheme of things, and I think it refers more to the conditions of city life than to what obtains in the provinces.</P>

      <P>I am very much impressed with what the Parliamentary Secretary has said in regard to this particular amendment but, of course, chargeable patients would ordinarily speaking be dispensary patients.  May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he intends to maintain the same line of argument, and the same opposition to the later sections on which the same amendment is to be put down?  One of these applies to private patients, and the other applies to patients who, so to speak, are taken up by the Gárda Síochána because they show signs of temperamental aberration and may become chargeable.  I ask this question because my attitude would depend on whether the Parliamentary Secretary was confining his opposition to the case of chargeable patients.</P>

      <P>When I was <Col N="2440" /> making my case the Parliamentary Secretary in his answer based the major portion of his argument upon the view which I have no doubt is correct, that in the section with which we are now dealing, the patient would ordinarily be the patient of a dispensary doctor, and would send to him, but to make it compulsory on the dispensary doctor to call in another doctor in regard to his own patient was a different thing.  To make it optional for a patient to call in another doctor was perfectly understandable. The same argument does not apply in the case of a well-off person, with a private medical attendant who has been looking after him for perhaps a number of years.  I think a great deal of harm might be done in forcing the private medical attendant to call in a dispensary doctor, and that is what I think would happen in Section 155 under which the patient may be chargeable or not.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for the considerate way he has treated my rather clumsy presentation of this amendment, but it has been made a bit difficult owing to the relationship between the amendments.  It is pretty plain that we ought to see eye to eye, <Col N="2441" /> because we really have the same interests at heart and are very anxious to make this Bill a success.  I agree with some of the criticisms of the Parliamentary Secretary, but I am rather slow about working them out. Could I have the permission of the House to withdraw the amendment in order to consider it at leisure?  There ought to be no serious difficulty in reconciling the viewpoints.  I do not for a moment imagine that a chargeable patient should have a private medical attendant, but in the case of the temporary patient I want to make it easy for him to avail of the services of the doctor who has been looking after his welfare and interest.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very small point.  It is concerned only with the suggestion that at the end of paragraph (2) there should be added the words &ldquo;or should happen to be at the time of removal&rdquo;.  It is to avoid the possibility of a person coming we will say from the south, without any criticism of the south, and having some disorder and then somebody <Col N="2442" /> acting according to the letter of the law and deciding that he would have to be taken back to the district mental hospital of the place in which he ordinarily resides.  Section 176 I believe makes this amendment unnecessary, but I thought in the interest of clarity it might be well to extend sub-section (2) of Section 165 by the inclusion of these words so that it would read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;.... for the reception and detention of the person as a person of unsound mind in the district mental hospital for the mental hospital district in which the person ordinarily resides or should happen to be at the time of removal&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>There is no clash of principle or policy involved in this amendment, but I am advised by the draftsman that the point is fully covered by Section 176.  I suggest that between this and the Report Stage, Senator Fearon might look into this and relate it to Section 176, and also read with it Section 108 that deals with the admission of persons from districts other than the district in which they ordinarily reside. Section 108 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a person received as a chargeable patient in a district mental hospital or other institution maintained by a mental hospital authority is not ordinarily resident in their mental hospital district, such authority shall give notice of the reception to the mental hospital authority&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>and so on, and it sets out the machinery for the transfer of a patient to the appropriate district hospital and for the financial responsibility. That is where the person comes, say, to Dublin from the country.  When Section 108 is read with Section 176 you will find the position covered.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the case of a person detained in a country hospital who is charged with an offence.  He is charged before a district justice and, as I understand it, the district justice does not determine what is to be done with <Col N="2444" /> him.  He makes a report on his condition and following the report the Minister considers the case.  After consideration of the report of the inspector of mental hospitals, if he thinks fit, he directs the removal of that person from the district mental hospital to the Dundrum Criminal Lunatic Asylum.  That is a perfectly normal and natural procedure.  What I am wondering is whether there is in fact a conflict of authority.  I understood it was the Minister for Justice was responsible for control of Dundrum Lunatic Asylum.  I wonder whether it is necessary to make provision here requiring the Minister for Justice to accept a person in Dundrum who is ordered to be sent there by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  I am not questioning anything regarding the construction of the section, except that I am curious to know whether there is in fact a conflict between the authorities.</P>

      <P>If there is any conflict I can assure the House that it must be a conflict of phraseology.  There has not been a conflict on a matter of policy as between the Department of Justice and the Department of Local Government and Public Health. Senators are aware, and legal men particularly would be aware of the cumbersome and unhappy machinery that exists to deal with such cases.  There are two matters to be considered. The Department of Justice will have to satisfy itself that the person is unfit to plead and that a <i>prima facie</i> case can be established against him.  In the ordinary course of things an inmate of a mental hospital would be brought before a district justice.  He would be returned for trial to the Circuit Court, and all that unfortunate procedure of trial would have to be gone through in the prior knowledge that the person was not responsible for his actions at the time the alleged crime was committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both the interests of the Department of Justice and the Department of Local Government and Public Health would appear to be reconciled. The Department of Justice can come in and satisfy themselves from the legal point of view, that the man is <Col N="2445" /> unfit to plead, and a <i>prima facie</i> case has been established against him. Medical science comes in at that stage. We send the inspector of mental hospitals to report and, on consideration of his report, the Minister will decide whether the man in fact is a suitable case to be transferred to Dundrum Criminal Lunatic Asylum.  I do not see any conflict of authority.  So far from a conflict there is a desirable degree of co-operation in dealing with a delicate and unhappy problem in a more rational way than it has been dealt with before.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the case of a person detained in a district mental hospital or in other institutions maintained by local mental hospital authorities charged with an indictable offence and brought before a justice of the District Court.  There is a number of cases in which a person charged with an indictable offence before a district justice may not be detained in a district mental hospital or other institution maintained by local mental hospital authorities, and perhaps the machinery contained in this section may be extended to cover such cases.  We have seen almost every year where men obviously insane from the beginning are arrested, charged before the district justice and the newspapers report that he appears to take no interest in the proceedings. He is obviously insane, of unsound mind, but he is sent back to Mountjoy or some other jail and brought before the district justice again at a later date and depositions taken.  He may be liable to be indicted before a jury which involves long and tiresome proceedings taking place in the District Courts by way of depositions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then he is returned for trial to the Circuit Court or to the Central Criminal Court, generally to the Central Criminal Court, and a jury is empanelled to ascertain whether he is fit to plead or not.  This jury may disagree and another jury has to be empanelled until some finality is reached.  All this costs the State a lot of money and a lot of time is wasted. This section, therefore, is a very welcome one, because the district justice can make an order, summarily so to <Col N="2446" /> speak, if he is satisfied that on the evidence before him the person charged if returned for trial would be unfit to plead.  Some provision should be made to cover the case of a person obviously insane, who is not detained in the district mental hospital or other institution maintained by a local mental hospital authority at the time he is charged.  In most cases the person charged with an indictable offence and discovered afterwards, or at the time of the offence, to be insane has to spend a considerable time in jail before being charged.  It should be possible to have such a person taken out of jail and sent to the Dundrum Criminal Lunatic Asylum without having to send him into a mental institution in order that he should come within the provisions of this section. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary might be able to give us some information on that point.</P>

      <P>I do not think I can agree with Senator Ryan.  Very often a person charged with murder will pretend to be insane if he has no defence and he will act in an insane manner in the prison or wherever he is. Such a person may very easily deceive the district justice and the doctors too.  I have known it to be done.  By making the change suggested you are cutting out the procedure already in existence whereby he must be returned for trial and then tried by a jury to know if he is fit to plead or not.  It is very dangerous to take short cuts in matters of that kind.</P>

That assumes that medical evidence would be given before the district justice to the effect that if the man was put on trial he would be unfit to plead so that the justice would in fact be acting upon the evidence tendered before him.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan, as he frankly told the House, has raised a much wider issue than the issue involved in the section.  He has raised an issue that cannot be dealt with in a Mental Treatment Bill.  It is well worthy of consideration.  The line of thought expressed is represented in our line of approach to the patient already detained in a mental hospital who is guilty of an indictable offence, perhaps guilty of assaulting another person, perhaps having caused the death of another patient or of an attendant.  That is the type of case we have in mind.  The machinery we have in mind to deal with this particular problem might, perhaps, with necessary modifications, be adopted to deal with the corresponding patient who has not yet been detained in a mental hospital.  If it is desirable it could only be put into operation by an amendment of the criminal code.  I shall bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Justice for his consideration in the event of a Bill being brought before the Oireachtas to amend the criminal code.  There is a lot to be said for Senator Ryan's views on this matter where there is no obvious doubt that the person is of unsound mind, but you get into rather dangerous waters where the person pretends to be insane in order to avoid the consequences of his actions. Senators will observe, if I am not keeping the House too long, that this section will only become operative if and when the district justice sits in a mental institution.  That, I rather think, will involve an amendment of the rules of court in order to enable the district justice to sit in the institution so that we must have the full co-operation of the Department of Justice in the matter.  I feel that when we are doing the thing at all it would be absurd to have to haul a person out of a mental hospital for trial in the District Court.  Unless we can get the district justice to sit in a mental <Col N="2448" /> hospital, the section will not become operative.</P>

That is one of the few cases in which a report, on discharge, is not to be sent to the Minister.  If a person in a district mental hospital dies or if he is discharged, a report has to be submitted to the Minister.  In this instance, there is a departure which I do not quite understand.  A person is taken out of the district mental hospital and sent to the central criminal lunatic asylum because he has been charged with an offence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This section makes provision in relation to persons discharged from a district mental hospital where no relatives are known or can be traced.  Sub-section (3) provides that, where a person detained in a district mental hospital or other institution maintained by a mental hospital authority is discharged under this section, the authority may, if they think proper, pay to, or in respect of, him such sum as they consider reasonable towards his travelling expenses <Col N="2449" /> on his journey to his home.  This provision seems to me to be hardly adequate.  Let us assume that a person has been for a period of years in a district mental hospital.  He may find it very difficult to trace his relatives, if he has any.  This provision deals with cases where it is impossible to trace relatives.  After such a lapse of time, when the patient has lost contact with society, he is to be put on a tram or train and sent home.  No provision is made to deal with him on his arrival.  That can be a very serious matter under certain circumstances for a person released from a mental hospital.</P>

      <P>There is a provision in Section 223 to deal with the case of a person entitled to public assistance. If we may use the old expression, we are dealing there with the pauper patient&mdash;the person who is discharged from a mental hospital and who, in the past, would have been regarded as a pauper.  He would have been entitled, under Section 223, to get poor law assistance.  However, I have in mind a person who is actually in a mental hospital.  Everything I have heard of him confirms the view that he is no longer any danger to himself or anybody else.  I understand that he has an excellent time solving crossword puzzles and entertaining himself in other ways.  If that person were discharged under this Bill, as he probably will be, and could get on his feet, I think that he would be comfortably <Col N="2450" /> off because, so far as I know, he has some property and is entitled to an income.  Seeing that we have gone so far in this Bill to meet all kinds of difficult problems, I wonder if we could not empower the mental hospital authority to do something to re-establish this man on his discharge, as he would not be entitled to public assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that it would be possible to make provision for the contingency envisaged by Senator Duffy.  What he asks us, in effect, to do is to make provision for some form of financial assistance to a private patient.  If a patient is a chargeable patient, he is entitled to public assistance.  If he is entitled to public assistance, there is no difficulty whatever in obtaining it.  If a patient is destitute&mdash;if he has no home to which to go&mdash;the mental hospital authority is given statutory power under Section 223 to transfer the patient to a local authority institution. When Senator Duffy asked us to go a step further and make provision for a person who does not require it and who has private means, he is asking us to do too much.  He is either a private patient&mdash;a person who is maintained out of his own estate or by his relatives&mdash;or he is a person who is maintained, in whole or in part, out of the local rates.  If he is maintained, in whole or in part, by the local rates, he is entitled to public assistance.  I did not like the Senator's reference to paupers.  There are no paupers in this country and I hope we shall never see them again. There are people of limited means and of very little means, but the State and the local authorities long ago faced up to their social and moral responsibilities in making the necessary financial provision for those people. That provision applies to mental patients as soon as they are discharged because, when discharged, they cease to be mental patients.  They are either persons entitled to public assistance or not so entitled.  If the patient is not entitled to public assistance, he must be in a position to lav hands on some means of living.  He has either a <Col N="2451" /> home to which to go or property of his own or a business.  He cannot be classified as a destitute person.</P>
      <P>We have made every possible provision to cover contingencies that may arise in so far as the low-income classes are concerned and I think we cannot ask the local authority to make provision out of public funds for classes of people who are able to provide for themselves.</P>

It seems to convey the meaning which is intended.  To compel a man to attend a service that is contrary to the religious beliefs he held when he was in possession of his normal faculties seems to be somewhat different from compelling a man to attend a religious service other than a service of the religion which he held when admitted to the institution.</P>

      <P>The section as it stands would mean that he should not be compelled to attend a service contrary to the religion to which he is ascertained to belong.  Persons may have different religions, but they may hold a number of religious beliefs in common.  The word &ldquo;contrary&rdquo; would imply that they held totally distinct and different beliefs on some of these matters.  I take it that the intention of the Legislature is that a patient in a mental institution should not be compelled to attend any religious service other than the services of his own religion.  That is why I would suggest that the section should be amended to read &ldquo;shall not be compelled to attend any religious service other than the service of the religion to which he is ascertained to belong&rdquo;.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should consider the matter between now and the Report Stage.</P>

Everybody knows where the service of a particular religion is held. To say that one religious service is contrary to another religion is, I think, not good phrasing.  At all events, I make the suggestion and I think the Parliamentary draftsman may not be so obdurate, so hard-headed or as self-satisfied as the Parliamentary Secretary seems to think.</P>

There is nothing wrong with the section except in relation to the qualification of the barrister.  The President of the High Court is authorised to appoint a barrister of not less than six years' standing.  I do not know whether it matters or not, but I should rather be inclined to think that that word should be prefaced by &ldquo;practising&rdquo;, so that it would read &ldquo;a practising barrister of not less than six years' standing&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>In page 103, to delete sub-section (2).</P>
      <P>This section provides in the first part for the supremacy of this Act over any other statutory enactment in force at the time this becomes law.  But in the second sub-section it goes much further. It provides that the Minister may, by Order, in respect of any statutory or other enactment, introduce such adaptations and modifications as he considers necessary or expedient.  I will be told that this also is not new. I am not concerned with whether it is or not.  I am considering it from the point of view of what is being done by this House.  What we are doing is this: we are handing over to civil servants the power to make an Order declaring according to their judgment what any Act of Parliament passed by the Oireachtas may mean in certain circumstances.  The Parliamentary Secretary will tell us that he depends upon the draftsman for the meaning of legal phrases.</P>

      <P>I hope I am not hurting the sensibilities of the Senator, but I should like to point out that it is officials who will make these regulations when this Bill becomes an Act. What is being done then by the Oireachtas is to hand over to civil servants the power to adapt or amend statute law in such manner as they think fit.  This Bill has been under consideration, I gather, for a very long time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, it has been under consideration for a long time.  It was very extensively amended in going through the Oireachtas.  It is a very large piece of draftsmanship, and I think it must be assumed that those in charge of it discovered any adaptations that are necessary.  They discovered what Acts should be amended, and what Orders should be set aside, and I think it is unreasonable that this provision should be inserted here.  I have no objection to the first sub-section, but I have a distinct objection to the provisions of the second sub-section, and I ask the House to delete it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a usual section included in every, what I may call, comprehensive enactment, because there may be other enactments, of course, which are not directly repealed or directly mentioned in this Bill.  This section gives the Minister power to adapt or modify those other Acts so as to make this Bill, when an Act, operative and effective, and the Minister can only make an Order within the powers given to him by the section.  If he exceeds his power, then the court can set his Order aside.  I <Col N="2458" /> think myself that we would leave this Bill incomplete and unfinished if this section were not in the Act when passed, and, therefore, I would suggest that Senator Duffy should be satisfied that it is a necessary section and that the only authority who can make the necessary Order is the Minister.  The Senator should have at least a little faith in the Minister.  Senator Duffy said that this Order will be made or drafted by civil servants.  Well, they may be civil servants, but I am also certain that they are lawyers of long experience, and that, having had sufficient practice in making all these Orders in connection with similar sections, they can be relied upon to do the work exactly as required and nothing more.</P>

      <P>I must confess that I disagree with Senator Ryan.  I do not think that in the full form, as present in the sub-section, it is the usual kind of thing in such sections. The form is usually to give the Minister power to make statutory modifications for a limited period after the Act comes into force.  So far as I am concerned, I would agree that the Minister should have that power for, say 12 months, or even a longer period, if he wants to ascertain the detailed working of the Act, but I do not think it is desirable that it should remain operative there for the Minister for all time.  In that connection. I must confess that, much as I complain about the Department of Local Government and Public Health in other matters, so far as the legal end of their work is concerned they are the only Department making any effort to modify and codify our legislation, and to that extent I think we can give them more credit than any other Department.</P>

It seems to me that if Senator Ryan said that to-day was Christmas Day, Senator Sweetman would feel bound to say that it was Easter Sunday. I do not agree with Senator <Col N="2459" /> Duffy, who complained that this was drafted entirely by civil servants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I understood him to say that.  Surely, the Senator does not think that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister got down to the actual drafting of this Bill themselves?  If so, I am quite sure that we would have the Senator complaining that the Parliamentary Secretary was neglecting his duty in the House, and doing nothing else but that kind of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, of course, that is an exaggeration.  I complained that when this becomes law it will confer, not on the Minister&mdash;and not for the reason Senator Quirke gave&mdash;the power to adapt, alter and amend other statutes, but on civil servants, as it is they who will be administering the Act, and they may consider that a certain enactment, perhaps 103 years old, is the kind of thing that can be amended under the section, and we shall have no redress, as this House need not know.  Who is going to invoke the court?  Who will go to the expense of invoking the court in order to set aside some recommendation made in that way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Senator will allow me to explain.  When I saw this amendment on the Order Paper I came to the conclusion that when Senator Duffy came to the end of the long journey and reached Section 280 he was either tired, or took a final kick at the Bill&mdash;that he began to celebrate when he got to the end of the journey.  That is the impression it conveyed to me.  Now, what, in fact, does this action do that Senator Duffy is so much concerned about? Sub-section (2) is the one that gives him particular worry, and under sub-section (2)&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;the Minister may, by Order, make, in respect of any statutory or other enactment in force at the commencement of this section and relating to any matter or thing dealt with or affected by this Act, all such adaptations of and modifications in <Col N="2460" /> such enactment as appear to him to be necessary or expedient for carrying into effect the provisions of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are empowering the Minister to bring this Act into effective operation, and we are empowering him to do nothing else and nothing more.</P>
    <P>Surely the House, if it passes this Bill, intends that the Act should become operative, and fully operative. How can it become fully operative if the Minister is not empowered to make these adaptations?  Now, Senator Duffy conjures up to himself, apparently, all kinds of modifications of existing enactments by the adaptation powers that the Minister is given in sub-section (2).  Bear in mind, however, that these adaptations can only be made in so far as they are necessary for bringing the Act into effect, and bear in mind also that they are essential.  I shall just give a few instances of why they are essential. We have changed the terminology.  We talk in this Bill that, I hope, will shortly be enacted, about &ldquo;chargeable patients&rdquo; that were formerly &ldquo;the insane poor&rdquo;, and in Acts that are not repealed they are still the &ldquo;insane poor&rdquo;.  We talked formerly about &ldquo;lunatics&rdquo;.  They are now &ldquo;persons of unsound mind&rdquo;.  We talk now of &ldquo;district mental hospitals&rdquo;, but in certain statutes they are &ldquo;lunatic asylums&rdquo;.  The Minister must have power to make the necessary adaptations in order that the terminology we have incorporated in this Bill may become effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that this motion of Senator Counihan should receive the support of any Senator in this House.  As a matter of fact, the motion itself was all right, but Senator Counihan in speaking to it made the worst speech I think I ever heard in the House.  I did not expect that there would be one member in the House who would make that statement. The Senator asked the House to pass legislation that would compel workers to remain at work no matter what conditions they had to work <Col N="2462" /> under or what payment they received. Senator Counihan would like the farm labourers of this country to be downright slaves.  The Senator goes so far as to say that a person who would help the farm labourers of this country should be put in prison.  Why not go the whole hog and say that anyone who would help the workers in any other type of industry should go to prison?  But no, he attacks the lowest and those that are not organised.  With regard to strikes, I do not like the idea of lightning strikes if they can be avoided, and I think that at certain times it is a tragedy that a farm labourer should go on strike, but the things that Senator Counihan referred to were only small little incidents and, in fact, there were no strikes of farm labourers since the emergency. Senator Counihan makes a great deal out of the fact that farm labourers were working for 18/- or 20/- some years ago.  That is true, and while it was a disgrace to the country that they should have to work for 18/- or 20/- a week, the Senator will have to admit that now that they have got £2 1s. per week in view of the cost of living, it cannot be said that they are better off even at that wage.</P>
      <P>Senator Counihan has appealed to the Minister to bring in a law that would prevent the farm labourer going on strike.  The Senator is very forgetful for after all the Government brought in a standstill Order on workmen's wages in this country and we are forced to give them the credit that they did not include the farm labourer in that Order.  They would not go so far as Senator Counihan would have pone in dealing with the farm labourer. For that reason I am forced to say that it is a very good job for the workers that Senator Counihan and his Party are not in power and we would see what the workers would get.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Anyhow the position is that Senator Counihan asked the House to pass a resolution not to allow the farm labourer to leave his work. Senator Counihan accused me of being practically responsible for bringing out these men in County Dublin.  That is a lie.  The Senator also accuses me of being the agricultural expert in the Labour Party.  I have never claimed to be an expert in anything, but I do say that I am satisfied I am as much an expert about it as the Senator and I know equally as much about it as the Senator because the Senator cannot distinguish between the Labour Party and the trade unions.  The Senator also said that I made a false statement quite recently in this House on another matter in reference to the prices of cattle.  He said that I stated that beef was sold in the Dublin cattle market at 5d. and retailed to the people at 1/5 or 1/10.  The Senator said I made that statement because I knew so little about what I was talking about.  If the Senator wants the information I will give him figures and I will leave the House to <Col N="2465" /> judge.  They are taken from the <i>Irish Press</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i> of December 7th, 1944, from the market reports&mdash;prime cattle, 55/- to 57/- a cwt.; secondary sorts, 47/- to 51/-, and rougher types 43/- to 46/-.</P>

The figure works out from 57 per cent. to 60 per cent. dead weight.  I want to tell Senator Counihan also that all the offal is not waste.  What about the hide?  I have yet to know the butcher who sells boneless meat.</P>

      <P>Senator Counihan said that not even a &ldquo;screw&rdquo;&mdash;I do not know what a &ldquo;screw&rdquo; is&mdash;was sold at that price.  From the report on December 7 in the <i>Irish Press</i> and <i>Independent</i>, fat cows were sold at from 28/- to 38/-; seconds at from 20/- to 28/- and others at from 12/- to 17/- per cwt.&mdash;an average of 24/- a cwt. for fat cows on the Dublin market.  Yet, Senator Counihan, who is the expert so far as the farming section of Fine Gael is concerned, says that there was not a beast sold in Dublin at less than 1/- per lb.  The figures I have given show that the average figure was 3d. per lb. for fat cows on 6th December. That meat was sold to the workers of Dublin at 1/6 per lb.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>According to Senator Counihan's statement, he would think it good enough for some of the workers, at all events.  I have also the prices here for Wednesday, November 1, and the figures are about the same. Even then, there could not be a clearance of all the animals, which shows that some people would have sold at less.  I hope that, when Senator Counihan is replying, he will admit that he made a terrible mistake in saying that not a beast was sold at less than 1/-.  I have shown that they were sold at 3d.  My statement that the butchers were charging 1/5 per lb. was an understatement.  That was the average price.  Some of them were charging up to 2/- for certain cuts of beef. However, that is only by the way.</P>
      <P>The point that concerns me most is that there should be any Senator who would go so far as to compel agricultural labourers to be slaves, because that is really what Senator Counihan's proposal would mean.  Why should Senator Counihan have those people arrested on charges?  I hold that, if it were not for the people who organised the workers, they would be slaves, as they were in the past in Senator Counihan's time.  Surely the Senator does not want us to go back to that. Is that what he and his Party stand for&mdash;that the workers should go back to the days of slavery?  It is no wonder that the workers lose confidence in any Party with which Senator Counihan is associated.  According to his ideals, a farm labourer should be treated the same as a horse or a dog, but he would make sure that the horse was well fed. He would have no consideration for the labourer.  Some years ago, when the cost of living was low, £2 a week would be fairly good wages.  We did not hear Senator Counihan protest against the increase in the cost of living.  A fairly decent suit would cost a farm labourer at present about £12. We have had the statement by Senator McCabe that a shirt would cost £1 in Cavan and a pair of boots £3 10s. 0d. I do not know how a farm labourer, rearing a family on £2 a week, could get that amount together.</P>

Some of Senator Counihan's friends hold the lands taken from my ancestors when they were sent to Connacht, because they remained true to their religion and their country.  The Tourmakeady farmer has an uneconomic holding.  It was not land at all originally; it was reclaimed.  It is not really fair that he should be called a farmer.  I am sorry that Senator Counihan should hold him up as equal to the grabbers and graziers of Meath. I can tell Senator Counihan that the Tourmakeady farmers and their class were always true to this country. They went out and fought for this country when other people were fighting for somebody else.  However, that is going away from the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, Sir, it might be no harm at this stage to recall to the notice of the House the terms of the motion we are discussing.  I am not reflecting on anybody but I am afraid that members of the House who have not got the Order Paper in front of them may have forgotten the terms of the motion.  The motion moved by Senator Counihan is in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad is of opinion that the Government should introduce as early as practicable legislative proposals for the establishment of an arbitration tribunal to which all labour disputes in the agricultural industry would be compulsorily referred for determination during the period in which the compulsory tillage regulations are in force.</P>
      <P>Senator Counihan is obviously interested in a particular industry and a particular aspect of that industry, but whether he realises it or not, this motion does not relate merely to compulsory tillage regulations, nor is it a motion referring merely to agriculture. It is the thin edge of the wedge for compulsory arbitration in industrial disputes of all kinds.  Let us be under no illusion about it.  If there was any doubt in anybody's mind it was surely shattered when Senator Summerfield seconded the motion. Senator Summerfield is not interested in Senator Counihan's compulsory tillage, during the emergency and those who are going to support him are not concerned with compulsory tillage.  They are concerned only in establishing in some form the principle of compulsory arbitration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An argument could be used in favour of compulsory arbitration, but I would remind this House that the Governments which have been most successful in imposing compulsory arbitration in industrial disputes are Labour Governments, both in Australia and New Zealand and in each of the new New Zealand and Australian States.  They have adopted a form of compulsory arbitration, not for the purpose that Senator Counihan has in mind but for the opposite purpose&mdash;the purpose of <Col N="2470" /> ensuring that there shall be adequate organisation and that wages and conditions of employment will be brought up to a minimum standard in accordance with a formula laid down by the courts of the States.  That formula was established, as far as Australia was concerned, by an Irishman whose gifts we were receiving some weeks ago.  Judge Higgins of the Supreme Court of Australia is the man who laid down the standard for minimum conditions in Australia.  He said that the basic rate for the lowest paid grades of worker must be adequate to maintain a man and his wife and family in reasonable comfort in relation to the conditions of the time in which he lived.  In other words, he did not think of a minimum for 1945 related to the conditions of 1845.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that this is not the first motion relating to compulsory arbitration debated in this House even during the emergency.  Senator Counihan spoke on a previous motion of this kind and I have the report of his speech here.  It was delivered in this House, on the 24th April, 1940, just five years ago.  Senator Counihan was on the same topic then.  The motion was one tabled by Senator Douglas suggesting that the Seanad would welcome the introduction by the Government of a Bill generally amending the law in relation to trade disputes and providing for an industrial court to promulgate advisory judgments. Senator Douglas and those associated with him were not advocating compulsory arbitration.  They were advocating the establishment of a court of inquiry which would advise the Government in relation to matters leading up to trade disputes.  Speaking on that motion Senator Counihan said: &ldquo;I do not agree&rdquo;&mdash;he was voting for the motion, by the way, although he did not agree with it&mdash;&ldquo;with Senator Douglas or Senator Hayes&rdquo;&mdash;another member of the Fine Gael Party&mdash;&ldquo;in their suggestion for settling these disputes.&rdquo; The Senator went on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think the proposal made by Senator Douglas would only be tinkering at the job.  Strikes and lockouts and peaceful picketing should <Col N="2471" /> be prohibited by law.  In particular, peaceful picketing should be prohibited.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the Senator's mind travelled back over the dark ages and he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no such thing as peaceful picketing.  Peaceful picketing in a great many cases means attempted murder.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the speech of Senator Counihan delivered in this House on the 24th April, 1940, as reported in Col. 1091 of the Official Debates.  So that Senator Counihan is not thinking now entirely of the emergency or of agricultural wages.  For some reason that has never been clear to me, he has acted as if his mission in life were to get some kind of compulsory arbitration in industrial disputes&mdash;not that Senator Counihan is the type of man <Col N="2472" /> who wants cheap labour.  I make no reflection on him in that way.  I think he told us on the last occasion that he never had a labour dispute.  I believe he never had and I believe that, while Senator Counihan has been complaining of parties going around the country trying to get a wage of 55/- a week for agricultural labourers, in fact he himself was paying £3. per week.  I am saying that because I should like somebody to explain to the House the extraordinary mentality that permits a decent man like Senator Counihan, who has never had any labour disputes, to come in here and ask the House to tie men's hands, to tie them in a manner in which we have no right to tie them.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9 p.m. until Wednesday, 9th May, at 3 p.m.</P>
