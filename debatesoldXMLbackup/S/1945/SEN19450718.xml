      <P>With regard to the Order of Business, I understand that the Taoiseach will not be available to take No. 1 on the Order Paper &mdash;Emergency Powers (Continuance and Amendment) Bill&mdash;to-day, and it has been suggested that this business be placed first on the Order Paper tomorrow; that, second on that Order Paper will be the National Stud Bill; third, the Johnstown Castle Bill, and the remaining Bills received this week from the Dáil in a grouping of Departments. May I take it that there is agreement to that course?</P>

      <P>There is an amendment in the name of Senator Duffy on the Order Paper.  The amendment, Senator, is out of order.  It would in my understanding increase the charge on the State and, therefore, cannot be moved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to submit, <Col N="258" /> Sir, that if the statement that was made on the last occasion by the Minister is accurate, this is not imposing any increased charge: it is merely clarifying the position.  I understood that the stand taken by the Minister was that whatever sum would be required to meet these charges would be met by the State.  In other words, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that the fund will be nothing better and nothing worse because of this. If that is the case, then it cannot impose any charge on the State, because all we are asking for is that if, on examination, a deficit is discovered, the deficit will be made good in the manner suggested here in the amendment. I submit that that is not imposing any new charge on the State whatever.</P>

      <P>It seems to me, Senator, that if this amendment were agreed to, and if it became operative, there would be an increase of charge on the State.  However, in view of the submission you make, I should like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary on the point before ruling finally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Grady)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to this Bill is that we wish to treat all serving soldiers of the immediate past and of the future as having been in employment during the period of their service, as from a certain date, the 2nd September, 1939.  The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that these men will have adequate provision made for them to cover any period of unemployment consequent on their retirement. It is not the intention of the Bill to take from the Unemployment Fund in any respect.  This contribution must be regarded as an insurance premium to cover that liability in respect of these men from the start.  Any sums that may be necessary, I think, have to be provided in accordance with sub-section (2) of Section 2, which reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There shall be paid into the Unemployment Fund out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, by way of employers' and employed persons' contributions, such sums as will, in <Col N="259" /> the opinion of the Minister for Finance, be sufficient to enable discharged members of the Defence Forces to whom this section applies to be treated in the manner provided by sub-section (1) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That provision absolutely covers the point which Senator Duffy's amendment is intended to cover.  There is a guarantee there that whatever sums are necessary will have to be provided by the Minister for Finance to meet the obligations of this Bill.  Accordingly, in my opinion, that absolutely covers the point raised by Senator Duffy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>A difficulty I see is that Senator Duffy's amendment seeks to put in the Bill what the Minister said was his intention, and, therefore, I must assume that it must be so that it does not impose a new charge.</P>

      <P>It seems to me now that the point of order is well taken.  The amendment may be debated. Senator Duffy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is not meeting the exact case I made.  On the last occasion I was endeavouring to make clear what is the attitude the State is taking towards a body of men, perhaps 20,000, with a view to putting them into a position where they may get State unemployment benefit as a right, not as a dole, and not what was called uncovenanted benefits, but an actual claim to benefit under this Act.  I was endeavouring to point out to the Minister that it did not appear to be quite clear that provision was being made fully in the Bill to meet the charges that would arise in discharging these benefits.  The Minister was quite emphatic that at least so far as <Col N="260" /> the substance of the Bill was concerned, the intention was that moneys will be paid into the Unemployment Insurance Fund by the Minister for Finance to meet these obligations in full.</P>
      <P>When I look at this Bill, accepting all the time the Minister's assurance, because I think there is no doubt what the Minister's intention is, it seems to me from sub-section (2) of Section 2 that what was proposed here is that there shall be paid into the Unemployment Fund by way of employers' and persons' contributions, such sums as in the opinion of the Minister for Finance, would be sufficient to provide the benefits contemplated in sub-section (1) of Section 2.  Now, normally, the Unemployment Fund consists of contributions of employers, contributions of workers and the State contribution.  These three groups jointly make up the Unemployment Fund.  At times, that fund has been overdrawn.  There is a bookkeeping arrangement by which it is clear that when the expenditure from the fund is greater than the receipts that what might be commonly called an overdraft is provided to keep the fund going.  That sum has to be found, sooner or later, by the contributions of the State, the employers and the workers, so that the overdraft is paid off or repaid.</P>
      <P>I am just anxious that it will be made clear in this Act that the obligation on the Minister for Finance is to keep the fund out of which the soldiers' benefit will be paid in good standing itself without any claim on any other section of the fund.  The Minister said in effect that this is the intention.  My anxiety is to ensure that the intention is met in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion there are no grounds for Senator Duffy's amendment, adequate provision having been made in the Bill to provide that the necessary funds will be available. The Section I have already quoted, I think, meets the situation fully.  The funds are provided as Senator Duffy has pointed out, in the ordinary way for insured persons by a contribution of 10d. from the employer, 9d. from the employee and a contribution of <Col N="261" /> two-sevenths on the part of the State. The intention of the Bill is that similar contributions in respect of each soldier will be made and paid over into this fund and the Bill, when it becomes an Act, will be an adequate guarantee that the money must be provided.  Seeing that the provision is already made, I am afraid that I cannot accept Senator Duffy's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to insist that my interpretation is a better one than that of the Parliamentary Secretary. I am anxious to ensure that if it is found that the Minister for Finance has been wrong in his amendment, there is some means whereby the deficit can be made good as against the Minister for Finance. Under sub-section (2) the sum which will be paid into the unemployment fund is met by way of employers and workers' contributions which, in the opinion of the Minister for Finance, will be sufficient to meet forthcoming claims.  If it is discovered at the end of 12 months or two years that the Minister for Finance was wrong in his assumption that the sum he actually has paid in is insufficient to pay the expenses, what remedy has the Minister for Industry and Commerce as against the Minister for Finance to obtain the sum in deficit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is extremely unlikely that the Minister for Finance would become a defaulter.  Will he not be bound by law to make good these funds to the Minister for Industry and Commerce when the Minister informs him that these sums are necessary?  It should not be necessary to say that the Minister for Finance will go into default&mdash;nobody <Col N="262" /> in his wildest dreams would suggest that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to Senator Duffy that it is no use in pressing this amendment.  He is up against a stone wall.  It seems that the fundamental difference between the two is that in one case the Minister for Finance says how much shall be paid.  Nobody has questioned that.  Under Senator Duffy's amendment the fund or possibly the Minister for Industry and Commerce could take the Minister for Finance possibly to the courts to prove that what he paid in was not an adequate sum.  I am inclined to think that there is not an awful lot in it.  Theoretically, Senator Duffy is right, but practically, it does not matter and as there is opposition he would be better advised to withdraw.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (1), to delete the <Col N="263" /> words &ldquo;after consultation with&rdquo; in line 11, and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;with the concurrence of&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want, in the first place, to apologise to the Minister for giving him rather less time than I might have given to consider these amendments, but there is a certain fatality in that respect.  The purpose of the amendment is very obvious.  This is not an isolated case. The same wording occurs throughout the whole course of the Bill.  As the principle is exactly the same I only put down an amendment in one place to cover the whole lot.  The Minister has provided for consultation with the President of the High Court and I am perfectly certain that the Minister will tell me that no Minister for Justice, neither himself nor any subsequent Minister, would act in opposition to the wishes of the President of the High Court after he had been consulted.  I think, having regard to that, it would be better if it were specifically so stated in the Act.  It is not really from the point of view of the Minister that I am considering this.  For the reason that it is expressly set out in the Bill and in the Act, that the Minister merely consults the President of the High Court, it would be better if the President had to give his positive approval because then he would be likely to consider it very much more carefully and seriously before giving advice after consultation.  The Minister is at one with me in trying to ensure by every possible means that there shall be nothing directly or indirectly that will cause any possible chance of interference with the judges of the courts in the carrying out of their duties.  These duties are necessarily carried out not only when they are sitting in open court.  We all know perfectly well that it is possible to ensure by indirect means that a man carrying out a job is hampered through the staff and the facilities that may be made available to him.  I do not think that there is any attempt or suggestion here of doing that, but I want to ensure that it cannot be done in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not possibly accept this amendment <Col N="264" /> because its principle is one on which the Government could not give way.  Under the Court Officers Act of 1926 there was such a provision. There had been a practice of judicial patronage, and that was done away with.  The staff were to be under the control of the Minister and the Department responsible to the Oireachtas.  While, as the Senator says, any Minister will try to meet the wishes of the President of the High Court, the Minister could not for a moment allow the President of the High Court to have what would amount to a veto in the matter of staff. There is no intention of interfering with the judicial rights or functions of the judges, but in matters of management or control of staff no Minister could possibly give way.  Therefore, I could not possibly accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that the Minister claims that although the judges are independent as regards their functions constitutionally, those who are to carry out the various instructions the judges may give in the execution of orders of court, etc., are to be entirely under the Government? It seems to me that there should be some restriction.  I do not want to go back to judicial patronage and I do not suppose anybody else does.  I think this question applies pretty well to all the courts, and that, if a man is independent in his functions, he must take whatever officers he is ordered to take, in a very short time it is possible that may interfere with the independence of his functions.  There should be an obvious line of compromise.  To my mind the amendment proposed by Senator Sweetman is reasonable.  It does not give to the President of the High Court power to appoint anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>There is room for genuine difference of opinion.  The question is whether in the event of a difference of opinion, is the Government to have control over all the court officers?  I doubt if that is a right or a good principle.  I think the Minister is right from his point of view in the stand he takes.  He wants the Government to have absolute control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is dealt with in the Court Officers Act of 1926.  It is Section 65 and as it is a short section I will read it if I may.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Nothing in this Act shall prejudice or affect the control of any judge or justice over the conduct of the business of his court.</P>
      <P>(2)  When an officer attached to any court is engaged on duties relating to the business of that court which is for the time being required by law to be transacted by or before or under or pursuant to the order of a judge or judges of that court he shall observe and obey all directions given to him by such judge or judges.</P>
      <P>(3)  All proofs and all other documents and papers lodged or handed in to any court in relation to or in the course of the hearing of any suit or matter shall be held by or at the order and disposal of the judge or the senior of the judges by or before whom such suit or matter is heard.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is simply a matter of the control of the ordinary staff which must be in the same position with regard to the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance as any other staffs in the Civil Service.  The provision in the Bill is to make sure that that will be the case.  As far as judicial matters are concerned they are quite safeguarded. There is no question whatever of interfering with them.  If I accepted the amendment I would be accepting a right for judges which the judges do not claim.  I could not allow the judge to veto the Minister in the case of a purely staff matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving out the general principle, which we can discuss on the other sections, this is, presumably, going to happen only once.  The Minister is to make an Order to relieve the Master of the High Court of the Management of the central office. That is not a matter that affects the general status of the staff.  It is the exercise once of a function changing the whole management of the courts. I was rather mystified as to why the section was introduced at all in the form in which it was introduced&mdash;with the introduction of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;. It may be that there was necessity for the section, but the Minister could have come to the Oireachtas and said this should be done.  I do not quite understand why it is left in that discretionary way, unless the Minister intends to have further consultations with the President of the High Court. If he intends to have further consultations, the responsibility for this very sweeping change, in case it does not work, should not only be on the shoulders of the Minister, but on the shoulders of the President of the High Court, because, as I have said, the change is very sweeping.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is to consult the President of the High Court. It is unlikely that we shall be at variance in the manner suggested, but if it should come to that, the Minister could not agree to taking control of the staff out of his hands.  In this case, there has been consultation, and there will be consultation when the Bill is passed, with the President of the High Court as to what should be done.  I do not think that it interferes with the judges in any way.</P>

The only difference is that another official will take the place of the Master.  The provision is taken word for word from Section 5 of the Court Officers Act. So far as judicial work is concerned, the word of the President of the High Court is what will carry.  There will be no interference with the work of the judiciary but, as regards purely administrative work, the ordinary Civil Service regulations will apply to officers in the courts, as elsewhere.</P>

    <P>The same situation arises, to a large extent, in this case.  I suggest seriously to the Minister that the person most likely to know the most suitable officer of the courts to become examiner is the President of the High Court and not the Minister.  I suggest, therefore, that the President of the High Court should, if the word may be used, have a veto on any proposal to go outside the officers carrying on that department when the new appointment is about to be made.</P>

I shall not weary the House with a description of the way in which the work is carried out except to say that there are two chancery judges.  This Bill now provides that there shall be two examiners and that each of the examiners shall be in the same position as a private secretary, say a first executive officer, to the Minister.  The Minister would feel extremely aggrieved if he were not to have a voice in saying who was to be appointed his private secretary. The examiner must act in that position in regard to the chancery judge.  If we wish to preserve the independence of the chancery judges, I think we must ensure that they will have some say in the appointment of officers working under them who will be responsible for arranging and conducting all their business.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <Col N="273" /> The Agricultural Wages Act, 1936, provided for the fixing of minimum rates of wages for agricultural workers, made it an offence for an agricultural employer to pay an agricultural worker less than the minimum rate, and gave the agricultural worker power to recover by civil proceedings any sums due to him on account of payment of wages at less than the appropriate minimum rate.  The Act, however, did not provide any limit to the period in respect of which such arrears of wages could be recovered.  That is one of the principal points dealt with in this Bill.  There are five principal sections and as this is an amending Bill it would be well to deal with them.  Section 1 deals with the definition of contract.  Under the Act there are two types of contract of employment, one for a period less than five months and the other for a period of five months or over. In the first case wages are fixed for a week of 54 hours and, in the second case, there is no specification of the hours worked in a week.  Section 1 is merely to bring the present amending Bill into conformity with the principal legislation and, therefore, is of no great importance. Section 2 deals with a point that gave me, personally, a great deal of trouble and worry during the last seven or eight years.  Under the Principal Act the Minister has to determine whether the work is agricultural work or not. In many cases legal questions arise and I feel that it is not appropriate for the Minister to decide these; that it is better they should be referred to the courts to decide whether the work is agricultural or not.  The effect of the section is to ask the court to decide that issue.</P>
      <P>Section 3 is not of any great importance, because it would not be operative at all unless Section 4 becomes operative.  The section deals with summary prosecution cases where an employer was not paying the appropriate wage, and where, incidentally, in addition to that offence, he was at the same time building up arrears of wages.  Section 3 merely limits the arrears in such cases to two years, the same as in Section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 is the principal section, as <Col N="274" /> it seeks to limit to two years the period during which arrears of wages may be payable to the employee.  It lays down that the employee must make the claim within two years of leaving the employment. As the legislation stands, if an employee has worked for less than the minimum rate for an employer, he can claim for the difference between the fixed wage and the wage he was working for, over any number of years. From the point of view of the employer and the employee, I think the present arrangement very bad.  From 95 to 97 per cent. of the farmers are quite prepared to comply with the law, and are glad to pay a decent wage to an employee but a very small percentage, I must admit, of employers, for one reason or another, are anxious to get an employee to work at less than the minimum wage if they can get away with it.  But the employee who takes such a position would be doing a great disservice to his colleagues, because in a particular district, where it is known that a particular man is working for less than the minimum wage, that has an adverse effect on the labour market, so that employees in that area are somewhat at a disadvantage in regard to the minimum wage.  I should say, taking the cases that have been put to me, that it is much more important from the point of view of the employees to have this amendment made than in the case of employers, because employer have to pay in the end.  But it has such a bad effect on the employee's colleagues that we should try to make it right as soon as possible.  That is looking at it from the material interest of employer and employee, but looking at it from the higher standpoint, that of justice, in the case of the employer who gets a man at less than the minimum wage, if we say to an employee that he must come along within two years and claim what is due to him, and if we make that the law, I have no doubt that employees in general will come along within two years and that employers will have to pay up.  Therefore, I think we may leave the employers out of the question, because we may take it for granted that they will have to pay in genuine cases of contract for agricultural service between the ordinary <Col N="275" /> farmer and the ordinary labourer. Really what induced me to bring in the amending Bill was representations from the agricultural wages committees and the Agricultural Wages Board.</P>
    <P>I cannot expect Senators to be familiar with all the details of administration. They may not be familiar with the constitution of these boards. We have the Twenty-Six Counties divided into five area committees. There are five or six counties represented on each committee, and on each committee we have representatives of employers and employees.  These committees meet from time to time under the chairmanship of the Chairman of the Agricultural Wages Board.  They make recommendations which are afterwards considered by the Agricultural Wages Board.  The board is composed of four representatives of employers and four representatives of employees, as well as three neutral members.  These are not farmers or farm labourers.  They are neutral members, and are there to advise the chairman in case there is a clash of interests between the two parties.  Now, as a matter of fact, in our activities so far, the board have usually agreed unanimously to any proposition that they did agree to, and the neutral members, therefore, had very little to do, but the point at issue here is this matter of arrears of wages.  All these agricultural committees agreed unanimously &mdash;both employers' representatives and employees' representatives&mdash;that we should limit the period within which arrears should be paid.  As a matter of fact, the limit that they unanimously agreed to and put up to me was 12 months.  That proposal was agreed to unanimously by these committees and put up to me, but I thought that 12 months was too short a period, and accordingly I put in two years instead. That is the period that is fixed in this particular clause&mdash;two years.</P>
    <P>Now, first of all, I should like Senators to keep in mind that where you have the ordinary case of the ordinary farmer and the ordinary labourer, and where the ordinary labourer, for one reason or another, agrees to take 36/- or 38/- a week <Col N="276" /> instead of 40/- a week, which, I think, is the minimum wage for agricultural labourers in most parts of the country, it is reasonable to say that if the employee concerned gets sorry afterwards and wants to claim the balance due to him, he should get two years in which to make his claim, and no more, and that even from the point of view of his fellow-workers that is a good thing.  From the point of view of the employer, although, to some extent, it may have been his own fault, it is also a good thing because, not alone will he have to pay up the arrears of wages, but he may be penalised by a fine in court, which might amount to more than the arrears of wages due.  However, it was not the ordinary case that the agricultural committees had in mind, but rather some peculiar types of cases, of which I propose to give a few examples. No. 1 is the case where the employee is a relative of the employer, and No. 2 is where the employee is employed by an employer who has a shop in the local town as well as a farm in the country.  Practically all these peculiar cases fall into those two classes.  One case came before me in 1943.  That was the case of a widower in the country who had a small farm. A cousin of his who was, as one might say, I suppose, at a loose end and looking for a job, came to the widower and said, in the usual way: &ldquo;Well, I am a cousin of yours, and you might give me a job, and I will not expect much in the way of wages.&rdquo;  They agreed between themselves, and they lived together.  The wages were not very high, but the employee was treated in the same way as the employer; he dined at the same table with his employer and went out, I presume, in the evening, with the employer to the local publichouse, had a few drinks, tobacco, and so on; but the wages were not high.  The employee was a rather oldish man; it was a small farm, and for the six winter months they had very little work to do.  They just marked time, so to speak, attended to a few cows, and so on, and between them they did very little work in the day.  After seven years, however, they fell out, and the employee claimed the sum of £303 <Col N="277" /> 12s. 2½d.  If he had succeeded in his claim&mdash;I am not sure if he did succeed; I think he did not&mdash;it would have meant that he would have become the owner of the farm, and the other fellow would have been his employee.  Not that that would have made very much difference in the particular case, and I suppose the same thing would happen again and they would both live together; but it just goes to show you what can happen where the rules and regulations are so rigid and where an employee must be paid a minimum wage.</P>
    <P>That is one example, and we have many others, of relatives being employed in similar circumstances.  Let us come now to the case of a small shopkeeper.  In this case the shopkeeper was a lady who owned a small shop.  I do not know if Senators have observed this in the country&mdash;I know that I have observed it many years ago &mdash;that a man is more willing to work with a country shopkeeper or publican with a bit of land at much lower wages than with the ordinary farmer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Senator A Senator">
      <NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not exactly know why, but one man said to me: &ldquo;Well, my chances are good, and I would have no chance on the farm&rdquo;.  At any rate, they are prepared to work for less wages, whatever the reason may be. This lady had a small shop, and the man concerned agreed to work with her for a small wage because his chances were good, but his &ldquo;chances&rdquo; were not recognised by the Agricultural Wages Board.  He came along afterwards and claimed £400, and the lady in question said: &ldquo;Well, if he succeeds in his claim he can have the farm and the shop and I will go to work for him&rdquo;.  Another case that I shall give is that of a man with a small business and farm of, I think, 11 acres, who employed a man under certain conditions, to which the employee agreed. After five years they had a falling out, and the claim put in by the employee was for £250.  Now, these are typical cases where any ordinary person would say that it was not fair, since the particular man went to work with a relative or with a country shopkeeper and <Col N="278" /> said that he was quite satisfied with the wages he was given in the beginning. Probably, he was quite satisfied for four, five or six years, until they had a falling out, and then, owing to the law and the rigid nature of the regulations, that man could practically claim his employer's whole estate and become owner himself.</P>
      <P>These are the types of cases we have in mind in the amendment in Section 4.  I would have been very anxious, if possible, to deal with these peculiar cases in another way, but it does not appear to be possible to do so.  If we were to say, for instance, that a second cousin could not claim against a third cousin, and so on, or that an employee could not make a claim against a man who had both a shop and a farm, we might be doing an injustice to the employee in such cases, and so, I think, it is better to treat the matter in the way proposed here.</P>
      <P>If the relative or the shopkeeper concerned is foolish enough to make such an agreement and to take on a person to work under such conditions, then the worst that can happen to the employer is that he or she will have to make up the two years' difference between what was agreed to and the minimum wage, and I think that so far as the genuine employer is concerned, we can agree that if the employee feels that he is not being properly treated, the fact that he has two years in which to make up his mind about claiming the arrears ought to be sufficient to satisfy him.</P>
      <P>Section 5 deals with a somewhat different type of case from those in Section 4.  In the Principal Act it was laid down that if both the employer and the employee agreed that the employee was not of full mental and physical capacity and made an application to the board accordingly, the board might grant an exemption from the minimum wage requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was not a very large number of cases.  I think that in all there were about 2,000 cases in which applications were made under the Act since its passage in 1936.  What happened in all those cases was that we sent an inspector to investigate.  We never agreed without sending an inspector <Col N="279" /> to see both employer and employee, and in about 75 per cent. of the cases exemption was granted.  Then the employer was free to employ the particular person without paying the minimum wage, but there have again been cases of great hardship where employers did not know there was such provision under the Act and where they neglected to exercise their rights under the Act.</P>
    <P>I can recollect one case in particular, in County Tipperary, where there was a mentally defective person who could not get work and who was in a very pitiable state indeed.  He was fairly useful on a farm, but he was not by any means capable of carrying out all farm operations, and the clergyman came to a certain farmer and asked him to take on this poor man.  The farmer said that the man was not worth the wage and the clergyman replied that he would work for half the wage.  The farmer said that was all he was worth and after great persuasion gave him a job.  After four or five years, this man was evidently instructed in his rights, and he applied to the court to secure payment of the difference between the minimum wage and the wage at which he had been working.  As the Act stood, he was entitled to it, and he got a large sum of money.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill proposes to give an opportunity to an employer to plead before the court that the employee was not of sound mind or physically sound, and if the court believes or is satisfied that the complaint is justified, then they may, as it were, retrospectively decide that the person was not of sound mind or physically sound, and in that case the arrears of wages could not be granted.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the title and the code of legislation.  I think that is all I have to say in asking the Seanad to agree to the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the explanation of Section 5 which the Minister has just given probably explains the whole attitude of his Department to the Act of 1936.  Section 5 deals with <Col N="280" /> the people who are presumed to be mentally deficient, and I imagine the Bill is designed very largely for those who are mentally deficient, because the proposal here is to cover the case of a man, such as this workman in Tipperary, who was employed at less than the minimum rate.  It is going to be open to the employer, in his defence to an action in which the workman is claiming repayment to him of the difference between the minimum rate and what he is receiving, to say that the man was mentally deficient, and I imagine that any court will hold that a man who has been accepting 10/- a week when the minimum is 40/- a week was mentally deficient.  If the Minister succeeds in persuading the House to adopt Section 5, I think he can drop the rest of the Bill.</P>
      <P>On the whole, his approach to this situation is desperately reactionary. Take, for instance, his proposal to repeal Section 2 of the Principal Act. Section 2 followed the line of policy which has been pursued by this Government for 12 or 13 years, that was to say, that in cases of dispute in regard to the interpretation of something or other, the decision was given by the Minister rather than by the court.  Many people would quarrel with that policy.  I remember there was a quarrel over the National Health Insurance Act, the Act which unified health insurance societies, because the former practice of referring to the court questions of interpretation was abandoned and the Minister claimed the right to determine any matter in dispute as to whether a person was insurable or things of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something similar has been done under the Unemployment Assistance Act, a departure from the order Unememployment Insurance Acts where a court, actually the High Court, determined whether a person was or was not insurable.  That policy was followed in this Act of placing on the Minister the right to determine a matter in dispute or whether a person is an agricultural worker or not.  On previous occasions that policy was defended by the Minister's colleagues on the grounds that it would be unreasonable to put people, particularly people without any organisation behind <Col N="281" /> them, to the expense of going to court to have their status determined, and some people who took the view that those competent to interpret an Act are the courts, accepted the argument put up by the Government that it would be unreasonable to force workmen to have their rights determined in court when the Minister was just as capable and competent as any court to decide matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>Now, the Minister abandons that and he has put nothing in its place.  He repeals sub-section (2) of Section 2 of the 1936 Act so that if a workman takes a case, say, to the Circuit Court or the District Court, for repayment of a sum of money due to him, and the employer raises the issue that the employment was not agricultural work, it is not clear who is going to determine it or who is not going to determine it.  The District Court may take the view that they were not competent to decide it. It may have to go elsewhere.  No provision is being put into the new legislation to take the place of provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 2 which are being repealed, under which the Minister has placed upon him the responsibility of defining whether the particular employment was or was not agricultural work.  I think that is a mistake.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to make it clear what the procedure will be in future when a question arises as to whether a particular job is or is not agricultural work, and the method should be inexpensive and simple.  It has been argued by various people, the Minister himself included, that the number of people organised in agricultural employment is small.  The Minister put the figure at less than 2 per cent. in any organisation at all, which means there are many of these cases.  The claimant is then a poor man who has no money to risk on briefing barristers, paying solicitors or, in fact, in losing time attending the court.</P>
    <P>In regard to the next point, the limit of two years in respect of which a workman can recover, seems to me to be wrong.  Employers will, in the main, be well-informed and reasonably intelligent men.  An employer can truthfully say that he does not know there was a <Col N="282" /> trade board rate fixing wages at such a figure, and it is almost inevitable that a large number of workmen will not know there are wages boards, and will not, very often, know what these rates are.</P>
    <P>The rates of minimum wages are changed from time to time.  Probably five or six changes have been made since 1939.  Workmen have, therefore, tremendous difficulties in establishing their claims at all.  I put it to any member of this House how difficult it is going to be for the workman who is working with an employer in some rural part of Ireland for the last six years to go into court and cite for the justice the rate applicable to his employment at the different periods during the last six years, having regard to the fact that these rates have been changed from time to time.  It is going to be a difficult thing, and I suggest that the workman should be facilitated in establishing his claim, rather than having it made more difficult for him to make it.  This is one of the few places in which a Minister comes to the House and says that a law was passed a number of years ago, and that a number of people have evaded that law and that we must not be too hard on them.</P>
    <P>That was the Minister's statement to the House.  He mentioned a case where a workman had to recover £340, which would be tantamount to taking over the place, but that defence is never raised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance when they seek to justify convictions involving, fines of, perhaps, £3,000 to £5,000, and the question of whether the man concerned is driven out of business or not is not permitted to influence the Minister's mind.</P>
    <P>What happens here is that an employer knows quite well he is obliged by law to pay minimum wages, and feels happy getting away with paying less.  If the minimum rate is 40/- and the employer gets away with paying only 37/6 because the workman accepts it, he is charmed at getting away with 2/6, because he feels he has something up on his neighbours, even though he might spend several times more than that 2/6 in other directions.  It reminds <Col N="283" /> me of the man who travels by train and manages to get out of the railway station without buying a ticket.  Having escaped, he spends at the other end of his journey two or three times what would have bought him his ticket. That is what you are encouraging here.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to find some means of ensuring that not merely the workman will recover but that the workman will be entitled to recover arrears of wages due over other periods and steps should be taken by the Department to see that the money will be recovered.  That is not being done.  There was a return issued in the Dáil last February showing the number of inspections carried out over a period of seven years and the number of prosecutions and convictions. In the last couple of years they were infinitesimal.  In 1944 there was only one conviction out of probably three or four prosecutions and the size of the fines inflicted was so small that it will act as an inducement to pay less than the minimum rates, an entirely unsatisfactory state of affairs, not merely unfair to the workman but to the other farmers who are conscientiously paying the full rates.  I am totally opposed to the principle of this Bill and I propose to vote against it.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of placing a prohibition on the institution of proceedings after a certain date on which a man has left employment, I am in sympathy.  A man who is not prepared to take proceedings, say, within two years after he has left the employment, ought to be barred.  There ought to be some time in which proceedings should be instituted.  I distinguish between the practice in this Bill as to the period in which arrears may be recovered.  I have said that I propose to vote against the Bill and that is the only protest I can make at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a great deal to be said about this Bill but I confess that I would have expected Senator Duffy to proceed along a different line in his approach to the problems raised by the Bill itself.  I <Col N="284" /> have never thought the Agricultural Wages Act a satisfactory instrument. It may be more satisfactory after this Bill, but so far I confess I cannot see how it has benefited either employers or employees.</P>
      <P>From the knowledge I have been able to glean about it, I feel that it has succeeded in cutting out more men from work on the land than it has succeeded in putting into employment. No doubt it is true that it has helped employees in many instances. They have been paid higher rates of wages in some counties anyhow, than they received before the passage of the Act.  I would say that is notable in the Minister's own county in view of the figures we saw before the passage of this law.  Two main points are being covered by the present Bill.  I have some experience of the way the 1936 Act operated and the injustices perpetrated by it in the clauses which the Minister now seeks to amend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Duffy has suggested that few employees can truthfully say that they know the details of the fixed minimum wage.  I can truthfully say that a great many employees have a better appreciation of it than their employers, and that the employees know more about their rights than the employers.  If you want to meet a group of people in which there is colossal ignorance in regard to payments, go among the ordinary farmers of the country.  Most of the farmers who have been prosecuted and persecuted in the courts under this Act were completely in ignorance of what the law was.  I have knowledge of instances myself where sometimes employers were taken into court in respect of persons employed by them who are actually mentally defective. They have kept them all the time quite unaware of the fact that they could obtain exemption from the Agricultural Wages Board.  They were brought to court and paid the penalty of their ignorance and kindness of heart, because that is really what it was.  There is no use in suggesting that there is justice in a law that will operate like that.  Truly the Minister is doing something to redress the burden of injustice that the original <Col N="285" /> Act imposed.  The other point made by Senator Duffy is that an employee cannot look for arrears of wages beyond a period of two years.  I do not know whether Senator Duffy has lost contact with the country mentality, but you would be surprised how very wary and clever the agricultural workers can be in some of these matters. The agricultural worker can go into service, knowing right well what his rights are and not struggling very bitterly to get his rights, knowing that the law gives him protection. That has been the position in a number of cases up to the present.  There is no excuse for the employer who will not pay his employee decently.  I do not know just how much one is permitted to say on that, but I said in the beginning that this is a very ineffective instrument.  One might call it a rule of thumb method of determining the relationship between employer and employee in regard to wages.  It is not based on any solid facts.  It is not based on the capacity of the farmer to pay, or the need of the labourer, on whether in the one instance the produce of the farm enables the farmer to pay or whether in the other instance the payment is adequate from the point of view of the maintenance of the worker, his family and his home.</P>
    <P>I would have hoped that Senator Duffy would have proceeded to discuss the Bill from that angle, that no satisfactory relationship has been established. The Bill never purported to do that.  I have tried to discover from the people who sit on the Wages Board how they proceed to determine wages and I have never got much enlightenment. I put it to the Minister that all of us are resting on our oars.  There has got to be a completely new approach to the payment of wages to workers and the capacity of the industry to pay.  I do not know how many members of the House have seen the scales of allowances which can be taken into account in paying agricultural workers.  It will be seen from these scales that the farmer is entitled to put down 3d. against the agricultural worker's tea.  One wonders how the farmer was able to manage tea for 3d.  I think 3d. is the figure now, but <Col N="286" /> perhaps it was 2d. or 2½d. some time ago.  You can put butter, tea and bread down, but not one of the commodities that go to make the worker's meal can be purchased for the amount which is entered as the allowance against that commodity.</P>
    <P>I am drawing the attention of the House to this in order to indicate that the whole approach to the regulation of the relationship between employer and employee is thoroughly unsound and unsatisfactory, and is not helping to add to the numbers employed on the land.  It is regarded by a great many farmers as a very defective piece of mechanism.  The Minister will have to face up to the responsibility of instituting some machinery whereby it will be possible to determine what is the minimum which any employee anywhere ought to obtain, so as to give him a standard of frugal comfort that will enable him to be a physically fit man to do his job.  Having discovered that, the Minister has got to put the industry in a position to better that responsibility. I support this Bill because it is doing something to amend the faults of the original Act.  In my view, the original Act has a great many faults and makes an entirely wrong approach to the whole problem of defining the relations between employers and employees.  It would be much better for the employers and workers if we were organised in such a way that we could decide this matter ourselves.  I suggest to Senator Duffy that the best approach is not to deride the farmers, and to point to them as a group of people who do not want to pay their debts, or who want to pay their workers much less than their service is worth.</P>

With regard to the problem of the labourer on the land and improving conditions, even for the farmer, I feel we have been brought to the stage that it is only by raising the standard of living for the agricultural labourers and putting the industry in a position to pay them the necessary wages, that the farmer will attain the status which he ought to have got long ago.  If he has to make <Col N="287" /> the case that he has got to provide so much for his agricultural worker, perhaps the rest of the community will be taught to realise that he has got to be provided with the wherewithal to do that.</P>

      <P>I feel that I have not got a sufficiently intimate knowledge of agricultural matters to be able to speak with any authority on the different points raised by the last two speakers.  There is, however, one small point which occurs to me as a lawyer. Under the Agricultural Wages Bill, agricultural wages are fixed at a certain sum.  There is a contract made by law between the employer and workman.  That contract is one which should be carried out by the employer. If the employer does not carry it out he can by the provisions of this Act be brought to book and made to pay the amount which the worker has been underpaid.  But why should this obligation to pay be confined to two years?  In an ordinary contract the amount that can be recovered is confined to a debt within six years.  Where a contract is made by the provisions of a statute the period of limitation in law is 20 years.  I could well see that it would be absurd to have a 20 years' period of limitation in a case like this, but if it turns out that a worker has been underpaid for a period of over two years, I cannot see why he should not be entitled to recover for the legal contractual period of six years the money which for one reason or another he ought to have been paid, but was not paid.  There may be very good reasons, but <i>prima facie</i>, I do not see why he should be treated any worse in respect of his contract than any other person who has undertaken work for a definite sum, who has not been paid and goes to law to assert his rights.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the word &ldquo;reactionary&rdquo; now.  I am proud of being reactionary, because we do not do that.  Perhaps Senator Duffy is not a reactionary.  I do not know. Senator Duffy raised the point about convenience for the employee putting his case to the Minister rather than going to court, but the employee is in court in any case.  The employee is actually in court claiming the wages that are due to him, that is, the difference between the wage he contracted for and the minimum wage.  I am dealing with Section 2 now.  The only change we are making as regards Section 2 is that we ask the district justice first to decide if it is agricultural work.  If he decides that it is, he goes on to hear the claim.  If he decides that it is not agricultural work, then the claim is rejected.  I am only mentioning that to rebut Senator Duffy's point that it is inconvenient for a man to go to court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is agreed I take it, that the workman would have to finance his case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I will deal with that, but first I make the point that he is not going to court on this particular <Col N="289" /> issue.  It is only an added issue and, therefore, it is not an extra inconvenience for the employee.  I hold there are cases of more legal importance than anything else, and it is proper for the district justice to decide them.  A case came before the High Court in 1942 and that court ruled that despite the definition given in the Act of what an agricultural worker is, it did not give the Minister power to decide on so technical a question of law as contract of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was their decision, and I had to be very particular ever since about what I would give a decision on.  It is better to leave the whole issue to the court to decide in future.  Senator Duffy asked what is the rule with regard to the amount.  I think the rule is that where a claim is under £25 it goes to the District Court, and where it is over £25 and under £300 it goes to the Circuit Court. I take it there is an appeal, if necessary, from that court to a higher one.  The Senator also raised the point that the board would see to these matters.  They do, of course.  I have never heard of a case anywhere where an employee appealed to the board, saying he felt he was wrongly treated, that the board have not dealt with.  The board made a large number of inspections during the last six or seven years and comparatively few cases came to court.  The inference is that the inspector on the spot was able to convince the employer that he was doing wrong and that the employer accepted it and paid up the arrears. In such a case the inspector did not insist on the case going to court, because he felt that the employer was, perhaps, ignorant of the law.  When he got things fixed up in an amicable way, he did not go to court.  There were something like 52,000 cases inspected in the last seven years, 7,000 irregularities were found, and of these only about 50 cases were brought to court.  That is why I say it must be taken that of these 7,000 cases practically all were believed by the inspectors to be due to misapprehension or ignorance and it was found that the employers are willing to make things right.  Where the employee has a grievance or believes he has been badly treated, the board will institute <Col N="290" /> proceedings and bear the necessary costs to get things right.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Baxter. Perhaps if my speeches at the beginning were read, it would be seen that I had no great hopes from the Act but, personally, I was rather agreeably surprised by its results.  It worked very much more smoothly than I ever expected.  On the whole, when we look back on it, I think it was rather well-framed. First, you had these committees in the various areas, composed of representatives of employers and employees.  They made recommendations to the board, which was composed of four representatives from the employers and four from the employees, with three neutral members and a chairman.</P>
    <P>The legislation was framed in this way, that when the board dealt with the question of wages and the employers and employees agreed, that meant that it was an order of the board and nobody could question it further.  Where it was impossible to get the employers and the employees to agree, the chairman made a ruling but he had the three neutral members to consult and support him.  In fact, what we had was a system of arbitration. The chairman tried to get agreement between employers and employees. I should say that we had conciliation because the chairman tried to get agreement.  We had conciliation in the first instance and arbitration afterwards.  As far as I can remember, for the last seven years the chairman had never to dictate a decision.  He was always successful in getting employers and employees to agree upon the minimum wage.  When we look back on that fact we will have to agree that the legislation in this respect was very successful.  The fact that there was only one conviction in the last 12 months does not prove very much.</P>
    <P>Most Senators will agree that the great majority of agricultural workers are getting more than the minimum wage and it would be extremely difficult to get a worker to work for less. I am not surprised that there have been very few convictions.  I have no doubt at all that there were contraventions of the Act in the beginning. <Col N="291" /> If there should be, in the years to come, depression in agriculture again, we might have the same conditions prevailing.  The board will have to be more vigilant but, at the moment, it has very little to do so far as that is concerned.  Senator Kingsmill Moore told us that, under the present law, money due under contract can be recovered up to 20 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The period under an ordinary contract is six years and under the provisions of a statutory contract 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>So that, in the ordinary way, if this provision were not made, the period would be 20 years.  It is a question of deciding what the number of years should be.  I tried at the outset to impress on Senators that, in the interest of employer and employee, we should try to shorten the period. Senators who have the interest of the employee at heart will agree that, even amongst agricultural employees, there are some who might be described as &ldquo;bright boys&rdquo;.  They would be prepared to go to an employer when work would be hard to get and offer to work at 5/- less than the minimum rate. They would say that they did not believe that the Government should interfere in these matters but they would be aware that, after working for four or five years, they could recover the arrears of the balance of the minimum wage from the farmers.  Consider the damage that they would do to their brother employees who were trying to get the best wage so as to rear their families properly.  That sort of behaviour has a depressing effect on a whole area because the farmer who employs the man tells a brother farmer that he is not paying the minimum wage because he does not think that it is justified.  The effect is that wages are depressed and the whole Act goes into abeyance in that particular district.  I do not think that representatives of employees should countenance or encourage such conduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the other House, I asked trade union leaders to say what they would do with a man in one of their unions who would accept less than the fixed wage.  Suppose that the wage for carpenters <Col N="292" /> is £4 10s. and that a carpenter, finding it difficult to obtain work, offers to work at £4 5s.  If he went back to his union secretary after six or 12 months, would the union secretary say: &ldquo;My poor man, we shall get your wages back for you&rdquo;?  Would he not rather say to him that he was the next thing to a blackleg and deserved no sympathy?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the meantime, he would try to recover the back money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but would not the union secretary like to have a thing like that reported to him as quickly as possible?  He would hardly like to have it going on for 20 years.  I think that the period of two years provided in the Bill is long enough and that it is in the interest both of employers and employees. On these area committees and on the board, representatives of the employees were as keenly in favour of this provision as representatives of the employers because they saw that, if they allowed these matters to drag on, they would have an adverse effect on those in whom they were interested.</P>

      <P>Senators will already be aware of the general purpose underlying this Bill, which is indicated in the Title, but it is necessary for me, in the first instance, to give a brief account of the circumstances which make the passing of this measure necessary.  Before 1840, borough corporations received grants of property, particularly lands, frequently in return for services rendered to the national authority.  They had very wide powers in regard to the disposal and use of such property.  As a result of social changes and widespread abuses, they were converted into trustees by Act of Parliament in 1840.  Thereafter, the use to which they could put funds became more and more limited and defined by statute.  Senators will recall the legislation by which the granting of leases was strictly controlled through Acts of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities that have come into existence in the past 100 years were in an unfavourable position in regard to the acquisition of property since, although they might acquire property either by agreement or compulsion, they might not acquire or administer gifts made to them.  All such property must be administered according to several codes relating to public health, housing, etc.  In particular, they have no powers to acquire property which can be administered apart from the ordinary revenues <Col N="294" /> accruing from rates and grants from the Central Fund.  Within recent years, public-spirited citizens have begun to take an increasing interest in the civic development of the localities with which their families are associated and several cases have arisen in which great difficulties have asserted themselves in enabling bequests for civic purposes to be administered for the benefit of the communities concerned.</P>
    <P>Two cases of note may be briefly related.  Mr. Daniel McGrath, who died in 1941, bequeathed over £48,000 for the benefit of Muinebeag citizens.  The High Court on the application of Mr. McGrath's Trustees settled a scheme for the administration of certain charitable trusts and a second body of trustees known as the McGrath Memorial Trustees were appointed to assist and advise the trustees of the will.  It was necessary to pass an Act in order to give effect to Mr. Daniel McGrath's intentions because of the limited powers accorded to local authorities, as already stated.  The second example is that of a bequest by the late Sir John Arnott of the town of Bandon where the town commissioners were also trustees for the Bandon town park.  Difficulties arose because the commissioners as a statutory body could not act as trustees.  In fact in order that a local authority may take advantage of a gift by an individual, until this Bill is passed, it is necessary that a trust be formed with all the attendant complications and difficulties which that involves.  There is a lack of public interest in charitable trusts of that kind and therefore, as I have said, up to now there has been difficulty in this matter.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of pleasure to all of us that one of the greatest living Irishmen, Mr. George Bernard Shaw, proposed that a law should be enacted enabling public-spirited citizens to bequeath funds for the general civic improvement of any local authority.  He pointed out that under present circumstances it was not possible for him to leave to Carlow Urban District Council a certain property which he owned there as the nucleus of a fund for the <Col N="295" /> general improvement of the town, to which any citizen could contribute, and to which further bequests could be made by persons or companies who, in addition to being interested in charitable work, desired to associate themselves with the progress of the community in which they lived.</P>
    <P>Mr. Shaw made it very clear that he was in no way in favour of a charitable trust, because of the attendant complications, and he pressed, to paraphrase his own words, that we should pass an Act enabling every Irish municipality to establish and administer a voluntary civic improvement fund open to all citizens who have property which they desire to give or bequeath to their country.  The Carlow Urban District Council agreed with him.</P>
    <P>The Government accepted Mr. Shaw's suggestion, and, indeed, since the Bill was introduced, it has become popularly known as the Shaw Bill.  I should say in passing that we who have watched Mr. George Bernard Shaw since the days when he did more to arouse the social conscience of the English-speaking world than perhaps any other one individual, are delighted that he should be associated with a particular change in our local government organisation which should be an advantage to the Irish people in the future.</P>
    <P>The Bill enables a local authority to accept gifts on the condition that it adopts a civic improvement scheme and inaugurates a civic improvement fund for this purpose.  The administration of the funds will be under the direction of the local authority, and is for this purpose a reserve function. Revenues arising from bequeathed property or funds may be invested from time to time as considered desirable. It is for the High Court to decide whether a local authority can vary a particular scheme because of complications that may arise.  It will be noted that in Section 2 a civic improvement scheme may be of a particular class, or if drawn up in general terms may cover a number of different schemes, all of which must be conducive to the welfare of the inhabitants concerned.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that Senators will welcome <Col N="296" /> this new power given to local authorities, as we are all aware that one of the great needs of the present day is the stimulation of civic pride throughout the land.  Contributions both from the Exchequer and from the rates have reached such a high level that the ordinary revenues of a local authority must be largely applied to essential purposes, although in the organisation of libraries, vocational education and agricultural activities the field of local government has been extended for social and economic improvement.</P>
    <P>I could give many examples of purposes to which voluntary contributions and civic improvements funds could be devoted.  They would include memorial parks, scholarships for certain purposes, prizes for the advancement of agricultural competence, for the advancement of the Irish language or athletics, contributions towards the repertory theatre movement, the establishment of agricultural shows and for the creation of any amenities beautifying towns and villages; also, in Mr. Shaw's terms, experimental innovations, home modernisation and progressive work not likely to be otherwise undertaken.</P>
    <P>The Bill in its present form is elastic in character and, as I have said before a civic improvement scheme may be of a general character or it may be confined to the establishment of a particular amenity arising from a special bequest. It is hoped that the effect of the Bill will be cumulative and that once a bequest is made encouragement will be given to other persons to give contributions in aid of a particular scheme.  Provision is made in the Bill for publicising the existence of a civic improvements scheme in order that citizens will be reminded every year that they may add their contribution to the fund.</P>
    <P>Another section of the Bill makes it clear that expenses in connection with publicity may be defrayed from the fund itself or, if necessary, can be defrayed out of the municipal fund poor rate, borough rate or the town rate, as the case may be, save in the case of vocational education and agricultural committees, where the cost must be defrayed out of the fund itself <Col N="297" /> It is open to local authorities to defray the cost from the improvements fund in all cases that they so desire, but since the first bequest might be small it was felt desirable to enable such expenditure to become a charge on the rates.  Vocational and agricultural committees, however, are not rate-raising powers, and in this case of necessity the fund must bear the cost.</P>
    <P>A section of the Bill makes town commissioners who are not already a body corporate act in such a way for the purpose of administering a civic improvements fund.  It will be recalled that similar powers have been given to town commissioners in connection with the acquisition of land for housing or other purposes.  The Bill is comparatively straightforward and I recommend it with great enthusiasm to the members of the Seanad for Second Reading, because I believe that it is one more step in the advancement of local administration and it enables personal initiative to be associated with the work of local authorities.  It enables both rich and poor to give contributions, large or small, towards any civic improvement fund that is established and to take a personal interest themselves or through a local authority in how the money is spent. I have great pleasure in recommending the Bill for Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On this side of the House we, of course, also welcome this Bill.  It does fill a need that has been obvious since Mr. Shaw by his munificence to the town of Carlow publicised the void there was in our local government legislation.  I only want to refer to a couple of small matters on this stage to which the Parliamentary Secretary might address himself and explain more clearly.  He has correctly said that the adoption of a scheme is a reserve function of a county council.  I would have thought that it would have meant, shall I say, better drafting if in addition to that, the making of an application to the High Court to vary any scheme so adopted, were also a reserve function because as drafted&mdash;it is not likely to happen&mdash;a scheme might be satisfactory to the elected members but not <Col N="298" /> to the manager and the manager might, at a subsequent date, make an application without the consent of the elected representatives.  I think as the section is worded, there can be no doubt that that can be done.</P>
      <P>There is a second matter about which I should like to be quite clear. I am not perfectly happy about the exact meaning of Section 5.  I appreciate that town commissioners in certain instances have not got a seal, but am I correct in thinking that under Section 5 it is only a town which already has commissioners that can adopt a civic improvements scheme? For example, how are we to deal with a gift to an area which has no town commissioners in existence, although, possibly, it may have a parish council?</P>
      <P>I think that there should be a provision&mdash;if the provision is not already implied, and I do not think it is&mdash;that the county council would be in a position to say, for a particular electoral division of the county concerned: &ldquo;We shall adopt civic improvements scheme A for one division, and civic improvements scheme B for another division&rdquo;, in cases where two gifts came to them. I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to make it clear to us if that can be done.  However, I also would seriously ask him to consider this matter of the variation of the scheme being made a reserved function.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator Sweetman, he is right in saying that a variation of the scheme is not a reserved function under this Bill, but I would put it to him that it is almost inconceivable that a county manager would, improperly or against the wishes of the county council, proceed to the High Court, with all the complications that would be involved, and ask for a variation of the scheme.  It seems to me that the county manager would be placed in a most difficult position if he had to act in that way, and at any rate we have assumed that he would not do so except in most extraordinary circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I would not say that, exactly, but, definitely, variation is not a reserve function.  With regard to the point of a small town, with no town commissioners, a civic improvements schemes must be administered by the county council for the area, and it is quite possible for them to formulate a civic improvements scheme in respect of the division of any part of the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they cannot.  We purposely included here the bodies who would have proper powers to administer these schemes: in other words, those bodies which can make use of the very wide powers indicated in Section 3, lines 31 and 32: &ldquo;and in either case may do all things incidental to or consequential on such acceptance, holding and administration.&rdquo;  Our idea was that such powers would be those of the established local authorities, and that they could not delegate these powers to such bodies as parish councils, for instance.  I think I am right in saying, however, that if the parish council wished to give advice to a local authority or to establish an informal committee advising the county council, there would be no objection to that, but they would have no actual legal power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following motion:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad welcomes the proposals for the extension and enlargement of the public health services and the reconstruction of the social insurance code outlined by the Most Rev. Dr. Dignan in his Social Security Plan; and believing that His Lordship's proposals afford a basis for the reorganisation in a desirable direction of the social services to which they relate, this House requests the Government to make without undue delay an actuarial calculation of their financial implications and submit as soon as possible, in the form of a White Paper, detailed proposals for carrying into effect the aim expressed in Dr. Dignan's Plan.</P>
      <P>This motion has been tabled, in my name and that of Senator Tunney, in the first place to express our point of view regarding the proposals published some months ago by the Most Rev. Dr. Dignan, Bishop of Clonfert, in relation to social security, and, in the second place, to indicate to the Government the desire of this House that a proper calculation should be made as to the costs involved if the scheme were to be adopted, and, of course, that some indication should be given as to how the finances would be provided.  There is, as members will observe, an amendment proposed by Senator Sweetman which, I think, is intended to place less emphasis on the approval that the House is invited to give to Dr. Dignan's proposals.  Like the motion, however, the amendment submitted by Senator Sweetman also asks for an investigation into the costs of Dr. Dignan's scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I still think that it would be desirable for the House, when asking the Government to make an investigation, <Col N="301" /> to say to the Government that so far as we are concerned we think that the proposals outlined by Dr. Dignan are something that we could approve of. That, I think, would add some weight and some authority to the request which we addressed to the Government asking for an investigation. However, we can come back to that later.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite agreeable.  I made no comment on the fact that the Minister was not present, because I assume that he was aware of the debate as a result of some angry comments regarding this scheme made by the Minister and published in the newspapers.  I assume, therefore, that the Minister probably did not desire to be present for the discussion or to take part in the discussion, but that, of course, should not interfere with our attitude towards these proposals.  As I have already explained at the outset, the motion asks the House to extend a welcome to Dr. Dignan's proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are entitled to say we like them or do not like them, but we ought not merely to try to dodge the issue as to whether we do or do not like these proposals.  As far as I am concerned I am willing to say this: that there are aspects of the scheme published by Dr. Dignan which I think are undesirable <Col N="303" /> and require amendment, but on the whole I am prepared to commit myself to approval of the general principles in the scheme published by Dr. Dignan.</P>
    <P>I would draw attention to the fact that Dr. Dignan's scheme was published in the newspapers and in pamphlet form in order that it might be examined and commented on.  His Lordship invited examination and comment.  He did not ask us to accept this scheme as the last word in regard to social security, and I think the time has arrived when the subject should be examined by people representing different interests and having different points of view, so that public opinion might be formed as to whether or not they are prepared to accept the implications of the Bishop's proposals.</P>
    <P>Dr. Dignan himself has commented at length on his own proposals in a publication of the Mount Street Club. Members will recall that the proposals are published in pamphlet form.  What I am referring to now is an article published in the magazine of the Mount Street Club over Dr. Dignan's signature, and it is interesting to recall what he means by the term &ldquo;social security&rdquo;.  In the article from which I am quoting he says:</P>
    <P>The term &lsquo;social security&rsquo; explains itself&mdash;it is the securing of the families and individuals of the State against the many social ills of to-day &mdash;unemployment, low income, sickness, accident, etc.  We shall have social security in Ireland when we have a national social and economic plan that will enable every family to have a decent livelihood and, thereby have the material conditions for prosperity and happiness.  As families presuppose homes, and, as it is the duty of the father of the family to maintain the home, a social security plan will ensure to every man able and willing to work an income sufficient to support his family as a Christian family in this the 20th century ought to be supported.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, I think, is the definition of &ldquo;social security&rdquo; that prevails in most countries.  Many people refer to the expression &ldquo;social security&rdquo; as <Col N="304" /> meaning benefits, sickness benefit, unemployment benefit or something of that kind, whereas the Bishop of Clonfert has so very properly pointed out, it means something quite apart.  It means, first and foremost, a policy of full employment; secondly, it means employment at proper wages, and thirdly, it means making provision for these incidents of life against which there is no remedy except such as is provided by an insurance scheme, or something equivalent to an insurance scheme.  Later in this article to which I have referred Dr. Dignan discusses the basis upon which a scheme of social security can effectively operate in Dublin.  At the end of one of his paragraphs he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In short, &lsquo;social security&rsquo; can be had if there is continuous employment for all and a family income for all; and under a proper &lsquo;planned economy&rsquo; it is possible in Ireland to have continuous employment for all and to pay all a family wage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>His Lordship may not be an economist, but he has certainly given his authority to a view which is not popular in certain places.  I think it is not very popular in the Department of Local Government.  I have been reading the speeches of the Minister and some of those associated with him, in which ridicule has been thrown on this expression &ldquo;full employment,&rdquo; and suggestions are being made in certain quarters that even if it were practicable to secure a policy of full employment, it is undesirable we should do so.  There has been a suggestion that the objection is that you cannot have full employment and freedom.  The Bishop of Clonfert does not take that view.  He says that with a properly planned economy it is possible in Ireland to have continuous employment for all and pay all a family wage.  It is worth noting that everybody who proposes a scheme of social security does so against a background of full employment.</P>
    <P>It can be admitted at once, and I am going to admit, that if we are to have 60,000 or 70,000 people unemployed reaching as many, over a period of years, of 130,000 in some portions of the year, and if we are <Col N="305" /> going to have some farmers with small incomes and people leaving the country for the harvest and seeking work elsewhere we cannot adopt the scheme proposed by Dr. Dignan, because we cannot afford to pay for the benefits he proposes.  We must first and foremost make up our minds that we are going to increase the national income very considerably.  We must have greater production, full employment and regular work for a growing community. Therefore, it is not merely a question for the Department of Local Government. It is a question that must be tackled by the Government as a whole, a question of promoting the prosperity of agriculture, securing a high level in industry, securing that there would be proper wages, and that the whole economy would be a complete departure from the practices that obtain here, and that seem to have been set as inevitable some 20 to 25 years ago. If I might refer to the benefits proposed by Dr. Dignan's plan, I will do so merely to enumerate them.  The scheme is published in pamphlet form, and is available to every member of the House.  I assume that it has been studied by Senators.  I draw attention merely to the number of cash benefits that the author considers should be brought under one authority. That is the aspect which will most concern everyone who has experience of insurance and social affairs.  Dr. Dignan wants sickness benefits, disability benefits, marriage benefits, retiral benefits, mortality benefits, workmen's compensation, unemployment insurance, widows' and orphans' pensions, old age pensions, blind persons' pensions, and children's allowances to be managed from one centre.</P>
    <P>Apart from anything else, that is a very valuable proposal.  At present we have children's allowances administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce in the Castle; widows' and orphans' pensions are administered in D'Olier Street, the funds from which they are provided coming from the same source, the National Health Insurance Company stamp.  The National Health Insurance service is administered by an independent body set up by Statute as successors to the approved societies.  Old age pensions <Col N="306" /> are paid through the Post Office, and so on.  Where stamps are used there is a variety of stamps and a variety of service centres administering benefits at very great cost.  There can be no doubt, that apart from any inconvenience from the point of view of the recipient, the administration of these funds and benefits would be infinitely improved if all of them could be unified under one authority, and where stamps are employed covered by one stamp.  Again, we have a service like workmen's compensation, which is probably the most unsatisfactory of all benefits provided in this State.  The workman is insured under a Statute passed by the Oireachtas.  If he is injured in an accident he will be entitled to compensation.  That seems fair enough at the outset.  He is told that if injured by accident he will get compensation, but there is no assurance whatever that he will get compensation, because the employer may not be in a position to pay.  The Minister for Agriculture told us a while ago about the great hardship inflicted on an employer who was a defaulter under the Agricultural Wages Board regulation, that if a worker came along claiming five or six years' arrears, something like £300, the only thing would be to hand over the whole place to him.</P>
    <P>In this case, if a decree were given against an employer for £300 or £200 he would not have funds to meet the claim.  The employer would simply turn the key in the door and walk off. In theory the employer is supposed to pay compensation to a man injured by accident, and in theory the employer should be insured in order to provide a fund with which to meet the claim, but the employer may make this case: why should he provide insurance in order to build a house, when more than 50 per cent. of the profit is used in administration?  The employer has a very good defence if he says: &ldquo;I will not insure in order to give fabulous profits to such concerns?&rdquo; Dr. Dignan's scheme will provide for workmen's compensation.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the proposal which I think is important&mdash;the great anxiety to get rid of the dispensary <Col N="307" /> system and to substitute for it a scheme of national health services. That is one proposal I approve of very warmly.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention to the fact that those who have spoken on behalf of the Government in regard to this proposal have carefully avoided giving any indication of what is involved by Dr. Dignan's scheme or what it is going to cost.  I do not know why they are so shy on that subject because I notice that, in his Budget speech, the Minister for Finance dealt at considerable length with a plan which has been proposed in Great Britain, called the Beveridge scheme.  I refer Senators to column 39, Dáil Debates, 2nd May, this year.  The Minister for Finance, at column 39, reviewed the social services maintained by the Government and gave us an estimate of their cost.  He said: &ldquo;It may not be out of place to mention that the social services proper, account, in our Estimates for expenditure for the coming year, for an outlay of no less than £9,686,000&rdquo;.  After reviewing the situation, he prefaced his review of Sir William Beveridge's scheme with the remark: &ldquo;Social services, social security, full employment and allied topics occupy a prominent place in public discussion just now and alluring vistas are held out of communities freed from want and disease and, almost, from toil&rdquo;.  That gives us the approach of the Department of Finance &mdash;the sneer, if I may say so, at those who tried to visualise a community freed from want, with the suggestion that that means free from toil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>No reference is contained in that speech to Dr. Dignan's plan or to any other home-made plan, whether prepared by the Government or not. The next part of the Minister's speech deals with the proposals of Sir William Beveridge, and proposes to give an estimate of the cost of applying Sir William Beveridge's proposals to the Twenty-Six Counties.  They are, of course, to be applied to the Six Counties. The Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The total present cost to the State here of services of the kind covered by the Beveridge recommendations is, approximately, £8,200,000, and the total expenditure on benefits, exclusive of administrative expenses, is £9,450,000.  After serious study, I can state that the total expenditure here on benefits as proposed for Britain by Sir William Beveridge would be £38,900,000, of which the State contribution would be £23,500,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Having given that estimate of the cost of applying the Beveridge proposals here, the Minister proceeded to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;These striking figures seem to dispose of the suggestion that such a scheme is practicable here.  Even if we were to follow the somewhat less costly scheme suggested in the British White Paper, the total expenditure involved would be £36,000,000 per annum, of which £20.2 million would be contributed by the State, the remainder coming in the form of contributions from various sections of the population.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister cannot make the excuse that an estimate of the Dignan Plan cannot be framed.  It is not open to him to say that the Beveridge Plan cannot be evalued.  If it is possible to make an estimate of the cost of one type of scheme, data must be available for the making of an estimate of the cost of the other type.  The proposals in the British White Paper and the proposal by Sir William Beveridge may seem generous to a community, such as ours, amongst whom benefits <Col N="309" /> are so small but the proposals for Britain are not regarded as generous elsewhere.  It has been pointed out clearly that the British proposals are less generous than schemes obtaining in other countries.  In that connection, I should like to refer to the benefits provided in New Zealand.  The publication from which I derive my information is an authoritative one.  It has been written by the Honourable Walter Nash, who is Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand, and it was published in London in May last.  The author sets out in this booklet a complete list of the benefits provided under their social security plan in New Zealand.  It is very comprehensive and it makes the British proposals and Sir William Beveridge's proposal seem like chicken feed.  The age benefit, for instance, commences at 60 years, so that a man and wife may have a joint weekly income of £3 5s.  I do not know whether there would be consternation in this House if I suggested that people in Ireland could do with a benefit of £3 5s. as well as they can do with it in New Zealand.  If the economy of the country were reorganised, there would be no reason why we should not provide it.</P>
    <P>However, I doubt that the scheme outlined by Dr. Dignan would cost anything like the sum mentioned by the Minister for Finance in his Budget.  I accept, of course, his references to the Beveridge Plan and the British White Paper.  Some friends of mine have been working on the financial aspect of Dr. Dignan's proposals and they have come to the conclusion that the cost of the scheme&mdash;I do not give this as the final figure&mdash;would be roughly £20,000,000.  They point out that, at the moment, we are spending £16,500,000 on services akin to those proposed.</P>
    <P>This is the statement given to me: &ldquo;At present the principal sources of social security funds are general taxation and rates.  General taxation provides £10,250,000, and the rates provide nearly £4,000,000, while employees and employers' contributions provide £2,250,000 between them.&rdquo;  So that we are already paying £16,500,000 a year for social services, and if the scheme <Col N="310" /> outlined by Dr. Dignan could be provided for £20,000,000, it would mean that we are called upon merely to find an additional £3,500,000.  No doubt £3,500,000 is a large sum.  It is not easy to find in a country like this, but when we were confronted with an emergency we found £8,500,000 for the Army. If that Army were to continue for the next 20 years, like it or not, we should be obliged to go on finding that £8,500,000 per annum for the Army. Nobody would grumble at that.  Nobody got up in either House of the Oireachtas to state that the burden was unbearable, and that some way out should be sought.  I do not know whether we shall be told that the additional £3,500,000, assuming that is the correct figure, which I have mentioned in relation to the social security plan, is beyond our means.  If that case is made, however, my reply would be that we must increase the income of the community so that the people may be in a position to provide this additional money.  Surely, it is not beyond the capacity of this country to increase its wealth to a point at which an additional £3,500,000 would be relatively unimportant.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether anybody believes that we are now at a point beyond which the national income cannot be increased.  It seems to me that everybody talks and writes as if he believed that by an intelligent form of organisation, the income of our agricultural community could be easily doubled.  I think I pointed out in a previous debate that while each of our farmers feeds a family and a half, in addition to his own, the continental farmer feeds four families in addition to his own, so that it is not merely a question of increasing by 50 per cent., or even doubling the income of the agricultural community.  It should be a question of multiplying it three or perhaps four times.  Reach that figure and you will have a national income not of £250,000,000 in the present terms of purchasing power, but of a sum say of £750,000,000, a sum which of course would enable the expenditure on social services to be increased enormously without imposing any additional burden on the community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="311" /> The case which I would like to make for these proposals and the case which I think the Most Rev. Dr. Dignan made for the proposals, is that actually there would be a diminution in the sums expended on benefits such as unemployment insurance benefit, unemployment assistance, health and invalid payments, etc.  A policy of full employment would enable the community to attain to a better standard of living in which the expenditure on benefits, hospitals and medical services would be reduced enormously.  I think that, without delaying the House further, I have said sufficient to indicate that there should be an inquiry into the proposals set out by Dr. Dignan in his plans.  I am asking two things.  I am asking the House to express approval of his Lordship's proposals, and I am asking, secondly, that the Government will be urged to have a proper inquiry made into the cost of these proposals, assuming they are adopted.</P>
    <P>I do not think the proposal in the amendment is helpful.  I do not know why Senator Sweetman found it necessary to put down an amendment of this kind unless he was anxious that the House should call for an inquiry without saying whether Senators themselves believed or did not believe in the proposals of the Bishop of Clonfert. I wish to go on record as saying that I believe in them and in their utility, and I would ask the House to vote for the proposal and to reject the amendment.</P>

      <P>Before I formally move the amendment which is standing in my name, I think it would be very wrong if I did not avail myself of the opportunity to comment on the fact that although this motion and the amendment have appeared on the Order Paper in the ordinary way, no steps have been taken by the Minister under whose aegis, presumably, this matter would come, to attend or to send either of his two Parliamentary <Col N="312" /> Secretaries so that they might express his view, or even to send a message to the House that he did not propose to avail himself of the ordinary practice of this House and of the members of the Government in regard to this House.  It appears to me to be not only clearly discourteous to the House but akin to contempt for the deliberations that we have here.</P>
      <P>For that reason I think that, when I am dealing with the matter now, and when we have no rhyme or reason, nor any excuse, suggestion or statement offered for the absence of the Minister or of one of his Parliamentary Secretaries, it would be very wrong if I were not to advert to that fact and to suggest that if that attitude is typical of the attitude which the Government propose to take up towards our deliberations here, then it is indeed a waste of time in any of us coming here and trying in what manner we can, in our own small tin-pot way, to do something for the betterment of our country.  I now move the amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; where that word first occurs in order to substitute the words: &ldquo;Seanad Eireann feels that the proposals for the extension and enlargement of the public health services and the reconstruction of the social insurance code, outlined by the Most Rev. Dr. Dignan in his Social Security Plan, are worthy of the careful consideration of the Oireachtas and, therefore, requests the Government to submit in the form of a White Paper, an actuarial calculation of the financial cost together with a detailed statement of the views of the Government upon the other implications involved.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I read Senator Duffy's motion on the Order Paper, I felt, quite frankly, that he proposed to insinuate into it something more than, in fact, he did insinuate in his speech.  Quite frankly, I felt that he meant the word &ldquo;welcomes&rdquo;, in the first line of the motion, to be an out-and-out endorsement of his Lordship's, Dr. Dignan's, plan, as expounded by him, and having heard Senator Duffy I still feel that the wording in the amendment which <Col N="313" /> I have proposed typifies more accurately and states what, perhaps, was in his mind and certainly what is in my mind, although I think that exactly what he said was not quite in the wording of his own motion.  The fact of the matter is this: that there have been schemes for social security suggested in other countries, that in some other countries those schemes have been put into force and put into effect, and that a scheme&mdash;or rather, to be more strictly accurate, in my view, part of a scheme&mdash;has been suggested in this country by Dr. Dignan.  I do not know whether the Government are working at the moment on any scheme of that type of social security or dealing with the matter of the amalgamation of social services along those lines.  Quite frankly, if the Government were to come here to-day and say: &ldquo;Yes, we are working on such a scheme&rdquo;, my answer would be that I fully appreciate that, and that until the Government produced their suggestions for a scheme it would be unwise for me to ask for the acceptance of the motion or of the motion as amended.  The fact remains, however, that we have not heard that that is the intention of the Government.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that Dr. Dignan has produced certain suggestions, and, again, if those suggestions had been produced by an ordinary individual, who had no idea of what legislation might possibly be involved in a scheme of social security, or what it might mean from the point of view of its administration, it might be held that it was not worth the time of the Government or of the Civil Service to devote themselves to any consideration of it, but this scheme or plan is put forward by a responsible individual.  I notice, Sir, that the Parliamentary Secretary has just come into the House.  I had hoped that the Minister or one of his Parliamentary Secretaries would be present, and when I saw the Parliamentary Secretary walking in at the door I knew that my hope had fructified, and I am delighted to see that the Minister has sent his Parliamentary Secretary here to deal with this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I say that I accept the Parliamentary Secretary's explanation absolutely and withdraw any insinuation I made?  To go back to where I was, the situation is that a scheme or part of a scheme or proposals or part of proposals have been submitted by a person who is in a position to know something about the administration of our social services. Accordingly, as such, I consider, and I would ask the House to consider, <Col N="315" /> that those schemes and those proposals are worth while our giving them serious consideration, since we have not been told that there is any other scheme or proposal to come before the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Whether or not the schemes are practicable is one thing, but the fact remains that there is a public demand among a considerable section of the community for some such ideas, for some such schemes or proposals, whatever you like to call them.  It may mean that the adoption of schemes such as these would entail that we might have to give up something else we have already.  I do not think at this stage that it is right or proper that we should comment on that, but the fact that there is a demand there does suggest to me that if, at the present time it is felt that the demand could not be justified, the proper way to rebut it is to ensure that the full and adequate information which alone is in the procurement of the Government should be made available.</P>
      <P>So far as the detailed suggestion or proposal put forward by Dr. Dignan is concerned, it is perfectly obvious to anyone that there are points in it with which some of us might not agree, that there are other points in it with which we might agree. It could, therefore, amount possibly in the end to the consideration of the good in it and the bad in it and the consideration of whether, taking all the pros, they were greater than the cons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to this House that when proposals&mdash;the author admits they are not complete and could not be complete&mdash;are put forward in a serious manner by a person who knows, and must know from his experience, something about the working of social administration, then those proposals are worthy of consideration.  All of us must agree that whatever the National Health Insurance Act of 1911 has done towards providing cash benefits and towards ensuring that the first part of its title has been carried out, namely, insurance against loss of health, it has not as yet been possible to ensure through the development of the <Col N="316" /> schemes under that Act that there would be satisfactory prevention and cure of sickness.</P>
    <P>I did come across, fairly recently, a long consideration of the latter half of that position by the Welsh Medical Association.  They in their consideration felt very very strongly that, though the Act had succeeded, so far as the first part of its Title was concerned, in insuring against loss of health, it had not been a success in the prevention and cure of sickness.  I think that doctors here who are working within the scheme as it operates at present in this country, will agree without any question that that is a fact.  It appears to me also that there is a <i>prima facie</i> case, without any reference to Dr. Dignan's plan at all, that there could be a very substantial saving by a reorganisation in one administration of our existing social services.</P>
    <P>There could be a very substantial saving, and, in fact, the administration of those services would be carried through in a much more expeditious and satisfactory way.  Bearing that in mind, and the fact that in my opinion, and in the opinion of those people able to know, how that Title of the Act of 1911 has not proved to be the success which was anticipated, and also bearing in mind the fact that we have not heard that the Government has any alternative proposition to put before us, I think these proposals, coming as they do from a man with such experience, are worth our consideration, and I feel I am justified, therefore, in asking the Seanad to request the Government to put sufficient information at our disposal as a result of consideration of which this House and the people as a whole will also be in a position to judge the adequacy of the pros and the adequacy of the cons, and to come to a final conclusion as to whether the scheme, as suggested, with or without large modifications, is capable of making an addition to the success of social services and to the efforts towards ensuring that we shall have a better life here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I would oppose the amendment for the same reason that I am in favour of the <Col N="317" /> original motion, and I oppose the amendment because I am completely and wholeheartedly with the Most Rev. Dr. Dignan in his aspirations.  I am largely with him in his approach, although I do not desire to be bound down to any details of his plans, and I think if the House rejects the amendment and passes the original motion, they would be giving a greater emphasis to the desire to have the matter gone into, and statistics brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>In other words, if we show we are heart and soul behind Most Rev. Dr. Dignan's aspirations, it will bring more pressure to bear on the Government to put facts before us which will enable us to judge how far these aspirations can be given practical form along his lines, or his lines as modified. Personally, I will not be content until I know that every penny this country can possibly afford is being spent on social services.  I am not at the moment convinced that that is so now&mdash;I am nearly convinced that it is not so&mdash;but until I have seen the statistics as prepared by the unusually efficient Government statistics branch with Mr. Geary at the head, I am reserving judgement on that, but I think the House should press the case with all its might to have the facts investigated so that when we know the facts we can put our weight into the demand that every penny we can afford is put at the service of those who are at the present moment among the underprivileged classes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support Senator Sweetman's amendment. There is no doubt about the fact that Dr. Dignan's efforts in this matter have excited quite an amount of interest in the country.  They show that his Lordship made a very extensive study into social security not only in this, but in other countries.  His suggestions are worthy of attention and consideration. Much publicity has been given to his proposals and suggestions, but these suggestions do not constitute a scheme. They are an innovation, and like many other innovations of benefit to the country, we must regard them from the standpoint of cost.  I hold that before this House passes any opinion as to the <Col N="318" /> advantages of a scheme we desire to have, we should first visualise its effect on the finances of the country.</P>
      <P>In my view the only way in which that can be done before one could approach the study of a scheme, is by the adoption of the suggestion set out in the amendment, that there should be an actuarial calculation of the financial cost, together with a detailed statement of the views of the Government upon the other indications involved. Until we have got an actuarial calculation of the cost of such a scheme on the country we would not be in a position to do anything more than pass a pious opinion.  That is why I support Senator Sweetman's amendment, and I trust that the discussion here this evening will interest the Government in making a study of the suggestions set out by Dr. Dignan. In the near future, I hope we shall have the views of the Government of such a scheme, and by that time we will be in a better position to pass an opinion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say, in the first place, that it is rather difficult to say very much one way or another on the <Col N="319" /> motion and amendment before us, for the simple reason that if one has to disagree to any extent with some of the statements that have been made, both here and outside, one would be branded as being a heretic, or as being definitely opposed to the Lord Bishop of Clonfert.  However, if I am asked if I am in favour of social security, I have no hesitation in saying that I am.</P>
    <P>But if I am asked if I am in favour of a particular scheme I want to know what the particular scheme is.  I have not seen any scheme.  I have asked a number of Senators who are particularly interested in social security&mdash;of course, we are all interested in social security, but some people seem to hold themselves out as more interested than the rest of us&mdash;whether they had any figures one might examine.  But I have not been able to get them.  Suggestions have been made&mdash;that is true. We are all capable of making suggestions, we can all state the ideal, but when we come to this House, I think we ought to be prepared, if we make suggestions, to back them up with argument.</P>
    <P>We ought to have gone to the trouble to examine such statistics as are available. If we are incapable of examining them ourselves, we ought to secure help if we can get it at all, but, in any case, I do not think it is fair to come into this House and make a number of suggestions, and then without argument leave the matter at that.  If the Government finds that there is nothing in these suggestions which can be examined, or nothing on which a definite pronouncement can be made, it is unfair of us to hold up the Government as offering an insult to any person or persons responsible for making these suggestions.  The suggestion that one thing should be done or another thing should be done is at best nothing more than a suggestion.</P>
    <P>Senator Sweetman was rather annoyed that the Minister for Local Government or the Parliamentary Secretary was not here when the debate began.  I agree that when the Parliamentary Secretary explained his delay in coming here the Senator <Col N="320" /> withdrew the strictures he had so vehemently made.  If he had not withdrawn these strictures I would still have been minded to ask what Minister did he expect to come here.  What particular Minister is concerned in this suggestion regarding social security? In all fairness is it not clear that every Minister of the Government would need to be here because every Minister is directly concerned in the question of social security.  I gathered from the statements made here this evening that the outstanding suggestion is that the economic structure of the State should be overhauled or recast.  That is the suggestion that stands out.  I think it is only reasonable to ask on what lines is that structure to be overhauled.  We have had quite a number of experiments in Europe extending over a considerable time.  The people who suggest that the structure of the State should be overhauled, I am sure, have studied the systems that I have in mind but which I need not mention. It should have been possible for them, having examined these systems, to point out to us where we might overhaul our economic structure and avoid the mistakes of these people and outline for us the system that would give us the El Dorado which they think it is possible to achieve.</P>

To come in here and merely say that the economic structure of the State is to be overhauled and that production is to be increased to God knows what extent and leave the matter at that is neither fair to the people nor fair to the Government nor fair to this House.

For the information of Senator Duffy, I do not mind reminding him that New Zealand is vastly greater in area than this country and has, roughly, only 1,500,000 souls as against 3,000,000 in the Twenty-Six Counties. The average size of a farm in New Zealand would be, say, about 550 to 600 acres.  There is no comparison whatever between the capacity of that country in its present state of development to do certain things and the capacity of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the duty of every Senator to keep himself informed not merely as to what is happening in this House but <Col N="322" /> what happens in the other House also. Seeing that the Oireachtas is generous enough to provide us with official reports the least we can do is to study them and make ourselves <i>au fait</i> with what is going on and the statements made there.  It would benefit ourselves considerably and I think it would be a most valuable economy in more ways than one.  This question was discussed in the other House and the head of the Government stated that the whole question of social security was one in which the Government, as a Government, was keenly interested, and it was a question he was having examined. I think in all fairness to the House the least that might have been done by those who sponsored the motion and the amendment was that, if they did not go to the trouble of studying what was taking place in the other House and making themselves <i>au fait</i> with what is really the attitude of the Government, at least they would have gone to some Minister whom they thought responsible in the matter and asked him for a view on it.</P>

      <P>Senator Hearne is quite right.  The name of the Bishop of Clonfert, a good Irishman, whom we all thank for his interest in these things and for the work he has done, has been used a good deal of late.

      <P>However, there is nothing that I can see in either the motion or the amendment that we might break our hearts about.  I am satisfied with the assurance given by the Taoiseach in the Dáil.  I think Deputy Everett when he was dealing with the matter took a reasonable attitude when he said that in view of the statement of the head of <Col N="323" /> the Government that the matter was receiving attention it ought be left over until such time as the examination would be completed.  An investigation of this kind with the best will in the world and the most competent Civil Service&mdash;and I think we have certainly some of the most competent civil servants in the world&mdash; cannot be rushed or completed with any satisfactory effect, especially in view of existing or likely conditions inside I do not know how many years. It would certainly take a considerable time.  I have no enthusiasm one way or the other either for the motion or against it, nor have I any enthusiasm one way or the other either for the amendment or against it.  If I must decide by voting on this question, my view is that the statement of the head of the Government in the Dáil is a good and reasonable one, and I am prepared to await the report of the investigation which he has promised.</P>

      <P>I have nothing whatever to do with the putting down of either the motion or the amendment, and so I can be absolved from any charge of wanting publicity.  Apparently it is the point of view of Senator Hearne that the amendment shows a desire for publicity.  That is the usual view taken by certain members of the House when something is put down that is rather inconvenient to discuss, but it is a point of view I can never reconcile with freedom of speech and the liberty of members to seek infornation. We have listened to Senator O Buachalla, a professor of economics and a director of the Central Bank. One would have expected from his calling and his upbringing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Please do not let the Senator think that there is any attempt to disparage his qualifications or competence to pass judgement on a subject like this, but I do wonder whether he has read either the motion or the amendment.  There is a difference between them.  Senator <Col N="324" /> Sweetman is much more cautious and almost like Senator O Buachalla desires to have certain information with all its implications in regard to the social structure before any decision is taken.  He is prepared to stand by and wait and see if Senator O Buachalla has any enthusiasm for a social security plan.  What fault has he to find with Senator Sweetman's amendment which asks for the actuarial calculations which must be the preliminary to the investigation which the Taoiseach has said should be made.  We have all responsibility in this matter, and we should be given the opportunity to consider the cost and all the implications of this proposal so that we may have an opinion as to what it may amount to.  I confess that I have a doubt about the anxiety expressed by Senator O Buachalla when he says that he is prepared to treat the amendment and the motion in the same fashion and to reject both because the Taoiseach said something else.  Perhaps from the Party point of view there is nothing wrong with that, but if that be necessary let us be quite frank about it.  The Senator mentioned the Bishop of Clonfert.  May I point out that Doctor Dignan said this: &ldquo;I do not for a moment imagine that the scheme is free from defence.  I ask for it to be discussed, analysed and criticised and improved on when necessary.  The scheme is put forward on its merits. There is nothing sacrosanct about it for I write as Chairman of the National Health Insurance Society not as Bishop of Clonfert.&rdquo;  So the Senator need not fear being classed as a heretic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>He need not fear if he has the courage to face up to the implications of the scheme.  We should have reached a stage when we would have the right to examine a scheme put forward by anybody.  The difficulty we are up against is that one cannot examine the implications of a scheme which purports to co-ordinate all services, such as public assistance, hospitals, old age pensions, unemployment <Col N="325" /> assistance, widows' and orphans' pensions, blind persons' pensions, and children's allowances without a great deal of matter being made available. Senator Duffy's motion, as modified by Senator Sweetman's amendment, is asking that this information should be available.  I do not know why any Senator should be against it for asking for information like that.  We have no doubt through the organs of the State it can be made available and probably much of it is made available.  I am sure that in a short time that information could be made public.  If not, it simply means that we are not being given a chance to examine this problem in all its aspects.  What conclusion is to be arrived at?  The conclusion naturally is that a great many people who talk about social security are only paying lip service to it.  That can be challenged and I am sure will be contradicted.  That is how it looks to me.  Senator O Buachalla's complaint was that not much information had been offered by the proposers of the motion or the amendment. Actually they are asking for information.  If any person comes in to seek information that is the way to avoid the issue, and it is not a fair way to meet the proposal.  Senator O Buachalla referred to the scattered population of New Zealand and compared its total area with ours.  He went on to talk about production.  I did not hear Senator Duffy referring to production at all, and I do not know whether he did or not.  Senator O Buachalla said that increased production was vital to the implementation of those schemes.  I would remind Senator O Buachalla that there is information available which reveals that the productivity of New Zealand, because of the improved methods employed in agriculture there, has been staggering in the extreme, when compared with our puny effort, the result of which is that our production is falling instead of rising. Senator O Buachalla should have addressed himself to that aspect of the problem when contrasting conditions in New Zealand with those here.  It is not right to state part of a case and neglect the more important aspect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="326" /> This is how the problem strikes me: It ought to be the aim of all of us to see ordered, stable conditions.  There should be realisation on our part that the foundation of those conditions is security for all our people.  Conditions here are comparatively unstable.  We have evidence of that.  Expenditure on social services amounts to about £19,000,000.  Government speakers claim credit, political and otherwise, for that achievement and boast about it.  I always feel that it is a thing about which we should not boast.  Many of the services that have to be operated here are operated because of the conditions of unemployment which should not exist.  However, the net point is that these social services are costing us £19,000,000.  The Dignan plan makes no calculation of the amount which would have to be spent if all those services were co-ordinated under one organisation.  I do not know how much more they would cost.  If they were operated under one organisation, I am certain that they would be more efficiently operated than they are.  Yesterday in Cavan town I met a small but comfortable farmer who had sold his farm, and I asked him why he sold. He replied: &ldquo;I could not turn out a calf; I had a field here, there and yonder.&rdquo;  That is what our social services are like.  We have hosts of inspectors in different Departments.</P>
    <P>Members of the Oireachtas spend three-fourths of their time going from the headquarters of one branch of our social services to those of another, trying to get apparent concessions for poor people who are supposed to enjoy those social services.  In nine cases out of ten, these are matters of right instead of concessions, but they cannot be obtained without intervention by members of the Oireachtas.  Members of the Government Party know that as well as I do, because they get more trouble in this way than I do.  In the case of many of them, attention to matters of administration relating to social services takes precedence over their work as legislators.  To me, that is becoming one of the most alarming developments of our political life&mdash;the extent to which the activities of our people in trying to avail of schemes <Col N="327" /> of social service are eating into the time of members of the Oireachtas.  I warn the House, that if the Oireachtas is to do its job efficiently and thoroughly as a legislative assembly, something will have to be done in connection with the administration of our social services in the future.</P>
    <P>Apart from the unwieldiness of their administration and the extra overhead expenditure necessitated by having one inspector in the case of widows' and orphans' pensions, another in the case of old age pensions, and so on, there is this consideration&mdash;that the more complete co-ordination of social services would create an organisation which could provide us with what we style social security.  If that demands the expenditure of additional money, is that what we are afraid of?  I should have liked Senator O Buachalla to address himself to that aspect of the problem.  I should regard him as competent to deal with it.</P>
    <P>What would it mean if conditions of social security were to be obtained by increasing the total national income and, side by side with that, bringing about a redistribution of the national income, because that would have to take place concurrently with the other effort?  Would that not mean that into one great pool or reservoir very considerable sums of the money of the people would be flowing day after day and week after week?  That is what is styled &ldquo;expenditure&rdquo; and some people are afraid of expenditure in this connection. When they think of expenditure and social security, some people have the idea that it is the same as collecting goods and throwing them into the sea or blowing up cities and towns.  It is nothing of the kind.  We have had an example of that in Britain. There they had a scheme of savings from their earnings.  These savings were collected and made available for re-investment in all the productive activities of the State.  It was by that method that Britain carried on the war, kept down inflation, provided the goods necessary on land, sea and air, and provided the people with food, clothing and shelter, so far as shelter could be provided.  When we talk about <Col N="328" /> the cost of social security, it is quite clear that we do not realise the implications of the task we are setting ourselves. Far from engaging in waste of money or extravagant expenditure, we would be assuring ourselves that, week after week, we would collect considerable sums into a central reservoir which would be available to the weak and poor in the community but which, at the same time, would be available to the people&mdash;whether the Government, or some organised group set up as a branch of the social security plan or a group to engage in productive enterprise, which would provide employment, produce goods and create such conditions as would render your social security scheme more and more secure because they would be providing the people with work.  Unemployment is the greatest dread which confronts people who are in charge of a social security plan.</P>
    <P>That is the approach which I believe has to be made to this problem.  I do not see why we should be afraid of it. I frankly confess to an inability to understand the attitude of the Minister who has already addressed himself to this subject.  There is no type of citizen so bad as the extreme Radical who becomes an extreme Conservative and too many of us are drifting in that direction to-day.  We can very well reach disaster from that point of view. I believe that what is being sought for in the motion or in the amendment is something that it is quite legitimate for a member of this House to seek. It is something which he is entitled to get and it is something which should not be denied to the House and to the country.  I think it would be information of very considerable value and I hope the House will agree to make this information available.</P>
    <P>We heard Senator O Buachalla speak of the conditions that have existed in other countries and the condition of the kind of organised State that has been turned over.  Why has it been turned over?  I am not going into that but I do suggest that what is being asked for either in the motion or in the amendment, is quite a reasonable request and that there is <Col N="329" /> no justification for the attitude of Senator O Buachalla in saying that this information should be denied to the House.  I think that Senator Duffy is really doing a service in asking that this information should be made available.  As to the challenge that it is publicity, well, Senators are here to do the nation's work and to serve the people of this country in the way they know best.  There are some people in this country who are not satisfied with social conditions as they exist and who are perturbed about the question of social security.  The responsibility is on us to set our minds to the task of ensuring that whatever can be done to make conditions a little easier for our people will be done. We should not be afraid to face up to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to say more than a few words in this debate.  I wish merely to indicate my personal attitude towards this problem generally.  In the first place I think that any State, no matter how large or small, which closes its eyes to the fact that there is going to be, here and elsewhere, a demand for the right of every individual to have work or, failing that, to have an opportunity of being provided with a livelihood, is sticking its head in the sand.  Sooner or later we shall have to face up to the fact that that demand is there; we can either provide for it or we cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am inclined to think that it is obvious that we cannot provide for it at the moment, but I think the resources of this country, properly utilised, should make it possible at some future date to provide for it.  I do not think it is going to be provided simply by any scheme in booklet form or in the form of a report.  It is going to be made available only by such cooperative effort as will lead to the utilisation of our resources to provide practically full employment for the people inside this country.  If you have that, then it will not be difficult to provide for what may be called social services, though personally I hate the term&mdash;to provide for the small number who are either unfit to work or <Col N="330" /> who, through special circumstances, have not for the time being a livelihood. It is not simply because we accept Christian principles.  Personally I do not think that any Christian could ever be perfectly satisfied until he sees&mdash;a thing which I do not think any of us will see in our lifetime&mdash; practical effect being given to the Sermon on the Mount.  These are enormous, almost limitless, ideals, having regard to the circumstances in which we find ourselves to-day.</P>
    <P>I, however, do not believe that any Government can afford to adopt anything like a cynical attitude towards any proposal which may be put forward in an authoritative form.  I think personally that the Government made a mistake in the attitude which they adopted towards the report of Dr. Dignan.  It came in the first place from a high Church dignatary.  I do not think it is the function of the Government necessarily to take official cognisance of everything that comes from a high Church dignatary, but when a reverend gentleman who also happens to hold what is virtually a State position, intervenes to make certain suggestions, it seems to me it is incumbent on the Government, not because of any political or constitutional theory, but in wisdom, to take these suggestions seriously, and to set out what would be the cost of giving effect to them.  Instead of taking the attitude that some Ministers adopted, I think much the wiser method would have been to have treated his proposals seriously, and let the people see what it would cost to put them into effect.</P>
    <P>Until we have increased the wealth of this country considerably, I do not believe it would be possible for us to finance any scheme which would be closely allied to what is commonly called the Beveridge scheme, unless we are prepared to do with something less.  We have an extremely expensive system of government, having regard to our population; we are working on the principle of centralisation with the maximum amount of State control. That is all expensive.  It may be&mdash;I do not know&mdash;that if the figures of some <Col N="331" /> such scheme as that proposed by Dr. Dignan&mdash;again I shall not attempt to go into details&mdash;were put before us, if the cost were clearly put before the people, and if we were to ask them: &ldquo;Will you have that and do without so many civil servants or so many Ministers, or perhaps some other social service&rdquo;, that they would chose it in preference.  It may well be, on the other hand, that they would not.  But that we can go on with our system of Government, with the present rate of expense and add the cost of this scheme on top of it, I simply think is not possible and we had better face up to that.  That does not mean, however, that we should not face up to the demand that every person who is able to work should be offered work or provided with means on which he can live on a fair standard.  That is a growing world demand.  It is coming not only in countries that are definitely Christian, but it is coming in countries that are non-Christian too.  It is there as a challenge, and some day it has got to be met.  I think we should be very foolish, if we think that we can adopt a cynical attitude towards it.  I would much prefer Senator Sweetman's amendment. I know that Senator Duffy's motion is hedged around with various provisos, but it is foolish for us to take Dr. Dignan's report&mdash;it is not a scheme, but a report setting down what he thinks could be done&mdash;until the method of financing and administering it is completely set out.  I think it would be foolish for us to involve ourselves in anything that implied approval of that particular report.  I do not mind the word &ldquo;welcome&rdquo; because we should welcome any effort by any responsible individual to put forward proposals to deal with this matter, particularly, when the reverend gentleman holds a responsible State position, but there does seem to me to be implied in Senator Duffy's motion, approval of the proposals before we have got all the information.</P>
    <P>If I am to be asked, would I be glad to see these benefits made available for everybody, the obvious answer, of course, is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  I imagine that that applies to every same person, but <Col N="332" /> approval means very much more than that.  Approval means that we think the proposed scheme is to some degree practicable, and I do not think we have sufficient information before us to enable us to say that it is practicable. In Senator Sweetman's amendment we have the suggestion that we should have more information before us, and I think that that is so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak on this motion, but having heard all the statements that I have heard I am rather tempted to say a few words on the subject.  I should like to know what particulars or what figures the proposers of the motion and the proposer of the amendment require.  What is the scheme for which they require figures?  Is there any definite sum mentioned in the scheme at all?  Is it suggested that every able-bodied person&mdash;man, woman or child&mdash;in Ireland should get a certain allowance per week and, if so, what is that allowance?  If there is no scheme, then how can figures be given for it?  If it is only a matter of pious suggestions or hopes, how can figures be given to carry them out?  Is not everything being done at the present moment for the poor of this country, and what suggestions are there that the methods at present adopted can be improved?  Senator Duffy suggests that we can improve production in this country by a large percentage.  In what way?  Is it by giving every man who is able to work in this country a certain allowance per week, and if you give him that allowance, will he work?  Do we not all know that farmers at the present moment find it very hard to get men to work on the farms or to help them to cut or save the crops?  Do we not all know that certain people at the present moment do not want to work because they have the dole?  We all know that certain people who had free grazing on mountains reduced the number of cattle they had grazing on these mountains in order to get the dole, for which they had to travel a long distance, and most of which they spent before they came home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that a single Senator on the other side of the House who <Col N="333" /> has spoken is in favour of either the Dignan plan or the Beveridge plan.  I do not believe that they are sincere in their proposals.  I believe that these motions are introduced for a particular purpose.  Does Senator Duffy suggest that each labourer would be prepared now to pay 3/- or 4/- a week in order to raise a fund out of their wages to distribute amongst others?  How does he think they would take such a suggestion, or how does he think that the employers would take the suggestion that they should contribute more?  By how much would it reduce the number of unemployed?  I think that the proposal is farcical and insincere, and for that reason I shall vote both against the motion and the amendment.</P>

You will always find a minority of slackers in every section of the community.  You will find them amongst the ordinary workers as in other sections, but I resent very much the suggestion that the Irish people were ever a people who wanted to get something for nothing.  If something of that kind has grown up latterly, a lot of it is due to the policy of the present Government.  Now, I do not wish to be taken as attacking the present Government when I say that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Dea will remember that when the dole first came out in this country some of our people objected to taking it.  He knows that the same thing applied when old age pensions were first introduced here.  I know that in my district a number of people who were over the age of 70 would not take the old age pension when that scheme first came out.  I realise that that has changed since then, but it is the system that is responsible. So far as work on the farms is concerned, you cannot blame a worker for not going to work on a farm if he feels that he can get better wages at something else.  I should like to say, in answer to Senators O'Dea and O Buachalla, that if they say they are satisfied with the present system, I, for one, am not satisfied.  So far as a scheme is concerned, I have no particular scheme in view.  Certainly, I admire Dr. Dignan's idea of a scheme.  Of course, the details of it have not been outlined, nor have any real figures been given in it.</P>
      <P>We have two Senators saying they approve of the present system.  Are they satisfied with the present system when within this nation 500 old age pensioners had to demonstrate for their rights on last Thursday week in the City of Dublin?  Some of these old people were 90 years of age; yet they were forced to parade in the streets to look for justice.  Hunger drove them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> Senator O Buachalla condemns us for tabling a motion seeking to end the system which brings these poor people on the streets despite the Constitution we hear so much about.  We are entitled to call attention to their plight. Those old age pensioners belonged to no single group or party; they came from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour probably, but they were all united in one thing, their poverty and hunger in their homes.  No one had organised them.</P>
    <P>Is it not a disgrace to this Catholic country that such poor people should be forced to adopt those extreme measures to obtain the right to live a little longer?  I am one of those who admire the Government for the many social schemes they have introduced. I admire them for their family allowance scheme although it does not go far enough, in my opinion.  However, it shows to the country and the people, at least, that the Government became aware of the position of families.  As far as I am concerned, I feel that the scheme should go twice as far.</P>
    <P>If Senator O Buachalla doubts my word about the poverty and distress prevailing in Dublin to-day, I will take him to the homes of widows in Dublin where there is nothing for the breakfast in the morning.  Is he satisfied it is for show that we bring such things forward here, where we are entitled to call attention to them?  We give 11/- a week to a widow and child in Cabra under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, a non-contributory pension, and out of that she has to pay 8/- and odd pence rent weekly.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at the line taken by those Senators on the other side of the House.  But I am glad that, despite the fact that those Senators have spoken, they are not giving the attitude of the Government to the social problems of this country.  While the Government have not gone far enough with the social services of the country, they have, nevertheless, taken a different attitude from our friends, the two Senators on the far side.  Is there one Senator who will rise to his feet and say that, in this <Col N="336" /> Christian country, we cannot do better than 10/- a week for an old age pensioner, or is there one Senator who will say an old age pensioner can exist on that miserable amount?</P>
    <P>It has been asked if it would be fair to put anything on the workers to contribute towards meeting their old age. I know people in this country who have been working for a lifetime, for 50 odd years.  The amount of money they were receiving was not big enough for savings, with the result that they had no savings.  I should say that if there was a system in this country whereby, during their years of employment, they could contribute something to secure little comforts in their old age, I doubt if we would be dissatisfied with the idea.</P>
    <P>Is it right or Christian that the head of a family when he falls sick at the present time can get nothing more from the present system which Senator O Buachalla upholds, than 15/- a week, although in many cases he may have five or six dependent children? How can such a family exist on 15/- weekly?  Is that the system you would like to continue in this country?  I am satisfied that the majority of the Irish people would not like it to continue, irrespective of any politics or policy and I am satisfied there are Senators on the far side of the House who would not wish to see helpless people left in poverty.</P>
    <P>My particular concern is not the question of the amount of money we give to the unemployed men because that is a very doubtful subject; it is questionable whether it is a good system in any country.  Far better, if we could give work at decent wages no matter at what employment.  But our aim should be to put people into productive employment.  But, so far as the widows and orphans, the young persons and the blind are concerned, I believe that the Government have a big job to tackle.  Mind you, they have already tackled all these questions in one way or another, but there is a crying need for more to be done.  I believe that there is no fraction or percentage of our people who would object to contributing something more to give such persons in distress a fair degree of comfort.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> It can be done.  Why is it not done? We have no need to make apologies for putting down this motion.  It was tabled before any statement was made in the Dáil, so that Senator O Buachalla is not always correct.  Why should it be argued that this motion is out of place?  What is the Seanad for? Some people argue that it should be abolished.  Surely, if we have no right to express our views here, the sooner it is abolished the better, if we are to follow the lines suggested by Senator O Buachalla.</P>
    <P>I hope and am satisfied that the Government's approach to Dr. Dignan's plan will not be on the lines advocated by the two Senators sitting on the Government side of the House, if there is any side in the House</P>

    <P>Senator Douglas in his opening <Col N="338" /> remarks expressed a truism when he said that no nation can remain stationary, that it should go forward so as to prevent its going backwards. It is also a truism to say that no people can march forward except according to their own strength.  There is no one in this House who does not wish to better the social condition of the people, but Senator Tunney was wrong in his interpretation of what was said by Senator O Buachalla and Senator O'Dea, that they were satisfied with conditions as they were.  We want to march forward and it would be a good thing if there were a general understanding among all the members of the House of how a country can improve its social services.  When proposals are brought forward by the Government at a later period there is no use in one section trying to appeal to prejudice by suggesting the cutting down of the cost.  The expenditure is justified.  We want to spend money on social services.  We want to better the condition of the people but at the same time we want greater production in the country and greater endeavour by the people.  There is no use in coming here and trying to make Party capital by introducing the name of one of the most revered of our ecclesiastics in all Ireland, fellow county man Most Reverend Dr. Dignan.  Dr. Dignan besides being a great ecclesiastic is also a sincere lover of Ireland.  He proved that in the difficult days gone by.  Social workers like Dr. Dignan do not introduce a scheme for the purpose of having it used as a weapon of party warfare.  It is a question that must be faced on all sides of the House.  We cannot get anything by cavilling at one another.  I believe that there is a sincere desire to improve social conditions.  I hope in the very near future the Government will produce a scheme that will have the whole-hearted support of all Parties in the House and in the country.</P>

      <P>Dr. Dignan's scheme has been referred to and if it did nothing else I believe it has done a great thing in bringing Senators of such different views as Senator Sweetman, Senator Tunney, Senator Kingsmill <Col N="339" /> Moore, Senator Douglas, and Senator Duffy together.  Senator Counihan left the House for fear he might be brought in too.  I doubt if there is much sincerity behind the references to Dr. Dignan's scheme.  I believe there was some motive other than this high Christian ideal behind both the motion and the amendment. Having read the motion and the amendment I came to the conclusion that I would put the amendment as an alternative before the motion and when I would get the opportunity afterwards I would vote against the amendment.  I thought we were going to hear something about this plan.  I have read every little bit or scrap I could about it, and I thought we were now going to get a detailed explanation of the whole plan.  I was sadly disappointed.  I have always heard that the tunny is a diver in deep waters but I did not realise that Senator Tunney could dive so deep and that when he came up we would know so little more.  It must be well known to the proposer and seconder of the motion and the others who supported it that there is in fact no real scheme. In the motion we have reference to an actuarial calculation.  If I know what that means it would be a job of work that is going to take years.</P>

      <P>I hope to live long, but I am not sufficiently an optimist to believe that after all these plans have been put into effect by the most efficient means at the disposal of humanity there will not be still somebody with a genuine grievance.  In a report in connection with Dr. Dignan's plan I read a statement made by Senator Duffy.  I will read it now.  It appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 19th of October, 1944.  It said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Luke Duffy, secretary of the Labour Party, said: &lsquo;The proposals began at the wrong end and differed from the Beveridge plan, as they sought to treat the victims of the disease rather than boldly tackling the causes of poverty.  Under the scheme, the more you need the less you get.  It would not put us in a position to compete with the economically progressive countries after the war&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Can anybody doubt the sincerity of the man who made that statement approximately six months ago and now comes in to-day without any apologies for what he said in the past to tell us that the scheme is the cure-all for all the troubles the country has had for several hundred years?</P>

      <P>Then we know where we are.  I am sorry if it appeared that I wanted to misrepresent the Senator. I did not want anything of the kind. Before the Senator started out with his flagwaving for his scheme, he should have withdrawn what he said previously.  Far from that, he says that he would say the same thing again.  There is nothing like consistency. At this late hour, I do not propose to make a long speech.  If the Senators who moved this motion were really sincere, they would have given the Minister or Parliamentary Secretary a reasonable time before launching an attack from four fronts because he had not produced a scheme of this kind in the space of a couple of months.  The motion was drafted with one idea&mdash;to get political kudos out of what Senator O Máille described as proposals made by one of the most distinguished people of his own County Galway.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long inasmuch as I am not prepared to discuss the merit or lack of merit of what is described as the Dr. Dignan scheme or any other scheme.  I should have intervened earlier in the debate were it not that I was rather anxious to hear the views of the members of the House on this question of social services.  Those views were very interesting and I have no doubt that they will be of considerable value to the Government when considering any reorganisation of their social services.  It is well to have those views on record.  If we come before the House at some future time with a scheme which may cost a substantial amount of money, we shall come with the feeling that we shall have an almost unanimous House behind us in any increased expenditure we may recommend.  The debate has served a useful purpose and I have no doubt that it will be encouraging to the Government in its examination of this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we talk about schemes, we sometimes appear to be somewhat confused in mind.  If a person who is interested in the entire social position of our people sits down, without having any financial limitations imposed upon <Col N="342" /> him, and proceeds to record the various changes, developments, extensions and expansions that he would like to see operate, it becomes a very simple matter.  If members of this House were to sit down for an hour or two hours and devote their entire thoughts to the question of evolving the most desirable scheme of social reform that could be evolved, I have no doubt in the world that we should get a number of excellent schemes. Any intelligent man could do that and do it in a very short time.  But a scheme must involve something more than that if it is to be described as a scheme at all.  It is not sufficient to sit down and record the various reforms you would like to see brought about. You have to address yourself to the question of how those reforms are to be financed.  You have to address yourself to the question of how far the financial burden of those reforms can be borne by our people in the light of the resources available to them.</P>
    <P>When I say that, I wish to draw attention to the fact that no worked-out scheme has ever been submitted to the Government by Dr. Dignan or anybody else.  Certain proposals and certain aspirations have been put on paper.  So far as those records of the views of social reformers have stimulated public thought on this question, I think that they have done a tremendous amount of good, as I think this debate will do good.  Having said all that, I want to suggest to the mover of this motion in all sincerity that the time is not opportune for the full discussion which this whole problem merits.  Various recommendations for the reform of our social services have been submitted to the Government from time to time.  Dr. Dignan is not the only one who has outlined proposals, as members of the House are aware.  Within the past couple of months, the Government set up an Inter-Departmental Committee to examine the entire field of our social and public health services.  That examination has not yet been completed. In addition to the InterDepartmental Committee which has been closely applying itself to this problem within the past couple of months, another committee is engaged <Col N="343" /> in my Department in examining other aspects of the problem.</P>
    <P>I think that it is reasonable to suggest to the mover of the motion and the mover of the amendment that these proposals should not be pressed upon the House until the Government shall have had a full opportunity of examining and surveying the entire field.  When that has been done, the Government will either submit to the House a scheme of reform of our social services, including our public health services, or come to the House and tell you why Dr. Dignan's scheme, or Dr. Shanley's scheme or the scheme of the Irish Medical Association or various other proposals which have been submitted to the Government are not acceptable to them.  If I were asked, as I could be reasonably asked, how long I think this examination will take, I think I could with perfect safety say that the examination will be completed within the next few months, so that, after the summer recess, if the Government's proposals are not satisfactory to Senator Duffy or any other member of the House, the time would be opportune to put down an appropriate motion and have a full discussion on the matter.</P>

      <P>I am not blaming the Parliamentary Secretary.  I am regretting that he did not get an opportunity to state what the Government is doing and what he hopes will emerge from the inquiry which is taking place.  Instead of that, his supporters in this House availed of the occasion to misrepresent those of us who are responsible for this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested that the motion was put down in order to get publicity. I wonder publicity for whom or for what?  I did not know that we came here as political Parties.  Evidently Senators on the other side have forgotten that they came here as <Col N="344" /> members of a vocational chamber, not as members of a political institution. It is unfortunate that that should be so.  It is unfortunate that Senators motives should be misrepresented. The conclusion I came to, after hearing the tirade delivered by Senator O Buachalla, was that he felt remorse of conscience.  He was being ordered into the Division Lobby to vote against this motion and he had to give some excuse.  The method he adopted was to misrepresent those responsible for the motion.  I would again point out that the motion is limited to a very narrow field.  It asks the Government to make an investigation.  Now we have the Parliamentary Secretary stating that the Government is engaged in an investigation of this and other schemes.  I think it reasonable that we might await the result of that investigation, particularly as the Parliamentary Secretary has informed us that it is only a matter of a couple of months.  I did not imagine that the adoption of this motion would result in our getting an actuarial valuation in a month or even two or three months.  I did not hope to see a valuation of this kind completed within a year.</P>
    <P>I want to make just one other point. I think it very unfair to this House for Senators who are politically minded to get up and say: &ldquo;So-and-so did not do this or do that&rdquo;.  Senator O Buachalla, for instance, asks about figures, ignoring the fact that the motion was one asking the Government to get figures.  I was careful to make only passing allusions to the Dignan plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>It might not be too difficult to do that.  I pointed out to the House that the Dignan plan was set out in a pamphlet written by the Bishop of Clonfert and I did not proceed to examine it.  Senator Quirke recalled to the House my own evaluation of that scheme when it was published. I have not changed my mind about it.  There is very good reason, <Col N="345" /> having regard to the ballyhoo that is talked about it, for our knowing what it is going to cost.  I told the House earlier that a certain valuation was made for myself.  The actual figure I was given&mdash;I do not say it has any authority except that it was produced by two or three people, an economist and a couple of accountants&mdash;was £40,000,000.  Deducting from that the £15,000,000 or £16,000,000 now being spent on these services, there was a net figure of £25,000,000, provided we did not have full employment.  With full employment it would be quite a different matter.  That is what I wanted to stress to the House, that it was not really a question of providing additional benefits and of increasing the sums paid to unemployed people and to people who became ill, but to ensure an economy in which we would have full employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O Buachalla wonders what this economy means.  I would remind the Senator that as far as Denmark is concerned they have been increasing productivity of the land there for 60 years.  Our agricultural production decreased by 11 per cent. during the emergency.  This must be the only country in the world in which that happened. Then again I am accused of making lying statements about New Zealand whereas all I said about New <Col N="346" /> Zealand was to quote the rate of benefits there.  Senator O Buachalla told us that the average farmer there had 500 or 600 acres.  He is wrong to the extent of double the acreage.  New Zealand is a country with only 20,000,000 acres of arable land.  Senator O Buachalla counts the mountains, the rocks and the lakes as part of the arable land.  Their arable acreage is 20,000,000; ours is 12,000,000, so the disparity is not nearly so great as the Senator imagines.  The land surface is equal to 12½ acres per head of the population; ours is equal to 4 acres per head.  He then measured up on the productivity per acre, but the figures which I have given, I suggest, upset the Senator's calculation.  I know it is not possible to go any further to-night and I do not propose to divide the House.  I promise the Parliamentary Secretary, however, that if things do not turn out as he promised, this motion will probably be repeated at a later date.</P>
