    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I was not able to fulfil the promise which I gave when I started to speak last night to the effect that I would be, if at all possible, as brief as Senator Douglas was in the consideration of this Bill.  As I went on, a number of points occurred to me which I thought it essential to bring to the notice of the Minister and of the House.  Last evening, just before we adjourned, I was referring to the necessity for the board to see to it that every precaution would be taken to ensure that, when the scheme got under way, the quality of the appliances which would be put on the market would be up to a standard that would satisfy them. As I said then, a great deal will depend upon the quality of the equipment that will be produced, whether the scheme will prove economic or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point which occurs to me in that connection is, that there is clearly a necessity for the establishment of some kind of committee of experts to consider the kind of appliance which should be provided to suit the type of farms peculiar to this country.  The board itself, in its excellent report, did not overlook that particular point.  They have dealt with it in a paragraph starting at the bottom of column 2, page 30.  I suggest that the Minister might consider the establishment of some kind of joint board of engineering and agricultural experts to examine this matter at once.  It is something which is bound to take a considerable time, notwithstanding <Col N="1554" /> the fact that there must be on the market already quite a number of machines and appliances suitable to agriculture.  In view of the size of our farms, and in view of the peculiar types of production engaged in, it is clear that some serious consideration will have to be given to this point, since special equipment may be called for.  It would be a pity if we were to wait until the lines had been erected and the farms connected up before we undertook this investigation. I should like to see the educational activities which I mentioned last night undertaken at once; I should like also to see this investigation into the type of equipment that may be necessary undertaken at once, so that the fullest use can be made of the introduction of electricity to the rural areas as early as possible. The scheme proposed will prove of enormous benefit to the housewife. There is no doubt whatever that it will prove a great boon for domestic purposes but, great as that advantage is, I do not think it is the most important result that we expect from this scheme.  It is clear that the State is already committed to a tremendous programme of social development, and it is quite clear also from the statements of the Government from time to time, that they are determined that standards in this country will go very much higher if that lies in their power. It is obvious then that any further development in social services can be achieved only as a result of further economic production, and it is clear also, as Senator Johnston mentioned last night, that there is considerable scope in the agricultural industry in particular for that extra production. It is because of that that I want to stress, or underline, this particular paragraph to which I have referred in the board's report, where it points out the necessity for engaging in this particular type of research.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cost of electricity, it seems to me that some of the speakers are inclined to be too pessimistic. For one thing, it must not be overlooked that if the system as proposed is introduced, the Government is clearly committed to subsidising, <Col N="1555" /> to a very great extent, the introduction of electricity in the rural areas.  It is a question then how much further we should go in this matter of subsidisation.  With regard to the rates, I do not feel uneasy.  They may prove to be too high or they may not.  But, as the board itself points out, there will be this difference between the use of electricity in the rural areas and its use in the urban areas, that in the rural areas practically the whole use of it will be directed towards production, and I do not think that the charges as forecast will present any great difficulty.</P>
    <P>A further reason I have for not feeling as uneasy as some of the speakers is that the Electricity Supply Board, while it is a monopoly, is not a monopoly in the same way as monopolies generally with which we are familiar.  What I have in mind is that the Electricity Supply Board, while it is a monopoly, is not a profit-earning body.  It is not concerned with the levying of charges with a view to making a maximum profit. That being so, one can rely on it that whatever charges are levied by the board will be those believed to be in the best interests of the community, and agriculture in particular.</P>
    <P>I should like to have been able to follow the discussion by Senator Duffy and Senator Sir John Keane somewhat better than I was.  Here, at any rate, I was not able to grasp the force of their arguments&mdash;I really had to make a guess at what they had in mind. Without question, this Birmingham Bank experiment to which Senator Duffy referred is most interesting, but if I might comment on it in a negative kind of way, it is rather surprising, in view of the success of that experiment, Birmingham should have allowed in any bank or any other system, other than the bank in question. It does seem extraordinary that the commercial banks have been able to thrive and make progress to the extent they have in view of the results of the experiment referred to by Senator Duffy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I <Col N="1556" /> do not quite understand.  If the bank mentioned by the Senator has been able to work in the way he suggested, it does seem extraordinary that that type of bank did not spread unless it be that the people of Britain have a special liking for paying high rates of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I explain that the Birmingham Bank was established by statute when a certain gentleman happened to be Lord Mayor?  Subsequently, legislation was introduced in the British Parliament to give authority to establish similar banks elsewhere and it was always defeated by the Conservative Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to engage in a controversy on the matter because this is not the occasion for a discussion on the principles of banking and I have no intention of going into them.  The Minister is entitled to some assistance, and to make a general statement and leave him to do his best in regard to it is hardly fair. That is why I referred to it at all. Perhaps on some other occasion Senator Duffy will be able to develop the idea.  I must approach this question of banking, in view of my position, from a theoretic angle, and I am very anxious, if my views are wrong, to have them corrected. Senator Duffy is party to the handling of considerable sums of money, vast sums, and he will naturally have wide experience of the problem.  His colleague, Senator Sir John Keane, has very practical experience and, perhaps, between the two of them, on some future occasion, we will get something constructive on this particular problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other point raised by Senator Duffy was, I am sure, not intended to mislead us, but it does occur to me that there is likely to be a danger that some people might be misled in regard to it.  That is his reference to the fact that Irish money is invested abroad at rates as low as 17/6 per cent.  I am sure there is some truth in his statement, and I am also sure that it is quite true that considerable sums of money are invested abroad at rates as low as 1 per cent., but I do not think that <Col N="1557" /> gives us a true picture at all.  If Senator Duffy's statement is true generally, then our external assets would be not in the region of £300,000,000 but, judging by the income we have been receiving for so long, they should be in the region of £1,500,000,000 or £1,600,000,000.  The fact is that these investments are of two distinct kinds. Some of them are capital investments in the strict sense of the word, earning very high dividends or rates of interest.  The other portion belongs to the short-term type of investment essential to banking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator say whether the Irish banks do in fact lend money to industry in Britain, although they will not lend money to industry in Ireland?</P>

      <P>I am afraid we are allowing the debate to develop into a discussion on monetary reform rather than on the Bill before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not engaging in a discussion on monetary reform and I do not intend to, but I am entitled to say this: if it is suggested to the Minister that he can get money at certain very low rates of interest, because money of a certain kind has been earning very low rates elsewhere, I am entitled to show there may be some fallacy in the contention.  I would like to give the House a little enlightenment, although I do not intend to labour the point.  There are two different kinds of investment in question. One of them, at very low rates, is that in which banks generally engage because of the peculiar nature of their business.  Unless we are prepared to introduce legislation or some kind of conscription with regard to wealth, banks must be in a position to meet their liabilities whenever they are called upon to meet them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that case, the banker must invest in securities of a short-term nature on which only a very low rate of interest can be paid.  I am not quarrelling with Senator Duffy on that&mdash;I have no intention to&mdash;but it is only fair that the position in regard to this matter should be stated and understood.  I would like very much to go on discussing this matter, but I am afraid, Sir, that judging <Col N="1558" /> by the few notes I have here, it might lead to a much deeper discussion on monetary policy than is permitted in a debate on this Bill, and so I will leave the matter at that, except to say that I would like to draw Senator Duffy's attention to this point, that there is a very great difference between what are commonly called the three C's&mdash;currency, credit and capital.  I do not think that it is possible for the Government to create capital.  Capital must come from the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely they can create credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>They can create credit, yes, but I have drawn attention to this, that there is a difference between credit and capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but the credit would create the capital in the case of the Erne, for instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that credit can give rise to capital but what I want to draw attention to is that in our circumstances, and especially at the moment, any attempt by the Government or the Central Bank to create what one might call capital will only result in sending the fool further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely nobody suggests that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>If we take a realistic view the position is not that we suffer from a shortage of capital. Actually there is so much capital that an outlet for it all cannot be found. If we could induce the public to transfer that capital to the Government or the Electricity Supply Board we will have achieved something.  That is the only way we are going to achieve it. Whether we get it at 3 per cent. or 5 per cent. is another matter.  I believe that it would be possible to get it at 3 per cent. or thereabouts.  Whether the Electricity Supply Board would feel that it would be worth while for them to go and look for it at that rate, or something lower, or whether they should make the contract at the rates which obtain, and whether they feel they would be able to use the capital within a reasonable time, only the <Col N="1559" /> board in the circumstances can say.  I agree that we should obtain the loans at as low a rate as possible, but we must be very careful about this question of interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator say whether he considers it good national policy for the Government of this country to invest in Great Britain the moneys committed to their care in the Post Office Savings Bank?</P>

      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>The only other matter that I want to refer to is the point made by Senator Duffy, where he referred to the fact that the Government is able to get money at 2½ per cent. and lend it out at 5 per cent., thereby making a profit.  If that is true certainly there is something wrong, but pending an investigation of the matter I am inclined to doubt that it is a fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, in fairness to the House and for fear of being side-tracked into discussions not germane <Col N="1560" /> to the matter before the House, I will leave the matter as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see that the Minister will have a very much easier time in passing his Bill through the Oireachtas than his predecessor had under the previous Government. Everybody now seems to support the development of electricity, but when the Shannon development measure was going through the Oireachtas it met with very definite opposition in this House.  I think that all those who opposed it would be prepared now to admit the wisdom of the Minister who conceived and piloted that scheme through the Oireachtas at that particular time.  The agricultural representatives in the Seanad at that time very definitely supported the Shannon development scheme.  I think only for the attitude of the agricultural representatives then in the Seanad the Bill would not have become law.  After all, there is as much sense in the agricultural representatives as there is in a very big number of representatives of this House, and in the representatives of the big industries who, at that time, very definitely opposed the scheme.  When the scheme was being discussed in this House we were told of the great blessings which rural electrification would confer on the farmers.  They are still waiting to get these blessings.  We have seen none of them.  The farmers cannot get any electric supply at any time, and I am not very optimistic that under this Bill the blessings which we are now being promised are going to materialise.  If anything like half of the amount which the Electricity Supply Board has been charging or proposes to charge for bringing an electricity supply is to continue to be charged there will be very few farmers able to take advantage of the opportunity to get electricity in their homes or farmyards.  I have been trying for a number of years, long before the emergency, to get an electricity supply for a number of farmers in my district.  I want to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and to the Electricity Supply Board about the matter.  I have been hammering at them for six or seven <Col N="1561" /> years without any effect.  I was told by one of the officials that if we could set up any sort of a little factory in the village we would be sure of getting electricity brought there, and that then farmers would be able to get it.  I pointed out to the official that there are three farmers in my district who are giving more employment than any of the little factories, that we are producing valuable goods, and that we were paying over £7,000 in wages, but I was told that a little factory in the village would have four times the effect in getting an electricity supply brought there.  I hope the policy has since changed.  I went to the Department later and stated that there were two farmers and myself living within two miles of a 10,000 volt line.  We were able to guarantee the Electricity Supply Board £50 if we could get a supply.  We would pay for wiring the houses and the farmyards, and we would guarantee £50 a year for the supply for five years.  If we consumed more than that, we were satisfied to pay at the ordinary rates, but we would pay that no matter how much we used. That was turned down.  If that policy is going to continue very few farmers will be able to get electricity into their homes or their yards.</P>
      <P>The Minister has now a clear field to develop his scheme, which has the support of everybody, but if he continues to try to make money and to charge anything like half-price for the bringing of electricity to the farmers, very few will avail of the scheme, because the cost of bringing electricity to the farmhouses is entirely too great.  We are prepared to pay a fair rate.  We do not want it even at the rate obtaining in the towns and cities.  We want the Minister to arrive at a fairly reasonable figure and bring the electricity to the villages and small towns so as to give farmers an opportunity of taking in a supply.  I trust that the Minister will consider that point when he is making his arrangements with the Electricity Supply Board.  I support the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>A great many people are anxious to know whether the <Col N="1562" /> policy of having minor schemes in villages and hamlets will be part of the entire structure under this measure.  There are villages and towns so remote from any main line one could think of that it would not be possible for them to secure electricity for 20 years, if ever.  Through these hamlets and villages there is usually a strong stream running which, for nine months of the year, would provide an ample supply of electricity over a big area.  If the material were available, and if those anxious to inaugurate schemes in places like that were subsidised by the Government at the same rate as Government assistance will be forthcoming in respect of the major scheme, they would be more inclined to carry out local schemes than wait for the major scheme, which may not reach them for many years. I am aware of two or three such schemes which were a great success prior to the emergency.  When materials are available, I think that many hamlets with a water supply will be anxious to establish little generating stations on their own account.  In times of emergency, those stations would relieve the load on the major schemes.  I think that it would be wise for the Minister to consider the question from that angle and to facilitate those who are anxious to inaugurate such schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody who realises the privations suffered by many people in the rural areas since the emergency, owing to the absence of kerosene, will welcome any effort made to extend the advantages of electric lighting to houses in those areas. Whatever criticism may be levelled at the proposal to extend such benefits to rural areas, those who are the most severe critics will be amongst the first to avail of the facilities afforded when rural electrification becomes an accomplished fact.  That was the case when the original Shannon scheme was established.  Those responsible for the most devastating criticism and those who argued that the £5,000,000 involved would be more usefully spent on drainage and bog roads were amongst the first to avail of the <Col N="1563" /> amenities afforded by the Shannon hydro-electric scheme.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that it is the intention to utilise the water power in other rivers to supplement the supply of electricity, and I should like to point out that there are other rivers in the country than the Shannon and the Erne the power of which could be harnessed with very good effect.  In that connection, it occurs to me that the question of rural electrification and arterial drainage should go hand in hand.  I know very well that that might present administrative difficulties, seeing that arterial drainage is a matter for a Government body while rural electrification will be in the hands of the Electricity Supply Board, which is not a Government body.  At the same time, I think that, for the sake of economy and to prevent overlapping, some scheme of co-ordination should be instituted.  I am delighted that it is the intention to utilise the inexhaustible supply of turf which, happily, this country is possessed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the plant will be so disposed throughout the country as to prevent the wastage which has characterised the schemes for the production of turf since the emergency.  I fully appreciate that the cost of installation of electricity may be an obstacle to enjoyment of the benefits to be conferred by this scheme.  I believe that something could be done to bring those costs within the capacity of the people who will have to bear them.  Certainly, the charges made by the Electricity Supply Board for installations, even in normal times, were excessive and would be regarded as exorbitant by many people who would like to avail of this scheme.  The charge was, on the average, about 21/- for each light.  That was too much.  Senator McEllin suggested that an effort should be made to give people free installations.  I am not in favour of that.  There is the danger that, if it were possible to do that, and if it were done, the people might expect free light afterwards and there is very little respect in this country for anything which is obtained for nothing. So far as the administration of the Electricity Supply Board is concerned, <Col N="1564" /> I feel that that body is not so anxious to accommodate people as it should be.</P>
    <P>I know a case in which a very valuable building site was made use of by the Electricity Supply Board for the erection of a transformer.  The people who owned that building site made no question about it, and the amount of compensation paid was merely nominal. Afterwards, an offer was made for the site by a gentleman who was anxious to extend his business, and the people who owned the site made application to the Electricity Supply Board with a view to finding out whether it would be possible to transfer it to them without any loss.  The answer was that the Electricity Supply Board were prepared to do that but the charge involved was unreasonable and amounted to about three times the value of the site.</P>
    <P>Now, there is no reason why the Electricity Supply Board should not be prepared and even anxious to facilitate members of the general public in a matter of that kind, and I think they should not be allowed to stand in the way of public progress.  When an offer was made to them in the case I have mentioned, to move a transformer to a more suitable site, the cost of the removal of that transformer was excessive, and I do not think there is any reason why that should happen.  I think that the more ready and willing the Electricity Supply Board are to accept such circumstances and to facilitate the public, the more ready will people be to avail of the facilities provided by the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the speeches that have been made here, it was a relief to hear somebody coming down from the stratosphere of high finance to the ordinary things that matter.  Being a woman, I do not know much about high finance but, from the chorus of welcoming voices which greeted this Bill, both in the Dáil and in this House, I think that the woman's voice should not be missing because, of all the beneficiaries of its provisions, women&mdash;and especially the women of the countryside&mdash;stand in the front rank.  It holds for them <Col N="1565" /> the promise of one of the most fundamental &ldquo;freedoms&rdquo;&mdash;though I do not know whether that &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; was listed in the famous declaration&mdash;freedom from senseless and unnecessary drudgery.  Moreover, the Bill will make it possible to add enormously to the amenities of home life in rural areas, and help to render the domestic hearth more attractive to the young people, balancing, against the lure of the cities, the pleasure of the home circle, such as reading, music, wireless listening, games, needlework, etc.&mdash;all those good things which the provision of electric light and power brings to the most modest dwelling.  All this would be in addition to the stepping-up in farming efficiency which a wider use of mechanised power in rural economy is bound to ensure.  For instance, the supply of piped water to the house and dairy, the electric iron, the washing machine&mdash;all those helps which a scheme of rural electrification turns from a dream into attainable realities&mdash;will do more to make the hard work of the country woman easier than anything else it is possible to conceive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in farming more than almost any other avocation, the women's part is of the utmost importance, and no plans for the development and improvement of Irish farming which fail to take cognisance of that fundamental fact can go very far.  I should like Senator Johnston to bear that fact in mind in connection with any scheme of post-war planning.  What I fear, however, is that our countrywomen will not rouse themselves to take full advantage of and claim their new &ldquo;freedom&rdquo;. Too long have they allowed themselves to accept the role of uncomplaining drudge, working from the dark of morning to the dark of night at the heaviest tasks, without any of the mechanical aids which women in more progressive countries than ours look on as their right for the alleviation of toil.  Too long have they pandered to an attitude on the part of their menfolk which finds illustration in a story I read long ago in an American journal&mdash;when I used to go, like Senator Johnston, to American magazines for light reading.  Apart <Col N="1566" /> from my obvious antiquity, that was in the days when incubators were still a new invention, and, according to the story, a Yankee salesman was exercising all his art to dispose of one of these incubators to a backwoods farmer.  As a clinching argument, he stressed the great saving of time the more modern method assured, to which the farmer countered: &ldquo;What the dash&rdquo;&mdash;he did not say &ldquo;dash&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;do I care about a hen's time?&rdquo; Unfortunately, a great many men, and, what is more disconcerting, the women themselves, set the same value on women's time&mdash;it is &ldquo;hen's time&rdquo; and therefore does not count.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister has made it plain that the success of the scheme of rural electrification&mdash;in so far as that success is defined by a low cost of provision&mdash; will depend on the co-operation of the people whom it is intended to benefit. The extent to which people may be willing to take a supply will react on the proportion that may be supplied within that criterion area.  It seems evident to me, then, that we must get the women of the countryside clamouring for electric current, and forcing their menfolk into a realisation of its benefits, both economic and social.</P>
    <P>How can that be done?  Taking a long view, we must aim at the adequate training for their vocation of the girls who are to be the future farmers' wives.  Such girls, trained as the girls in Belgium, Holland and Germany were trained in pre-war days, will not be content with muscle-power farm methods; and if there were enough of them the Electricity Supply Board will not have far to go to look for a large percentage of rural customers.  But the problem of &ldquo;a bigger and better supply&rdquo; of farmers' wives only incidentally arises here, and I do not propose to do more than refer to it now.</P>
    <P>Two problems do arise, however, and if we are to get our countrywomen &ldquo;electricity-minded&rdquo;, we must not overlook them.  They are a part of our traditional rural economy, and have to do with the scarcity of ready cash in the average country home.  As most of us are aware, the majority of country people do not handle much money except at certain seasons.  The local <Col N="1567" /> merchants give them credit, until they get paid for their cattle or crops.  Now if the Electricity Supply Board does not take cognisance of this state of affairs and expects payment on a two-months' basis, there will be a great hesitancy in a great many farmhouses to change over from the oil and candles they get on credit from the shop to electricity.  There may be difficulty too about the money for wiring and installation.  But that could be spread over a long term and included in the consumption bill.  A still better solution would be if ready money were actually brought into the country houses through the introduction of electric current.  What I have in mind here is the fostering of home industries such as have been the salvation of France.  It is a fact familiar to many Senators that in whole districts in France every farmhouse was a little factory and it was the abundance and cheapness of electric power, derived from small local plants, which made this state of affairs possible. Different districts specialised in different crafts&mdash;glove-making, toy manufacture, the grinding of glass for watches, etc.  There was in each case a central selling agency which took care of the marketing of its products. I think we might aim at something of this sort and realise that the Bill we are considering brings advantages well within the radius of practical plans for the economic and social advancement of the Irish countryside.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ruane and Senator McEllin that the cost of installation will be a deterrent, as country people do not believe in spending a lot of money on things for which they do not see an immediate return, and nobody would think of suggesting that electric light should be installed in these houses for nothing, but the cost should be spread over an extended period, because I do not think many country people have reached the stage when they would willingly part immediately with the sums required to defray the cost.  There may be the solution, I suggest, and I commend it to the Minister, by which we might make ready cash more freely available by the introduction of electric current. <Col N="1568" /> What I have in mind is the scheme that worked really well in France, by which home industries were fostered.  France was covered with a network of small electric plants which supplied light and very cheap power to all the farmhouses.  Virtually every farmhouse was not only a household but a sort of miniature factory, and regions specialised in the production of different commodities.  I remember reading a most extraordinary book, which showed how France, in spite of all she went through, was able to survive.  That was largely through the operation of the family rooted on the farm and of industries carried out in connection with the farm.  There was an excellent scheme of marketing, and then, as I say, different regions specialised in the production of different commodities.  The scheme worked out extremely well.  The Minister might give some attention to this matter in his post-war planning.  I believe that we need some fillip like that to give the people a real interest in securing for themselves the benefits of electric light and power, otherwise they will think only of the cost.  They have not been sufficiently accustomed to see the advantages.  That is to say, if the advantages can be expressed in money power or earning power, it will bring home to them more than anything else the value of the scheme. I am very glad that the Minister has brought forward this Bill.  I hope that it will have all the success that he envisages for it and that it will secure all the benefits which we are entitled to hope for under it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.J. O'Reilly Mr. P.J. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer very briefly to some statements made by the Minister in introducing the Bill yesterday.  I do not know if I heard the Minister properly or not, but I understood him to say that at present there is no power vested in him to deal with schemes that have water as their source of power.  That statement rather surprised me because unless my information is very wrong a very elaborate series of plans was lodged for the development of the Boyne some time ago&mdash;roughly about a year ago&mdash; and some of the most historic parts of the country were to be submerged in <Col N="1569" /> connection with that scheme.  The plans were of a very elaborate nature, so far as I know.  If the Minister has at present no power to deal with schemes other than generating schemes, it does seem a bit surprising that these elaborate plans would have been lodged at that time. There is a serious aspect of this matter to which I should like to draw attention.  If a scheme is projected in connection with a river and no action is taken on that for a considerable time, a great amount of uncertainty is created in the minds of property owners along the river as to what is going to happen.  The tendency of that uncertainty is to depreciate very much property adjacent to the river. I would suggest, therefore, taking the Boyne as an example that if any mistake were made&mdash;I do not say that a mistake was made&mdash;there should be great hesitation in taking action in view of the possibility of inflicting very severe losses on the people concerned. I probably misunderstood the Minister's remarks on the matter, but perhaps he would deal with it again in his reply.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to turf as a source of power, and he mentioned that it was very necessary to have a stand-by station.  He mentioned that the Pigeon House was a stand-by station, depending on coal for its power.  What exactly do we mean by a &ldquo;stand-by&rdquo;?  Is the stand-by station in constant operation concurrently with other sources of electrical power?  If these other sources of power break down, to what extent will the stand-by stations meet the needs of the whole country, since, by hypothesis, it requires power from the Shannon, the Erne and the Liffey to supply the full needs of the country?  Is the Clonsast station to be in constant operation or is it going to be in operation only at intervals?  Perhaps it may mean that instead of being used to its fullest extent only portion of the power available from that station will be used. These are a few questions which I should like the Minister to answer when he is replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter yesterday referred to the advantage of removing turf from <Col N="1570" /> the surface of the country in the shortest possible time.  From time immemorial the bog was regarded as the farmers' coal mine.  I am not so happy about a station such as Clonsast which will use enormous quantities of turf and do away with this coal mine in a comparatively short period.  I do not think that turf is the type of fuel which should be applied to purposes like that because, should an emergency occur again at some time in the future, when our turf supply has completely disappeared, matters may be very serious for us.  Of course it may be said that electricity will be developed to such an extent that it can be used as a source of heating as well as a source of light and power as at present.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with other points, I should like to express the pleasure with which I heard Senator Honan refer to the desirability of allowing small schemes which have been operated successfully in the past to continue in operation.  I called attention to this matter in connection with the Arterial Drainage Bill.  I hope there will be no tendency, as a result of the passing of this Bill, on the part of the Minister, to exercise powers the effect of which would be to insist upon the closing up of these small schemes.  I can see that he may say that, in the case of certain villages where schemes are dependent upon oil or some such source of power apart from water power, there may be a possibility of the exploitation of consumers on the part of the owners of these schemes.  I can see that point, but then it is up to the people in those places, if that exploitation is being imposed upon them, to see that the advantages of the larger national scheme are availed of.</P>
    <P>Senator O Buachalla referred to the need for educational work in connection with this big scheme.  I should like to point out that within the past six weeks the committee with which I am connected put up this suggestion to the Department of Education, but unfortunately, as we see it, these Departments are very independent, one of the other.  Where a good thing involves a certain amount of expenditure, each of the Departments is fighting for safety.  That is a bad spirit, <Col N="1571" /> and personally I see a great need for propaganda work generally.  There will be, in the first place, a great amount of danger involved in the use of electricity. Probably, before we have got to understand it properly, a lot of people will have met their deaths.  The number of casualties ought to be reduced to the minimum, and, from that point of view, I suggest that there should be a series of lectures in the various rural areas, lectures of a popular type, explaining generally the idea of electricity, its powers, its advantages, its dangers, and so on.</P>
    <P>Now I come to submit the desirability of providing for advisory committees in connection with this scheme. I was sorry to see that the Minister in the other House rejected those advisory committees.  The Scotch are a very canny race, as we know, and in regard to their big hydro-electric scheme they thought it desirable to have two committees, one an amenity committee and the other a fishery committee.  Dealing with the amenity committee first, I would go back again to what I stated about the Boyne scheme.  Many of you who are familiar with the valley of the Boyne and the well-known beauty spots there are familiar with the fact that the part that was to be affected or may be affected is the burial place of the old kings.  Some very ancient raths would have been submerged.  Slane Castle, I understand, would have been submerged.  I do not say that it is a particularly historic place, but it housed and sheltered Archbishop Hurley on one occasion.  Practically every square foot of the ground in that neighbourhood contains the remains of our ancestors.  Here, I might say behind the backs of the people&mdash;they do not know anything about it&mdash;it was proposed to submerge all that ground, without any question of protecting the ancient monuments alongside the river. That is one reason for the appointment of an amenity committee&mdash;to advise the Minister regarding spots of that kind which may be affected by those schemes.</P>
    <P>As regards the fishery side of things, no doubt we have the Minister for Agriculture, who has a certain number <Col N="1572" /> of advisers, but, from my contacts with people who are interested in the sport of fishing as well as in the fishing industry, I would say that they are of the opinion that some great improvement in the present methods is very necessary.</P>
    <P>Vocational organisation has not yet become a universally popular idea. Surely, here is an opportunity of employing the theories of vocational education that cannot by any stretch of imagination do any harm and will certainly do an immense amount of good.  An advisory committee such as that suggested would keep the officials of the Department in touch with the views of those interested in this sport and in this very important industry.  I would appeal to the Minister then to consider the advisability of setting up the two committees which were suggested in the other House.  The Tourist Board is one of the bodies that would be concerned.  They would be entitled to appoint a representative. If we ignore that side of the resources of the country, surely we are making no attempt to co-operate with the efforts of that board to make Ireland an attractive place for tourists.  In addition to the Tourist Board, you will have a number of others, such as boards of conservators throughout the country, different anglers' associations, and about half a dozen, or if you like a dozen, people who would keep the Minister in touch with current opinions with regard to those matters.  I am in touch with quite a number of people who know something about this question, and it is my view that there is very great need for an improvement in inland fisheries generally.  I believe that, if the Minister could see his way to accept this suggestion, he would give very great pleasure to a vast number of people.  Fishing is a peculiar sort of art in some ways, because it establishes friendships between the lord and the labourer.  If we want to find a method of gradually melting away the Border I suggest that the solution of the problem should be put into the hands of the fishermen.  The Border would disappear in a comparatively short time because of the friendships established through this sport. There is no question of aristocracy or <Col N="1573" /> of any other class.  All classes, the poorest and the richest, are interested in it, and it is a very healthy sport.  I would appeal then to the Minister to give this matter consideration.  To enable him to do so, I will probably submit some amendments for the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Mrs. Concannon, I should not like to enter into this very contentious question of money.  Some statements were made last night regarding the matter.  For some time past, I have given a very considerable amount of study to the monetary side of things, but I will not go into the matter at the moment.  Instead of being annoyed with Senator Sir John Keane for having suggested the possibility of getting money at 3 per cent.&mdash; some speakers were annoyed&mdash;I think we should realise that, by virtue of his position as chairman of a very important bank, he stated something which ought to be of considerable service to the Minister and to us all. He has mentioned the possibility of getting money at 3 per cent.  Personally, I believe it could be got at 2½ or 2 per cent.  Anyway, it is a big reduction, from 5 per cent. to 3 per cent., and probably, with a little persuasion, it might come down a little bit more.  In that event, the scheme would be much cheaper, so I do not think there is any need to be annoyed at the suggestion about getting money at a cheaper rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to resist the temptation to join in the general throwing of bouquets at the Minister for Industry and Commerce as a result of his introduction of this Bill.  I believe it is an excellent Bill and that it is, in fact, long overdue. It is a long time since I suggested that some such scheme should be brought into existence to deal with rural areas. I think at that time several people laughed at my suggestion that it would go a long way towards stopping the flight from the land.  There has been a lot of talk about the disastrous flight from the land, but nobody seemed to suggest any way by which it could be stopped.  I said then, and I say now, that I believe this rural electrification will do more to get people settled down on the land than anything <Col N="1574" /> else that could possibly be done for the rural areas.  Senator Mrs. Concannon referred to the fact that you can bring a horse to water but you cannot make him drink.  I had the experience a few days ago of bringing a horse to the water but he was so tired when he got there that, although he wanted to drink, he was not able to do so.  We finished up by having to &ldquo;bottle&rdquo; him with the water.  Anybody listening to Senator Counihan and Senator Baxter would think that the farmers would have to be &ldquo;bottled&rdquo; with electricity in order to make them take it.  Notwithstanding those attempts to throw a wet blanket on the scheme, while at the same time lacking the moral courage to denounce it, I can assure the Minister that he will find the farmers on their toes waiting for this electricity to be sent around to the rural areas.  The only worry I have is that it will not get around to the rural areas sufficiently soon.  Many people in rural areas really believe that it can be done by the Minister waving his magic wand, as he has so often done in the past, but we all know that it cannot be done overnight.  However, I look forward to the not far distant time when electricity will be available in many of the rural areas of this country.</P>
      <P>Attempts have been made to throw the usual political wet blanket on this scheme as on other schemes introduced by this Government.  The suggestion is made that the farmers would not pay the initial outlay which would be necessary for the installation of electricity. I do not believe that is so at all.  I believe the principal difficulty is to decide which area is to get a supply of current first, and which farmer will have it installed first, and I believe that the farmers, as they have always done, will chip in and do their bit, and will not hesitate to pay a reasonable price for their electricity and a reasonable price for the necessary installation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that any house with electricity is worth far more than one without it, and it follows naturally that a farm with electric light and power is worth more than a farm which has not got it.  That being so, <Col N="1575" /> there are enough institutions in the country ready to advance money on reasonable terms to enable farmers to overcome any difficulty which may exist in that connection.</P>
    <P>Section 31 of the Bill deals with the right of the board to go into the manufacture of electrical appliances, if it is necessary.  Certain suggestions have been made that that is an interference with individual enterprise.  It is quite clear from the Bill that that is not so, and that it is far from being the intention behind the Bill.  It is more or less as a precaution against the possibility that private enterprise may not come in sufficiently quickly, or in sufficient quantity, to meet the demand that may and probably will arise when this scheme gets under way.</P>
    <P>There are numerous things for which electricity can and will be used, and I believe that as soon as the people in one area see what has been made possible in another area, they will get ready themselves to avail of the electric current when it comes along. Senator Mrs. Concannon made what was, in my opinion, a very helpful speech, and I believe a good deal of propaganda of that sort will be necessary to make the people electrically-minded, if you like to put it that way. Most of us here were reared very far away from electric light and appliances, but we know very well when we got used to them we find it difficult to get along without them.  In the same way, if the young girls are trained to use electrical appliances in the technical schools, they will urge their fathers and mothers and families to instal electricity as soon as it is available.</P>
    <P>Senator O Buachalla suggested that steps should be taken now to provide suitable machinery.  I think that that is a good idea and it will be very necessary and very desirable that we should have up-to-date equipment, but I think something which is more important is that we should get somebody working on schemes now to utilise our present machinery in conjunction with electric current.  I am a very long way from being a mechanical engineer.  I know little about it and have no taste for mechanical things, but I think that all <Col N="1576" /> that will be necessary in a great many cases will be a small electric motor with a belt and sonic shafting to utilise our existing machines.  In that way, we will make the installation of electricity more enticing for the average farmer.</P>
    <P>Of course, a lot of new equipment would be necessary and desirable when current is available but, in the meantime, we should make plans to get along with what we have in the line of turnip cutters and oat crushers.  Apart from the convenience of power-driven machines, I believe we would be able to use our raw materials to a greater advantage.  Most of us who are in touch with the land know that there is a great improvement in the feeding of stock if you can prepare it properly. Properly prepared food is beneficial to all animals, particularly young horses, and old ones, too.  It is very important to have oats properly crushed and that can be done very much easier by means of electrical equipment.</P>
    <P>In the same way, I believe that electricity on the farm will make all the difference there.  Most of us know what it is to walk out of a farmhouse on a dark winter's night and hit our toe against a bucket.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

      <P>Senator Baxter will have to agree that electric light in the farmyard makes conditions much easier.  I wonder if he ever heard of anyone walking into a donkey at night-time.  I believe that electricity will go a long way to eliminate a lot of the distress associated with farming, and I believe that far from being reluctant to accept electricity, the farmers will jump at it and will have no hesitation in trying to get the supply lines into their part of the country before they are brought anywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Senator Honan who <Col N="1577" /> asked if it would be possible for individual schemes to be proposed where power is available.  As far as I can understand, that is possible under the Bill and was possible before the Bill was introduced at all.  It was possible to have individual power schemes developed where local rivers were available, and I believe that a good many schemes have already been inaugurated in the country.  I look forward to the day when the Electricity Supply Board will go around the country and examine the possibility of supplying power from such sources in every rural area, and the sooner that is done the better.</P>
    <P>Senator Counihan said that the agricultural representatives in this House and the other House backed up the Shannon scheme when other people were criticising it and doubting whether it would be supported.  We all know the blessings which have come from that scheme.  I think that on numerous occasions I saw Senator Counihan enjoying to the fullest the blessings of the Electricity Supply Board when standing on a fair green at 5 o'clock or 6 o'clock in the morning. When the electric light was switched on, he soaked in it just as well as the rest of us.  I think that the last scheme was a good scheme, a good beginning, and I am glad to throw one more bouquet at the Minister for his efforts to extend it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other members of the Seanad in welcoming this Bill and in paying a meed of praise to the Minister for his courage in bringing it forward.  We have heard a great deal during this discussion about rural electrification, but the Bill, as such, contains only one section dealing with rural electrification.  That is Section 41, which empowers the Minister for Finance to advance to the board sums not exceeding in amount £5,000,000 for the purpose of the electrification of rural areas.  That section also provides that one-half of the money should be repaid to the Central Fund by the Minister for Finance out of moneys voted by the Oireachtas and that the remainder of the money should be repaid by the board.  That means that <Col N="1578" /> the board must pay to the Minister for Finance at least £2,500,000.  The question arises where the board will get the money out of rural electrification. Senator Quirke said that the farmers are on their toes waiting to take the electricity.  That may be so, but are they on their toes ready to pay for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not say it.  Assuming they are on their toes waiting for the electricity, I will give them the benefit of the doubt and say that they are on their toes to pay for it.  It appears that, as far as rural electrification is concerned, this Bill is only a half measure, because it will be necessary to enact further legislation to implement the policy of rural electrification. You cannot electrify the rural areas without electrical plant and without huge capital outlay.  Now, the farmer must pay the capital cost of the installation and of the lines which will bring the electricity to his farm from the grid.  It would be a good plan that the policy adopted by the Agricultural Credit Corporation of making advances to farmers for the purposes of purchasing stock should be extended to the purchase of electrical equipment and electric plant for the equipment of farms.  It is all very well to talk about the blessings of rural electrification, and about making farmers and farmers' wives electricity-minded, but in the end it resolves itself into a question of capacity to pay for the electricity supply. Therefore, I think that that aspect of the matter has not up to the present received full consideration.  The Electricity Supply Board must repay to the Minister for Finance half the moneys advanced for the purpose of rural electrification.  The board must collect that from farmers or persons who benefit.  Therefore, it is a mistake to say that this is a Bill dealing with rural electrification.  It is nothing of the sort.  It is a Bill for the purpose of the preparation and execution of schemes by the Electricity Supply Board for the generation of electricity from suitable rivers other than the Shannon and the Liffey, and the acquisition and management by the board of fisheries and fishery rights <Col N="1579" /> in these rivers.  These are the main objects of the Bill.  We all welcome the policy of generating electricity from suitable rivers in the country.  The Minister mentioned the Erne as a suitable river, and I am sure there are other rivers of a lesser size which would be just as suitable for the particular districts through which they flow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill also gives the board power to acquire fisheries.  Senator P.J. O'Reilly spoke about the comradeship of fishermen and said that all our ills, according to my impression of his speech, can be cured by the comradeship which exists amongst fishermen. We had in this House a very short time ago a Drainage Bill in which the interests of drainage in my opinion were sacrificed to the interests of fishermen.  It appears to me that in this Bill the Minister for Agriculture as the protector of fisheries is driving a very hard bargain with the Minister for Industry and Commerce who is promoting this Bill.  If we look at Section 11 of the Bill, we see it is entitled in the margin &ldquo;protection of fisheries&rdquo; and we will find that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has agreed to the Minister for Agriculture deciding whether or not any particular work which the Minister for Agriculture requires to be carried out for the protection of fisheries is or is not detrimental to the hydro-electric work or is a substantial increase in the cost of the hydro-electric work.  I should like to know how the Minister for Agriculture has expert advisers or machinery at his disposal to decide&mdash;and he has the final word&mdash;whether or not any works substantially increase the cost of the hydro-electric work or are of substantial detriment to them.  I say that this policy which has been adopted recently of the Minister for Agriculture as protector of fisheries forcing his views on the Parliamentary Secretary in the case of the Drainage Bill and now on the Minister for Industry and Commerce is going too far.  I say that this is primarily a hydro-electric Bill and if it should so happen that the fisheries should suffer slightly, well, <Col N="1580" /> they must suffer.  There are as good fish in the sea as were ever caught.  I mean there are more fish there.  It is easier to get fish than to get electricity.  Therefore, I think that in this Bill we should regard our main object as the provision of electricity. I have no objection to fishermen or to fish.  In fact I like fish very much but we must, in legislation, have a sense of proportion, and the Minister should reconsider the power which he has agreed that the Minister for Agriculture should have in connection with the hydro-electric works.</P>
    <P>I say that the board alone is entitled to decide what types of work are or are not detrimental to a hydro-electric scheme.  These are suggestions of mine but I am merely pointing out what was already provided for in the Shannon Electricity Act of 1925 and the Liffey Reservoir Act, 1936.  By Section 16 of the Liffey Reservoir Act, 1936, the Minister for Industry and Commerce was empowered to decide what type of work was or was not detrimental to the Liffey works.  He has surrendered his right since that time, and now he is giving the Minister for Agriculture in this Bill power to decide what type of work is or is not a detriment to hydro-electric work.  I just mention these matters to show that this is not a Bill for rural electrification at all.  It is merely the thin end of the wedge.  A great deal of legislation must yet be enacted before rural electrification can be carried to a successful conclusion.  The Minister has given us some figures as to the cost of the project and the length of time which will be required to carry it out.  Rural electrification must be dealt with on a long-term basis and this is just the beginning of the matter.  A great deal of work must yet be done before electricity will find its way into the farmhouses and farmyards and before electricity will wash the clothes and boil the kettle in the farmer's home. While the Minister should be congratulated on introducing rural electrification, he should not stop there, but should plan further for the carrying into effect of rural electrification by legislation enabling the farmers to pay <Col N="1581" /> for the equipment which will be necessary if the scheme is to be a success. With these words, I support this Bill and wish it every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that all the speakers who have gone before me are right in their views and that I am mistaken in the views which I intend to express on this Bill.  I am very sorry if I disagree with the Minister because nobody knows better than I do the good work he has done by way of industrial development since he became Minister for Industry and Commerce. Some of the figures which he gave yesterday rather frightened me.  If I understood him rightly, he said that there would be 75,000 miles of wire laid down, as against 3,840 miles under the present scheme.  If I am wrong in those figures, I hope the Minister will correct me.  If that be a fact, the mileage of wires will be 19 times what it is at present.  I see that £13,500,000 was advanced to the Electricity Supply Board for the schemes which have been carried out.  I assume that it cost about £8,500,000 to erect the works at Ardnacrusha. I take £5,000,000 as the cost of the wiring of the 3,840 miles.  If that be multiplied by 19, it amounts to £90,000,000&mdash;an enormous sum.  That assumes that the work will be carried out now at the same cost as it was under the Acts of 1927 and 1937. Senator Duffy says that it will be 75 per cent. more.  That would add very much to the cost.  That is one of my troubles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, if you develop other rivers, you will have to put down turbines and other engines such as had to be put down in connection with the Shannon scheme.  That will cost a great deal of money, too.  The old scheme has paid about £1,000,000 a year since 1927 but, after all, they tapped the cities and towns.  Here it will be necessary to have the wires running from house to house.  Senator Baxter suggested that great care should be taken to secure that people living in mountainous districts would get a supply of electricity as quickly as those in other parts of the country.  Senator Baxter probably knows Connemara and areas of that type.  I do not know how many <Col N="1582" /> transformers would have to be erected to bring electricity to the houses of persons in those areas.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question which Senator Concannon touched upon. You may bring the horse to the water but you cannot make him drink.  In this case, we are bringing the water to the horse.  In other words, we are bringing electricity to the people, but will they pay for the installation? Senator Quirke thinks that they will. I sincerely hope he is right.  I suggest that, before any scheme be carried out under this Bill, not alone should a demand come from the people but the people who say they desire to have electricity should be required to sign contracts to pay the estimated cost of getting electricity into their houses and the charge for the electricity when installed.  If the Electricity Supply Board proceed along those lines, they can make no mistake.  I believe that, under those conditions, the scheme would be a success, but if the Electricity Supply Board proceed without those contracts, there is a grave danger that electricity will be made available in certain areas and not used as it ought to be used.  A great deal has been said as to what electricity will do on the farms.  Senator Counihan and a few other big farmers want electricity extended to their farms.  Big farmers and industries will require this service, but will that pay for bringing it out to the rural areas if the smaller householders do not take it in and agree to pay their share of the charges?  This is a very big problem.  I shall not go into matters of finance, but the amount is big, whether the rate be 3 per cent. or 5 per cent.  There is an idea abroad now that money is of no value.  So far as I can see, the Central Bank is withdrawing a certain amount of notes from circulation every year.  I presume that that is done to prevent inflation and make money of some value.  Money will, I trust, be of some value in this country even in the post-war period.</P>
    <P>I am just as anxious as Senator Mrs. Concannon or other speakers to see rural houses brightened up, rural conditions <Col N="1583" /> made better, and thus keep the people on the land.  I should like to see our people industrial-minded, and I trust that education in our different types of schools, whether the primary schools, the vocational schools or the secondary schools, will be directed towards making use of the facilities that will be provided by this extension of electric power, once it comes to their doors as is proposed under this scheme.  I think it must be admitted that the trend of our education is not in that direction at the present time and that our young people are not being trained to know what to do with their hands.  They are trained for occupations which might seem to be more respectable and easier than work on the farm.  Perhaps my views are entirely wrong&mdash;I hope they are&mdash;and, personally, I wish, as other members of the House have wished, every success for the Minister so far as this Bill is concerned, but I do want to express my fears on the matter.</P>

      <P>It is, of course, correct to say, as stated by Senator Ryan, that this is not a Bill designed merely to facilitate the operation of the rural electrification scheme.  The Electricity Supply Board, under existing legislation, has all the powers that it needs to carry through the rural electrification project.  The only thing it requires is the money, and the purpose of the relevant section in this Bill is to provide the money which the board needs for that purpose.  The main parts of this Bill are designed to facilitate other development projects which the board have in contemplation. If the board had already obtained, through legislation, general powers to carry through hydro-electric works&mdash;powers which this Bill proposes to give them&mdash;then the measure that would now be presented to the Oireachtas would be very much shorter, indeed.  It will be noted that a very large number of sections of this Bill are designed to give very general powers which will not have to be repeated in the future.  The main purpose of the Bill is, firstly, to provide <Col N="1584" /> capital funds for the provision of steam generation stations which the board has full power to construct, to facilitate the board in the carrying through of hydro-electric schemes, to provide the finance for the rural electrification scheme, and to give the board powers to promote the manufacture of apparatus, subject to the restrictions which are suggested.</P>
      <P>A large part of the discussion on the Bill related to the finances of the Electricity Supply Board.  In that connection, I find it hard to know where to begin in order to put Senator Duffy right.  Senator Duffy brought his horse to the post, and he certainly started off with a good gallop, but it would appear to me that having started his gallop, he got on to the wrong track and was chasing himself in circles.  In his gallop he was gaily followed by Senator Baxter and Senator Sir John Keane, although I think that Senator Sir John Keane knew, or, at least suspected, that his horse had got on to the wrong track. Later on, however, Senator Duffy evidently felt that his horse had come a cropper, but, even so, he gallantly remounted and carried on.  First of all, however, I should like to make it clear to Senator Duffy and Senator Baxter, who was misled by Senator Duffy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not misled by Senator Duffy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if the Senator was not misled by Senator Duffy, perhaps he was misled by his own misconceptions. What I want to make clear to the Senators is that there is no relationship between developing the water power of the Erne and the rural electrification scheme.  If there were no rural electrification scheme, it would still be necessary to develop the Erne for power purposes.  We need to use the Erne now for power purposes.  The rural electrification scheme will take at least ten years to complete, and long before that period of ten years, we will have passed, in the generation programme, beyond the Erne and other power projects equally as comprehensive as the <Col N="1585" /> Erne project.  That misconception as to the relationship between the Erne project and the rural electrification scheme led Senator Duffy into a number of extraordinary calculations which produced equally extraordinary results.</P>
      <P>The report of the Electricity Supply Board on the rural electrification scheme mentions a figure of 12 per cent., as representing the return which the board requires to get in fixed charges from rural consumers on the capital cost of the rural network. Senator Duffy, however, related that figure to the cost of the Erne project, and he proceeded to make his calculations on the assumption that the board required to get, somewhere, a sum which was equivalent to 12 per cent. on the cost of the Erne project. As a result of that calculation he reached a conclusion as to the price to be charged for current from the Erne, which was extraordinarily fallacious. In fact, he ended up by concluding that if we could give the board capital for the Erne development at 3 per cent., instead of 5 per cent., it would mean a difference of one ½d. per unit.  Actually the cost per unit of Erne current will work out at 242 of 1d. per unit, and the difference of 1 per cent. in the cost of the capital involved to the board, as the scheme will cost something like £3,500,000, 1 per cent. of which is £35,000, would work out at about one-twentieth of 1d. per unit. It is true that in connection with a hydro-electric scheme the rate of interest practically determines the whole cost of the current, because once such a scheme is constructed the main charge involved is the capital charge, since the working cost is very low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will find, in the appendices to the report, a note showing how the board determines the cost of current generation at their stations.  They relate that cost, not merely to the charge in generating, but also to the charges involved in transmission, and they give, as the average cost per unit, 82 of 1d. at the output of the 10,000 volt lines. While, therefore, Senator Duffy was right in saying that the cost of current <Col N="1586" /> depends on the method of financing, if, by that, he means the amount they will have to pay in interest, he was incorrect in saying that the differentiation in the rates of interest will effect such a substantial difference in the costs of current as he quoted.  Senator Duffy said that he had heard nothing about how the scheme is to be financed.  I thought I had made it perfectly clear that the board is to be financed by advances from the Exchequer.  So far as generation works and other capital expenditures are concerned, the board will obtain advances from the Exchequer within the limits fixed by legislation and will repay these advances within the periods laid down.  In so far as the rural electrification scheme is concerned, they will receive advances from the Exchequer, and will repay only one-half of the total so advanced.</P>
    <P>In connection with the rural electrification scheme, I want to make it clear also that the amount which was estimated to be the cost of that scheme was estimated on the basis of pre-war prices; and all that has been taken into consideration in that regard is the cost of the network to be constructed in the rural areas.  I gave a figure of £17,000,000 as representing the capital cost that the board would have to incur in that scheme, but there is nothing in that total for generation.  There is nothing there except the cost of constructing of something like 75,000 miles of network.</P>
    <P>Senator Summerfield, whom I may, perhaps, congratulate on his maiden speech, suggested that the Government should proceed in connection with this rural electrification scheme on the basis of fixing the price at which it wishes current to be available to rural dwellers and then to relate the costs of the board to that price.  That is precisely what the Government is doing. The Government decided that it should endeavour to make current available to rural dwellers on the basis of the existing rural tariff of the board, that is, the rate charged for current which the board now provides for rural dwellers.  It can only provide current to a very limited number of rural <Col N="1587" /> dwellers at present, but on the basis of the charge now in operation the Government decided that the supply should be extended all over the country On examination it seemed clear that the board could do that without loss, provided that one-half of the capital cost of the network was made available by way of grant.  It may be that experience will show that that estimate was incorrect.  In making the calculation the board assumed a rate of interest of 5 per cent.  It assumed that rate of interest because it was entirely working on the basis of pre-war experience.  It had no other basis upon which to make assumptions.  It assumed pre-war prices for equipment and pre-war rates for interest.  If the rate of interest should prove to be lower, then the calculations will have to be varied accordingly.  If it is possible to provide the whole of the capital required for the purpose at a lower rate of interest than 5 per cent., then the board will not require a grant of one-half of the total cost and the taxpayer will be saved that amount.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane suggested that we should decide to give one-half of the capital cost in any event and if the actual construction charges should prove to be less than we assumed, to let the benefit pass to the consumer. We decided to proceed on the lines suggested by Senator Summerfield, to fix the price at which we desire electricity will be available and if we can make it available at that price without a charge to the Exchequer, well and good, but certainly on the basis of keeping the charge to the Exchequer at the lowest possible level.</P>
    <P>Again the House must keep in mind a clear distinction between the cost of the network and the cost of the current delivered over the network.  It is because the board has two distinct charges to meet in providing the services over the network that the system of payment imposed on consumers is a two-part tariff.  The consumer pays for his current under two headings. There is a fixed charge which is determined in relation to the floor space of his dwelling and outhouses.  Irrespective of the quantity of current he may <Col N="1588" /> consume, he has to pay that fixed charge.  That fixed charge is related to the actual capital cost of bringing the connection to his house.  The board which brings the connection to his house has to meet a capital charge thereon irrespective of the quantity of current he takes.  Consequently the consumer must pay an appropriate annual contribution to the board which is related to the capital cost of bringing him a supply irrespective of the quantity of current he consumes. Having entered into this obligation, he pays for the current he consumes on the basis of the quantity he may consume. The rural tariff of the board at present in operation imposes a charge of 2d. per unit for all current supplied up to 500 units and ¾d. per unit for current consumed in excess of 500 units.  That system which is intended to give a supply for domestic purpose on the basis of 2d. per unit and for power purposes at 3/4d. per unit, involves a minimum outlay by the board either in the supply of current or in the supervision of the system.  It is a scheme which involves the installation of only one meter per household.  It may be that some rural households will consume more current for domestic purposes and others more for power purposes but by having a uniform rate applicable to every dwelling it is intended to get into a position where a domestic consumer will pay 2d. per unit and the farmer using current for power will pay ¾d per unit.  It is assumed on the basis of that charge that the board will recover the .82d. which is the actual cost of the current to it at the 10,000 volt line output point. That was the cost to the board in 1939-40. It has been probably higher since.</P>
    <P>The fixed charge is calculated on the basis of the floor space.  If Senators will examine the statistics relating to the four trial areas it will be seen that the vast majority of consumers will be paying a fixed charge of less than £2 a year.  Senator Baxter urged that we should contract to supply rural dwellers apart from the cost of bringing the connection to them.  The Government decided against that.  It is quite obvious that if we were to undertake to create a rural network capable of supplying everybody <Col N="1589" /> the advantages of the scheme would be considerably less attractive because there are in every county some dwellings so isolated that the capital cost of connecting them would increase the average cost of connecting all dwellings. The Government decided to adopt what is called the 16 criterion ratio.  That term is explained in the report.  It means that every rural dwelling where the capital cost is not more than 16 times the amount of the fixed charge payable, will be connected. The adoption of that criterion ratio means that approximately 90 per cent. of the total number of dwellers in all rural areas can be connected under this scheme.  It is true, of course, that in making that calculation allowance must be made for the fact that some 20 per cent. of the dwellings will not be connected because the owners will decide not to accept connection. Again, if there are dwellings so isolated that they cannot be connected on that basis then some capital contribution towards the cost of connection may be required from the owners.  I want to make it clear to Senator Counihan that this rural electrification scheme is designed to avoid imposing an obligation on rural owners except in certain cases to make a capital contribution towards the cost of the connection.  For all these 90 per cent. of rural dwellers, there will be no capital contribution, and if the consumer elects to take a supply the connection will be made and he will pay only on the basis of the rural tariff&mdash; only a charge relating to his floor space and so much per unit.</P>

      <P>Many Senators appear to be under a misapprehension as to <Col N="1590" /> the method by which the Electricity Supply Board is financed.  Many references were made to the 5 per cent. rate of interest which the board pays upon advances made in the past. At the time when the bulk of the amount advanced to the board was made available, the State was paying 5 per cent. for the money that it borrowed.  It would probably be true to say that 90 per cent. of the actual amount of cash advanced to the board was advanced at a time when the State could borrow at 5 per cent. and nothing less.  Subsequent capital expenditure undertaken by the board and authorised by legislation was financed by the process of using for that purpose the balances to the credit of the board in different depreciation and reserve accounts.  It will be obvious, therefore, that the rate of interest in respect of that proportion of the capital expenditure incurred by it is only a book-keeping matter to a very large extent, because the board is itself getting 5 per cent. upon the money advanced from the depreciation and other reserve funds, and if there was a reduction in the rate of interest brought into effect, then the board would have to make a greater appropriation from its revenue for the purpose of the depreciation fund and those other reserve funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say just now. The fact is, however, that the board is not required at present to pay 5 per cent., nor will it be required to pay 5 per cent. in the future.  The rate at which the board may borrow from the Exchequer is determined in relation to the general conditions prevailing, and it is certainly not intended that the Exchequer should make any profit upon the advances made to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage, would the Minister deal with the point as to the extent to which the original 5 per cent. advances have been redeemed by the Exchequer?  Surely portion of the earlier loans has since been redeemed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1591" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, and that is a point which I think the Senator should have taken into account before he suggested that the board should be charged the average rate of interest which the State is paying upon all the loans floated from time to time, because there is that repayment obligation upon the Exchequer, and many of those loans must be repaid by the Exchequer within a shorter period than that in which the advances made by the Exchequer to the Electricity Supply Board must be repaid.  A number of circumstances must be taken into account in deciding what is a reasonable rate of interest for the Exchequer to charge the board, even if it is agreed that there is to be no profit made by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane also suggested that the board should be allowed to issue its own stock and get capital otherwise than through the Exchequer.  That suggestion may be considered.  I doubt if it would be desirable to give the board that freedom at the present time.  I doubt very much if the board will be anxious to obtain it at any time, because it may not be to their advantage to have that obligation of financing their own development placed upon them.  They may find and I am sure do find it convenient to have the existing system under which they can obtain finances from the Exchequer as they want them instead of having to issue blocks of stock from time to time and keep some proportion of the money realised on them unemployed until their various projects have reached the stage at which capital expenditure has to be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the House will excuse me if I do not enter into the discussion upon general financial topics which was initiated by Senator Duffy and carried on by Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Baxter.  There was, however, a suggestion that the Government could make electricity available at a lower rate to consumers if it adopted the views of those Senators as to the operation of the Government's finances. I am interested in this general assumption, which, to Senator Baxter and some others appears to be unquestionable, <Col N="1592" /> that it is an unmixed blessing to have a sudden or a substantial fall in interest rates.  Surely other consequences follow from a sudden or substantial fall in interest rates than the lessening of the interest charged on advances by the Government. The lowering of interest rates is good for borrowers.  It is not necessarily good for lenders. Let us have regard for a moment as to who are the lenders of money to the Government.  They are not mainly the banks, and they are certainly not this wealthy rentier class which Senator Baxter was talking about, and which for all practical purposes does not exist in this country.  The people who lend money to the Government, those whose names you will see published in the papers as the largest subscribers whenever there is a Government loan, are, first of all, insurance companies; secondly, trustees of various kinds, guardians of trust funds of one sort or another; pension funds; trade unions with various benefit funds of one kind or another; commercial firms seeking investment for their depreciation and other reserves.  These and similar classes are the people who subscribe money to Government loans, and clearly a substantial or sudden reduction in the rate of interest on Government loans is going to affect firms and persons of that class very considerably.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I want to put it to the House that a sudden fall in the rate of interest paid by the Government upon Government loans will have the immediate effect of giving an unearned increment to every existing owner of fixed interest stock.  If the Government created conditions which enabled it to issue a loan to-morrow at 1½ per cent. instead of 3 per cent., every fixed interest stock on the market would double in value.  Must we not take that into account?  That unearned accretion of market value to the owners of those stocks is something which we must take into account before we decide that the reduction of interest charges is something which we should bring about, irrespective of other considerations. Many pension funds would, in such circumstances, become insolvent.  Pension funds have become <Col N="1593" /> insolvent before, not always because of a lowering in the return upon their investments; it was sometimes due to mismanagement.  But clearly either the pension funds operated by various concerns would become insolvent or there would have to be a substantial reduction in the amounts of pensions payable from those funds.  Many life insurance companies would find themselves in difficulty, and the cost of life insurance would undoubtedly increase. The banks would protect themselves. Senator Baxter need not worry that the banks will be the sufferers from any sudden reduction in the rate of interest on Government loans.  They will make up the loss of revenue by increasing the cost of commercial credit, by increasing the bank charges, or by any of the other devices open to them.  Therefore, before Senators lightly assume that it is in everybody's interest that the rate of interest upon Government borrowing should be brought down substantially and quickly, I think they should give consideration to those inevitable consequences.</P>
    <P>I do not say that it follows therefore that the Government would be justified in maintaining the rate of interest on its loans at a higher figure than the general circumstances would appear to require.  It is probably true to say&mdash;here again I join issue with Senator Sir John Keane when he contended that the interest the Government must pay is the interest which the borrowers are prepared to accept &mdash;that the Government could so create conditions that all the money available for investment after the requirements of industry and commerce had been met would have to be loaned to the Government at whatever rate of interest the Government decided upon.  I think that is the situation which now exists in Britain.</P>

      <P>Our circumstances are somewhat different here, because Irish citizens and Irish banks have free access to the British stock market, but even if we withdrew that freedom of <Col N="1594" /> access to the British stock market and instituted here the same form of control over investment as, in fact, operates in other countries, it would not be true to say that the Government must pay the rate of interest which lenders are prepared to accept. They could pay whatever rate of interest they thought fit to pay and lenders would have no option but to take it.  On the other hand, if we permit access to the British stock market to continue, then while the power of Government control would undoubtedly disappear, it would still not be true to say that the Government would have to pay the rate of interest desired by the borrower.  The position would be that the borrower would have to take the rate prevailing on the British market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, it is the rate which lenders would have to accept.  I am, generally, putting Senator Sir John Keane right.  Some Senators appear to have the impression that because the State operates a bank, a savings bank, and pays on amounts deposited in the bank by people throughout the country a lower rate of interest than it pays on loans, that rate of interest should be the rate charged on advances from the Central Fund for general purposes.  You cannot place money withdrawable on short notice in the same class as money provided for long-term capital investment purposes.  In any event, that money is taken into the Exchequer and is being used for the purpose of the Exchequer and it is not now available for Erne development or any immediate undertaking of that character.  Perhaps I said more on this general issue of finance management than I had intended, so I will get back now to the details of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Douglas referred in his brief speech to the development in the demand for electric current in this country since the first Electricity Supply Bill was passed.  That development has been very considerable.  The number of units generated by the <Col N="1595" /> Electricity Supply Board in 1930 was 61,000,000; in 1942 it was 450,000,000, but I still think we are only in the infant stage of development, and that the demand for current can be, by various devices, expanded considerably and it is desirable to expand it considerably.</P>
    <P>It is true that the very big development in that demand in the years immediately preceding the war was due largely to the fact that industrial development was proceeding apace at that time.  There are some industries, notably the cement factories, which consume very large amounts of electricity, and, in fact, it would be true to say that the cement industry alone would take the total output of the Liffey scheme.  The fact is that in the earlier stages of development people here did not anticipate how the demand would grow, and that was reproduced in other countries also.  In many other countries, the demand for electricity far outran the plans of those who had responsibility for providing it.</P>
    <P>I remember being informed by certain representatives of the New Zealand Government who were here a short time ago, that their experience was similar to our own.  In fact, when they undertook the equivalent of our Shannon scheme, they were so apprehensive that the demand for current would be very much less than its output that they endeavoured to step up the demand by undertaking to provide every rural household with hot water on tap by means of electricity at a fixed charge of 5/- per month.  Long before the scheme was completed, they had a demand for the current at a commercial price which they could not supply, and they had reached the stage of regretting the fact that they had entered into this commitment to give at a subsidised price a supply of current which they could have sold at a fully economic price, as they desired, for industrial development and similar purposes.</P>
    <P>In every other country, the experience has been somewhat similar. The growth in the demand for electricity and the growth in the usage of electricity, has surprised even those <Col N="1596" /> who are directly concerned with the planning of electrical development.  In this country, I think we can look forward after the war to a very substantial stepping up in the demand, and I know it will be many years before the Electricity Supply Board will be able to construct and get into production the number of generating stations that will enable them to overtake the demand and to reach the stage when they will have a surplus of current for sale and have to undertake the ordinary type of commercial propaganda to dispose of it.  It may be of interest to mention that in the first year of the Electricity Supply Board's operations, 1930, the average price secured by the board for current was 2.66d. per unit. That price had fallen by 1942 to 1.47d. per unit.  Later it came to 1.68d. per unit and those who are complaining about the increase in the cost of current in recent times will be interested to know that it is still substantially below the cost in the first year of the Electricity Supply Board's activities.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy objected to the provisions in this Bill relating to the manufacture of apparatus.  He indicated a preference for the manufacture of apparatus by the board rather than by private concerns.  I disagree with that point of view entirely.  So far as consumers' equipment is concerned, we require not merely production by private enterprise but by competitive enterprise, and I would attach considerable importance to the desirability of promoting competitive enterprise in that regard.</P>
    <P>Electrical apparatus is still in the process of development.  Every day improvements are being thought of by inventors, and unless we have the element of competition, there will be a tendency to slow down upon the introduction of those improvements or the scrapping of existing plant in order to permit of a new type of apparatus being manufactured, and I think it is desirable that we should keep abreast of progress in other countries, particularly in that matter of domestic apparatus and equipment designed to <Col N="1597" /> facilitate farm work.  There will, of course, be a substantial quantity of equipment required by the board, and for equipment of that kind the board will be the only consumer in the country, or certainly the main consumer.  In respect of apparatus of that kind, I feel myself that the board should be associated with its manufacture, but very probably those who will be undertaking its manufacture will desire to have the board associated with them so that they will feel assured that when they commence production they will have interested in their future welfare the only customer for their products in the country.  I do not think that it is necessary to go to the trouble of setting up a committee of experts to design suitable farm appliances.  I feel sure that appliances which are devised by private firms for use in other countries will be suitable here or can be adapted to our circumstances so as to make them suitable, and, in any event, we can leave it to private firms to design appliances which will be attractive to the people to whom they want to sell them.  It is necessary to keep in mind that it will be a number of years before the rural network is completed. That network will spread out from the existing 10,000-volt system, and it is only in area after area that any special propaganda work will be required, or any instruction given to the public in the use to which electricity can be put, or any advice as to the type of appliances best suitable to obtain.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter asked a question concerning the effect of the Erne scheme upon the drainage of the Erne. The experts who have advised me in the matter state that the effect of the construction works on the Erne will be considerably to lessen the drainage problem in that area.  However, there is a drainage problem which is mainly outside our jurisdiction, and, for the information of the House, I might mention the total area to be flooded for the construction works will be only 750 acres, which is very much smaller than the area flooded in connection with either the Shannon scheme or the Liffey scheme.</P>

      <P>In County Donegal. Another Senator asked about the use of tidal waters.  The possibility of the use of tidal waters has been considered by the board.  I do not think that there is any technical problem in connection with it.  What the board reported to me was that of all the various methods of generating electricity, the use of tidal power was the most expensive, and consequently did not interest them in present circumstances. Senator Johnston said that this Bill was not part of a comprehensive plan for agriculture.  That is quite true, and it is not presented as such. Whatever comprehensive plan for agriculture we may devise for the post-war period must, I think, have a special regard to post-war circumstances, and it cannot be seriously affected by a scheme for the gradual development of electricity supply over the whole rural area, which will take at least ten years, and possibly longer to complete. Senator O Buachalla made reference to the use of Irish in the Electricity Supply Board services.  I will bring his observations to the attention of the board.  The Senator also asked what preparations are being made to provide trained personnel for this scheme.  The board has, I understand, begun its preparations for the carrying out of the rural electrification scheme.  It is blue-printing the course of the various networks and has engaged additional staffs, to the extent that it considers necessary.  However, the bulk of the personnel required for the construction of the network will be semi-skilled, and it is not necessary to undertake an elaborate apprenticeship arrangement.  The construction of the network will not require any highly-skilled personnel, and I think it will be possible to get in every district a number of workers without any particular experience in construction activities of this kind, and to give them training which will enable them to be utilised in the construction of the network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that a rural dweller getting connection with the supply will have to undertake some outlay in connection <Col N="1599" /> with the wiring of his house and the installation of the appliances for the use of the electricity.  The board does installation work and does it in competition with a number of private firms.  While the board would, I am sure, be prepared to operate some easy payment system, it is a matter for consideration whether it is advisable that they should do so unless the private firms which do the installation in competition with the board are also able to give the same facilities.  I think it is quite possible that a number of private electrical firms will be prepared to wire houses and supply appliances upon an easy payment system, and I should be surprised if there are not numbers of firms with the enterprise and resources to enable them to do so.  I think we can contemplate a rural dweller getting his house wired, and the appliances installed, without having to undertake any capital expenditure whatever, merely paying for the current as it is used and for the appliances over the course of time.  There is, of course, nothing in this Bill which limits, any further than it is limited by existing legislation the power of individuals to undertake the production of electricity for their own use.  One must not assume that there are outlying villages and hamlets which will not be supplied under this scheme.  It is true that the scheme will have to develop gradually from the existing network, and the areas most remote from the existing network will inevitably be the last to be supplied, because the new network must extend gradually from the existing network, but the intention is that all villages and hamlets will be covered in the course of time. There is a number of rivers which can be developed.  The Report of the Electricity Supply Board indicates that a number of these rivers are being investigated by the board, with a view to the preparation of plans in connection with them.  May I say to Senator P.J. O'Reilly that I know of no plan already lodged for the development of the River Boyne involving the flooding of ancient historic areas, or of any plan at all?</P>

      <P>The board stated that it &ldquo;continued its investigations into water power resources....  The development of the lower reaches of the River Boyne, for which preliminary plans and investigations were completed, did not appear to justify further consideration at the present stage.&rdquo; They said also &ldquo;plans for a small hydro-electric development of the Lower Liffey at Leixlip were completed. Surveys and preliminary plans for the Torc Waterfall, County Kerry, and the River Lee, County Cork, were in course of preparation at the end of the year....  Further rivers included the Avonmore (County Wicklow), the Clady and Gweedore (County Donegal), the Nore (County Kilkenny), the Slaney (County Carlow), and the Ballisodare (County Sligo).&rdquo;  That is the only information I can give the Senator on that matter and it seems that the plans for the development of the Boyne have by no means reached the advanced stage which he assumes. I agree with Senator Mrs. Concannon, that the use of electricity in rural areas is going very largely to depend on the attitude towards it of the womenfolk. Although electricity will lessen the burden of farm work upon the males it will be a very special boon to women. I hope to see the day that when a girl gets a proposal from a farmer she will inquire not so much about the number of cows, but rather concerning the electrical appliances that she will require before she gives her consent, including not merely electric light but a water heater, an electric clothes boiler, a vacuum cleaner and even a refrigerator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless it will make the proposition far more attractive to a young lady.  Senator O'Reilly asked me to say what I meant by a stand-by plant.  In the calculation which I gave as to the output of electricity from the Erne, or any information which may be given from time to time in regard to the output of the Shannon or the Liffey, an <Col N="1601" /> average flow year is assumed.  The actual flow varies from year to year, but these calculations are based upon the average experience.  There are many years obviously where the flow is much below the average, and to keep up the supply there must be a stand-by steam plant.  In a good year that plant would not be used at all, and in a very dry year it might be used very extensively. The aim is to have a sufficient provision of stand-by plant to ensure that in any year in which the flow was less than the average, the supply of current can, nevertheless, be kept up to meet the full demand for it.  One must not think that a stand-by plant of that kind is equivalent to a reserve plant to provide against the possibility of a break-down of machinery.  In a stand-by station, such as the Pigeon House station, there will be reserve turbines in case any may go out of action but the whole station is a stand-by to the water-power station. Clonsast will be a base load station, not a stand-by station, and will, therefore, work continuously to its maximum output.</P>
      <P>I do not think that there is any ground for apprehension that the Minister for Agriculture will use the powers given to him in this Bill deliberately to obstruct the completion of our hydro-electric plans.  The intention is, as expressed in a decision of the Government, that where an unavoidable clash occurs between fishery interests and the development of water power for electricity development, power purposes must get priority.  The particular form of words used in the Bill is designed to ensure that, subject to the priority of power development, maximum efforts will be made to protect fishery interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Dea has been misled in his calculations as to the cost of the network.  The estimated cost is £17,000,000, based on pre-war prices. That is for a 10,000-volt network.  The existing network includes not only 10,000-volt lines but higher-tension lines, with which the 10,000-volt lines are connected, and also a number of underground mains in urban areas <Col N="1602" /> which are, of course, much more costly to construct.  The actual cost of the network will be substantially higher than £17,000,000.  That figure is based upon pre-war prices.  I do not think it is likely that post-war prices will be, as Senator Duffy assumed, 75 per cent. higher than pre-war prices.  They may be 50 per cent. higher and will be, almost certainly, 33? per cent. higher.</P>

      <P>That represents a network system of a very different character.  The construction of a 10,000 volt line, which can be done with wooden poles and comparatively light wire, is a different proposition from the construction of a 40,000 volt line, which involves the use of steel pylons or the construction of underground networks, which necessitates the making of tunnels.  The board has estimated the cost at £17,000,000, and that figure includes the cost of the network and transformers.  I think I have dealt with all the principal points. Some points of detail were raised which will, no doubt, be raised again in Committee.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Reilly appeared to anticipate the possibility of a scarcity of turf and questioned the wisdom of using turf for production of electricity since it might be required in some future emergency.  I can assure the Senator that the turf reserves of the country will last us through many an emergency.  The fuelling of Clonsast station can be done from the existing mechanised bog of the Turf Development Board at Portarlington.  The question of further turf-burning stations is a question of selection&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The cost of turf at Clonsast could not be definitely estimated now because the machines required for winning the turf are not yet available and it is difficult to say at what price it will be possible to procure or construct them.  There is no reason to assume that the project will be in any sense uneconomic or that, on the basis of turf being half the calorific value of coal, it will not be possible to deliver into the boilers of the stations at Clonsast turf from the Clonsast bog at, at least, half the price per ton at which coal can be delivered from Great Britain into the boilers of the station at the Pigeon House.  These calculations are made on the basis of the costs at the Pigeon House, which has the most favourably situated position in the country so far as the use of coal is concerned.  The cost of coal to the Pigeon House is less than it is in the case of any other industrial concern.  If one were to calculate on the basis of costs to a power house on any site other than that of the Pigeon House, the cost of coal would be very much higher.</P>

      <P>We shall never get coal at the pre-war cost and I do not suppose we shall ever produce turf at pre-war prices but, so long as we can get turf at half the cost of coal at the Pigeon House, the use of turf is cheaper than the use of coal.  There are, of course, turf production problems to be solved.  I tried to emphasise in my opening statement that the use of turf for power purposes is not a technical problem for the Electricity Supply Board but a problem for the turf board&mdash;a problem of ensuring regularity of quality and regularity of delivery to the power <Col N="1604" /> stations.  The turf board is tackling that problem and, subject to their solving it, there will be no difficulty for the Electricity Supply Board in generating electricity from turf.</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Dublin) Bill, 1945&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to increase the representation of the citizens of Dublin on the city council.  It proposes, in the second place, to empower the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to make a new division of the city into electoral areas, and, consequential on this, to assign to each such electoral area the number of members to be elected for it.  Thirdly, it proposes to empower the Minister to defer the election for the Dublin County Council to such date, not being later than 1st day of July, 1946, as he may think necessary, and to further empower him&mdash;this time with the consent of the Oireachtas&mdash;to defer the new election for a further two years. Fourthly, it proposes to postpone until 1948 the new election for members of the several boards administering public assistance in Dublin City and County.</P>
      <P>The Bill also proposes to give the Lord Mayor of Dublin a wider range of choice should it become necessary for him during his term of office to appoint a deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill proposes to increase the membership of the Dublin City Council from 35 to 45.  No doubt, most members of the House are aware of the fact that the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930, fixed the size of the city council at 35 members, of whom 30 were to be elected by persons for the time being registered on the Register of Local Government Electors for the city, and five by persons on the Register of Commercial Electors.  By the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1935, <Col N="1605" /> the provision for commercial electors was abolished and the ordinary local government electors were given the right to elect the whole of the 35 members.</P>
    <P>When the Act of 1930 was passed, however, the total local government electorate was only 144,000 odd, giving an average of just over 4,800 local government electors per councillor elected by them.  But in 1935, the local government electorate for Dublin City was considerably increased and has since continued to increase still further until this year it has reached the figure of 297,051, or more than double what it was in 1930.  On the other hand, there has been no corresponding increase in the total membership of the city council so that to-day it remains at the original figure of 35, giving a membership of one councillor to over 8,300 electors.</P>
    <P>I think the ratio is too large, particularly in view of the fact that the city council has to nominate members to a very large number of committees and its numbers should therefore be such that these nominations can be made without unduly burdening individual members.  The council not only appoints eight council committees, but there is a number of joint bodies such as the Vocational Education Committee, the Joint Committee of Management of Grangegorman Mental Hospital, the Dublin Fever Hospital, to which the council are required to appoint members.  The council also nominates representatives to numerous hospital boards, to five school attendance committees, the Irish Tourist Association, and other bodies.  I submit to the House that the proposed increase in the number of members is justifiable on the ground I have mentioned, and particularly in view of the duties which council members are called upon to fulfil.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill is, as I have said, consequential on Section 2. Naturally if the membership of the city council is to be increased, some provision must be made for the re-allocation of the representation to the various electoral areas.  Under the Act of 1930, to which I have already referred, five electoral areas were constituted; but that Act did not give a <Col N="1606" /> continuing power to make new allocations from time to time as population changed.  Therefore new powers, such as Section 3 is drafted to confer, are necessary if the re-allocation is to be made.  Apart, however, from the proposed increase in the membership of the city council, there is another reason why powers to make a re-allocation are necessary.</P>
    <P>Marked discrepancies exist in the representation allocated to the several borough electoral areas.  Thus, in No. 1 Area, 43,867 electors return seven members; in No. 2 Area, 66,683 electors return seven members; in No. 3 Area, 63,527 electors return eight members; in No. 4 Area, 50,863 electors return six members; in No. 5 Area, 72,111 electors return seven members.</P>
    <P>So that the number of electors per member varies from 6,267 in No. 1 Area to 10,301 in No. 5 Area; with corresponding figures of 9,526; 7,940; and 8,477 for Nos. 2, 3 and 4 respectively.</P>
    <P>The corporation quite properly have drawn my attention to these anomalies, and I propose, if the Oireachtas gives me the powers asked for in Section 3, to remove them so far as is reasonably possible.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of this measure was not originally in the Bill, but was inserted on the Committee Stage of the Bill in the Dáil in deference to representations, made from all quarters of the House, that the present limited choice which the Lord Mayor of Dublin has in regard to the appointment of a deputy lord mayor has been found in some instances to occasion great inconvenience.</P>
    <P>Section 5 will give the Minister power to defer the holding of the new election for the Dublin County Council until the 30th June, 1946; that is, one year later than it might otherwise be held.  The section further proposes to empower the Minister in certain circumstances, which are set out in subsection (3), and with the acquiescence of the Oireachtas, as provided for in sub-section (7), to extend by Order the period within which the election may be held.</P>
    <P>The reasons why it has become necessary to envisage the deferment of the <Col N="1607" /> election for the Dublin County Council is the simple fact that the overhaul and reorganisation of the county services now proceeding are not likely to be quite completed by the end of June of this year.  Furthermore, many important proposals for the constructive development of certain of those services which are under immediate consideration will have reached a critical stage about that period.</P>
    <P>These proposals, which envisage the construction of over 1,350 houses, the execution of water supply and sewerage schemes to the value of £358,818, and the construction and improvement of roads at an ultimate cost of over £5,000,000, are all urgently necessary for the proper development of the county.  The actual execution of these works, except to a minor degree, will not be possible until the end of hostilities in Europe renders the procural of the necessary plant and materials more feasible than it is now.  But it is imperative that the planning of them should be undertaken now, and pushed as rapidly as possible to completion, so that everything will be ready to enable the actual works to be put in hands as soon as the opportunity offers.</P>
    <P>The preparation of all these plans, under the direction of the commissioner for the county, is, in fact, in progress and is well advanced.  Indeed, as I have already indicated, most of the actual planning of the proposed works has reached a critical stage in its development.  I would, therefore, deprecate very strongly any possibility of a change which in any way might impede or delay the completion of these plans, as a change in the direction of the council's affairs at this stage might do.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill proposes to defer until 1948 the new election for the Dublin Board of Assistance.  What I have said in regard to the undesirability of making any change in the present administration of the Dublin County Council affairs applies with equal force to the administration of the Dublin Board of Assistance.</P>
    <P>When I found it necessary, in April, 1942, to replace the then members of <Col N="1608" /> the board by commissioners, I indicated to the chairman of the commissioners that I desired him and his colleagues to undertake a radical reconstruction of the entire services for which the former board had been responsible.</P>
    <P>A report dated 9th February, 1944, which I received from the commissioners, and which I caused to be circulated to all Deputies of the city and county, last March, indicates the almost chaotic conditions which the commissioners, when they took over, found to exist in the administration of the affairs of the board.  I do not propose to recount to the House this report in detail.  It recommends radical reforms in St. Kevin's Institution and a complete reorganisation of the whole administration of the board's services.  When the commissioners investigated the organisation of the institution, they found that it represented practically unchanged the inheritance which the board had received from the bad old workhouse days.  Since then the commissioners have been trying to segregate the hospital, St. Kevin's, from the home, and to dispel the spirit of pauperism which pervaded the whole place.  They have recommended that, in due course, the premises now housing the infirm and chronic inmates should be evacuated, and that all those buildings which are intended for the care and accommodation of the aged infirm, should be removed to a much more suitable site on the outskirts of the city.  As one step in clearing away the relics of the poorhouse service, which have been clinging to the hospital, the commissioners have abolished the employment of inmate labour therein.  Paid orderlies and ward attendants have now taken their place and a considerable increase in the nursing staff has been effected, while the hospital itself is being fully equipped as a surgical hospital.</P>
    <P>Besides the problem of the institution proper, the commissioners have also had under consideration the reorganisation of the whole dispensary system, and in this connection a survey of the dispensary premises and dispensary medical services has just begun.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1609" /> The importance of co-ordinating the public health services and the medical services in the metropolitan area need not, I am sure, be stressed; the work to be undertaken by the commissioners in this respect is of the greatest urgency and is an essential preliminary step to far-reaching developments in that regard which we have in contemplation.</P>
    <P>In connection with all this I should point out that the estimate of the commissioners for the coming year will be just under £4,000 less than the figure which the old board of assistance estimated would be required for the year ending the 31st March, 1943. That fact is very significant when considered in relation to the improvements which have already been made in the management of the institution, the improvement in the general conditions of the inmates, the improvements in the buildings, and the expansion in the services which the commissioners have undertaken since they were appointed. It shows that not merely may we hope to provide a proper service for the poor but that, if we carry through the reorganisation which we are contemplating, that these improvements are not going to impose an undue burden upon the general body of ratepayers.</P>
    <P>The commissioners have been administering the affairs of the board only since April, 1942.  They have already carried out many far-reaching reforms, but the great, and, I think, the more onerous job still lies in front of them. They have, as I have indicated, to prepare schemes for the evacuation of the aged poor and infirm from the existing institution.  They have to modernise the hospital there.  They have got to overhaul and reorganise the dispensary and medical services and they have got to complete their overhaul of the administration of public assistance.</P>
    <P>It would be, in my view, disastrous if at this stage we were to take the commissioners off the task on which they have been engaged up to the present, in order to replace them, perhaps, by a body such as that which we had to dissolve less than three years ago.  Accordingly, I am asking the Oireachtas, in this connection, to <Col N="1610" /> give me powers to defer the new election of members of the board of assistance until the year 1948.  I do that, not only for the reasons I have indicated, but also because I am satisfied that we cannot get ahead and coordinate the local government of the city and county until we have found a solution for the problem of devising a sound scheme for administering public assistance and the various other services for which the Dublin Board of Assistance were responsible.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 of the Bill relate to the position of the Balrothery Board of Assistance and the Rathdown Board of Assistance.  It is proposed to defer the elections for these boards until 1948 also.  As the House is aware, the functional areas of the Dublin, Balrothery and Rathdown Boards adjoin each other.  They are all within the geographical county; and the county, as a matter of fact, is a contributor to the Dublin Board of Assistance which administers public assistance in areas which, for other purposes, are under the jurisdiction of the county council.  We cannot institute a new scheme of local government for the city and county, based, of course, upon popular election, until we have carried forward our plans for administering all these interlinking areas, authorities and services, much further than they are at present.  That is why I am asking the Oireachtas to give me power to defer the elections for the Dublin Board of Assistance, the Balrothery Board of Assistance and the Rathdown Board of Assistance until 1948.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave us an explanation of all the sections of this Bill, but, although it could be put rather briefly, he gave us no indication at all of what the policy is with regard to this particular kind of thing.  The Bill, in effect, postpones elections in County Dublin and in certain subsidiary <Col N="1611" /> bodies of the Dublin County Council because those bodies are now being administered by a commissioner, and because the Minister is quite clearly of opinion that the administration of the commissioner is superior to the administration that we might get through a manager with the assistance of any kind of county council that would be elected.  That is one part of the Bill.  The other part of the Bill, the first part, provides for an increase in the members of the Dublin City Council, and provides for a rearrangement of the electoral areas in the City of Dublin.  The case for increasing the membership is clear.  It has been made to the Minister, I think, by the Dublin City Council already.  I think it is fair to say that the case for a rearrangement of the electoral areas goes with the case for more members, the increasing population.  But the Minister did not tell us what he expects the new city council to be.  At the same time, we are not without enlightenment on that particular subject, because a colleague of the Minister told us a few nights ago, in very robust language indeed, what he envisages.  He envisages an entirely political council, and he argues that no other council can be any use but a political council which is in complete agreement with him.  I suggest to the Minister that, if that is the Government policy, then it is very unfair that a politician should have complete control of the arrangement of the electoral areas in Dublin City, because if he is so in control he will surely use his power for the benefit of the Party&mdash;the Party which, according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is the only Party whose members can ever rise above Party considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that one obvious amendment to this Bill would be to put the rearrangement of the electoral areas into the hands of an impartial committee, presided over by some impartial person, which would come to an arrangement that could be accepted by all concerned as satisfactory. We have some evidence already of the way in which the Dáil constituencies have been rearranged with <Col N="1612" /> an eye to the political prospects of a political Party, and there are some grounds for the fear that the Dublin City area might be manipulated also in the interests of a political Party. I wonder has any consideration been given, when increasing the membership of the council, to a proposal to increase the term of office of the council from three years to five years?  On the whole, I think it would be an improvement, but I do not want to go into that now.  What I do want to say is that the two parts of the Bill seem to be inspired by entirely contrary policies.  One part of the Bill envisages a city council, which the Minister for Industry and Commerce hopes will be radically changed in its political views, and the other part of the Bill envisages no council for County Dublin until certain schemes have been brought to fruition.</P>
    <P>It is only right that one should ask whether it is a definite policy on the part of the Government that local bodies combined with the managerial system should be elected on an entirely political basis, because it has always seemed to me that the managerial system in itself, if one were to argue for it and to acknowledge its merits, most certainly implies that the councils, who have certain powers <i>vis-a-vis</i> the manager, should not be elected on a political Party basis. There are only two methods of electing local bodies once you have a manager. One is the totalitarian method, where you have only one Party in the State ever allowed to raise its head.  That Party appoints the manager from the Party membership, and the local body is also appointed from the Party membership.</P>
    <P>The other scheme is the one which the Government has actually adopted. In the appointment of a manager, such as the Dublin City Manager who will have a council to assist him in this Bill, the view has been taken that the manager is a non-Party person, that he should be appointed by a non-Party machine, that he should act as a non-Party person, and that he should serve the council that is elected, and serve a central administration, whatever its particular political complexion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1613" /> It is fair to say that managers have been appointed on a non-Party basis, and if they have, it would seem to me to be very foolish to endeavour to secure that the councils with whom the managers are to co-operate should be themselves entirely political.  The extraordinary thing about this whole business&mdash;I had occasion to refer to it before&mdash;is the way in which the members of the Government Party are able to assume to themselves such extraordinary virtues, such almost superhuman attributes, while they deny to their opponents even the virtue of having a national outlook&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Mind you, Sir, if they have, it is even a greater miracle than one could hope for.  They must have acquired them since the time I knew them long ago.  When the British were here, Party politics in local bodies was completely understandable. It was very simple.  There were the people who wanted to change the British régime, and the people who wanted to keep it there.  It had the merit for a great many years of being very simple, indeed.  You had an Administration in Dublin, a foreign Administration, not one responsible to the people.  Now that that has been changed, it seems to me, and has always seemed to me, that the corollary is that local bodies should be allowed to do their business in a nonpolitical way.  The managerial system existed in Dublin and Cork before the present Administration came into office, and the present Minister has extended the managerial system to the whole country.  It would appear to me that the natural result of that managerial system would be that politics, in the Party sense, would be kept out of local bodies, that they should do their job along with the manager without being partisans.  I have no understanding how any other conclusion can be reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, local bodies have been shorn of their powers to a great extent, and one of the results of that is that a great deal will depend, more <Col N="1614" /> than ever before, on the type of person elected to local bodies.  They will have their influence on the manager rather more by personalities and the type of people they are, for the powers they exercise have been very much reduced. What we have put forward as Government policy, and it is very important to this Bill, because it concerns the City of Dublin, is that Fianna Fáil cannot take the chance&mdash;I am quoting the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;&ldquo;that candidates nominated by other Parties will always be capable of rising above Party or sectional considerations to the extent of giving enthusiastic support to schemes for which Fianna Fáil may get credit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think I said some time ago that members of the Party in this House were Pharisees to the last degree. Surely that is quite indisputable.  The Pharisee says: &ldquo;Look at me, I can rise above Party consideration&mdash;no one else can&rdquo;.  We have here in this House in the Fianna Fáil Party, if I am allowed to say that of the members who normally support the Government, the pick of the Fianna Fáil Party.  We have the result of a combination of the Party in the Dáil, and in the country in local bodies, so that we should have in this House those who represent the very cream of the Party from the point of view of intellect and from the point of view of putting national considerations above Party.  But I am sorry to say, and I think nobody would disagree with me, that even in the case of the cream in this House, they do not always take a non-Party view.</P>

      <P>They more frequently in a majority take an unholy Party <Col N="1615" /> view.  I know that there are occasions, such as yesterday, when they did not all follow the Party line.  Even as a matter of fact, Sir, the Fianna Fáil members of the local bodies do not come up to the standard of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He wants the kind of member who will never let him down, who will always say that whatever comes from the central Government is right and must be done.  Quite clearly, that is a bad system, and, quite clearly, it is going to bring local government into greater disrepute.  Every argument in every individual instance for the abolition of a local authority is the same as the argument for the abolition of the Dublin County Council which arises under this particular Bill.  When you take all the cases together, and if you make all the political bodies completely political, so that they will not have any function but to shout &ldquo;Hurroo&rdquo; when a measure comes down to them, you will reduce local government to a farce.  When you have done that, there will not be an argument left in favour of the Dáil and none at all for a Seanad.</P>
      <P>I want to call attention to the effect of this Bill on the electoral areas of Dublin, seeing that Dublin is to be made a political battleground.  Elections for the municipal council will be a political battleground if electoral areas are selected by one Party.  The Dublin Corporation should be allowed to remain in office for more than three years.  I do not understand this provision at all, but I do not intend to fight it, or obstruct the passage of the Bill, but by what process of reasoning are we asked to accept that if a county council were elected, it would in some way impair the great schemes which the commissioner has brought to a certain point?  I have not made any study, and I am accepting the Minister's view that the schemes are good in themselves, but I do not accept the view that you can work a democratic parliament or democracy in the country if you are going to replace your local bodies in the country with commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you think that a system of efficient commissioners is better than local <Col N="1616" /> bodies and that an efficient commissioner unadvised by a local body is better than one hampered by a local body&mdash;that is the Minister's view&mdash;I think it is a deplorable view for the future of local government and central Government.  If we insist that people must put on a Party label before they take an interest in local government, we shall fail to get the proper people interested in local affairs.  Therefore, some of the provisions in this Bill, and the policy of local Government, as stated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and as carefully not stated by the Minister for Local Government, are going to have extremely bad consequences. In the meantime, in accordance with the policy which I have frequently advocated, the Bill ought to get a Second Reading, but there are certain matters which will call for further consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to justify the provision in this Bill which seeks to postpone for a period of, say, three years, the election to Dublin County Council.  Dublin County Council was abolished some four or five years ago for reasons which are understandable, but I am not at all sure that the arrangement which was made for the discharge of its functions is satisfactory. Some people are happy in the possession of good publicity agents. Their smallest achievements can be glorified in the Press and their shortcomings are ignored.  There are many shortcomings in the present administration of County Dublin.  One of the things which strike me in relation to Dublin County Council is this: that with all their weaknesses and all their vices, and having regard to the fact that they were suppressed because of their incompetence to carry on administration, yet seven members of the council are called into the election of members of this House.  It is a most extraordinary thing that a body of men who are not regarded as being capable of conducting their local affairs now, under the authority or guidance of the county manager, are sufficiently qualified to become electors in the body that elects members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the situation in Dublin City it is clear that a case can be made <Col N="1617" /> for increasing the council but I am not quite sure if that case has been made. I wonder for what purpose is it necessary to increase the membership of the council.  It was pointed out that there are a number of subsidiary bodies, committees and the like and that you require a larger number upon which to draw.  If you are going to get away from the principle of a small council, then you are getting back to the old situation where the council was worthless, because it was unwieldy.  At one period there were 80 members or there abouts on the Corporation of Dublin. That number was subsequently reduced to 35 and now the proposal is to increase it to 45.  I am not opposing the view that 45 should be the minimum, but nevertheless it is a very large body, and if there is a full attendance at the same time it is not a body that will do the best work.  I think a smaller council would be much more efficient than a large one.  The difficulty I see, however, is in regard to the description of the new electoral areas.  It is true that the Order which will be made by the Minister describing these areas will be tabled in both Houses of the Oireachtas, and may be annulled by either House, but it might have been a better arrangement if the Minister were to provide that the Order would not have effect until approved by both Houses.</P>
    <P>One knows what happens when these Orders are tabled.  They are placed in the Library and when you get your Order Paper you find a reference to the fact that this Order has been tabled. That places on somebody the duty of taking the initiative to have it annulled, but if nobody puts down a motion for the purpose of annulling the Order, then it becomes operative, without any more ado, after 21 Parliamentary days.  It seems to me that from the Minister's own point of view, it would be more satisfactory if he were to put down a motion confirming the Order.  That at least would ensure that the Order was brought to the attention of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is another aspect of this matter which is of some importance. A private member putting down a motion has no assurance that <Col N="1618" /> his motion will be taken and debated within the 21 days.  Although, in practice, that usually happens, I remember one or two instances in which a motion on the Order Paper was not reached within the 21 days, and therefore the provision enabling the House to take action was inoperative.</P>
    <P>Another point arises out of this rearrangement of the electoral areas and the enlargement of the council.  I do not think the Minister has adverted to the question of the number of aldermen who will be elected if the membership is increased, and if the number of areas is increased.  I take it that those increases will be followed by an increase in the number of aldermen. I am not quite sure how that is provided for.  It may be provided for by another method.  I merely draw attention to the fact so that it may be cleared up.  The last point I want to refer to is the provision in sub-section (5) of Section 3, because that seems to me to be more or less getting back to the position in which we had a commercial register in Dublin, which was abolished by the present Government in 1935.  The sub-section reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In assigning by an Order under this section the numbers of members to be elected for the electoral areas specified in the Order, the Minister shall have regard to the populations and rateable valuations of such areas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apparently the Minister does not like this principle of counting hands or counting noses.  In fact, he imposes upon himself the obligation to have regard to the kind of house in which a voter lives.  I think it is a reasonable assumption that what is provided by this sub-section is that 1,000 people living in Rathmines or Pembroke will be entitled to larger representation <i>pro rata</i> than 1,000 people living in Townsend Street.  There is not much other point in imposing on the Minister the obligation to have regard to the rateable valuations in the areas when determining the number of members to be elected to the city council.  I urge on the Minister that that is a reactionary proposal and that he <Col N="1619" /> ought to get back to where the Government stood in 1935, when they abolished the commercial register.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be that I am not now in touch with matters and that they would get a majority from those areas.  If so, then the case made by Senator Hayes would be correct.  I do not think that the Minister would like to go down to history as having departed completely from the policy which was inaugurated by his predecessor, who abolished the commercial register and extended the local franchise to every man and woman over 21 years of age.  I approved then, and still approve, of that attitude.  I urge on the Minister that he ought not to take this step, that he ought to get back to his former position in regard to election to the Oireachtas and to local authorities&mdash;that is, adhere to adult suffrage, giving every individual an equal right in regard to elections and forgetting the great qualifications that attach to a high valuation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Seán O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not as one of the cream of the Fianna Fáil Party, to whom Senator Hayes referred, that I rise to speak on this Bill. The Minister referred, in his opening statement, to the differences in population that exist in respect of the five electoral areas.  I have a booklet here showing the figures.  Those figures are extraordinary and require the correction of which the introduction of this Bill is indicative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter to which I wish to draw attention has no reference to politics. It is connected with the curious overlapping and interlapping of the Parliamentary constituencies and the municipal electoral areas.  Crumlin, for instance, is within the city for the <Col N="1620" /> municipal election and without the city for the Parliamentary election.  The people there do not know whether they are in the city or county.  That may interest representatives of the county electoral area in the Dáil.  This overlapping of the municipal and county areas is causing great confusion.  It is not confined to one area.  In the area in which I reside, the Mountjoy Ward is in our No. 2 electoral area for municipal purposes and it is in North-West Dublin for the Dáil Election.  Howth, now part of the city, comes into the No. 2 electoral area for municipal purposes but it is in the county for the purpose of the Dáil Election.  I think that that arrangement should be revised. I believe that the statutory period in which the Dáil constituencies must be revised will soon expire.  If there is to be an alteration of the municipal electoral areas, they should be made to coincide, so far as possible, with the Parliamentary constituencies and obviate this overlapping of areas in the city as well as the division of areas between county and city.  That is forced upon one's attention in districts like Crumlin, Rathfarnham and Howth.  I think that if a district is within the city for the purpose of the municipal election, it should be within the city for the purpose of the election to the Dáil.  The same thing should apply in the case of the county and not have this overlapping and interlapping.</P>
    <P>As regards this Bill, if it simply means a more uniform allocation of the representation of the electorate to the different areas, I think that is quite desirable.  The Bill refers to five or more areas.  There are five at present. The Minister has not indicated whether it is his intention or not to increase that number or to increase the representation of the areas as he will define them.  It would be better if we knew what the areas would be.  Then we would be in a position to discuss the matter.  At present, we can only discuss the Bill and hand it over to the Minister to tell us what the areas will be later.  Senator Duffy was not correct in referring to 21 sitting days in connection with annulment of an Order made under this Bill.  The period is seven sitting days.  If there <Col N="1621" /> were an Adjournment of the Dáil or Seanad, it would be easy for the period to elapse and even seven sitting days might prove somewhat awkward.  However, the principal point I want to emphasise is this overlapping and interlapping of electoral areas and of municipal and county districts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to enter into the Party discussion which has arisen on this Bill, but there are a few points to which I would like to refer.  Senator Duffy spoke of the annulling of the Order under the Bill within 21 days.  Senator O'Donovan spoke of the annulling period as seven days.  Both happen to be right.  The Bill provides that the Order made under Section 3 may be annulled by resolution passed by either House within the next seven days within which that House has sat after the Order has been laid before it.  Section 9 provides that an Order made under that section&mdash;an Order adapting existing enactments to give effect to the Orders made under the Act&mdash;may be annulled within 21 such days.  It is difficult to understand why the Order made under Section 3 should be annulable within seven sitting days, since 21 days are allowed for the annulment of the Order under Section 9.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that the Order under Section 9 was just as important as the Order under Section 3, because it may be that an Order may have to be made under Section 9 as well as under Section 3.  However, in making these few remarks I only wanted to make possible the annulment of both Orders, within the same time limit. Under the Bill, the membership of the city council is increased from 35 to 45. Personally, I cannot see any advantage in being a member of the city council, since the functions of the council were so limited under the Local Government Act of 1930.  That Act limits the powers of the city councillors to certain functions, described as reserved functions, and I cannot understand why people should be so anxious to become members of such a council in order to discharge a limited number of functions.  Possibly, the main function of the council is the election of the Lord Mayor, and that might be a sufficient attraction to induce people to wish to become members of the city council.  It seems to me, however, that it does not matter whether the number of councillors is 35 or 45, so far as the city council is concerned, since their functions are so limited.  I think it was Senator Hayes who spoke of a non-political city manager and a political city council.  I understood that the city manager was appointed on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commissioners and that, therefore, the question of politics did not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, then, I apologise. The city manager will be appointed by the Local Appointments Commission and, accordingly, the question of politics would not enter into his appointment; but so far as the question of election to this body is concerned, it would seem to me to be a matter of amusement or recreation, so far as their actual functions are concerned.  I think that, perhaps, it would be advisable for these people to change their names: some of them to call themselves &ldquo;city reformers,&rdquo;&ldquo;independent ratepayers&rdquo;, or some such names.  It appears to me that so far as this Bill is concerned, there would be very little disadvantage in changing the name and that it would be very easy for any party to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have very little to add to what I have said.  The functions of these local bodies, which are kept in abeyance, I presume, will be kept under observation up to 1948.  If we are all alive at that time, I am sure that the whole system of local government will be changed considerably.  Possibly there may never be any election to these bodies, but personally I am of the opinion that, from the point of view of administration, a small body is better than a large and unwieldy body of persons of dissimilar tastes who may not have the necessary concentration to deal with the problems which must arise in connection with such matters.  As regards the Dublin County Council, I think that, at all events, for the present, the present county commissioner system should be given a chance for another year or two, because, in that time, it can be seen whether or not it has proved to be a success.  Perhaps if that system should prove to be a success, there may be a further postponement of elections to <Col N="1624" /> the county council, but the probability is that by that time Dublin County will come to form part of a greater Dublin City and that the whole system of government of Dublin City and County will take a very different form from that which we have to-day.  At all events, if the Dublin Corporation think that 45 members are necessary instead of 35, then, by all means, let the city council have that membership. I have nothing further to say, except to refer again to those discrepancies in the Bill to which I have referred and which, no doubt, have already come to the Minister's attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that this was going to be about the least controversial measure introduced in this House for a long time, and therefore I was surprised to hear Senator Hayes talking, as it appeared to me when I came into the House, quite excitedly about the alleged suggestion of the Minister as to politics entering into county councils.  I would not mind such a suggestion coming from certain Senators but, coming from Senator Hayes, I thought it was a very good joke.  Now, I understood Senator Ryan to suggest that certain political bodies might change their names for the purposes of election to county councils, but I can assure the Senator that that has been tried before. Senator Ryan who, like myself, is non-political, would agree that it has been tried before, and that we have had very many Parties calling themselves by different names, such as the Ratepayers' Association, the Farmers' Union, the Christian Front, and I do not know how many other fronts.  All these people call themselves by various names but, as a member of a county council&mdash;and I have been a member of a county council for a long time&mdash;I think I can say that I hardly ever saw one of these people making a mistake so far as the attitude of the majority of the people was concerned. I do not think there is anything wrong in the bringing in of Party questions into discussions by local bodies.  In fact, I think that one of the most sensible speeches ever made was that made by the Minister for Industry and <Col N="1625" /> Commerce, who generally makes a very good and sensible speech, when he referred to that matter.  The fact is that at the present time the combined Opposition&mdash;and by that I mean all the various Parties that go to make up opposition to the Government &mdash;have, apparently, lost all hope at the moment of ever getting anywhere or of ever getting into power, and it seems to me that it is quite evident that they have made up their minds that their only hope of getting anywhere is by the use of obstructionist tactics.  I can assure the House that the people of this country are sick and tired of all this bickering and nagging, whether in connection with county councils, boards of health, county committees of agriculture, and so on, and that they feel that the best thing for the country is to have some kind of uniformity.</P>

The majority of the people want one thing and there is no reason why their representatives on local bodies should not do everything in their power to put the machinery in motion.  Senator Duffy referred, rather sarcastically, I thought, to the seven members of the defunct county council who have the right to vote in the election of the Seanad.  Does Senator Duffy suggest that that right should be taken away? If he does, why not go the whole hog and say so?  If he does not, it is ridiculous to refer to it at all.  He says also that we should have a smaller council.  How much smaller would he make it?  Should we have, say, 20 members or five or six members?  If we were to have five or six members going round from one room to another, as members of the various committees, surely that is not a sensible suggestion?  If we are to have efficiency on the various committees there must be a reasonable number to choose from.</P>

      <P>Baineann an Bille seo <Col N="1627" /> leis an gCathair agus leis an gConntae Ath Cliath agus labhróchaidh mé ar an mBille amháin.  This Bill applies mostly to the City of Dublin and I shall endeavour to confine whatever few remarks I have to make to the city. Unfortunately I was detained in another place while some of the previous speakers, whom I was anxious to hear, were addressing the House.  I have only just come in now but since coming in I have heard various observations as to an increase or decrease in the representation of various areas. It is well that Senators should know exactly the fluctuations in the representation of Dublin for the past 50 years.  Under the '98 Act&mdash;I am speaking now subject to correction from the legal gentlemen &mdash; Dublin City was enlarged by bringing in the three outlying townships &mdash; New Kilmainham, Glasnevin and Clontarf.  They were then called added areas and the city had a representation of 80 members. There were 20 wards, each ward returning three councillors and an alderman, a total representation as I have said of 80.  The councillors went out triennially, that is to say one councillor in each ward went out each year, and the alderman went out at the end of five years, so that when the alderman's election came on there was a councillor and an alderman elected at the same time.  That system went on smoothly until 1930.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time, of course, as well as the City of Dublin there existed two independent urban councils &mdash; Rathmines Urban Council and Pembroke Urban Council.  Under the Act of 1929&mdash;I am again speaking subject to correction of the legal gentlemen&mdash;the whole representation of Dublin was changed.  The 20 wards and the two adjoining urban councils were dispensed with and five areas were formed with a total representation of 35.  Three of these areas returned six representatives, one returned seven representatives, another returned five representatives and what was called the commercial representation also returned five representatives. The idea of the commercial representation was that a certain type of representative would be elected on a special <Col N="1628" /> register composed of the wealthy ratepaying section of the community.  I heard some talk about politics but what happened that commercial representation? It became the tail-end of one political Party in Dublin Corporation with the result that there was an Act passed in 1935 dispensing with that special representation.  They had a special register of their own.  The five commercial representatives were apportioned to each of the five existing areas.  That brought the representation of No. 3 area up to eight representatives, the representation of No. 1, No. 2 and No. 5 up to seven representatives each, while No. 4 had a representation of six.  That accounts for the total representation of 35 and that is the position as it exists to-day.</P>
    <P>There were certain inequalities in the position that existed in 1930.  For instance, No. 3 area had a higher representation than No. 5 area, although No. 5 area had the bigger population.  No. 5 area is the area which the Minister now present represents in the Dáil.  It is coterminous with the old townships of Rathmines and Pembroke.  It required more votes to elect a councillor in No. 5 area than in some of the other areas.  Vast changes have taken place in the population in recent years.  I think I would be justified in saying that No. 4 area has increased in population more than any other area.  It has increased by 50 per cent. because of the addition of Crumlin.  There has been a big housing scheme in that area which has meant an addition to the population computed to be equal to that of the City of Limerick.  We have no indication in the Bill as to how the city may be divided or what the representation of each divided area will be.  Some people were thinking that it is quite possible that the Minister, by his Order, may follow what happened in 1936 by adding the increased number to the five existing areas.  Of course, in 1936, as I have already stated, the five outgoing commercial representatives were allotted to the five existing areas.  If I may here dabble a little bit in politics, I will say that it is so clear that <Col N="1629" /> the Government were justified in their action in 1935 that only one of the five commercial representatives had the courage to face the Dublin electors&mdash; Willie O'Hara, who was formerly a member of the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether any suggestion I might make would be looked on with favour by the Minister, but I would suggest to him the advisability of considering whether, in some way, the Dáil constituencies could be linked up with the municipal areas.  At the moment, we know that there is this anomaly: the Park ward, which is, of course, on the north side of the Liffey, is in No. 4 area for the purposes of municipal elections, and it is in No. 3 Dáil constituency.  It is in a separate and distinct area for each election.  For the Dáil election, it is in north-west Dublin, and for the municipal election it is in No. 4 area.  Furthermore, there are many anomalies in regard to boundaries.  As those who know Dublin are aware, Dublin City South, the townships area and the County Dublin area, link up with each other around Crumlin, and the dividing line there is so complicated that in some of the dwelling-houses you will find one room in one area and another room in another area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but what I am suggesting is that the line should now be drawn clearly.  The Minister has corrected me by saying they did not do that.  I am not accusing the Minister of having done so.  The area about which I am speaking was a big tillage or pasture area.  To the corporation engineers and architects I will pay the compliment that, in my opinion, they do their business well.  The Dublin housing architect is a splendid man. But they were not going to pay attention to the dividing line as between one municipal area and another, or between one Parliamentary constituency and another.  That is what gave rise to the present position.  I <Col N="1630" /> am only suggesting to the Minister now that he might consider the advisability of clearly defining those lines.  Between the No. 4 and No. 5 municipal areas the line is very clear indeed.  Latterly, Mr. Brown, one of the Minister's officials, was consulted, and he satisfied the corporation representatives, in so far as he made a clear line in what is called Clogher Road. The left-hand side of that road is in No. 5 area, and the right-hand side is in No. 4 area.  When you cross over Sundrive Road again and go up Kildare Road the left-hand side of Kildare Road is in the No. 5 area, and the right-hand side is in No. 4 area. As far as that line is concerned, it is clearly defined, but in other cases we have the anomaly to which I have referred, where one room in a house in one area and another room in another area.  I am not suggesting that the Minister should take any dictation from any member of the municipal council in Dublin, but this matter was discussed at a general purposes committee meeting on last Tuesday week, and if he would consult with that committee he would find them most anxious to give whatever help they can.  The municipal elections are due to be held next June. Again I am speaking subject to correction, but I think they are due to he held between 20th and 30th June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="DenisHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, we are not far apart.  I would respectfully suggest to the Minister that he should proceed immediately with the dividing up of the areas and the defining of the boundaries, so that people who are interested in those elections will know the representation of each area.  We are now well into March, and the elections will be held in June.  Those elections will take some time.  We have to take into consideration the distance between Palmerston Road and Chapelizod and Merrion Gates, or the distance between Larkhill and St. Aloysius Schools in Crumlin, and so on.  Dublin is now becoming a big city, and <Col N="1631" /> the sooner those who are interested in the elections have the position made known to them the better it is for everyone.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the South Dublin Union and its administration before the commissioners took office. There is an old saying that the devil is not as black as he is painted, and I hardly think that the Dublin Board of Assistance exactly deserves the censure of the Minister for the manner in which they conducted their duties. In the first place, let me inform members here that, after the Dublin Board of Assistance meetings each Wednesday, the minutes of the meeting were sent to the Minister's office, so that the Minister was well acquainted with what was going on.  He has stated now that the commissioners have been endeavouring to clear away the old pauper stain from the Dublin Union. I think that all men and women of goodwill will endorse and support that. It is unfortunate that that stain is there.  I know the Dublin Union fairly well.  There are excellent medical officers and an excellent staff there now to look after the poor patients, so there need be no prejudice against going into St. Kevin's Hospital.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that changes have been made.  I remind the Minister respectfully that some of the changes for which he takes credit for the commissioners were carried out by the old board of assistance.  The nurses were increased in the Dublin Union and inmate labour was dispensed with by the old board.  A new wing was built, the back of it extending as far as Pigtown Lane, during the time of the board, and a comprehensive plan was arranged for the extension of that wing in the other parts of the union but, unfortunately, the war intervened in 1939 and upset the apple cart so far as new building was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then the commissioners came in.  I have nothing to say against the commissioners. Those commissioners were <Col N="1632" /> there before, during the previous regime.  I have a clear recollection of speaking at a public meeting in James's Street on a Fianna Fáil platform and accusing the then commissioners of starving the paupers in the Dublin Union.  I am not suggesting that the same thing is happening to-day, but let me point out this to the House and the Minister, that it is quite possible there is not such a great need for outdoor relief or home assistance as there existed formerly.</P>
    <P>His colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has introduced wonderful legislation for this city and country.  By his legislation, he has relieved to a great extent the want of the people all over the city. His most recent help was the Children's Allowances Act, which was a great boon to families who had been receiving outdoor relief.  There were several other beneficial Acts, including one making provision for building employees in wet weather.  In fact, the number of Acts he sponsored is almost too numerous to mention, and it is quite possible that the reduction in costs which the Minister speaks of is in a large measure due to the legislation introduced by the present Government.  Sometimes I have other views to put forward, but when I rise in the House they seem to disappear.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I appeal to the Minister to let the people who will be interested in elections know as soon as possible the details about the new divisions.  First we want to know the number of areas-there are five at the moment&mdash;and next, the manner in which those areas will be divided up, and the representation given to each area.  That is my final request to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words arising out of the statement made by the Minister, because I think it needs some clarification.  At the outset I want to say that as far as the <Col N="1633" /> abolition of the Dublin County Council is concerned, I was one of those who went in and gave evidence on oath for two hours why they should be abolished, so that I have no regrets so far as the Dublin County Council is concerned.  I think it is hardly fair to the present electors, however, to deny them a chance of electing a new council.  I say so for this reason-County Dublin had no right chance to elect a proper council.  In 21 years, only three local elections were held in the county, so that the council had grown stale and it was time they went out.  Nevertheless, I hold that when the electorate of County Dublin are capable of electing members of the Dáil to form a Government, they should be given an opportunity to elect a county council.  If the new council defaults, they can go the same as the last council went.</P>
      <P>As regards the Dublin Union, like Senator Healy, I happen to be a member of the board of assistance, and while I agree that great credit is due to the commissioners for the work they are doing, I must say that in the four years in which I was a member of the board&mdash;not of the board that was abolished but the one before it&mdash;they did very many useful things in the improvement of that institution such as the employment of those nurses.  I want to say to the present Minister&mdash; he was not the Minister then&mdash;that many good proposals put up by the board were not sanctioned by the Department of Local Government.  We found that Department a stumbling block in many respects, including the employment of those nurses.  I am afraid that we did not get much co-operation from the Department in our efforts to carry out reforms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I would like to see the Dublin Union institution burned out altogether, because it should not exist, and although I am getting a bit away from the Bill, I hope to see the day when the poor and those unable to provide for themselves will be housed in better surroundings than those of the Dublin Union.  Therefore, I congratulate the commissioners on going <Col N="1634" /> in that direction.  The only other thing I would like to say is that I feel the whole system of local administration, both in the City and County of Dublin, requires careful planning. You have Balrothery Board, Rathdown Board and the Dublin Board of Assistance, which caters for portion of County Dublin, and as stated by previous speakers, you have the Dáil constituency of County Dublin over one area and members of the corporation for the same area, although it is in County Dublin.  The whole matter requires cleaning up, because some of the people in County Dublin do not know who represents them at the present time.  So far as I am concerned, I have no objection to the Bill in any shape or form, and neither have I any regrets for the abolished bodies, the Dublin County Council and the Dublin Commissioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hayes devoted quite a part of his speech to tilting at the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and criticised me because, in introducing this Bill, I made no reference to a certain speech which my colleague delivered, not in the Oireachtas, but in a proper place to members of an organisation to which the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I have the honour to belong, regarding the policy of that organisation towards the forthcoming local elections.  He complained that I had given no indication of the Government's policy in that regard.  I think I can say this in justification. Senator Hayes is as well versed in our constitutional provisions as I am, and I think it is no part of the functions of the Government of the State to have, as a Government, any definite policy in relation to the contesting of the local or other elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not a Government by virtue of the fact that we are members of a political organisation.  We are a Government by virtue of the fact that we are members of the Oireachtas, and the Oireachtas as a body has no definite policy in relation to the contesting of either the municipal, or <Col N="1635" /> the Parliamentary elections.  Neither House of the Oireachtas, at least no intelligent member of either House, expects or requires a member of the Government to come and put before the Assembly for its acceptance any specific policy in regard to these elections. All they want us to do in that connection is to assure them that so far as we have any function in the matter, the elections will be properly and fairly conducted.</P>
    <P>Of course, Sir, we may have, as individual members of a political organisation, our own responsibility in a matter of this sort.  Political organisations have a constitutional right.  I think if the rights are not definitely conferred on them by the Constitution they are at least there by implication.  They have the right as organisations to participate in the public life of this country.  We have been endeavouring to induce some organisations to do that rather than to depend upon non-participation for the advancement of their particular point of view, and in that regard I may say we have had the very useful support of Senator Hayes.  If, therefore, the governing body of the organisation to which I and my colleagues belong should decide to nominate candidates for the local elections, I am sure we shall give our candidates as loyal support as I am perfectly certain Senator Hayes will give to Fine Gael candidates if his organisation decides to nominate such at the forthcoming election.  Beyond that there is nothing I can say in the matter.  I do not think indeed that I am called upon to follow Senator Hayes further through the rather intricate convolutions of a speech in which he tried to associate a speech quite properly delivered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to an appreciative audience with the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Senator seemed also to be concerned that I had not in this Bill asked the House to confer upon what I think he said would be a non-Party committee or a non-political committee....</P>
    <Col N="1636" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>A non-Party committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>To confer upon a non-Party committee the right to determine how the City of Dublin should be divided up into electoral areas for the purpose of municipal elections.  If I were to do that it would be to create a completely new precedent in the matter.</P>
      <P>Under the Local Government Act passed when the original progenitor of the Party of which Senator Hayes is so bright an ornament and such a stalwart supporter was in power, there was provision for the division of the City of Dublin into electoral areas.  It is found in Section 33 of the Act.  That section states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As soon as may be after the passing of this Act and before the day of election the Minister shall by Order, divide the area consisting of the existing city, the added urban districts and the added rural area into five borough electoral areas which shall be the borough electoral areas in the city for the purposes of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1919.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes, if he had then been an active member of the Oireachtas, would, I am sure, have been the first to refute any suggestion that the Minister for Local Government in 1930 was unworthy to be entrusted with the function of dividing the City of Dublin into electoral areas for municipal purposes.  I should think very little of myself if I were for a moment to admit that I was any less worthy of the responsibilities that I have to carry than he was in relation to the responsibilities he carried then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 35 of the Act of 1941 likewise provides that the Minister may by Order divide any borough or urban district into two or more local electoral areas and fix the number of the members of the council of such borough or urban district to be elected for each such area.  The Oireachtas four years ago conferred that power upon my immediate <Col N="1637" /> predecessor in relation to every local authority in this country outside the City of Dublin and I don't think I am any less worthy of trust than my predecessor was.  I do not think I am any less fitted or that I am likely to discharge my duties less fairly than my predecessor did in 1941. Therefore I do not see that by any stretch of the imagination I could have found myself in the position of coming here and saying to the Oireachtas that this function, which had been discharged properly enough, efficiently enough and equitably enough by two of my predecessors was one I did not feel myself capable of undertaking. Yet that is the position which Senator Hayes wanted me to put myself in.</P>
    <P>I only hope that the Seanad will appreciate that I am just as well able to undertake and discharge this function as General Mulcahy was when he was Minister for Local Government or as Deputy Ruttledge was when he was Minister for Local Government.  I have, however, strange as it may appear, made a concession in regard to this matter, but not because I felt that if I did make the division it would not be one which would be generally acceptable to the citizens of the city, who are the people to be considered in this matter.  I did it because the members of the Opposition in the Dáil tabled an amendment and I, because I felt that if my proposals were put before the House they could not be challenged from any quarter and that they would not be challenged from any quarter, accepted that amendment.  That amendment forms sub-section (7) of Section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As Senator Ryan has pointed out there are similar provisions in Section 9 and also in Section 5, but this sub-section differs from these sections in so far as it provides that the Order will be on the table only for seven days before it becomes unannullable.  The reason for that has been touched upon by Senator Healy.</P>
    <P>It is only fair that those who would be concerned as to the electoral areas, because they might be thinking of becoming <Col N="1638" /> candidates at the municipal elections, should have the question of their possible electoral areas put beyond doubt in the shortest possible time.  If I were to provide that this Order should lie on the table for 21 sitting days, as in Section 5, that might run over a very long period.  On the other hand, if I were to say that the period should be 21 consecutive days, it might happen that the Oireachtas might not be meeting during that period, and that those who might want to question or criticise the Order, or suggest its amendment, would not have an opportunity of doing so.  On the other band, the period of seven sitting days gives those who are interested, from the point of view I have mentioned, an opportunity of consulting their colleagues in the city council so that arrangements could be made for a motion to be put down here which would ensure that the Order would be discussed, if they so desired.  The motion could ask for its annulment or amendment and, in that way, members would have an opportunity of expressing their view and, perhaps, influencing the Minister before the Order would become final and unannullable. I think that that was a perfectly reasonable attitude to take up.  I adopted it because, as I have said, I wished to be fair.</P>
    <P>I have not, and never have had, any other intention in relation to these matters than to ensure that the electoral areas will be clearly and simply defined and will be such as to secure reasonable representation for all points of view in the municipal council.  Because I have had that aim firmly in mind, I have had no objection to tabling the Order after putting my ideas as to how the city should be divided in black and white, leaving it to any member of the Dáil or of this House to put down a motion challenging the Order if he wished and asking me to justify it.  I believe that I shall have no difficulty in justifying any Order I may make under Section 3 but I would not do&mdash;I hope the Seanad will take my view&mdash;as Senator Hayes suggests I should have done-come along to the Seanad and say, by implication, that I am unworthy of doing <Col N="1639" /> what the Oireachtas thought my predecessors were worthy of doing.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes said that this Bill seemed to be inconsistent inasmuch as I was proposing to enlarge the representation of the citizens of Dublin on their own city council while, at the same time, I was depriving the citizens of County Dublin of the right to elect a representative body.  I am reasonably certain that if it were left to the ratepayers of County Dublin to decide whether they wanted the present administration of their county to continue or whether they wanted to revert to the old position, they would vote by a very large majority for a continuance of the present situation. That, however, is not why I decided that it was necessary to continue the commissionership for a period of 12 months and possibly for a period of two years thereafter.  I did not, in introducing this Bill, use that as an argument in favour of Section 5.  The reason why I think it would be very undesirable to revert to the representative body at present is that the commissioner has had an enormous task. The administration of the affairs of Dublin County Council had got into almost the same sort of chaotic condition as the administration of the affairs of Dublin Board of Assistance. There was a huge amount of arrears in respect of rates&mdash;amounting, I think, to about £175,000.  The administration of roads, housing, public lighting and water supply had become so entangled in a network of intrigue and jobbery that it will take the commissioner at least another year and, probably, two more years after that, to straighten out the whole position.  He has managed to deal with the rate position.  Dublin County is now beginning to rise in that regard to the position which it should have held ever since the State was established. So far as the proportion of rates collected was concerned, it was one of the worst counties prior to the appointment of the commissioner.  It has risen until it now holds eighth place in the list of counties in that <Col N="1640" /> connection.  I think that it can go even higher.  I think that when the present year will have elapsed, Dublin, instead of being one of the least satisfactory counties in that respect, will have become one of the most satisfactory. That is the position which, by virtue of its close proximity to the city, the high value of the land and the many advantages which it enjoys, it should occupy.</P>
    <P>When the commissioner has reorganised its finances, as he is doing, the county council, when it is elected and starting off, will be freed from the damning inheritance which the commissioner had to take over when he was appointed.  It will start off with a clean sheet and there will be no excuse whatever for the representative body not being able to give to the citizens of the county the good, clean administration to which they are entitled and which they deserve.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons for this provision. As I indicated, the commissioner is planning a very large housing scheme which will meet the outstanding needs of the working-class people of the county for some time to come.  He is planning for 1,350 dwellings, and these dwellings are to be built not in places which will suit the local magnate, but in places which will meet the needs of the people for whom they are intended. All of them will be provided with water, light and sanitation.  That, I think, will be a very pleasant contrast with the position which prevailed under the old county council, which we had to abolish.  Similarly, the commissioner is engaged in planning a very large programme of sewerage and waterworks and, as I mentioned, there are very large road works in contemplation and being planned.  I should like to emphasise that these are all being planned.  They are not being undertaken at the moment.  If circumstances should change favourably during the period in which the commissioner holds office, naturally, the works will not be held up but will be proceeded with, but, in any event, before they can be proceeded with the <Col N="1641" /> necessary public inquiries will be made and the citizens, the ratepayers and the people of the county will have an opportunity of seeing what is proposed to be done and what developments are proposed to be undertaken within their county.  I am saying that so that people will not come along and say that these schemes are being put into effect without the knowledge or consent of the ratepayers and citizens of the county.  These things, no doubt, will be fully publicised in the Press, and those interested will, possibly, attend the public inquiries also.  In addition to that, the commissioner has been pushing forward, in co-operation with the civic authorities in Dublin, a joint planning scheme for the City and County of Dublin, and these draft plans will be made available to the people for comment and criticism.</P>
    <P>With their views to guide us and with the examination of the proposals in our Department, we shall eventually make a provisional plan.  A draft will enable the matter to be carried forward a further stage, for we shall have a blueprint of the services we propose for the City of Dublin and the county, some of which will have to be undertaken by one authority and some by the other, and others by both authorities in co-operation with each other.</P>
    <P>When we have gone ahead as far as that, and have got a solution of the problem presented by the administration of public assistance in the area of the board in the City of Dublin, and also in the area under the boards of public assistance dealing with the Balrothery and Rathdown districts, then, and only then, will we be in a position to determine what organs we want to administer local affairs in the City of Dublin and the surrounding county. This question of administering public assistance in the County and City of Dublin is a very big problem.  There is almost £550,000 involved, and that represents a very substantial part of the expenditure of the Dublin Corporation. If that problem is not examined and if we are not able to satisfy ourselves that we can devise a <Col N="1642" /> system of organisation, an administrative system which will ensure that the service is carried out efficiently and properly, then I do not see how we can ever approach that larger plan for the co-ordinated administration of the city and county which some people visualise.  Before we can really begin to reconstruct our plans we have to think of these things and examine every proposed solution.  We hope to be able to do that before 1948.  At any rate, we hope that before that we can lay at least the foundations, and plot out our schemes.  Then someone will get the kudos&mdash;I, probably, shall not&mdash;of putting them into effect. There is, however, a tremendous amount of work to be done before we can tackle this problem in the City of Dublin.  Before the war a lot of work could have been done, but the war diverted the attention of people responsible to problems which, naturally, appeared to be more pressing.</P>
    <P>We are now, however, looking forward to a time when all these emergency problems will become less insistent and when we shall be able, in peaceful and more normal conditions, to plan for the city and county.  This Bill is designed to enable those essential steps to be taken, steps which are an indispensable preliminary to the preparation of any composite proposals for local government of the City and County of Dublin, and for that reason I hope that the Seanad will give me the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
