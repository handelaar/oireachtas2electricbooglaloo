    <Title>Public Business. - Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1945&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, in the first place, makes the customary annual provision for the continuance of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts in force for another year-in the present instance, up to the 31st March, 1946. The necessary provision is contained in Section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 and 4 are designed to enable suitable men of the emergency and reserve classes to re-enlist for service in the post-emergency regular Army.  The effect of these sections is to include the period of service rendered during the emergency&mdash;or, in the case of a reservist, the period since he last reported for permanent service&mdash;as portion of the new term of enlistment, thus making such emergency service pensionable in the event of the man concerned continuing to serve in the Army for the period <Col N="1924" /> entitling him to a pension.  It is felt that this provision, taken in conjunction with other proposals, which I hope to be able to announce before long, will attract into the post-emergency Army many suitable men who have acquired valuable training during the past four years and who desire to make the Army their career. The conditions under which suitable temporary and reserve officers will be offered commissions in the regular Army and under which vacancies in the reserve will be filled, will also be made known as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The main effect of Section 5 is that a man enlisted for general service&mdash;as distinct from service in a particular corps&mdash;may be transferred from one corps to another unless he has had 10 years' or more service in a corps.  If he has had 10 years' service he will be transferred only if he himself consents. Up to the present a soldier, on being appointed to a corps, has, except for a few specific reasons, enjoyed a general right to remain in it.  In our Army, however, the conditions of service are so uniform that a transfer from one corps to another does not, generally speaking, entail hardship, and the problem which will arise from demobilisation and the revision of Army Establishments may make it necessary for the military authorities to be free to effect transfers, subject to the proviso which I have already mentioned&mdash;that a man will not be transferred from a corps if he has served in it for 10 years or more.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is merely an amendment of Section 55 of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1940.  That section provides that in court proceedings, a Defence Force Gazette, printed and published by the Stationery Office, will be evidence of the status, ranks and appointments of the officers listed in it.  The present Gazette is published in the Department of Defence and this position will continue for some time.  The purpose of the amendment is to make the Gazette admissible in evidence, even though it is not published by the Stationery Office.</P>
    <P>Section 7, which is another amending section, is rendered necessary by <Col N="1925" /> the fact that it is no longer proposed to publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> such matters as promotions and reversions of officers.  These are purely domestic matters, so to speak, and their publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is administratively unnecessary.  They will in future be promulgated in General Routine Orders for the information of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the character of this Bill makes it necessarily an urgent measure.  We usually have to leave its introduction to the last possible moment because of the possibility of the Army authorities requiring, as in this case, to insert an amendment at the latest stage.  I trust that the House will, as on previous occasions, find it possible to deal with the various stages as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <P>I see no objection to taking all the stages now, but I do not regard it as a precedent.  This is a Bill which is almost on a par with the Expiring Laws Bill.  There are certain conditions to be fulfilled and the only matter that might be discussed is demobilisation.  That might be reserved for another stage.  I see no objection, therefore, to taking all the stages now.</P>
      <P>Agreed to take remaining stages now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not objecting to take the Final Stage now, but I want to raise one point.  It seems to me that a number of men are likely to be discharged from the Army in the near future and some attention should be given to the circumstances under which they are discharged.  Questions of priority will arise.  No doubt the <Col N="1926" /> Minister has thought over the matter and given it his attention, but it would assist people who have to deal with inquiries concerning subjects of this kind if the Minister were, as soon as possible, to make known his proposals in regard to demobilisation&mdash;in other words, whether he has in contemplation the preparation of a scheme or programme by which there will be set up a system of priorities to ensure that people who have jobs to resume will be demobilised before those who have no immediate prospect of appointments. I do not want to press the matter any further.  I merely want to draw attention to it, in the hope that the Minister may be able to say something to indicate what plans have been made for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with Senator Hayes that we have not reached the time for discussing the question of demobilisation, and, while I agree, generally speaking, with the attitude of Senator Duffy&mdash;that is, to go as far as possible into the circumstances of the soldiers as to whether they will be retained or demobilised when the time comes&mdash;it is not a good thing to start off on the assumption that the emergency is ended.  I think it is very far from being ended.  A discussion of this kind is premature, and it should be postponed.  There will be plenty of material for a further discussion at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask a question? This is a point upon which I often find men in the Army worried.  I read what the Minister said in the other House. He said that where a man has a job to go to he will be facilitated by the Army authorities in every way.  I think that is correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There are men in the Army since the beginning of the emergency and we might regard that period as practically over, from a military point of view.  Presumably a gratuity will be paid to these men at the end of the emergency.  Is such a man to be debarred from getting a gratuity at the end of the emergency?  It seems to me <Col N="1927" /> that it would be unfair, from the point of view of common sense, to deprive such a man of a gratuity if he secures reinstatement in his employment when the emergency army is finally disbanded.  I use the words &ldquo;emergency army&rdquo; advisedly, because I would like to get the Minister's view on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies, I wish to call attention to another aspect of the matter which has been brought under my notice.  An employer informed me that employees of his, who joined up at the beginning of the emergency, have communicated with him as to what position they were in in regard to the resumption of work.  He said that he had not yet replied, because he did not know where he stood.  Since then he has taken on other employees who have filled the places of the men who had joined the Army, and he wants to know what he is going to do.  There is a considerable number of cases like that, and it is important that the Minister would clarify the position of employers.  My view was that they were under an obligation to take back former employees, but I have not enough information on the matter.  I hope that the Minister will try to clear it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained in the other House, the plan and scheme of demobilisation have been under consideration, both by the Army authorities and by the Government, for quite a considerable time, and I can assure Senator Duffy that it will be in accordance with his own views&mdash;that is, that demobilisation will take place in a proper and ordered manner. There will be priorities based on various things: service, married men against single men, and so on.  These have been thoroughly examined and recommended by the Army authorities, who are pretty expert on the matter, and who have given very much attention to schemes operating in other countries as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Senator Hayes, in the case which he mentioned, the man would be entitled to whatever emoluments <Col N="1928" /> will be granted in the near future in respect of men who are being demoblised from the Army.  In regard to Senator Baxter's remarks, I should point out that there is already legislation which prescribes the rights of the individual soldier and of the employer.  Both sides are protected. Some doubt has arisen recently as a result of one or two cases in which the employer was able to prove that he was not in a position to take back an individual who, apparently, in our opinion, was covered by the Act.</P>
    <P>It may be necessary to introduce, or produce, new legislation to cover cases in which it is impossible for a man to re-employ a soldier where his business no longer operates.  In general, the rights of the men are safeguarded by the Act passed in 1941.  Senators can be assured that from the point of view of safeguarding the rights of the individual in the scheme of demobilisation, the soldier will be generously looked after.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with what the Minister has stated, but he should bear in mind that there should be a proper system of priority.  I do not intend to discuss the matter in detail in any way, but I want to point out that it is not enough to say that a man will be demobilised if he has employment.  But what is the position of the employer who has taken on somebody else to replace his former employee who joined the Defence Forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister said in reply to Senator Baxter regarding the obligation imposed on employers to give back to their former employees their jobs.  I am just wondering whether there is machinery for enforcing the provisions of the Act.  I have some recollection of complaints being made in different parts of the country that men were unable to enforce their rights.  I am wondering who is going to enforce their rights for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure whether I grasped the point aright. Is it if the employer refuses to take an ex-soldier back, who is going to <Col N="1929" /> fight his case?  Well, the soldier will have to fight his own case.  If it is one of these types of cases in which there is very little doubt any solicitor will advise the individual as to his rights under the law.  If he wins his case the employer will have to pay the costs. We are considering the question of whether additional legislation will not, in fact, be necessary.  I do not want to discuss the matter while that legislation is pending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied.  That is exactly what I wanted to get.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not necessary. There will not be, as far as I know, legislation necessary in respect to demobilisation.  That is a natural function which takes place whenever the emergency is deemed to have ended. In that respect I should advise the House that it may be some time before that operation begins.  It may be some considerable time before demobilisation begins, and when it does begin it may extend over quite a long period. There will no doubt, in due course, be produced a White Paper which, I take it, will be laid on the Table of both Houses.  Arising out of that, I suppose it will be possible to have a discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very gratifying to hear from the Minister that the Government are contemplating legislation along the lines suggested by Senator Duffy, namely, that the workpeople, that is the ex-soldier, will be ensured employment with previous employers. We hope when that legislation is before this House it will be received sympathetically, and that those who are being discharged will be protected.  I am sure it is very gratifying to the House&mdash;it is very gratifying to me&mdash;to know that the Government are contemplating bringing in legislation of this desirable type.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that where a soldier is in doubt as to his rights he has to go to a solicitor.  May I put it that this is a problem for which it may be very desirable to have some kind of office or central authority with a representative of the employer, a representative of labour and of the Minister which would give soldiers advice about their rights?  That is something that the Minister might consider instead of leaving men in the position they are in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only telling the House what the position is.  Senator Hayes is actually anticipating what we are looking into in the legislation that is pending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to mention two points in respect of men who are incapacitated.  There is the man who receives injuries and is only able to do a particular type of work.  That is a case that has actually arisen.  The other point is the availability of work. I know one case which was already heard in the courts where the firm were only too eager to take the man back, but by reason of their present position they no longer had work for him.  In addition he was not physically capable of performing the work.  I mention these things because there is no employer who does not wish that every man in the forces should be reinstated in at least the position he had before he left.  The Minister knows that the case I mentioned went against the soldier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The case that the Senator mentioned is the one I had in mind.  The case of men physically incapacitated is one which was safeguarded some time ago by the Army Pensions Act which this House passed in 1943.  The soldier will be safeguarded when, in fact, physically incapacitated as a result of military service.  I should say that by way of appeal to employers it has been found necessary to discharge certain members of the Army because of some minor incapacity.  For instance,  might have tender feet, or corns, or something like that.  He is not found capable of marching and he is discharged. <Col N="1931" /> The only grounds upon which that can be done are that he was medically unfit.  Unfortunately one or two cases have been brought to my notice where employers have tried to take advantage of the certificate that he is medically unfit, whereas the man is probably in many respects more fitted than when he left his employment by reason of his good training, the good food and the open-air life.  In one or two cases advantage has been taken of that certificate, and I appeal to employers to deal with the matter more sympathetically.  Unless a man is really incapacitated he should be reemployed.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Agreed to take remaining stages now.</P>
      <P>Bill passed through Committee without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.</P>

    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), paragraph (b), line 33, page 2, after the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;being a member of the committee&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is related to sub-section (3) of Section 2.  I would like to draw attention to what is provided in the sub-section which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Nothing in the Act of 1934 or in any regulations or rules made thereunder shall be construed as...</P>
      <P>(b) prohibiting the Referee, in investigating an application for a service certificate, from authorising or permitting a person to hear the applicant&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That section is retrospective and its purpose is to validate investigations carried out by members of the committee and persons appointed by members of the committee, in other words, civil <Col N="1932" /> servants appointed to carry out these investigations.  The Minister complained, when we were discussing this Bill on Second Reading, that I was not a realist.  He deeply regretted that I should have fallen from grace in respect of this matter.  I suggest that he entirely missed the case I endeavoured to make.  I did not make a case, in the circumstances in which we are now situate, against accepting the broad principles of the Bill.  The main case I made was that the Bill was brought in to validate irregularities which had been going on, with the connivance of the Minister, for a period of ten years.  The only question at issue now is as to how far we are to go in validating those irregularities.</P>
    <P>I am willing to go this distance&mdash; that wherever an investigation was conducted by members of the committee set up in pursuance of the Act of 1924, that investigation should be accepted as if it were an investigation by the Referee.  I want to stop short at the point at which interviewing officers, who were not members of the committee, were authorised or permitted, under rules or regulations, or without rules or regulations, to conduct these investigations.  In other words, if there were some thousands of cases in which applicants for certificates were interviewed solely by those interviewing officers, who had no status whatever under the Act of 1924, I am endeavouring to ensure that, if the persons concerned are dissatisfied with the result of the investigation, they should have the right to a new hearing by members of the committee or the Referee, or by members of the committee and the Referee acting jointly.  That is what I am endeavouring to meet by this amendment.</P>
    <P>It is going very far, indeed, to ask the House to say that people who have no status whatever under the law can be appointed by the Department of Finance or the Department of Defence and told to go in and usurp the functions of the Referee and the Advisory Committee.  I want to lock the door against that and to secure that, if people desire a rehearing in cases in which the original investigation was conducted by interviewing officers, <Col N="1933" /> they shall be entitled to that rehearing. It is quite possible that many of the applicants whose cases were investigated by interviewing officers are satisfied, as a result of their discussions with these officers, that there would be no use in proceeding further. I am not making the case that they should automatically get a rehearing. All I am doing is asking the House to alter the sub-section in such a fashion as to enable applicants, if they so desire, to get a rehearing in cases in which the investigation was solely and entirely conducted by interviewing officers.  The Minister should have serious regard to that position.  If what is proposed here is written into our laws, it will be cited to us again and again by other Departments and other Ministers in relation to other types of legislation and we shall be asked to accept the principle that, when a Government Department goes off the rails, it has nothing to do but come in here and have its irregularities validated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that Senator Duffy still fails to grasp the fundamental principles at stake here. I should like to remind him that, between the two Acts of 1924 and 1934, over 80,000 persons applied for pensions. It must be obvious, even to Senator Duffy, that a large number of those persons could not possibly have had genuine claims.  When the Referee, under the 1934 Act, found himself facing an almost impossible task, it was quite reasonable for him to say: &ldquo;This task with which I am faced can not be completed in my lifetime unless I take some special measures to deal with it.&rdquo;  The special measures he took for the handling of the 60,000 cases with which he was faced, were to divide the personnel of his Advisory Committee into groups, and to use those groups to speed up, so far as possible, the hearing of the applications.  After some time, the Referee found that that would not be sufficient.  He then suggested that he should be given&mdash;this was based on his experience&mdash;a certain number of individuals who would examine the forms to see if, in fact, they revealed what he would regard as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of service.  That <Col N="1934" /> was the work on which the interviewing officers were engaged while the Referee and his advisory body were dealing with <i>prima facie</i> cases.</P>
      <P>The interviewing officer, having examined a form, might say that there was no evidence whatsoever of the applicant's title to a service certificate. But he did not take a decision on that question.  The interviewing officer had no function other than to refer those forms to the Advisory Board, with an endorsement stating that the Act did not apply to the particular case.  These forms were then examined by the Advisory Committee.  If the Advisory Committee were in agreement with the interviewing officer, that the form did not show a <i>prima facie</i> case, they endorsed the form, stating that the case was one to which the Act did not apply, and passed it to the Referee. The Referee himself examined the form and signed the rejection notice, so that there could be no question of persons having taken upon themselves powers to which they were not entitled. Their function throughout was to eliminate, so far as possible, waste of time by the Advisory Committee and the Referee in examining forms in which there was no evidence good, bad or indifferent, that the applicant had a case.  The only function the interviewing officers had was the saving of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly recommend the House to reject this amendment.  Already, every case has been heard and every case has been given the investigation to which it was entitled.  This amendment, and the following amendment, which is practically of the same type, are designed to invalidate everything that has taken place up to the present.  It would mean that the 60,000 cases would be entitled to a rehearing.  I submit that that would be a quite impossible task at this stage.  I have not heard of any charge at any time of gross injustice against the Referee. No cases were brought to the courts charging the Referee or the Advisory Committee with failure to hand out justice.  The only cases that were brought were those dealt with by the High Court and the Supreme Court, and in none of these was there any suggestion of anything being wrong, <Col N="1935" /> other than that the wording of the Act had not been carried out in the literal sense that the Supreme Court thought it should be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not alleging, and I hope the Minister does not imagine, that there was any charge of injustice so far as the Referee is concerned.  I made my case from the beginning on this basis: Both Houses of the Oireachtas agreed to the enactment of legislation making provision for the determination of claims for service certificates.  The law passed by both Houses was quite plainly ignored, set aside, or scrapped by whomever was responsible; whether it was the Department, the Minister or the Referee. They completely ignored the provisions of the Statute, and did something which was never contemplated by either House of the Oireachtas.  I agree that the Minister is perfectly right in saying that 50,000 cases were dealt with according to a particular procedure that was wrong.  We have tried to give these decisions a lawful validity.  What I am endeavouring to point out is that, at some stage, the Minister or the Department must have become aware of the fact that the Referee was overwhelmed with applications, which could not be disposed of within two, three, five or ten years by the procedure contemplated in the Act, and that it was mandatory on the Minister to come back to the Oireachtas with new proposals.  I do not care what these proposals were. If you like they might be these proposals or some other set of proposals, to enable the Referee to dispose of applications in a reasonable time.  The duty is clearly placed on the Minister, if he finds legislation unworkable, to come back to both Houses with proposals to amend the legislation.  There is no use in telling us that the Referee was overwhelmed with claims which could not be disposed of in his lifetime, and leave it at that, or in saying that like a sensible man he did the next best thing, adopted totally illegal procedure to dispose of the cases.  I do not think we should give our imprimatur to that conduct on the part of the Referee or on the part of anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1936" /> I do not want to multiply difficulties for the Minister.  I see his difficulty in regard to the large number of cases dealt with by the Advisory Committee, which apparently was divided into two groups to dispose more expeditiously of the applications.  I am trying to distinguish between the proceedings of the Advisory Committee, a body set up by statute, and the proceedings of people of whom we know nothing; who were brought in without any lawful authority to dispose of these cases.  The Minister tells us that the cases were not decided by interview.  Everyone knows quite well that the manner in which the interviewing officers perform their functions might very well decide the fate of an application when it came for signature to the Referee.  An interviewing officer who has made up his mind that A.B. should not get a certificate will be so biased, in spite of himself, in preparing his file that the appearance of the file when it reaches the Referee prejudges a case.  I want to avoid that.  I am not asking that people who were interviewed by the interviewing officers should get a rehearing. I am only asking that if they think fit to apply for rehearing they will get it.  I want to make it perfectly clear that this amendment is not designed merely to make difficulties, but to insist on the authority of the Oireachtas, having framed legislation and made regulations, being enforced. I think it is the duty of every Senator to insist when legislation is enacted here that it will be carried out in the spirit in which it was enacted.  On a previous occasion I quoted in this House statements made by the Minister's predecessor when introducing the Act of 1924, in which he assured the House that every application would be considered by the Referee, and that the applicant would be examined by the committee and the Referee.  All I complain of is that when the Minister found that that could not be carried out he did not come back here and get the law altered.</P>

      <P>Senator Duffy's statement bears out the saying that courts might find a flaw in every law that is passed.  I think the Senator's attitude is unreasonable in this matter.  As the <Col N="1937" /> Minister explained, if the Referee found the burden becoming too heavy, the obvious procedure for dealing with it within a reasonable number of years was to divide the committee into two sections.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Referee at the time stated that it was not necessary to have new legislation. I know as much about the procedure as most people.  I was with the Referee when he dealt with cases.  I was before two separate committees when additional people were put on. I have given evidence in connection with some extraordinary cases.  Now, even if the Referee himself, individually, were to sit down there in state, if you like to put it that way, in order to deal with the 60,000 cases, and deal with them thoroughly, as they have a right to be dealt with, I believe that the Angel Gabriel would not be able to catch up on them before we would be through with them. For instance, there were numerous cases of people who went up there, who were not what you would call normal; in fact, some of them were abnormal.  When people like that come before the board, and the Referee starts asking them questions, these people, in all seriousness, make statements which are completely ridiculous. The only way we could possibly get over that was to divide the committee, as was done at first, and then put on extra people to segregate those cases, and the Referee accepted responsibility, as the Minister has pointed out, in these cases, because the responsibility in these as in other cases had eventually to be taken by the Referee. If, as Senator Duffy suggests, provision should be made to have reopened as many of those cases as the applicants so desired, has Senator Duffy any doubt in his mind that the number would be very large?</P>

      <P>I think Senator Quirke realises&mdash;his speech indicates that he realises&mdash;that there is a much bigger issue at stake here than merely a review of a number of applications.  The principle at stake here is this: whether a Government Department shall simply scrap legislation and, by regulations made by themselves, do the very opposite to what is in the law and the very opposite to what the Minister assured the House would be done.  That is the issue at stake.</P>

      <P>I should like to quote for the information of the House the fact that under the Statutory Rules and Orders, No. 354 of 1934, there were issued rules for the guidance of the Referee, and Rule No. 7 of these Regulations stated that: &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of the Act and these rules, the Referee may regulate his own procedure.&rdquo; Now the Referee, I should remind the House, was a Circuit Court judge who was taken from the bench where he was actively operating and put in charge of this board, and it had to be presumed that he at least knew the law.  He presumed, I take it, that he was working within the Act when he found that he was covered by these regulations.  I do not think I am making an extravagant statement when <Col N="1939" /> I say that the High Court upheld that viewpoint, because the High Court did not grant the conditional orders asked for.  It was when the appellants went to the Supreme Court that the Supreme Court, as I mentioned on the Second Stage of the Bill, taking a purely legal point of view, decided that the Referee was not acting strictly in accordance with the Act. In other words, the applicants were not appearing &ldquo;before the Referee&rdquo;, and it was these three words&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, if the Senator wants to have that, we will grant it to him, but that is not a reason why this Bill should be invalidated, just to gratify the Senator's point on that matter.  As I have said, I feel, and I am sure the House feels with me, that there has been no case, certainly, of gross injustice against any individual.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the Senator has.  I am only saying that there has been no case of gross injustice inflicted on any individual. In fact, there has been no case of even a minor form of injustice. Of course, there have been complaints by applicants who have been refused pensions that they were as much entitled to a pension as Tom, Dick or Harry, but the fact is that the Referee must be the judge, and not this House or the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be some finality to these cases that have been decided, and the only finality there can be must be based on the Referee's decision.  We cannot come to this House or the other House and rediscuss or rehear these cases.  We cannot do that.  The decision of the Referee, in accordance with the Act, is final, conclusive, and binding, and I think that we, here, ought to accept that in the spirit in which it is framed and not attempt to rehear or rejudge and give our views on decisions which have been reached by <Col N="1940" /> a Circuit Court judge in practically every case, with the exception of the present occupant of the position who, I should say, was, for a period of, roughly, about six months, acting as a Circuit Court judge, but who is not now.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might mention this very important fact: that since the decision of the Supreme Court these cases are being heard strictly in accordance with the Act, and what is the result?  The result of that is that the maximum number of cases which have been heard in a week has been 16, and if you make a calculation on that, you will see that if we were to continue at that rate to rehear all these cases it would take, not the 70 years which I estimated, but 85 years, and I am sure no one would suggest that we should get back to that.  There have been suggestions that we could easily get over that by appointing a number of referees.  Possibly, we could, but the cost would be so exorbitant that it would not be worth the candle, and, as well as that, we would have varying decisions, varying degrees of service, and so on, which would simply add to the discontent and dissatisfaction that exist already.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what Senator Duffy is going to do about this amendment.  Unlike most, I can examine this situation very objectively, since I have had really no contacts at all with any applicants for pensions under any of the Acts.  I may say that I know one individual whose claim was turned down under this last Act and who, in my opinion, is entitled to a pension.  I believe that he has been telling me the truth, and yet he was refused a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, what strikes me about the position is this.  I frankly admit that I have not the same interest in the matter as people such as Senator Quirke and others have, and who may have a good deal on their conscience in connection with this matter.  Really the Minister is in the position in which he finds himself because the Party promised legislation and convinced a lot of people that they were <Col N="1941" /> going to get pensions.  That may have been very unfortunate, but it is the impression that was created in the minds of a great many people.  Your legislation took the form that it stipulated that the Referee was to give a decision.  The Referee was to be the final judge.  It was then discovered apparently that the Referee was not in fact the judge, that he did not, in fact, examine the applicants.  Anybody who has ever been in a court of justice&mdash; and some of us have been in a court of justice in varying capacities&mdash;know quite well that it is of the greatest importance for the judge himself to examine the applicants.  I think it was equally important in this, as in every other court where an individual was putting his case, to get justice. The position as I see it is that the Referee was no doubt very well served by the people to whom he delegated the work, but anyway the final responsibility was his to pass judgment on each applicant and he did not see the applicants. He did not examine them himself. I confess that I think the reaction of every judge in every case, as reflected in his decision, is to a considerable extent determined by the attitude of the person examined before him.  That, as it seems to me, is the position which the Minister is up against.</P>
    <P>I do not know what I should do if Senator Duffy proposes to push this amendment to a division.  I do not know that I could have an awful lot of sympathy with people who preached pensions to such an extent that they had 80,000 applying for them, apparently including thousands whom they regarded as not being qualified for pensions at all.  I do not know that there is any great obligation on me to take them out of that difficulty.  As far as the Minister is concerned, a very peculiar situation exists, but in the last analysis the Minister is charged with the responsibility of doing justice to the most humble.  If he is satisfied in his mind that it is not absolutely essential to the administration of justice in this case for the judge to be present when an applicant is being, as it were, tried, then he is propounding a new principle in my opinion in the administration <Col N="1942" /> of justice.  Frankly, I do not know that it is a principle to which I would be prepared to subscribe.  I should not like to go into any court in any capacity whatsoever to have judgment passed upon me by a judge who was not present.  That is how the thing looks to me.  I do not know what Senator Duffy will do, but if I have to commit myself to a principle I should like to be satisfied that inherent in it was some conception of justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer briefly to one statement made by Senator Baxter that certain people might feel it on their conscience to oppose these amendments because of the fact that they had preached pensions all over the country.  The suggestion obviously is that the Fianna Fáil Party went round the country soliciting support on the basis of granting pensions to members of the Old I.R.A.  It is not necessary for me to assure Senator Baxter, notwithstanding his political affiliations, that the most surprised people in this country when they found that they were going to be granted pensions were members of the Old I.R.A.  They did not go out to fight for pensions, they did not expect pensions and, as I say, they were the most surprised people when they found that a Bill was to be introduced to grant them pensions. When that Bill was introduced, I do not think that even the members of Senator Baxter's Party offered any serious opposition to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated previously, I think I know as much of the procedure up there as most other people with the possible exception of the Minister and some civil servants in his Department who are present.  I feel that certain grievances exist and if I may say so, in a few cases, genuine grievances, not so much that people were turned down who should have qualified but because in the case of A and B, who had exactly the same service, A goes up and makes what we call a good case, while B who goes forward with exactly the same service but with possibly not the same amount of experience and possibly not the same amount of education, makes not so good a case.  I am not suggesting that either man departed <Col N="1943" /> from the actual truth.  It is not necessary at all that they should depart from the actual truth, but one man could tell the truth in a different way from the other man.  A gets a pension and B is turned down.  B's grievance is not that he has not got a pension but that A who lived across the road from him, and who had exactly the same service, got through. Now people in B's category are, I think, entitled to pensions but I cannot see any way by which the matter can be covered.  I, as I have said before, have given evidence in these cases.  I know that a certain man down the country has had a certain type of service, but he goes before the Referee and if he is asked certain questions and he answers them in the negative, nobody can remedy that for him.  He can come along either to Senator Baxter or to me or to anybody else and say: &ldquo;I was excited; I had a few drinks taken&rdquo; or something of that kind, but no legislation can be drafted to deal with cases of that kind.</P>
    <P>Surprise has been expressed at the number of people who applied for pensions.  Possibly we were all surprised at the number of people who applied, but I certainly am not surprised at the number of people who got pensions, and if it were possible to bring in other people, there are still hundreds of people in this country who have not been catered for in this or any other Act.  Again, I say there is no legislation which could cover these cases.  I am thinking particularly of the case of a man who had a dug-out, for instance, on his farm, a dug-out, perhaps, in his own house.  Armed men were kept in these dug-outs, arms were dumped there, and explosives were being kept there.  If these dug-outs had been found, these men with their families would have been blown sky-high, but just because they were not members of the forces on either of the critical dates, they did not qualify for pensions.  Does Senator Baxter, or anybody else, suggest that they are not entitled to consideration of some kind?  Again, however, I do not see how legislation could be drafted to deal with such cases.  I think we <Col N="1944" /> ought to deal with this matter in a sensible way, and not try to score petty political points over it.  The situation must be regularised, and there is no better way to regularise it than by the Bill before the House.</P>

      <P>When I proposed this amendment, I was very careful and very desirous to keep strictly to one aspect of the matter under discussion. I put down the amendment, first and foremost, to narrow as much as I could the omnibus provisions of this Bill in so far as it proposes to validate irregularities. My suggestions to the House were that it is our function, so far as lies in our power, to uphold the supremacy of the law that is enacted by the House.  I was not discussing the merits or the demerits of any application for a certificate for a pension. I did not criticise the manner in which decisions were reached.  I did not allege injustice&mdash;I repudiated the suggestion that injustice has been done. Therefore, I dislike that there should be a political discussion now about the merits or demerits of the Pensions Acts, because, if that avenue is to be opened up, it will obscure for us what seems to be the essential point in this discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central point for me is that if legislation is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, we must do what we can to prevent anybody driving a coach-and-four through that legislation. No doubt, in giving a Second Reading to this Bill, we have confirmed the principle, the principle being that a cloak of validity will be drawn over gross irregularities.  All I am endeavouring to do in the amendment is to limit its field of operation so as to give validity to the decisions reached by any member or members of the Advisory Committee, but to stop there, and to refuse to give validity, that is to say, to give binding force, to decisions based on investigations by particular officers given the task of making these inquiries without any statutory <Col N="1945" /> authority.  That is the only point I am concerned with.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his last statement, proceeded to read the regulation, a very proper regulation, made for the guidance of the Referee and when he quoted Section 7, do not let us forget that the opening words were very properly &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act and to the regulations made thereunder&rdquo;. That was a perfectly proper regulation, but the Referee did not make any regulation for his own conduct subject to the provisions of the Act.  His regulation was contrary to the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>What is very important, although it is not legally binding, is the undertaking given by the Minister who introduced the Bill in the House in 1934. The undertaking given by the Minister was that every applicant would have an opportunity of appearing before the Referee and the committee and making his case.  I am not saying that that was a practical proposition in view of the large number of applications subsequently received, but I am suggesting that the Minister who was in charge in 1935 and 1936, when confronted with this shoal of applications, should have come back to the Oireachtas and said: &ldquo;This Act of 1934 is utterly unworkable unless we change the method of making the application.&rdquo;  If any Minister came back to the House and made that case, I am perfectly certain that members of both Houses would be most anxious to facilitate him.</P>
    <P>Having made the legislation, they would see that the Act could not be operated in the manner in which it was intended to operate.  But that was not done, and would not be done now if certain applicants had not a grievance &mdash;I am not discussing those grievances &mdash;and had not gone to the High Court. The High Court refused by a majority to make the conditional order absolute. The High Court happened to be wrong. The Supreme Court held that the High Court was wrong and that the Referee was wrong and that the law was ignored.  All these cases accordingly were held to be entitled to review.</P>
    <P>I am not discussing what would happen <Col N="1946" /> on review&mdash;I do not know.  I am not proposing to prophesy.  I adhere strictly to the point with which I commenced, that it is the duty of the House to tell the Minister and the Government, and every other citizen, that when legislation is enacted they are going to see it is carried out according to the letter of the law and not otherwise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Patrick O'Reilly Mr. Patrick O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Patrick O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no great point in making it possible for those seeking pensions to send in their applications, as provided by Senator Duffy's amendment.  I think that claims have been dealt with in the light of the details given on the application forms of the applicants.  When it became obvious that there was no possibility of the applicants qualifying on the basis of their forms, or on any supplementary evidence submitted, I do not think it would be fair to those who have been turned down, according to law, assuming that they have been heard by the Referee, to give an opportunity of applying again and undergoing the expense of travelling to and staying in Dublin, which would only prolong the disappointment.  It is quite obvious, as the Minister stated, that all the applicants could not qualify.  Good as the effort was against the British forces, it would have been much greater if all those who applied were entitled to pensions.</P>
      <P>As regards the method of hearing claims, Senator Quirke stated that the Angel Gabriel would have been caught in the procedure laid down by the Act.  I agree with the Senator that it was considered to be an expedient to give effect to the desire of the majority of the applicants and other interested parties who wished to speed up the administration of the Act.  In doing that, a number of cases were decided, having regard to the claims on the applicants' forms, which showed clearly that they could not possibly qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that there might be cases such as those cited by Senator Quirke, where people gave very valuable service at the time, but failed to qualify because they were not members of the I.R.A., even though they had given <Col N="1947" /> greater service than members of the I.R.A.  But if you were to give evenhanded justice under that Act, you would have to take case after case and go over them one by one, providing for every particular case.  I think it will be agreed that it is impossible to do that sort of thing, that legislation can only be made to apply in a general way, even though there may be cases of hardship.  That is unfortunate.</P>
    <P>I am of opinion that it would not be possible to take case after case and, if you like, legislate for every one.  Senator Baxter referred to the importance of the applicant being heard by the judge in any court.  There is quite a lot in that, I agree, provided that there is a question at issue.  But if it becomes clear to any person administering the Act, as the Referee was administering it, that the applicant had no case&mdash;in other words, that there was nothing at issue&mdash;then I suggest it would not be contrary to reason for the applicant not to be heard by the Referee.  It is only when there is a question at issue that it is important for the judge to hear the applicant.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to think that there is dissatisfaction because of the administration of the Act; in other words, all the people that applied did not get pensions.  Assuming it were made much easier and that more people would get pensions, there would still be a number of people disappointed.  We have got to face up to the question whether this House will subscribe to giving pensions to every applicant.  We must make up our minds about that.  If we agree that every person that filled in a form is entitled to a pension, well and good.  I am inclined to think that all the people who applied are not entitled to pensions.  Many may be, but there may be cases of hardship.  It is very hard to legislate for individual cases.  The trouble is that the onus of proof was on the individual.  That is the reason there is so much dissatisfaction <Col N="1948" /> with the administration of the Act.</P>
    <P>For instance, if an applicant was prepared to state that I fought in the General Post Office in Easter Week and that I got evidence to that effect, if people qualified to do so certified that that was correct, then the judge would have no option but to award me a certificate of service, even though it would have been physically impossible for me to have given it.  That was the position. If there is dissatisfaction much of it was caused by one man trying to get a pension at the expense of his fellows.  Because that position arose and because they were trying to get through all cases within a reasonable time the procedure referred to was adopted.  It has been found by the courts not to be strictly in accordance with the Act even though it may have been the intention of the Legislature at the time.  If the Legislature finds that what it intended to do was not, in fact, done and if a court held that no matter what it may have intended to do, it actually did something else, surely it is the right of the Legislature to go back and amend the legislation.  That, in my opinion, is all that is being done here.</P>
    <P>That is what I have to say with regard to the Act.  I do not think it is quite fair that people who would have no case should be allowed to apply for a rehearing under the amendment proposed by Senator Duffy.  I see no useful purpose in doing so.  If we had evidence of grievances it would be possible by way of legislation, or by some other means, to get over difficulties that have been suggested by Senators, and to take, as suggested by Senator Quirke, a broader interpretation of the definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo; as well as having some authority to inquire into cases that were turned down.  That would be a far better plan than an amendment of legislation at this stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (5), line 14, page 3, to delete the words &ldquo;shall not be obliged&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;may, if requested to do so by the applicant, consent&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My reason for moving this amendment, which I mentioned on the Second Reading of the Bill, was that on the earlier occasions and on a later occasion when claims were being dealt with, owing to the lapse of time, certain people were not available, many being in America and a great many having gone from us, and, in the preparation of lists and accounts of activities, it was not always certain that the statements were absolutely correct. When the verifying officers went before the Referee and the Advisory Committee to give evidence on behalf of applicants they were generally supplied with evidence by brigade committees or by committees acting on behalf of applicants.  They might in perfectly good faith have given evidence which was contrary to what applicants actually claimed.  In the majority of cases the verifying officer was not in a position to know what an applicant had claimed.</P>
      <P>Some of the referees did not give any indication of the evidence of which they were in possession.  Verifying officers went up and made a statement. If, at a later period&mdash;even up to the present year&mdash;an applicant was able to ascertain that evidence was given which did not, by any means, help his claim, that applicant should, at least, have a right to give rebutting evidence. I earnestly appeal to the Minister to consider the alteration of the clause so that referees may, if so requested, consent to inform applicants of evidence given against their interest and allow them to tender rebutting evidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept this amendment because the object of Section 2 (5) is to protect the verifying officer.  It will be easily understood that, if a verifying officer had to give evidence in presence of the applicants, it might create a situation in which he might have to go on the &ldquo;run.&rdquo;  It would be most undesirable that we should reach a stage where the procedure of the referees who have operated up to this would be invalidated by acceptance of this amendment.  For the reasons I have mentioned, I do not propose to accept the amendment.  It would be most undesirable to have a situation in which the evidence of a man in respect of what might be an exorbitant claim would be refuted by the verifying officer in his presence.</P>

      <P>It would not be necessary to have the name of the <Col N="1951" /> verifying officer or of any other person who might have given evidence or written to the board revealed.  The present Referee actually does have the verifying officer, the applicant and other witnesses present and they give their evidence on oath.  If a mistake has been made&mdash;I genuinely think that some mistakes have been made&mdash;surely, it is only fair and just to the applicant to allow him to tender rebutting evidence. It would not be necessary for the Referee to give the names of the persons who supplied the evidence which was to be rebutted.  The applicant would not be in a position to know whether it was the verifying officer or anybody else.</P>

The majority of the members of the House are more intimately concerned with this question than I am.  In the ordinary court the parties are entitled to know what case has been made against them.  I know of no sphere in which there is greater possibility of bitterness over what is believed to be an injustice than in the case of this Bill.  If the individual concerned cannot <Col N="1952" /> find out where he stands, I do not think you are doing justice.  I cannot see any objection to the amendment.</P>

      <P>I can see no difference whatever between the section, as it stands, and Senator Miss Kennedy's amendment.  From the points made by Senator Miss Kennedy, it seems to me that the amendment should read &ldquo;shall, if requested.&rdquo;  As the section stands, there is nothing to prevent the Referee giving the information, if he wants to do so.  Under the amendment, the Referee can also do so, if he wants to do so.  It appears to me that the wordings are two ways of saying the same thing.</P>

      <P>The Referee does, in the majority of cases, concede these points but the fact remains that there may be cases in which the verifying officer would regard it as unwise that he should be compelled to give evidence in the presence of people who may be making exorbitant claims which he will have to refute.  He may have to go back and live in a small community with individuals by whom he will, probably, be charged with having deprived them of the pensions which they might otherwise have got. The evidence given by the verifying officers is given on oath.  We have got to presume that these men, when before the Referee, are telling the truth and are not just ventilating spleen against some individual.  If they do what they conceive to be their duty, they do not want to be advertised as having victimised some person who made a claim.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (9), line 48, page 3, to delete the words and figures &ldquo;1st day of February, 1945&rdquo;, and substitute the words &ldquo;passing of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is not of fundamental importance but it has some importance in relation to the manner in which this House views procedure in the courts when framing its legislation.  It should <Col N="1953" /> be observed that in sub-section (9) of Section 2 provision is made relating to what will happen in the case of a conditional order directing the Minister to send a report of the Referee to the court appointed.  It was stated there what will happen where a conditional order of that kind has been made absolute by order of the Supreme Court or the High Court made before the 1st day of February, 1945.  I find some difficulty in understanding the reason for that date, 1st February, 1945, because, actually, I think the Bill was introduced in the Dáil on the 1st March.  I could understand a provision of this kind being inserted to prevent access to the courts after the Bill was introduced, but I do not understand the provision prohibiting access to the courts in respect of applications made in February, before the Bill was introduced.  What I am endeavouring to do in this amendment is to substitute the date on which the Act is passed instead of the 1st February.  It may mean a delay of six or seven weeks, but there is a principle involved, and that is, whether litigants who go into court are to be prevented from getting the benefit of their application at that time or, at least, at the time when their application reaches the court.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the members of the Seanad feel on this matter, but I feel very strongly that we should be very slow to impose an impediment of this kind on applicants who genuinely believe that they are entitled to redress in the court and who, as has been proved in other cases, were entitled to the redress they sought.  On those grounds I ask the Seanad to substitute the words &ldquo;passing of this Act&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;1st day of February, 1945&rdquo;, which now appear in the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accepting this amendment.  The amendment is in direct conflict with Section 3, which we brought in specially to deal with this particular type of case.  I think it was on the 21st December that we issued a warning to all persons, likely to engage in this type of case, that they would do so at their own risk. I think that that was a fair warning-from <Col N="1954" /> 21st December to the 1st February&mdash;and we accepted practically every case because, after issuing the warning, we made the latest date for the acceptance of these cases the 1st February.  Between 21st December and 1st February we accepted every case that was brought before the court. When this Bill was being introduced we specified the 1st February as the latest date up to which we would accept these cases.  I think that that was reasonable, and we are not going to go beyond that particular date.  If any cases should be taken into court, where an individual may think it is worth the risk, well, then, we are going to make him pay for that risk which he may be inclined to take, after that, and I do not think anyone can grumble very much in that connection.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4 to delete sub-paragraph (ii), lines 31-38, inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, as a matter of fact, relates to the point to which the Minister addressed himself on the last amendment; that is, the second sub-paragraph in Section 3.  It seems to me that this is a most outrageous proposal. The section was not in the Bill when it was originally introduced.  It was introduced on the Committee Stage in the Dáil, and its purpose is that in certain circumstances a litigant <Col N="1955" /> will be made liable for his own costs and for the Minister's costs, irrespective of what the court may think of the matter at all.  Now, as far as I know, it has been regarded as the regular practice of law in this country that the awarding of costs is in the discretion of the court.  I have heard that argued over and over again.  I was interested in a case some years ago in which a very large sum of money was involved. The peculiar situation arose in which it was impossible to give the relief sought for, but the court allowed costs to the petitioners.  I remember an appeal being taken against that award, and the defence argued in the High Court, or the Supreme Court, I think it was, that the awarding of costs was entirely in the discretion of the court, and I think that that was generally accepted.  The proposal contained here takes away that discretion entirely.  It says that &ldquo;if the Minister appeals and the appeal is allowed, no costs in the High Court or the Supreme Court shall be awarded to, or be recoverable from the Minister by the prosecutor, but the Supreme Court may make such order as it thinks fit for the payment to the Minister by the prosecutor of the costs of the Minister in the High Court or the Supreme Court or in both.</P>
    <P>Now, I read the defence of this sub-section that was made by the Minister in the Dáil, and it seems to me that he has got hold of the wrong end of the stick.  He argued that his purpose was to prevent grasping lawyers getting hold of discontented I.R.A. men and inducing them to make applications to the court which would involve them in a substantial sum in law costs.  In that connection, the essential thing to bear in mind is that the solicitor or counsel cannot move in these cases unless there is an applicant who has a <i>bona fide</i> application and a right to go to the court.</P>
    <P>The solicitor or the counsel is merely the instrument used by the applicant, and what is being proposed in this sub-section is the preventing of a poor applicant going into court because, if the applicant has plenty of money and can afford to take the risk, he can go <Col N="1956" /> into court anyway; but if he is poor, unless the solicitor is very generous, he will be unable to find a solicitor who will take his case to court, as there is no assurance that the solicitor will be able to secure his costs.  I think that this is a most hateful way to approach a problem of this kind and I do not think that, on reflection, the Minister will feel any pride in this kind of legislation.  I would urge very strongly that even at this stage he would eliminate this provision and leave it to the discretion of the court to say whether or not costs would be awarded against an applicant.</P>

I do not like the word &ldquo;High <Col N="1958" /> Court&rdquo; in the section, and I think it should be omitted.

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3) to add at the end of the sub-section the following proviso:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Provided that the contrary shall be deemed to have been proved if the person can show that he possessed or had the custody of the goods as part of the stock in trade of a business and that the goods were sold in the ordinary course of trade to a customer and that he had no grounds for suspicion that the goods were to be exported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was put down mainly <Col N="1961" /> for the purpose of eliciting further information, if I can get it, from the Minister for Finance, with regard to the operation of this section.  He indicated, and I have no information which would enable me to suggest that what he said was not correct, and I am not disputing it, that some shopkeepers had been suspected of irregularities for the purpose of facilitating the export of goods.  I am sure that he will not think that I have the slightest sympathy with anyone who engages in transactions of that kind, or that I would have the slightest desire to make it difficult for his Department to deal with.</P>
    <P>He will appreciate that I am concerned with the position of the genuine trader, and in this I do not speak for myself, but for a large number of people.  Some of those who spoke to me were genuinely concerned about the position.  Roughly speaking, it is this: a person goes into a retail shop and produces a ration book.  It is not possible to know whether it is a genuine ration book or not; it may well be.  There is no onus on the shopkeeper to prove that the person who tenders the book is the actual owner of it.  It is a case of taking a man's ration book from a woman or <i>vice versa.</i>  The difficulty I have in mind is that about a person who is resident in the Six Counties, or who is working in England, and who uses a ration book to purchase clothes when he or she is at home.</P>
    <P>The shopkeeper has no reason whatever to expect that the clothes will be exported.  I do not mind telling the Minister that goods bought in retail shops are often exported as personal effects.  In my own business, I was asked by my manager what he should do about it.  I simply said there was nothing to do unless he had grounds for suspicion.  If he asked a customer whether there was any possibility that the clothing would be exported he would probably be told lies by those who intended doing it in any case.</P>
    <P>This is not a question of politics, and I am not raising it as a personal question, but I would like to ask the Minister if he is prepared, either now or at a later stage, to let us know the <Col N="1962" /> exact position of the <i>bona fide</i> shopkeeper. I do not intend to try to protect the shopkeeper who knowingly helps in the illegal exportation of rationed goods, but I do want the Minister to know that people residing in England come home and quite legally use the ration books and coupons of members of their families. They get clothes they could not possibly buy on the other side of the Channel, and I do not think it is possible for a shopkeeper to stop those practices.</P>
    <P>On the strict reading of the Bill, the shopkeeper may be deemed to be the exporter if the goods are afterwards found to be exported.  I put it to the Minister to see if there is any way out of the difficulty.  The amendment is not meant to be a hostile one; it is designed to meet a genuine problem.</P>

      <P>I fully accept what Senator Douglas said&mdash;that his only desire is to help and that he has no desire at all to assist anybody attempting to break the law in this matter of smuggling or in any other matter.  I fully realise that there are sometimes difficulties for <i>bona fide</i> shopkeepers. It happens every day in the week that goods are sold across the counter to people who intend to smuggle and the shopkeeper cannot know.  Senator Douglas said that his manager asked what is he to do.  I am afraid I can give him no advice.  One thing that flashed across my mind when Senator Douglas mentioned that was whether people coming into the shop with a North of Ireland accent would be any indication, but knowing Dublin I think sometimes that 90 per cent. of the people seem to have come from the North of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Not at all, especially as most of them are well off and I get a lot of income-tax out of them.  I am afraid that I cannot give any help <Col N="1963" /> in the matter and it would not help to know if they had a North of Ireland accent.  I do not know any other advice that I could give.  My advisers are of opinion that there has not proved to be any difficulty in the case of <i>bona fide</i> shopkeepers.  Their experience has shown that there have been few cases where <i>bona fide</i> shopkeepers who have been examined have had any difficulty in showing the officials who asked them the necessary questions that they did whatever they did in a <i>bona fide</i> way.  In the working out of the restrictions which have been imposed since the emergency, so far as we are aware the <i>bona fide</i> shopkeeper has not found himself in difficulties. Here is a note from my advisers.  It reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 3.  Sub-clause (3) deals with the completed offence of exportation, i.e., where the defendant is charged with having moved the goods out of the State.  Normally, the person from whom he procured such goods will not himself export them and should there be evidence that such seller was privy to the transaction he would, as a rule, be charged under clause 3 (7), i.e., &lsquo;knowingly concerned in dealing with the goods with intent to evade the prohibition&rsquo;, and not under this sub-clause.  The amendment is, therefore, unnecessary.  It may be added that, however the charge might be framed, the fact that a shopkeeper sells stock to a customer in the ordinary course of trade has been shown by experience to be no guarantee that the shopkeeper is not fully aware that the goods are to be exported illegally.  Convictions have, in fact, been secured in such cases, but if a defendant could satisfy the court that he had no grounds for suspicion that the goods were to be exported the onus would naturally be discharged without any such special provision as that suggested. It is accordingly superfluous.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to put the last words into the section, the words with regard to the onus?  My point is that on a careful reading of sub-section (3) it is not <Col N="1964" /> there.  All I want is that the onus should be to show that he had no grounds for knowledge.  As it is he has to prove that he did not know it was for export, which might be extremely difficult in certain circumstances.  As far as Section 7 is concerned I have no amendment because I have no objection to it.  Section 7 deals with &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;, and in that case I have no objection.  Sub-section (3) I have shown to one or two friends, some with legal minds, and I really suggest that it is extremely strict if it is taken in its actual wording.</P>

      <P>I am not dealing with the past.  May I suggest that I had no reason whatever to say that there is any legitimate grievance on the part of shopkeepers as to the way they have been dealt with by the Revenue Commissioners?  I have not suggested that and I would not like anything I say to be taken as suggesting it.  My point is that they might find a difficulty in this matter.  I am not going to press this amendment.  I have raised a <i>bona fide</i> point and I hope there will be some publicity given to the last statement of the Minister.  If it could get some publicity in the Press I think it would relieve minds because it would show the intentions of the Revenue Commissioners.  I may say that I do not find any general want of confidence in the officials among shopkeepers.  In fact, there is great confidence in them.</P>

I am not sure if it is legal for people who come home from England on holidays to purchase clothes with coupons belonging to the family here and then return to England.  Many shopkeepers know that, and it would not occur to them that there was anything wrong.  I am sure there is nothing morally wrong and I doubt if there is anything legally wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the section, in page 45, to add the following sub-section:</P>
      <P>(10) The word &ldquo;place&rdquo; in this section means a place where it is reasonable to suppose that goods would be brought in order to facilitate exportation.</P>
      <P>This really deals with another point. It seems to me that when a judge is trying a case under this section there ought to be an onus on the prosecution to show that the place the article was brought to was a place to which it might reasonably be brought for exportation. There is absolutely no limit to the word &ldquo;place&rdquo;.  The Minister might also consider this on the Report Stage. &ldquo;Place&rdquo; could mean where I am standing, or anywhere in Ireland.  It is an extremely wide term.  It would be for the judge in the case of a prosecution to know whether it was a &ldquo;place&rdquo; which might be regarded with some suspicion.  When you add to that the fact that the onus of proof is on the defendant, it is not unreasonable that the prosecution should have to show that the place was a suspicious place.  Otherwise, you may have a very grave injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally, I understand that the place would be definitely specified in the charge.  However, occasions do arise&mdash;fairly frequently, I understand&mdash;where the place cannot be so specified.  An example would be the case of a carter or a motorist carrying goods along a road.  The customs officials might be following that vehicle for miles before it would reach the Border.  It would be difficult in that case to specify a particular spot.  I am advised that this amendment would hamper the administration. In order to get after the smugglers in an efficient way, I am advised that the officials do need what are admittedly very wide powers.  It has also been suggested to me that the judges would take into consideration the suitability or otherwise of the place where the goods were found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty in that is that the judge has no business to take that into consideration if he accepts <Col N="1967" /> this Act literally, because the onus of proof is on the defendant.  The Minister has instanced the case of a car going along a road leading, presumably, to the Border.  That would be, unquestionably, a place where it would be reasonable to suppose goods might be brought for the purpose of exportation, and it would be covered by my amendment.  On the other hand, to include a place anywhere does seem extremely wide.  I do not propose to divide the House on the amendment. I do think, nevertheless, that the Bill requires some limitation by way of definition of &ldquo;place&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I cannot allow this section to pass without a short protest as a member of the Bar.  It is a retrograde section.  It brings us right back to the 12th Century. I say that, having due regard to the statutes of 1827 and 1876, which were quoted by the Minister in his remarks on the Second Reading. Unfortunately, I was not able to be present then.  There was a time when a person accused had to clear himself.  He did it by ordeal&mdash; by walking over red-hot ploughshares or by being thrown into a river to see whether he would sink or float.  If accused by an individual, he had to undertake the ordeal of battle with his accuser.  If the person accused was very small and the person accusing was very large, he would not emerge well from the ordeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>

    <Col N="1968" />
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Even when the ordeal was abolished the accused person was a suspected person, and he had pretty well to clear himself by his own efforts.  But from 1640 onwards, there was a steady movement, not so much in statutes as by way of the product of the crystallised wisdom of the judges, to make it incumbent on anybody, whether in a civil or criminal case, who makes an accusation, to prove it&mdash;and in a criminal case to prove it up to the hilt. That was the product of the wisdom of the judges who discovered two things&mdash;first, that innocent people had been convicted, and secondly that the conscience of the public was so disturbed by the possibility of innocent people being convicted that their weight was not thrown towards the enforcement of the criminal law, but rather against it.  For the enforcement of the criminal law, no policeman is as good as public opinion.  Accordingly that principle came in, and has been observed in criminal law, as a whole, up to the present day.  There have been certain minor exceptions under the Customs Acts.  Two of them were referred to by the Minister on Second, Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that principle exist in any other Acts than the Customs Acts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking offhand, I do not think so.  There may possibly, be an exception in the case of a burglar's tools.  The Minister justified the general principle of this section by reference to an Act of George IV&mdash;the Revenue Act, 1827. Section 76.  That was a provision of limited application.  All that that section provided was that, if a question arose as to whether the duties had, in fact, been paid, the onus was on the accused person of providing that.  Ordinarily speaking, he would have the receipt, and it would be easier for him to prove that than it would be for the revenue authorities to take the onus of proof upon themselves.  That was an example of quite a usual modification&mdash;that where one person has proof in his hand and the other person cannot get it, you <Col N="1969" /> may ask him to produce it.  The other case under the Act of 1827 had reference to a question as to whether goods were of the nature or kind alleged. The onus was placed on the individual to prove that they were not of such a kind.  As the goods were his, he would be able to show the nature and kind of them.  It would be easier for him to do that than it would be for those who were taking the case against him.  The provisions of that Act were, therefore, of limited application.</P>
      <P>In the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, also vouched to warranty by the Minister on Second Reading, of the three cases in which the accused person would have to discharge the onus, one was, again, where a dispute arose as to whether the duties had actually been paid; the second case was: if the goods had been unlawfully imported, whether there were circumstances which he alone could show which would change the <i>prima facie</i> conclusion to be drawn from the facts; and the last case had reference to the place from which the goods were brought.  Again, that was only a very limited shifting of the onus in respect of a question to which the accused person would be easily able to provide an answer and to which the State could not given an answer.  This section goes so far beyond that that I do not think the earlier Acts can be used to justify it as a principle which is accepted and recognised in law.  If you pass this section as it is now, you are going to get a great many more convictions and you are going to get your convictions more easily.  You are also going to put innocent people in a position in which it will be very difficult for them to clear themselves, and you are probably going to get innocent people convicted.  The question for the House is whether it is more important that the Revenue Commissioners should get 100 per cent. convictions in guilty cases at the expense of also convicting some innocent people, or whether the Revenue Commissioners, if they get a reasonably high proportion of convictions, can do without getting the full 100 per cent., and ensure that no innocent person is likely to meet with the pains and penalties provided by the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1970" /> It has always been regarded as a principle of the law that it is much better that a few people who have misbehaved themselves should escape punishment rather than that a person who has not done so should be wrongfully subjected to any fine, imprisonment or other form of animadversion.</P>
    <P>That, roughly speaking, is the question for the House, and I respectfully suggest to it that the attempt to get this 100 per cent. efficiency is a mistaken one in all government.  All you can do is to make a thing difficult; you cannot make it impossible.  You will not, as has been remarked by Senator Sweetman, make it impossible even by this Bill.  What you are going to do, I think, is to put a greater premium on the desperate corruption which already exists.  I do not want to deal with that matter on this section, but I shall deal with it at a later stage.  I think, however, that the effect of this will be that goods will be dearer, that the smuggling will be more difficult, that there will be greater bribery, and that that widespread corruption which, unfortunately, prevails throughout a great portion of the counties along the Northern boundary will probably become much worse, because the more difficult you make a thing the more profitable it will become and the greater incentive you give to underhand dealings.  I need only cite for that the case of the Prohibition Acts in America, and also the old smuggling laws in England at the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century.  The amount of corruption that they produced was staggering, and finally the rates had to be reduced so as not to give the incentive. I think that the effect of this will be that you will make it more difficult, that you will provide a greater incentive, and that you will create more of that underground traffic which at the present moment, in my humble belief, is doing more moral harm around the Border than any other thing that we can imagine.</P>

      <P>I had occasion to be up there a short time ago in connection with a series of cases, and <Col N="1971" /> I had the opportunity of speaking to a number of people of influence, both in the legal profession and outside it. The picture painted to me by police inspectors, solicitors, clergy, and so on, of the extent to which the whole moral tone of the community had been lowered by this smuggling was staggering, because not merely was it that the actual smugglers themselves were able to bribe extensively, but I was also told&mdash;I cannot vouch for this, but I had it on what I consider good authority&mdash;that as a result of the bribery and corruption of officials concerned with this matter, the effect on the ordinary members of the community, who saw people getting rich by these methods, who saw all this winking at the law going on, and who saw a regular, carefully worked-out scheme of corruption, extending from high up to low down, was that in connection with the ordinary criminal law the offender felt that he was doing nothing wrong.  He said, in effect: &ldquo;If these people who are so respectable and who occupy such positions are making money by indulging in such a widespread system of bribery and corruption and the subornation of evidence, then, surely, there is nothing wrong in my stealing a few spark-plugs, or something like that.&rdquo;  What I feel strongly is that we should get public opinion on our side in this matter, and we shall not get public opinion on our side if we create a state of affairs in which a person may be convicted because he is not able to discharge the onus of proof of his innocence.  Therefore, I feel that this is a section that I have to oppose as a whole, because I am apprehensive that, although it will certainly bring in more money and get more convictions, its long-term results may be very disadvantageous so far as the moral fibre of the people of this country is concerned.</P>

      <P>In connection with Section 4, I did not put in any amendment <Col N="1972" /> to this section on the last occasion, but I raised the matter on the Second Reading.  I did not put in an amendment to the section because it is very difficult for me to do so.  I subscribe, generally, to what Senator Kingsmill Moore has put so very well to the House.  Any of us who live in that area close to the Border know quite well what is happening and, in fact, we are really staggered at the degree to which the moral fibre of the people as a whole&mdash;perhaps, I should not say, the people as a whole, but a limited number of them&mdash;are having their moral fibre sapped by the traffic that is going on.  We all know that that traffic is taking place.  We see even fairly respectable people engaging in it, and one comes to the conclusion&mdash; the only conclusion that one can come to&mdash;that it pays them very well to engage in it, and that they can only succeed to the extent to which they are prepared to pay other people, and pay them very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the real problem, and the difficulty is for the law to get its hands on the people who are breaking the law.  Sometimes, one suspects that the law itself may not be as clean as is essential in order to deal with a traffic of this kind, and there again you have a difficult problem, but what I want to point out is that in this particular section you are dealing with the case of a customs official coming to a farm, and that is what I am specially concerned about.  He may request any person, &ldquo;in whose possession or control or on or in whose land or premises or in the immediate vicinity of whose land or premises the goods are found, to give him all information&rdquo;, and so on. Further down, it mentions that he must give &ldquo;the name and address of the owner of the goods, the purpose for which the goods are at the place where they are found, the intended disposition of the goods, and whether the goods are intended to be exported&rdquo;. Then you come on down to where an officer of Customs and Excise, when he requests any person, in whose possession or control, and so on, such goods are found, may demand that that person &ldquo;shall forthwith, to the best of his knowledge or ability, so give such information or produce such document, <Col N="1973" /> as the case may be, and that if he fails or refuses to do so, or gives any information which is false or misleading, he shall be guilty of an offence&rdquo;, and shall be subject to certain penalties.  I do not quite know how that is going to be dealt with, but I do urge on the Minister that there is a very real problem there.</P>
    <P>The people who are going to export butter, sugar, textiles, or the like, out of the country will not leave them in my field for any length of time.  I do not happen to be along the Border, but I know enough to know that such goods will not be left in my field for a week, and if a customs officer comes upon these goods in my field, in the evening or the dark of the night, it is more than likely that they would only have been there for about half an hour and, probably, in a field far away from the residence of the owner of the farm.  The customs official may not know how long the goods have been there, and he will come to the owner of the farm and request information from him.  Now, let us suppose that it is my case and that I were quite truthful and said that I did not know how those goods came to be on my farm; the customs official may not be satisfied with that statement, and then you have all these pains and penalties imposed upon you. Any person like myself who has seen people grow rich on this traffic, who has seen people buying farms who had not, as we say, three halfpence, on smuggling&mdash;they are taking in and they are sending out, of course&mdash;knows that these people are like chain shops in the big cities.  They have agents scattered all over and it is very easy for an agent to place a farmer in a position of very considerable difficulty.  If I am unpopular enough with some of them and if I am not prepared to accommodate them, it is on my land that the goods will be kept.  They will be left there deliberately and the customs authorities will then be sent to visit me.  I cannot find a solution for the problem but I urge on the Minister that there is a very great danger there.  I think that the Minister should look into the matter.</P>
    <P>I know that there are a great many <Col N="1974" /> people living along the Border who do not smile on this traffic and who are not making any contribution to it, one way or another.  When one sees that butter can be purchased in a Cavan creamery in a legitimate way and the next thing one knows is that it has got into this illicit traffic, with very considerable annoyance to people whose names may be introduced, one cannot but feel that there is a necessity for tightening up the regulations, and yet if that tightening up is going to be carried out at the expense of responsible and respectable citizens, I think your last position is going to be worse than your first.  I suggest that the Minister might look into the matter to see if it is not possible to do something on less stringent lines than are provided for here.</P>

      <P>I am going only to call the attention of the House to the fact that this section also transgresses a very old principle of criminal law, though not as old as the principle to which I referred earlier.  It is only about 100 years old, which is a comparatively young age with legal principles.  It always has been a principle that not only should a man not be forced to incriminate himself but that he should be protected by warning from incriminating himself. Undoubtedly questions of this nature will get you information; so would torture.  Torture would get quite a lot of information but if you force a person into a position in which he has to give information in order to get out of that position, he is going to say something in which it is just as likely he will protect the real criminal and incriminate somebody who is less in a position to round on him for the action he has taken.  Accordingly, on these grounds, I recommend the House to be very slow in passing this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am impressed by the case that Senator Kingsmill Moore <Col N="1975" /> has made on this and on previous sections. By nature and inclination I am inclined not to be harsh or drastic, or to get people into trouble or to lead people into trouble, but the unfortunate fact is that Senator Kingsmill Moore mentioned in Section 3 that the thing we have to do is to get public opinion behind us.  The unfortunate point is that we have not succeeded in doing that so far as smuggling is concerned.</P>
      <P>I have come across people belonging to professions that should have a particular regard for law and order, who, to my own knowledge, have delighted in the fact that themselves and their friends have succeeded in evading the law in regard to goods coming into and going out of the country.  When you find such types, it is not to be wondered at that the commonalty is of the same mind.  I do not know how we are going to proceed to eradicate that kind of feeling of pleasure that exists in getting under or over or around the customs laws.</P>
      <P>It does not apply alone to the people along the Border, the people who have profited most out of it, and who, as Senator Baxter said, have become rich as a result of the traffic. One hopes that we will one day see an end to it, and that is by the abolition of the Border.  How that is to come about is beyond me to say.  I do not see any solution at present.  But that would end the incentive there is to evade the Customs Acts.  Another thing that may modify it is the end of the emergency.  At the end of the emergency, let us hope, those goods and commodities, of kinds that are scarce now, will in the ordinary course become more plentiful, and there will not be profit to be gained out of smuggling; but it is a fact that enormous vested interests have grown up in the smuggling traffic.  That is there &mdash;unfortunately it is true&mdash;and we have made laws here in the Oireachtas which we find are being evaded every day of the week.  I take it that the Oireachtas lays the responsibility on the particular Minister concerned to see that the law is carried out, and I am asking the House to give me more efficient implements in the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1976" /> That is all I am asking.  I dislike interfering to any extent that is not, by reason of the times, necessary, with the private individual in his liberties. We have to do it in a variety of ways, in a great many things, particularly in the customs laws which, in a very drastic way, sometimes infringe personal liberty.  But really, I do not see any other way out of the section and I think some of the arguments used by Senator Baxter in favour of the restriction of the powers of the Minister and his staff could equally be used against him.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 36, to delete the words &ldquo;or conveyance&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is for the purpose of drawing attention to a particular sub-section. I have some doubt as to whether the Minister or his advisers appreciate exactly the effect of the section as I interpret it.  So far as the first sub-section is concerned, it is perfectly clear and correct in my view, but the second sub-section is a mandatory sub-section for forfeiture of the carriage&mdash;using the word &ldquo;carriage&rdquo; as a noun&mdash;of the exported goods.  I will give the Minister an example.</P>
      <P>Suppose that a man came to the horse fair which was held yesterday in Naas and bought a farm horse at the fair.  In present circumstances, it is forbidden to export a farm horse.  He tells the agent of Córas Iompair Eireann that he has a farm in County Cavan, and he asks Córas Iompair to send the horse to him on a railway wagon to his land.  The horse is sent up and subsequently is exported.  It appears to me that the railway wagon which carried the horse from Naas to Cavan must be, not may be, forfeited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is the effect of the section, I think that the Minister will agree that it is not as it should be.  I am entirely with him that where a man is trying to drive something over the Border that not only should the goods be forfeited but also the cart or other means of carrying them.  In this section, however, <Col N="1977" /> it would seem that the railway wagon or other vehicle used for the conveyance of goods at any time in the State up to the time the goods are exported is liable to confiscation.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which is going to arise very much in the future in cases of export.  It is not going to arise in cases of import, and it does appear to me that, as the sub-section is framed, it is not going to carry out the intentions of the Minister.  I suggest that between now and the Report Stage of the Bill, the Minister should look into it.</P>
    <P>I will give the Minister another example.  Suppose I was to get a stone of sugar, put it into a box and label it as something else&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>You cannot export tea at the present time.  Suppose I label it as a bundle of papers and that at the Border it was discovered that it was not in fact what I had alleged it to be.  Very probably, the stone of sugar would be forfeited, but, by the section the Revenue Commissioners would be empowered to forfeit the wagon in which it was carried.  It appears to me that some discretionary power will have to be left in the hands of the justice so that it will not be mandatory on him to order the confiscation of the conveyances, as is provided at the present time.</P>

      <P>This section is on all fours with the section relating to smuggling inwards in the Act which has been so often quoted here&mdash;the Act of 1876.  The deletion of the word &ldquo;conveyance&rdquo; would restrict the efficacy of the clause to one class of offence, that in which illegal exportation has been successfully effected. Seizures in such cases are naturally of infrequent occurrence; the majority of seizures are, of course, effected before the goods have actually been spirited out of the State, and the inclusion of the word &ldquo;conveyance&rdquo; will enable customs officials to deal with offenders making ready to export or caught in the act of attempted exportation. It is to these offences that regard must chiefly be had, and amendment must render the sub-clause <Col N="1978" /> nugatory is therefore quite unacceptable. That is the view of my advisers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 6 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>6. (1)  A list of goods, the export of which is prohibited shall be available at every customs station where passengers' personal luggage is examined.</P>
      <P>(2) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Act no person shall be guilty of an attempt to export prohibited goods if such goods were in his personal luggage when leaving the State and were produced to an officer of customs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is an effort on my part to put down what I believe is the usual practice but what rightly or wrongly I am informed has no statutory value at all.  Most travellers have to bring goods with them, the exportation of which is illegal.  I do it myself regularly.  Not being a nudist, it is necessary to wear clothes, to put it mildly.  It is recognised by custom and also by the officers, though I think it has no statutory effect, that a certain quantity of clothes are necessary for people staying a reasonable time in England or elsewhere, and they will be allowed to be brought as long as they are produced to the officials and no harm is done.  The Minister may ask why am I raising this.  I say I am <Col N="1979" /> raising it because the Minister is bringing in an Act which, to the best of my information, provides penalties and raises difficulties that never existed before.  I ask that the Minister indicate to the travelling public that they be dealt with in the same way as before, provided they show what they have got by opening their bags.  I do not think the Minister could give me a list of prohibited articles.  I could give a pretty long one from memory, but I am sure I would leave out something.  It is not possible, unless a list is given, to know exactly what is prohibited but, at the present time, the customs officials deal courteously and quite firmly with people who bring in an excess quantity of goods.  Sometimes, people bring in a few things but not to any large extent.  I have been asked why I had not a half a pound of tea and I said because I had not any friends. They said: &ldquo;We would have allowed it to you.&rdquo;  As we are bringing in a terribly drastic measure, with no safeguards for the individual, and in which every safeguard is provided for the Revenue Commissioners, I think it would not be unreasonable to put down what should be the practice and, at any rate, I should like a public assurance from the Minister that the practice is going to be continued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first section, I think that has been always the practice.  The list is a long one at present and there are frequent changes in it, I understand.  It is kept up to date from week to week, if not from day to day, and every person in the case of passage from the Border is supplied with copies of the list.  They do not always read them.  It is the custom to ask them have they any of the things on the list and the list is so long that very few people look at it.  It has been suggested to the Revenue authorities that it would be wise to put up a board and print them on it.  There are so many changes that that has not been found desirable or feasible.  There is a list printed with additions written in almost from day to day and every one can see that if they want to do so.  All are asked if <Col N="1980" /> they have any of these articles and if they wish they can ask what articles and the list is given them.  Usually, they do not bother.  People who are constantly going backwards and forward, probably know.  I have not much experience.  I do not think I have crossed the Border more than four times since it was erected and, when I crossed the Border, as luck would have it, I was not questioned.  I suppose my face was my guarantee.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister has completely misunderstood the amendment.  It is divided into two parts.  The second part is the only part I am concerned with.  It was only in order to make the second part reasonable that it seemed necessary to provide that there should be a list.  In other words, I do not want each list carried over to the railway carriage but, when a person so requires, he should be able to get it.  What I would ask is that, notwithstanding the provisions of the Bill, you would not be regarded as committing an offence if you produced anything that is on the list given to you.</P>

Even where goods are on the prohibited list, where they are in small quantities, where they can be used by persons on the job, cigarettes, cigars&mdash; I do not know about alcohol&mdash;I think they would be allowed to take a small quantity.  I think it is generally agreed people are reasonably facilitated by the Revenue officials.  They ask people: &ldquo;Have you got such and such articles&rdquo;, and if they tell they will be at all times facilitated.  I have <Col N="1981" /> not much experience but certainly, in the old days, I used to travel back and forward and I think the same custom prevails.  If you declared what you had you were reasonably treated.  The same tradition is, I think, carried on now.  It is only when people conceal things and get nervous in their attitude that the customs officers get suspicious. They are allowed to take small quantities, like the half a pound of tea Senator Douglas mentioned. That would be allowed, and I think it is a reasonable attitude.</P>

I only mention that because it was mentioned by Senator Douglas.  Once they are facilitated, I think discretion should be allowed to them, and I would rather not have down in black and white what that discretion should be.  But if they are treated reasonably, I would like them to have a free hand.</P>

      <P>(3) Any judge of the Circuit Court may, in his discretion, on an appeal under this section, direct that the complainant pay the cost incurred by the respondent in connection with such appeal (including any costs incurred by him on any reference to the Supreme Court as provided by the next following section).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Minister feels that this amendment is not necessary, as a Circuit Court judge has already power to grant costs.  I cannot see how that arises, though I have not got the recent Supreme Court judgement. <Col N="1982" /> I understand that the position was that the court held that a prosecution in a revenue case was a criminal offence. An appeal by the State from a criminal offence does not exist, unless and until this section is enacted. I cannot, therefore, quite see how the question of costs on appeal can be covered by existing law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <P>I am advised that costs can, at the discretion of the judge, be awarded to or against the State in a customs appeal to the Circuit Court from the decision of the District Court.  There is, therefore, no case for making provision as proposed. As regards the proposal in relation to costs incurred by the respondent on a reference to the Supreme Court arising out of an application by him or by the complainant under clause 10 of the Bill, it would clearly not be competent for a judge of the Circuit Court to make an order affecting costs arising in a matter to be determined in the Supreme Court.  The consensus of legal opinion is that the Supreme Court has full jurisdiction as regards costs and this proposal is, accordingly, unnecessary.</P>

      <P>I confess I am not satisfied with the optimism of the Minister expressed in this section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This Act shall continue in force until the 31st March, 1950, and shall then expire&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be much more optimistic about the Border going than the Minister. Frankly, I think that that is a confession we ought not to put into an Act of the Oireachtas.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be much wiser policy for us to re-enact this measure annually, if necessary.  I think that this is a line we ought not to pursue&mdash;to put in a confession of our belief and conviction that these conditions are going to continue for the next five years.  That is a very long period.  I should hope that the atmosphere would change and that the prospects are much brighter than the Minister visualises.  I am not going to raise any hares on that.  I disagree with <Col N="1984" /> the Minister in making a public declaration that the Border is going to be there for the next five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Minister for Finance be requested to take steps for the revision of income-tax law and practice with a view to general simplification and the removal of inequities in the application of that law and practice; and, in particular, the amendment of such statutory provisions or rules relating to income-tax or corporation profits tax as may restrict industrial and other development calculated to provide increased employment after the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always been of the opinion that the functions of a Second Chamber should not be confined to the revision of Bills sent to it.  One useful function should be the general discussion of current problems in which the people are interested.  The object of such discussions should not be so much criticism of the Government as the ventilation of views and opinions which might influence future legislation.  I think it will be agreed that there is a great deal of interest in the subject of this resolution at the present time and a growing belief that the existing system of the taxation of income, more especially as applied to business profits, needs revision and substantial amendment.  There is a genuine fear that, unless some substantial changes are made, the future development of this country may be seriously retarded by our system of taxation.  It is always a bad policy to kill or even to injure the goose that lays the golden eggs. It would be bad policy to allow taxation to prevent the growth of our national assets, which in themselves <Col N="1985" /> would provide a future yield in taxes or which would reduce national expenditure and thus lessen the necessity for taxation.</P>
    <P>At the outset, there are three things which I want to make clear to the House.  First, I want to emphasise that nothing that I may say should be taken as a criticism of the administration of income-tax or corporation profits tax. I have confidence in the integrity and fairness of the departments under the care of the Revenue Commissioners. No human institution can be perfect and, doubtless, mistakes are made in these departments from time to time, but I am satisfied that a genuine effort is made to give a fair deal to every taxpayer without fear or favour.  By a fair deal, I mean as fair as the law or recognised practice allows it.  There are inequities, but I believe that these are inequities of the law rather than of administration.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I want to make it clear that I am not against the principle of a tax on income.  I believe that individuals whose income is above the average, or which enables them to enjoy advantages denied to the majority of the people, have no cause to grumble if the State expects them to surrender a good part of that income for the common good.  Thirdly, I wish to point out that, in this resolution, I am not raising the question of the rate of income-tax.  I am not discussing whether it should be 7/6, as it is at present, or 10/- as it is in Great Britain and Northern Ireland or 3/6 as it was when a different Party held the reins of Government.  That is a matter which can be and should be discussed when the annual Finance Bill is under consideration, and I hope that it will not be made the subject of this debate.  I admit that some of my arguments would lose their force if the income-tax were 6d. or 1/- in the £, but this is so unlikely to occur that it may be ignored.  I am assuming the continuance of income-tax at a high rate, but I do not propose to discuss what that rate should be nor to discuss the general question of the total taxation which this country can stand without injury.  Many people fear that we have adopted a rate of national expenditure which is above our capacity, <Col N="1986" /> but that is not the question I am raising here to-night.  My point is that whatever our total expenditure may be, it is of the greatest importance that it should be applied wisely and equitably, and that a real effort should be made to avoid taxation which will, in effect, reduce our future taxable capacity.</P>
    <P>It is a long time since a debate took place in either House on the general question of income tax and corporation profits tax.  Discussions take place on certain aspects of these taxes when the annual Finance Bill is before the Oireachtas and these debates are, generally, on Party lines.  The principle of a tax on income and a tax on corporation profits is not a Party question, though Parties may differ as to the rate of taxation.  Every Party, as far as I know, is in favour of income tax.  Both the larger parties have demonstrated their belief in it when in power.  To my mind, it is impossible to debate the question freely and adequately on a Finance Bill, for several reasons.  In the first place, the annual Finance Bill is based on the Budget and a Government must carry it or resign.  It is therefore obvious that only trifling amendments will ever be accepted.  In the second place, it can readily be seen that any substantial changes in income tax law might alter the estimated yield of taxation and, therefore, such changes, if made, could not be made operative at once without upsetting the financial arrangements for the year.  Even if a miracle were to occur and I were to convince the Minister for Finance of the soundness of my arguments, I am pretty sure that he would say that it is too late to make drastic changes affecting the Budget for 1945.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>You never can tell. Taken as a whole, I think that my suggestions, if they would not bring in more revenue this year, might bring in more revenue eventually.  I propose, roughly, to divide my argument in favour of this motion into two parts.  The first part will be a plea for a complete revision of income tax law and practice which would, probably, <Col N="1987" /> take a year or two, at least, and the second part will deal with various matters which I consider require urgent adjustment and which I believe could be dealt with without any fundamental change in the present law and practice.</P>
      <P>A very large number of citizens regard income-tax law and practice as something so difficult and so mysterious as to be beyond the understanding of the ordinary person, and that it must be left to the trained specialists.  This point of view is understandable, but I do not share it, and I feel that it would be a good thing if it were studied more carefully, especially by those engaged in business.  It is not easy adequately to define &ldquo;income-tax&rdquo; as we know it at present.  It is an annual tax and is generally supposed to be a tax on the annual income received by the taxpayer, but it is also chargeable on amounts which the taxpayer does not actually receive, but which he is deemed by law to have received.</P>
      <P>The British Income-tax Act of 1918 still remains the principal Act dealing with income-tax in Eire.  It is a consolidation of earlier British Acts, and contains the rules for the assessment of tax under a number of heads or schedules as they are called.  Various amendments have been made by British Finance Acts prior to 1922, and by Irish Finance Acts since then, but the Act of 1918 still remains the Principal Act.  It is an Act which, according to my legal friends, has proved extraordinarily difficult to interpret, and it cannot be assumed that the same word is used in any two places with exactly the same meaning.  Its interpretation depends to a considerable extent on a large number of reported cases, and a student of income-tax law has to spend a lot of time in the study of case law.  In addition there has grown up what is known as income-tax &ldquo;practice,&rdquo; which is controlled and regulated by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Different methods of assessing the tax are applied according to the source from which the income is derived. The financial year is from April 6th in one year to April 5th in the <Col N="1988" /> next, and in general the tax payable for the financial year is assessed on the income of the preceding financial year.  But there are quite a number of exceptions which are often rather bewildering to the ordinary taxpayer.</P>
    <P>One of those, to which I will refer later, is the case of new businesses, employments and professions.  The current year instead of the previous year is the basis of assessment for income from interest, annuities and dividends which are taxed at source, and also for income deemed to arise from the ownership of houses and lands charged under Schedule.  &ldquo;A&rdquo; or deemed to arise from the occupation of lands for husbandry and charged under Schedule &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the House and to the Government that the time has come when we should take steps to plan a system of taxation on personal income and on profits of trade, whether agricultural, industrial, or distributive. which has been devised to suit our own needs and the special conditions operating in this country.  Although we may have much respect for the traditions which lie behind our present taxing system, we cannot ignore the fact that it was devised largely for conditions in another country and that very great changes have taken place in this country since the Principal Act was passed 27 years ago.</P>
    <P>A leading accountant told me a short time ago that the present system, before it had all the complexities of corporation profits tax, excess corporation profits tax, excess surtax and children's allowances tagged on to it, was on the whole not too difficult. What may be not too difficult for an expert may be, none the less, very difficult for the ordinary man or woman who has to pay the tax.  I suggest the appointment of a commission which would be asked to recommend a system of taxation on personal income and on business profits which would suit Irish conditions and which would give a total yield similar to that obtained at present from income-tax and corporation profits tax.  The commission should be asked to consider whether it would be practicable to differentiate between the profits which go simply to add to the private wealth of individuals <Col N="1989" /> and profits which go to the development of trade or industry in this country which will increase employment so that the former may be taxed at a higher rate than the latter.</P>
    <P>One of the first questions to be considered by such a commission would be that of general simplification.  It is, I think, a principle of just and equitable taxation that it should be as easy as possible for the taxpayer to ascertain his actual liability.  This is particularly so in the case of a tax payable on income.  A great deal of misery has been caused by persons spending or undertaking liabilities in excess of their income.  This is not infrequently the result of a belief that their income-liability is less than it actually is. Every person with a taxable income, except where the tax is deducted at source, should lay aside sufficient to meet his tax when it becomes due. How can he do so accurately if he does not know the amount?  A person with a large income in excess of his needs can easily save enough to meet any eventualities, but by far the larger number of income-tax payers find it difficult enough to make ends meet after providing for their essential needs and those of their dependents.</P>
    <P>A similar argument may be used in relation to the profits of a company, the main difference being that the tax payable by a company is often more difficult to ascertain.  This is especially so since the last Budget.  A company should provide for its income-tax and corporation profits tax before paying a dividend or embarking on expenditure on improvement or for the purpose of business extension.  It is very unsatisfactory if it has to wait a year or more before ascertaining its liability. I do not think that a commission would have any great difficulty in making proposals which would simplify income-tax so far as the ordinary individual is concerned.</P>
    <P>My first suggestion in that direction would be that all income-tax payable by individuals should be assessed on the income actually received by the taxpayer during a period of 12 calendar months.  I would prefer that period to be January 1st to December 31st in every year, but the exact dates <Col N="1990" /> are not very important.  It is comparatively easy for the average individual to estimate the income he is likely to receive in any 12 months, deduct the well-recognised allowances and lay aside from his income enough to pay the tax, when due.  There is a great deal to be said for the &ldquo;pay as you earn&rdquo; system recently introduced into Great Britain as a war measure, and I am inclined to think that it has come to stay in that country, and may even be extended in its scope.  It was not popular at first amongst employers, but I have been told that, in practice, they have not found it as difficult as they anticipated.  Personally, I have no idea whether or not it would be practicable to introduce some similar plan here but, if it were, it is a matter well worth consideration. It is not so popular amongst the taxpayers, because it has succeeded in getting in more taxes, but, for that reason, it might be popular with the Minister.</P>
    <P>The next suggestion that I would like to make is that an effort should be made to set out in an Act exactly what is &ldquo;income&rdquo; for income-tax purposes. This is not, I think, to be found in any Act or even in a collection of Acts, and I may be told by the Minister that I am asking for the moon.  I find it difficult, however, to see how any real simplification can take place without some serious effort to provide a statutory definition of &ldquo;income&rdquo; for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>I am also strongly of the opinion that there ought to be a change in the method of assessment of new and discontinuing businesses, employments and professions.  This would not, I be lieve, cause any administrative difficulty, if all assessments on individuals were assessed on the actual income received or deemed to have been received in a financial year.  At present, I am satisfied that it causes a certain amount of unfairness, with consequent dissatisfaction.  An employee who receives an increase in remuneration in any year will in most cases pay his tax in that year on the previous year's income, but if by any chance the increase of remuneration carries with it some element of promotion, especially <Col N="1991" /> if his work is called by a new name he may find that he is assessed on his actual year's income.  Thus, two employees in the same business may be treated differently although both may receive exactly the same increase, the reason being that one is regarded as having a new source of income and the other not.  It also works in an unsatisfactory manner in relation to fees payable to directors which are voted at an annual meeting of a company held usually months after the end of the trading year.  A small director's fee is often split up and taxed as for two earlier &ldquo;financial&rdquo; years by means of additional assessments with a consequent adjustment of surtax if payable. This causes a certain amount of trouble both to the tax authorities and to the taxpayer, which appears to me to be unnecessary.  Why not charge the tax on directors' fees in the year in which the fee is actually received?</P>
    <P>In my opinion Schedule A taxation also requires revision.  As it stands at present it is inequitable as a tax on income.  If the taxpayer receives his income from rents, I do not see why he should not pay on his actual income after deducting all expenses necessary to the maintenance of the property. It is, however, when Schedule A tax is levied on the person who occupies his own house that it appears to me to operate most unfairly.</P>
    <P>One man I know paid £2,000 for a modern house valued at £40.  Another paid approximately the same sum for an old house with a valuation of £80. The latter has to pay twice the income-tax that the former has to pay. Both expended the same amount of money, and I think in equity should pay the same tax if it is to be regarded as income-tax.  It is well known that the valuation of a house is not a guide to its market value.  For reasons, which I have never been able to understand, a Fianna Fáil Government decided to charge income-tax on five-fourths of the valuation, thereby increasing the inequalities which exist.</P>
    <P>Another subject which seems to me to require examination is the system <Col N="1992" /> under which repairs to buildings used for business purposes are allowed as an expense but new buildings are regarded as capital expenditure.  I have no quarrel with the allowances made for repairs to business premises which are usually measured on a reasonable basis.  In normal times every encouragement is given to companies to keep their premises in good repair. It seems to me, however, that it would be in the public interest to encourage new building, especially in cities or towns where there is a very large number of very old buildings.  It is desirable that our cities should be gradually rebuilt and it would be good policy to encourage privately-owned companies to do this work.  At present there is a very great temptation to keep on repairing old buildings as long as they will stand and in many cases the money spent on repairs over a number of years would have paid for a new and up-to-date building.  It seems to me that it would be wise to allow for the amortisation of sums spent on new buildings which replace old ones over a period of say 50 years.  This may not be an urgent question as supplies will probably not be available for an extensive replacement of old business premises for several years.  I think, however, it should be carefully considered in the near future.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the method of taxing business profits in which I consider that there is the greatest need for change, in order to meet Irish conditions. It has seemed to me for a long time that there ought to be a clear distinction between the tax payable on the income of individuals and the tax payable on profits of a trade or industry which are not paid out to any individual by way of salary, fees, dividends or share of profits.</P>
    <P>All taxes paid by a company engaged in business, whether that business be the production of some commodity or distribution to the consumer, are part of the costs of the operation of the business.  The tax will be passed on to the consumer, if this can be done, with the result that it is spread over all the customers of the business.  In some cases, where a company carries <Col N="1993" /> on both home and export trade, the tax can only be passed on to the home customer, as any attempt to increase the export prices would simply kill the trade.  In other cases, where there is no protection and a highly competitive market, it is impossible to pass on the tax.  Where the tax cannot be wholly or partially passed on, the financial position of the concern may be weakened, and it will probably find it difficult to provide adequate reserves for depreciation, and will certainly be unable to lay aside profits for use in future development.</P>
    <P>In this connection it is essential to bear in mind that income-tax is payable by a company, not on its real profits as they would be measured on a normal commercial basis, but on its &ldquo;assessable&rdquo; profits which is often a very different thing indeed.  I admit that it is not always easy to say what are the real profits of a company.  As a general rule, however, I think it may be said that the real profit in any year is the balance of the income over expenditure after provision has been made for annual depreciation, and for the amortisation of all money spent on assets which will be used up in the making of profits.</P>
    <P>If a company fails to make adequate provision for wasting assets and pays out annually, whether in profit distribution or in taxation, more than it can properly afford to do, it will reduce the value of its capital assets, and will sooner or later find itself in financial difficulties.  No well-managed company would be satisfied to confine its reserves to the amount allowed for wear and tear for the purpose of income-tax assessment.  On every sum placed to reserve in excess of the standard rates of wear and tear, the State forces the company to pay 8/9 in the £ (not including excess corporation profits tax). In small companies with an assessable profit of £2,500 or less the amount is only 7/6.  This seriously reduces the total that can be placed to reserve, to the detriment of many of our industries.</P>
    <P>The stated policy of the Government is industrial and agricultural efficiency.  We plan not only to supply, <Col N="1994" /> as far as practicable, the needs of our own people but also to export our products. The Government says that it is determined to reduce the cost of living after the war.  I am convinced that it will fail in all these aims if it fails to realise that present taxation on productive effort is too high.  The public generally believes that trade and industry, which has not made excess profits, pays 7/6 income-tax on its profits plus 2/- corporation profits tax on the profits in excess of £2,500.  This works out at approximately 43¾ per cent. which, having regard to present high taxation, would not seem unreasonable if it were true.  Actually the tax payable is at a much higher rate, and I believe that if figures were available to show the average percentage of real profits paid out in tax, the public generally would recognise that industry is too highly taxed for a country which has only commenced to develop its industrial resources.  My contention is that income tax law should be revised to provide for the measurement of business profits as near as practicable to true profits.  If and when this is done, the Finance Minister will have to consider what tax he desires to impose.  He will then be able to decide to what extent he considers it wise to take business profits for the State, but whatever percentage he demands he will know that it is a percentage of real profits.  At the present time I do not think he does know what percentage of real profits he is taking.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, I think that the time has come when the State should make a clear distinction between income which goes into the pockets of individuals and profits which are available for increasing the efficiency of our agriculture and our industry&mdash;which will increase employment and reduce the cost of the home-produced commodity.  The money made by a company may roughly be divided into two parts, one part which is paid to individuals whether as salaries, wages, fees or the distribution of profits.  The other part is retained in the business.  At present the State taxes the first part more lightly than the second part.  Both income tax and corporation profits tax are payable on <Col N="1995" /> the second part.  It is almost an encouragement to pay out money in salaries or dividends, rather than retain it in the business.  True, of course, there is a surtax on high incomes, but the proportion of surtax payers at the rate of 2/- in the £ (which is the rate of corporation profits tax) is relatively small.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that it would be wise national policy to encourage the keeping of profits in a business, as in the vast majority of cases this would gradually lead to a higher profit in the future with a greater yield to the State, and I think it would be wise to discourage the paying out of too much profit to individuals.  In particular, I think that expenditure on research and development should receive definite encouragement.</P>
    <P>I would very much like to see these problems considered by a commission consisting of experienced men.  Personally, I would favour the ultimate abolition of the British system of income-tax under which we work at present, and the substitution of two separate and distinct taxes, one an income-tax on the personal income which would be more or less on the lines of the present income-tax, and the other, a tax on trading profits which would be an entirely new tax and based on the amount which the State could take from industry or agriculture without injuring their efficiency, or their ability to give employment.</P>
    <P>I do not claim to be an expert, but I do know enough to realise that my proposal is not a simple one and that many difficulties would have to be overcome.  One of these is the taxation of business partnerships&mdash;another is the taxation of agricultural profits as distinct from the income of individuals engaged in agriculture.  Another difficulty which would arise is that of the taxation of capital appreciation which is exempt at present.  If profits retained in a business are taxed at a lower rate, it would almost certainly lead in come cases to an increase in the value of the capital which might be paid out to shareholders as bonus <Col N="1996" /> shares or in some other manner.  As this would be, in effect, payment of profit to individuals, some tax would have to be charged on such distributions. Personally, I do not see why casual profits made on the stock exchange should not be taxed.  If a man makes a few thousand pounds on Great Southern Railways or other shares the money he gets is just as good as that received by a salary or wage-earner, and I think the State is entitled to its share.  Of course, if you tax profits made on the realisation of capital you must also allow losses if they occur from realisation.</P>
    <P>There are many difficulties to be considered, but I do not think that they are unsurmountable.  If you are really satisfied with our present system of income-tax, then, by all means, do nothing.  If you admit that it requires change, then why not face up to it? We have tackled much greater problems in the last 20 years with a fair measure of success.</P>
    <P>Before leaving this part of my subject, I would like to point out that I have not included excess corporation profits tax as a subject for consideration by a commission because I understand that the Minister for Finance does not intend to continue this tax after the war.  To continue this tax in its present form, when the necessary supplies are available for increased trade, would be disastrous.  It is not a tax on profiteering.  It is a tax on any increased business over the pre-war standards.  If a company had excessive profits before the war it can continue these excessive profits without paying any excess corporation profits tax.  If a company had small profits or a small trade before 1939, it cannot better its position without paying 75 per cent. to the State.  I am, therefore, assuming that the Minister will resist all temptation to continue this tax in its present form after the war is over.</P>
    <P>If a commission is to be appointed, there should be no delay.  I think the first years after the war may well be exceedingly difficult, especially for those engaged in industry.  It would probably take a commission a year before a report could be prepared and <Col N="1997" /> probably another year before substantial changes could take effect.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the second part of my subject, i.e., amendments to the present law which could be made without any drastic change in the general system of taxation.  This applies to a greater or less degree to some of the suggestions I have made with regard to income-tax payable by individuals and I will not repeat them.  There are, however, one or two other suggestions that I would make.  I consider that the cost of travelling to and from the place of employment should be allowed as an expense deductible from income before tax is assessed.  Very few people with low incomes can choose their place of residence freely&mdash;they have to live wherever they can find a house at a rent they can pay.  Salaries and wages are becoming more and more standardised for the same work. An employee who lives miles from his work is usually paid the same as one who lives in the immediate neighbourhood, but his actual income is less.  He cannot earn his salary unless he gets to his work, and the cost of getting there is an expense essential to the earning of his income.</P>
    <P>It also seems to me that the allowance deductible for a child should operate from the date of birth instead of as at present in the first financial year after birth.  There is very heavy expense when a child is born, and the allowance is required at once.  This would cause a little trouble as assessments would have to be revised, but I think it would be worth the trouble.</P>
    <P>The immediate changes which I would urge on the Minister for Finance mostly relate to the taxation of business profits.  Pending the consideration of the larger questions which I have already dealt with, I think that some immediate steps should be taken which would somewhat case the situation in the early post-war period during which our industries may find themselves in a worse position than similar concerns in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, if no change is made.  Sooner or later after the end of the war in Europe supplies of raw materials and fuel will improve, and it is of the utmost importance that our trade and industry <Col N="1998" /> should be in a position to meet the anticipated demands, and also provide the maximum possible employment.</P>
    <P>In a letter to the Minister in November last, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce summed up the changes advocated by it as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  An all-over addition, not less favourable than has been granted in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, to the standard rates of wear and tear of plant and machinery.</P>
    <P>(2)  The necessity of granting obsolescence allowance where replacement does not occur.</P>
    <P>(3)  Allowances, by way of depreciation or otherwise, in respect of those wasting assets used in commercial activities, for which no allowance whatever is made at present.</P>
    <P>(4)  Revision of the present allowance of one-sixth of the Schedule A assessment in respect of factory buildings (if leasehold, revision might take place under (3).</P>
    <P>(5)  More equitable treatment of development and research expenditure, whether of a &ldquo;deferred revenue&rdquo; or &ldquo;capital&rdquo; nature, the cost of which at present invariably falls entirely on the proprietors without any tax relief.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a quotation from a letter sent to the Minister and circulated to its members by the chamber of commerce. The chamber of commerce did not specifically refer to the position of companies who, because of the emergency, have been unable to carry out repairs which are essential to the running of the business.  If these repairs could have been done they would have been allowed as an expense before computing income-tax, corporation profits tax, and excess corporation profits tax. The result is that many manufacturing companies have been assessed on fictitious profits, because they could not do essential repairs, and any reserves they made to provide for the carrying out of repairs after the emergency were not allowed for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>It is well known that the war has made the proper repair of machinery and plant impossible in very many <Col N="1999" /> cases, and the repairs which are necessary have accumulated to an alarming degree.  In some cases, companies have become liable to excess corporation profits tax which would not be so liable if they could have carried out adequate running repairs.  In these cases the State has collected 75 per cent. of what are really fictitious profits.  It may well be years after the war before the work can be done, and the Minister for Finance has more than once stated that excess corporation profits tax will not be continued after the emergency, so the companies may be unable to claim a refund of the excess corporation profits tax paid by them.</P>
    <P>The remedy for the situation is, surely, to allow companies to receive allowance for taxation purposes for all accrued charges of this nature, supported by full evidence which it will be possible to supply in all genuine cases.  The amount of all such allowances could be placed aside in the accounts of the companies concerned, and, if in any particular instances, it subsequently transpired that the whole amount of such allowances was not either utilised or required the unexpended portion could be brought back to taxation at the rates prevailing at the time when the allowances were made.</P>
    <P>I do not think that administrative difficulties of any serious nature should arise in the working out of this arrangement. The Revenue Commissioners would retain full powers of satisfying themselves that the claims put forward are fully authenticated.</P>
    <P>It is mainly with Great Britain that our manufacturers have to compete.  To have any reasonable hope for the future, industries in this country must expect to be allowed to survive the emergency period on at least a level basis with British industries.  Most British industries, owing to their participation in war production, must be keeping their plant and machinery at a fairly high level of efficiency, and in many cases they may come out of the present period better equipped than at <Col N="2000" /> the commencement.  It has already been announced that the British Government is giving full consideration to all post-war questions of wear and tear, obsolescence, and other allowances requisite to the encouragement and maintenance of industrial concerns.</P>
    <P>Irish industries will be faced with a very severe handicap, unless they are accorded at least as fair treatment in all matters of this kind, as compared with their British competitors, particularly as the only sound basis upon which Irish industry can be established must largely depend on its ability to compete as to efficiency and selling prices with industries of other countries operating under anything like comparable conditions.</P>
    <P>Most of the other immediate changes which I would advocate relate to last year's Finance Bill which contained provisions which have caused a number of genuine hardships which, in all fairness, require to be remedied.  The Minister was faithfully warned that these hardships and inequities would occur, both by members of the Oireachtas and by leading accountants, but he turned a deaf ear.  Certain persons had found methods of legally evading corporation profits tax and excess corporation profits tax, and he was determined to catch them, no matter how many hardships he inflicted in so doing&mdash;like the Customs Bill, I suppose.</P>
    <P>In particular, he made a special attack on subsidiary companies formed after May, 1941.  I would have been in agreement with him as far as excess corporation profits tax is concerned if he had been fair as between all companies, but he took the extraordinary step of allowing subsidiary companies to get away with a considerable part of their excess profits if they happened to make up their accounts to a date prior to January 1st, 1944.  This was, in my opinion, unfair.  The provisions of Sections 13 and 14 of the Finance Act of 1944 should have come into force on a fixed date, with a provision that the profits arising in an accounting period which ended after the fixed date would be apportioned between the part <Col N="2001" /> of the accounting period which was prior to that date and the part subsequent to that date.  This was the procedure adopted by the Minister when excess corporation profits tax was introduced and it was fair to all.</P>
    <P>The Minister also introduced into last year's Finance Bill the principle of retrospective taxation to an extent, as far as I know, never done before. Companies which had already made their distributions based on the tax law as it stood at the time found that they were liable for tax which they could not have anticipated.  This action was resented by every business man of my acquaintance.  It has caused considerable uneasiness as to the future and has made it exceedingly difficult to plan ahead.  Unless he makes it clear that he does not intend to continue the principle of retrospective taxation in future Finance Acts, I think the effect on our post-war development will be very bad.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should give some indication as to his attitude towards subsidiary companies which may be formed for the purpose of the extension of industry after the war.  Does he intend to continue the provisions of the 1944 Act in relation to corporation profits tax after excess corporation profits tax has been discontinued? At present any person who is a shareholder in one company cannot invest money in a new company without running the risk that his doing so would cause the new company to be regarded as a subsidiary.</P>
    <P>It also seems to me unfair that a company which is treated as a subsidiary and assessed jointly with the parent company for the purposes of corporation profits tax and excess corporation profits tax should be regarded as a new company for the purposes of income-tax.  When a company divided up its trade by forming a subsidiary company, I can easily see why the Minister decided to treat the two companies as one for the purposes of excess profits taxation.  To do so seemed to me to be fair except when the subsidiary company was formed to undertake new business not carried on previously by the parent company, but it was unfair to force such companies to pay, under <Col N="2002" /> the rules which apply to new companies, more income-tax than would have been paid if no subsidiary company had been formed.  This requires reconsideration, and in my opinion, the Minister should clear up this position in the next Finance Bill and make special provisions for new companies formed to carry on new business even though they may be owned wholly or in part by existing companies or shareholders in existing companies.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in which I profoundly differ from the attitude of the Government.  The Government shows its disapproval of employees becoming directors of companies in which they are employed and taking shares in such companies, by adding to the taxation of companies which permit this to occur.  I can understand the reasons for this action as regards excess profits taxation, though I believe a better method could have been found which would achieve a similar result.  But the Minister has not confined these provisions to excess corporation profits tax.  They apply also to corporation profits tax which is likely to continue after the war.  In my opinion, it is good that directors and managing directors should, where practicable, be appointed from the staffs of companies engaged in trade or industry, and that they should invest their savings in the businesses in which they work.  I therefore urge an amendment of the corporation profits tax provisions which are a bar to such action.  The provision that if a whole-time managing director owns more than 5 per cent. of the ordinary share capital the company must pay corporation profits tax on his salary in excess of £1,000 is unjustifiable and should be amended, especially in cases which are fairly common where a company is controlled by one person who owns more than half of the ordinary shares or who is a &ldquo;governing director&rdquo;. It being, therefore, clear that the director with his 5 per cent. would not have control of the company.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Finance Act of 1944 contains what I consider to be a very bad principle.  It gives autocratic powers to the Revenue Commissioners and makes it possible for them to disallow <Col N="2003" /> in tax computations expenditure which has been made by companies in the course of business.  They could, for instance, object to the appointment of a managing director or other employee on the grounds that the additional expense would avoid or reduce liability for corporation profits tax.  They could object to any increase of remuneration to an individual or other expenditure of any kind which would reduce liability to tax.  If this autocratic section had been confined to excess corporation profits tax and limited to the duration of the war, I would not be inclined to quarrel with it, as I recognise fully that it is very difficult to cover in an Act every possible method of evasion of excess profits taxation. But it applies to corporation profits tax and is apparently intended as a permanent piece of legislation.  I am sure that the Revenue Commissioners, to the best of their ability, will operate it fairly as between different companies and I am sure that they intend to act reasonably after due consideration.  But it is to my mind none the less a bad principle and it will make it more difficult for a company to estimate its tax liability.  It seems to me that this section when added to the danger of retrospective taxation will force companies to delay for a year or two before using any profits for business extension or improvement of any kind.  This will certainly not help the Minister for Industry and Commerce in his plans for post-war development.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by several leading accountants that quite a number of cases of real hardship have already arisen under the provisions of the 1944 Finance Act.  There has been considerable delay in the making of assessments and the effect of the Act is only now being realised, and unless the Minister takes steps to rectify the serious hardships which have arisen there will be pretty widespread dissatisfaction, especially in the case of companies which had no pre-war trade year and which are very adversely affected by Section 13, paragraph (1) (c) of the 1944 Act.  When that Act was before the Oireachtas last year, the Minister showed an unusual unwillingness <Col N="2004" /> to pay attention to representations which were made to him.  He is now one year older and I hope will see the error of his ways and act accordingly.</P>
    <P>Although no one likes high taxation, I think the average person feels no resentment if he feels that the taxation is fair as between all taxpayers in similar circumstances &mdash; when individuals or companies feel that they are inequitably treated there is strong resentment, and I know that this exists at the present time.</P>
    <P>This is a very large and important subject, and I have by no means exhausted the matters which I might have dealt with.  I hope, however, I have said enough to commend the resolution to the House and to provide subject matter for discussion.</P>
    <P>I have deliberately avoided dealing with income-tax in relation to agricultural profits, because I have no practical experience and because there are many members of this House very well qualified to deal with agricultural problems. I have made no reference to the amendment in the name of Senator Sir John Keane, because I am not competent to deal with it.  It is, of course, a matter for the House whether or not it should be embodied in the resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg formally to second the motion on the Order Paper in the name of Senator Douglas.  It is difficult to follow after the exhaustive survey of income-tax and corporation profits tax that he has given.  There are a few points to which I would like to refer.  The 1918 Act, which is the basic Act for the assessment of income-tax here, was merely a consolidation of 56 other different revenue Acts going back as far as the year 1842. It was a pure consolidation, not a codification, and, accordingly, we are thrown back in almost all instances to language and phrases that are both archaic and quite out of harmony with present times.  It heartens me to a certain extent that, in dealing with this motion, I have the knowledge that I will certainly get support from, at least, three members on the other side of the House.  We are supposed to be dealing with the revision of income-tax law.  That Act, in Section 237, gives <Col N="2005" /> the definition of an incapacitated person as &ldquo;an infant, married woman, idiot, lunatic or insane person&rdquo;.  I think it is time that, in our statute law, we did not continue that insult to the fair sex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come back to things that really matter, I want to deal with the practice under the existing income-tax code, and I want to be very clear that, in anything I may say with regard to the practice under the existing code, I am not in any way criticising the manner in which the existing law is carried out by the revenue officials.  A person who is liable to income-tax has at present to make one return of all his income.  That return goes to the inspector of the district in which he lives.  Notwithstanding the fact that he has made one return, he may get three, four or five different assessments, and he may have to check all these different assessments to make certain his various allowances have been given on each of the five assessments. An easy example to take is that of a man with small savings.  He may have these savings invested in houses in three different areas.  He is going to get three different assessments, although he is only asked by the revenue authorities to make one return.  I suggest that, in that case, it would be far more satisfactory for the State, as well as for the individual, if one composite assessment were issued by the inspector to whom the man in question made his individual return. The other inspectors could quite easily send their assessments to the inspector doing the business in that area and he could then issue one total, composite assessment which would save a great deal of trouble and difficulty.  The taxpayers concerned are often completely muddled by the number of assessments and by the fact that their allowances are sometimes given in one assessment and sometimes in another assessment. The Revenue authorities, of course, cannot grant any allowance unless a proper return of income has been furnished.  We know that, very frequently, people overlook their returns and that, accordingly, when an inspector of taxes issues an assessment under <Col N="2006" /> Schedule A, he may know that the particular taxpayer whom he is assessing is entitled to a personal allowance or an allowance for children but, because the individual concerned has forgotten to send in a return, the inspector is not allowed, as the law stands, to make the allowance in question.  I suggest to the Minister that, to deal with such a case, he should issue a direction that, in any case where an assessment is being sent out without allowances being granted, the inspector should add a note&mdash;it need only be a gummed slip of bright colour&mdash;calling the attention of the taxpayer to the fact that the assessment has been made without allowances because the Revenue authorities are not able to arrive at the amount of the allowances owing to the taxpayer omitting to make his return.</P>
    <P>That would be a fair reminder and, if the taxpayer still neglected to deal with the matter, I do not think that he could possibly have any grievance.  As the situation is at present, without any want of good will on the part of the inspector concerned, he is prohibited by law from granting the allowances until such time as a return has been made.  That question would not arise so often if the assessments were made as one, composite assessment by one inspector.  The same difficulty arises, to a lesser degree, in the case of surtax. I have never been able to understand why people should be asked to make a return of their income to the inspector of taxes for income-tax purposes and then to send what is, in effect, a copy of that return to the special commissioners, for surtax purposes.  The revenue authorities should be able to send the return from one Department to another, so that the same effect would be achieved by interDepartmental arrangement.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas did not refer deliberately to excess corporation profits tax.  Even though it may not come strictly within the ambit of this motion, there are a couple of points to which I should like to refer, arising out of the 1944 Act.  The restriction incorporated in Section 13 of last year's Act provides that, for excess corporation profits tax purposes, directors' remuneration should not exceed 3 per <Col N="2007" /> cent. of the paid-up capital of the company. That involves the system to which Senator Douglas referred&mdash;the remuneration of directors independent of the services rendered.  You might have a case of a mining company which would have a heavy capital outlay.  In that case, 3 per cent. on the heavy capital outlay would provide a very fair return.  At the other end of the scale, you might have a company which was providing a service&mdash;say an estate management company&mdash;where practically no capital outlay would be necessary but just the same amount of service and work would be demanded. Three per cent. in such a case would be totally and entirely inadequate. &ldquo;Capital&rdquo;, in the terms of last year's Act, does not include loan capital, nor does it include reserves.  It must be purely paid-up company capital, so to speak.  In that regard, I suggest to the Minister that it would be wiser to adopt the term &ldquo;capital employed&rdquo;, which is the term used by the Prices Commission in calculating the return which they think a company should get.  That would involve consideration of the real moneys that were being employed in a business and not merely the technical moneys, which are the paid-up and issued capital of the company.</P>
    <P>Another matter was discussed in the other House on the Budget last year to which, perhaps, I shall be permitted to refer very briefly.  I allude to the question of mineral development.  Enterprises of this nature have been very largely fostered by wartime markets and prices.  If they are to be encouraged in normal times without direct protection, through tariffs, it would be necessary to allow, for the purpose of the income-tax code, an annual charge calculated to permit the operating company to recoup the initial capital expenditure which is going to wear out.  I suggest that a mining company should be allowed to set aside annually a sum which, at interest, exempt from tax, at the end of the estimated life of the mine, would amount to the original sum invested. The investor in the mine would still have to take the risk that the life of <Col N="2008" /> the mine might not prove as long as that which had been estimated.  I agree that that would be a difficult provision to make, but it does seem unfair that the Revenue Commissioners should take the line that, because it is difficult, they will not envisage a scheme under which the allowance could be made, while at the same time they take a share in the profits of the concerns in question. So far as I could trace, in America, Canada, South Africa and Australia allowances of that nature are given. The only country of those whose records I examined which had not got such an allowance was England.  In America, for example, certain mines are allowed a charge of 15 per cent. of the gross annual value, subject to a limit of 50 per cent. of the net income. I mention that figure so as to give an indication of the extent of this allowance in other countries.  If we are going to have mineral development here after the emergency is over, some sort of provision along the lines I suggest must be brought in.  I would suggest, too, to the Minister that as the Act already stands, Section 21 of the Finance Act of 1922, which provides for surtax on the undistributed income of companies, is not satisfactory. I am sure that the Minister will point out that it is absolutely essential to have some such provision from the point of view of trading companies or what are commonly called one-man companies.  At the same time, this is a direct invitation to other companies to expend their resources rather than plough them back into their businesses.  It impels trading companies to expand their income to the largest extent compatible with the minimum of safety, instead of putting the money back into the business.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate that under such a system taxation may be obvious and easy of collection, but I suggest that that is rather going back to the days when the easiest form of collecting taxation on a man's property was to assess the number of windows in his house and tax him accordingly.  That was very easy to do, but it was considered to be complete nonsense in the <Col N="2009" /> end.  I would seriously ask the Minister to consider the point of view put forward by Senator Douglas, that the most uneconomic and even mischievous aspect of taxation on income at the moment is the refusal to exempt from tax prudent retentions from profits for reinvestment in the business concerned, or for the development of the business in other ways. Undoubtedly, if the activities of the Revenue Commissioners were changed in that respect, the effect would be to promote the accumulation of capital, but the promotion of such accumulation of capital by trading companies would, in the long run, mean that the Minister would get far more income-tax for the State, and, as a long-term policy, it would pay him, hands down.</P>
    <P>I want to make one other suggestion, and that is in connection with the new industries.  I do not think&mdash;and I seem to have sensed the same thought in recent speeches of the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;that protection and tariffs can last at a permanently high level, and if new industries are to be protected, I would suggest to the Minister for Finance that it is far more preferable to protect them, not by a tariff, but by a form of sliding remission of taxation in the earlier years of such industries so as to enable them to get over their initial period.  Such a method would have the advantage that any benefits given to them would be clearly seen and would not be in the form of hidden taxation. I need hardly mention to the Minister that an analogy on that line would run from the existing precedent of granting <Col N="2010" /> a remission of rates to a newly-built house.  I suggest that the two remissions would run completely parallel, side by side.</P>
    <P>We all appreciate that taxation and income-tax must remain, but we must remember, as Senator Douglas very rightly said, that it is essential to assure the public that the tax is being collected in a fair way and that it is falling evenly on all shoulders.  It is particularly necessary to give the public an assurance in the question of income-tax, because that is a tax on thrift.  It punishes the industrious apprentice and lets his idle brother go free.  In fact, it is based on the principle that was so dear to Oriental despots in former days, which was to find a man of property and then relieve him of his property.  I am afraid that, like the Prisoner of Chillon, so far as this tax is concerned here, we have become accustomed to our chains, and I am afraid that there is not much hope of getting rid of those chains. Therefore, all we can ask for or hope for is that our jailer will at least ease our chains a little or that, at any rate, he will not twist them any tighter.</P>
