      <P>Before we take up No. 1 on the Order Paper (Appropriation Bill) I should inform the House that the procedure to be adopted this year on the Second Stage of the Bill was considered at a recent meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The procedure favoured by the Committee was that there should be first a debate on general subject matters which Senators may be desirous of raising and that when that general debate had concluded, specific subject matters, of which notice had been received, should be taken up.  Only one such notice has been received, namely, from Senator Kingsmill Moore, who has given me notice, and I so informed the appropriate Department, that on the Second Stage of the Bill he would raise the question of the dissolution of the Board of Cork Street Hospital. At this point I should say that I have this morning received a letter from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health from which I infer that it is not the intention of that Minister to be present during the debate on the Bill.  The Minister states that it is his understanding that the Minister for Finance will be present during the debate on the Appropriation Bill, the Bill being concerned with the expenditure of the revenues of the State, and that the latter will deal with any relevant points that may be raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the understanding at the meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to which I have already referred, that Senators who had participated in the general debate, <Col N="462" /> were to be at liberty to speak a second time in the debate on that specific matter.  I think we may now proceed.</P>

      <P>On this Bill, Sir, I think it is appropriate to bring before the attention of the Minister for Finance a matter in which I think he is interested as a representative of the Irish Sugar Company.  It relates to the charges on the carriage of beet from my county to the nearest factory.  I do not expect the Minister to reach a decision on the matter here and now, and it would be unreasonable on my part to ask him to give it his fullest consideration straightway, but it is a matter that has weighed so severely against us that I make no apology for mentioning it as first on the Appropriation Bill.  Roughly speaking, the charge from our railway station to, say, Carlow, may be estimated at approximately one-fourth of our gross income. If we receive a return on our beet delivered, of £600, £125 of that has to be stopped for carriage from the railway station back, and I think that that, in itself, exhibits an injustice which good administration cannot and ought not to allow.  As to the remedy, I have suggested more than once that beet is entitled to the same consideration as wheat and that a flat all-round rate should be given for beet in the same way as for wheat.  That would mean that it would not matter to us, or to the producers anyway, what factory they may be requested to deliver their beet to.  We might go out and say that in thoroughly tillage districts we should have a factory, but I suggest that a more equitable method for the State, and one that in my opinion would entail less expense, would be to have a flat rate.  In other words, if the farmer is to receive £4 for his beet, let him receive it, and let the factory pay for the carriage in the same way as in the case of wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware that we have grown wheat as extensively, perhaps, as is humanly possible in our county. <Col N="463" /> We have done our best in its production, and for a time many of us have proceeded into potatoes as a green crop essential after intensive wheat cultivation.  I do not think it needs much experience in tillage to know that whilst potatoes will help to clean the land, they are not conducive to restoring its fertility.  Beet is.  Unfortunately, some of my neighbours have been forced out of it.  Carriage alone is the cause.  We have agitated with the Department of Agriculture. We have been sent to the sugar factory. Holding, as I do, a letter from them, which I was sorry it was the duty of the assistant to send, I have to be careful of the warning which Senator Duffy and Senator Sir John Keane gave us the other day.  However, I happen to be lucky in that the Minister for Finance, who is responsible, I think, for the appointment of many of the directors, will probably have the matter examined.  If I can be of any assistance to him, I shall be happy to render such assistance as I can give.  I have only one interest in the matter.  I say now, as I said previously in public and in private, that the farmers of certain parts of the country will weather any storm if they have a guaranteed, economic price for wheat and for beet but they cannot run one without the other.</P>

      <P>The occasion on which the Appropriation Bill is considered in this House should be a very important occasion.  Unfortunately&mdash;the Minister might say &ldquo;fortunately&rdquo;&mdash; the Appropriation Bill reaches us usually in July, when most members are tired and are looking forward to an adjournment of a month or thereabouts. As a result, the Seanad very seldom fully recognises its responsibilities in relation to the Bill.  The Appropriation Bill furnishes the only occasion on which this House has the duty placed upon it of making recommendations or criticisms of the general administration of this State through its Ministers and Departments. This House has not complete control over any Minister or any Department.  It cannot require the attendance of Ministers.  It cannot <Col N="464" /> ask for their dismissal.  It has really only the power of criticism.  I suppose it could make a recommendation to reduce the salary of a Minister, but that would be futile and it has never been the practice here.  I think I am correct in saying, subject to you, a Chathaoirligh, that anything which would be in order on the Vote for any Department of a Minister would be in order on this Bill.  I myself have not the slightest intention of taking full advantage of the Bill or of speaking upon anything like all the matters which I should like to see raised or in which I have an interest.  However, there are a few matters in respect of which I should like to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by the Bill to set forth my views in the hope of obtaining the views of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place, I propose to deal with one or two matters which are directly related to the Department of Finance.  I should like to know from the Minister whether he has under active consideration the question of excess corporation profits tax and its, probable effect on future industrial development.  In the debate on the Finance Bill, in May last, his predecessor said that as long as this tax continues it will be a deterrent to enterprise.  He also said &ldquo;If we are going to have industrial development on anything like a large scale encouraged here, it cannot be brought about until excess corporation profits tax disappears.&rdquo;  I should like to know from the Minister if he agrees with that statement, made by his predecessor.  I should like to know if he recognises&mdash;as, I think, he does&mdash;the need for further industrial development if we are ever to have a full employment policy here and if he proposes to do anything about it.  We have had several statements from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the effect that many plans have been made for further industrial development here.  The former Minister for Finance said that the present taxation was a deterrent to industrial enterprise. If the Minister could see his way&mdash;not, of course, to-day but some time in the near future&mdash;to indicate Government policy with regard to this <Col N="465" /> tax, it would be of great help to many people who are considering new projects and would, certainly, help them to make up their minds whether or not to proceed with them.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that excess corporation profits tax very often works as a tax on efficiency.  I cannot think of anything which will reduce profits more quickly than inefficient management.  But it will not reduce prices.  What we want is a reduction of prices, not necessarily a reduction of profits.  It is obvious that the two do not necessarily go together.  There is&mdash;I think it applies to every section of the population&mdash;widespread dissatisfaction with present high price&mdash;levels. Some of these may be due to profiteering but I do not think that that is the main cause.  Last week, Senator Duffy suggested that the Department of Supplies was ineffective in dealing with profiteering.  I do not believe that there is nearly as much in that as Senator Duffy thinks.  The methods adopted by the Department of Supplies may not always have been the best but there has, certainly, never been any want of energy or lack of enthusiasm in enforcing them.  Every manufacturer and shopkeeper I know will agree with me in that.  Last week, Senator Duffy, on a different Bill, stated that he was in the company of a manufacturer who saw an article in a shop window&mdash;I think he said that it was an article of clothing&mdash;priced 31/6, and the manufacturer said to him that that was an article which his firm made and that the cost price was 10/7. I took it from Senator Duffy's remarks that he thought that was an instance of profiteering.  My comment on that is that it is an instance of the futility of certain people.  I should like to make clear, as a person interested in manufacture, that if that had been an article which my firm had made and if I knew that the price was 10/7 and that it was being sold at 31/6, I would immediately have reported it to the Department of Supplies.  I am perfectly certain that they would have investigated the matter without the slightest delay.  I think that there is some snag in the story somewhere. What I want to point out is that it is up to the manufacturers to insist on <Col N="466" /> seeing that there is no undue profiteering in respect of articles they make.</P>
    <P>Another statement was made on the Finance Bill by the Minister's predecessor to which I should like to refer.  He said that if any case of hardship under the operation of combined income-tax and corporation profits tax and excess corporation profits tax was proved to him, he would ask the Dáil to alter the law so as to get rid of the hardship.  A week or so after the Minister made that statement, the President of the Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Brock, who is recognised as one of the most experienced accountants in this country, made a speech in which he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One of the reliefs for which we pressed related to small companies, particularly those formed since 1939, in which there is more than one whole-time working director or proprietor. We are satisfied that the present incidence of excess corporation profits tax on such companies is unduly harsh.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The position now is that they are obliged to pay more in direct taxation than their counterparts in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, notwithstanding the apparent favourable differences in the rates of taxation applied here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister if he considers it a case of hardship if small companies, in which there is more than one whole-time working director, have to pay a higher taxation than they would have to pay, under the same conditions, if they were operating in Northern Ireland. Was it the intention of the Government that certain companies should pay a higher rate of taxation than in Northern Ireland and, if it was not the Government's intention&mdash;and I do not believe it was at any time&mdash;I would like to know if the Minister will look into Mr. Brock's statement and see if it is accurate &mdash; as I believe it to be?  If it is accurate, then clearly there are cases of hardship and in that case I would like to know if the Minister is prepared to implement his predecessor's <Col N="467" /> promise and to have the law altered.</P>
    <P>I would like also to refer to a matter raised in the Dáil during the debate on the Vote for the Minister's Department. It relates to the computation of lump sums payable to male civil servants who were superannuated in the period from July, 1940, to December, 1944, during which the Civil Service bonus was stabilised by reference to a cost-of-living index figure of 185.  I will endeavour to be as brief and nontechnical as possible.  I am not asking for any fundamental change in Government policy.  On the contrary, I want to contend that, as regards a particular group of retired civil servants, there has been a failure to implement Government policy.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1909, a civil servant on retirement received a pension equal to 1/60th of his salary for each year of established service, up to 40 years, so that the maximum pension on retirement was 2/3rds of his salary.  A disadvantage of this scheme was that although it was recognised that the pension was really deferred pay, if the official died before or after the fixed date of his retirement, there was no provision for his dependents.  In 1909 a new scheme was embodied in the Superannuation Act of that year which provided that a civil servant's pension on retirement should be 1/80th of his salary for each year of established service, subject to a maximum of 40/80ths&mdash;that is, 50 per cent. of his salary on retirement&mdash;but that, in addition, there should be payable a lump sum on death or retirement equal to 1/30th of the salary for each year of service subject to a maximum of 45/30ths for the 45 years of established service.  That would be 150 per cent. of the retiring salary.  The right to this lump sum payment was, therefore, accorded in view of the reduction of the pension to 3/4ths of that previously payable.</P>
    <P>The new scheme applied to all male entrants to the service; it did not apply to women.  A man who was already in the service was allowed, if he wished, by express agreement with <Col N="468" /> the United Kingdom Treasury, to change from the old scheme to the new one and, if he did, he was granted a small increase in the lump sum.  When the so-called &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; was introduced after the 1914-1918 war, it became necessary to take account of it in determining pensions and lump sums. I will not take up the time of the House going into any details of the bonus scheme, except to point out that it was not a bonus in the sense in which we ordinarily understand a bonus in business.  It was a sliding scale adjustment by reference to the changes in the cost of living since July, 1914.</P>
    <P>All basic salaries of civil servants in this country are still fixed in terms of 1914 monetary values.  I have often wondered why that is continued, but there it is.  When the cost-of-living index was 185, as compared with 100 as at July, 1914, the lowest paid civil servant on a basic salary equal to 35/- a week received a so-called &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; equal to 85 per cent. of his salary.  But the sliding scale allowance was progressively reduced for all salaries above the minimum of 35/- per week and on the highest salary paid to civil servants in Éire the adjustment for the reduction in the purchasing power of money since 1914 was 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the years 1933 to 1935 the cost-of-living index figure hovered around 150 to 155; that is, the percentage increase over July, 1914, was about 50.  From that point it rose rapidly and, when it had reached 185, the Government made an Order stabilising it.  In May, 1941, the Government made the general standstill Order stabilising, subject to emergency bonus, the salaries and wages of workers outside the service. By that time the operative index for the Civil Service had become 210 and the cost-of-living index had risen to 296 by November, 1944.  I believe the latest figure published is 295.  The Government, nevertheless, maintained the index figure governing the remuneration of the Civil Service at 185 until December, 1944.  This applies to the point I want to raise only to the extent that it affected the superannuation of men who retired from the service during <Col N="469" /> the period when the so-called &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; was stabilised at 185.  Since the lump sum and pension are determined by reference to the amount of the salary plus bonus enjoyed by the officer on the date of his retirement, the latter amount vitally affected the pensioner's future.</P>
    <P>In arriving at the amount of the pension it has been the practice, as from 1922, to take into account 100 per cent. of the bonus, but whilst there is no provision at all for increasing the original pension if the cost of living rises, the portion of the pension calculated on the bonus falls to be reduced by quarterly reassessment when the cost of living falls. Obviously, this quarterly reassessment could not be applied to the lump sum and it was, therefore, arranged in 1922, when the cost of living was falling rapidly, that only 75 per cent. of the bonus should be taken into account in computing lump sums. This practice was expressly designed to allow for a fall in the cost of living during the remainder of the pensioner's life after his superannuation and it should clearly have ceased when the Government stabilised the bonus on a rapidly rising cost-of-living index.  In spite of this it was continued up to the end of 1943.  In May, 1944, the Government announced that lump sums of civil servants superannuated on or after 1st January, 1944, would be computed by reference to 100 per cent. of the bonus but applications to have the amended practice extended to retirements effected on or before 31st December, 1943, for which there is exactly the same case, have all been refused.</P>
    <P>In December, 1944, the Government made an Order providing that the index figure of 210 which, it seems to me, should have been operative all along, should be taken as the index figure governing bonuses on salaries as from 1st January, 1945, and, following a debate in the Dáil on the 1st December, 1944, a further Order was made on the 20th February, 1945, applying, as from 1st January, 1945, the 210 index to the pensions, that is, to the annual allowances but not to the lump sums of men superannuated during the <Col N="470" /> period 1st July, 1940, to 31st December, 1944, for which the bonus had been stabilised at 185.</P>
    <P>The policy underlying these recent changes seems to me to be reasonably clear.  The Minister's predecessor declined to reimburse civil servants for the losses in salaries suffered by them through the adoption for over three years of an index figure much below that applicable to employees outside the service, on the ground that to do so would produce another factor leading to inflation.  I am not now concerned to comment either for or against that attitude.  But the recent changes mean that it is the aim of the Government to place civil servants and Civil Service pensioners who have been superannuated since the bonus was stabilised, for the future&mdash;that is, from 1st January, 1945&mdash;on a level with employed persons outside the service. That appears, in theory at least, to be the effect of the adoption of the 210 index figure.  It has, I think, been expressly stated that the adjustments were designed to place fixed income classes on a general equality.</P>
    <P>Bearing this in mind, let me take the case of two men, each of whom, when superannuated, had a basic salary of £200 per annum after 45 years' service, one superannuated on the 31st December, 1943, and the other on 1st January, 1945.  Originally, both would have been entitled to a pension amounting to two-thirds salary and bonus, but both elected in 1909, by agreement with the Treasury, to take on retirement a lump sum, plus half salary and bonus.  As from 1st January, 1945, the pension in each case will be £178 per annum&mdash;a little less than £3 10s. 0d. per week&mdash;but the lump sum paid to the man who retired on 1st January, 1945, was £561, computed by reference to 100 per cent. of bonus calculated on a stabilised index figure of 210, the real index being 296, whereas the man who retired one year and one day earlier, when the real index was approximately the same, received only £457.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to maintain this difference of £104 as between the lump sums awarded to the two men.  If the men concerned had chosen to be pensioned on two-thirds salary and bonus, <Col N="471" /> each would be receiving the same pension, that is, £237.  Each of them has paid the same price, a reduction in pension of £59, for his lump sum, but the lump sum in one case is 22 per cent. higher than in the other.  I do not see how it can possibly be contended that these two men are placed on a footing of equality as from 1st January, 1945, when the capital sum awarded to one is £104 less than that allotted to the other.  The cost of living and all other conditions for both of them will be the same for the rest of their lives and will be sufficiently difficult on pensions amounting to less than £3 10s. 0d. per week.</P>
    <P>I have referred specifically to the case of the junior civil servant because the hardship is greater in that case.  If the two men had attained at retirement to salaries of £1,000 per annum, the difference in their lump sums would be £213.  The proportionate loss to the man who retired in 1943 would be less, but the principle is the same. A further anomaly arises from the fact that only the male civil servant suffers. All female civil servants who retire after 40 years' service are pensioned on the basis of two-thirds salary and bonus, and a female officer who retired any time between 1st July, 1940, and 31st December, 1944, would get the full benefit of 100 per cent. of the 210 index as from 1st January under the terms of the Order made last February.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that the anomalies to which I refer seemed to be due to some confusion in the mind of the Minister, or possibly his advisers, and that there had, in consequence, been a failure to implement the Government's policy of effecting equality as from 1945 onwards between the classes within and without the Civil Service affected by wages standstill Orders.  The confusion seems to have arisen in this way: the Government has so far declined to make good to civil servants the losses in salaries suffered by them up to 31st December, 1944, through the stabilisation of the bonus at 185 instead of 210. It would appear that, in the minds of the Minister's advisers, the losses in relation to lump sums suffered by men who retired during the period of the stabilisation of the index figure at 185 <Col N="472" /> have been aligned with the losses in salaries suffered during that period.</P>
    <P>If I am correct in this, it could have arisen only through a failure to have regard to the essential character of the lump sums.  The salary payments made during the relevant years were payments for work done month by month in those years. The lump sum, whenever it is paid, is a provision for the future, paid in lieu of a higher pension and must be looked at in precisely the same light as the pension itself, for part of which it is, in fact, a substitute.  Unless, therefore, the lump sums, as from the beginning of stabilisation, are adjusted, the Government's policy of effecting equality as from January, 1945, is clearly not achieved and discrimination of a character which it seems to me cannot be defended on any basis of fundamental justice is exercised against a number of men who have retired after long and faithful service.</P>
    <P>I do not claim to have any expert knowledge of Civil Service superannuation, but I have gone into this matter with some care, and it is my considered judgment that an injustice has been done to men who retired between 1940 and 1944.  I am satisfied that this is a strong case for careful examination by the Minister.  I do not, of course, ask him to deal with a complicated question of this kind to-day, but I do urge him to give it his personal attention.  No question of Party politics is involved.  All Parties would like to see economies, but none would support economy if they believed it meant injustice to a few civil servants who have retired after years of faithful service to the State.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I should like to say a word or two on what I regard as the great importance of our external affairs policy in the next few years. Before the war, there was very little interest amongst the people generally in international affairs and I do not think I would be wrong if I said that the general idea was that our external relations policy, except perhaps in so far as it concerns the British Commonwealth of Nations, did not matter very much.  I did not think that attitude <Col N="473" /> was right then and I am absolutely convinced that it is not right now.</P>
    <P>It is becoming more and more clear that a policy of isolation will not be practicable for any small country, if it wishes to progress and to develop its resources.  If we are seriously to attempt a full employment policy, of which we hear a great deal nowadays, we shall have to have close trade relationships with as many countries as possible.  Our neutrality in the war may have made us somewhat unpopular in many quarters, but it certainly has established beyond doubt a recognition everywhere of our position as an independent State.  I know, as we all know, of course, that six counties are cut off and are not independent. We all want to end Partition, but, in my opinion, we should be careful not to let the existence of Partition interfere with our good relationships with other countries.  If we do so by any chance, we shall only be playing into the hands of a small number of people who wish to maintain Partition.</P>
    <P>We cannot close our eyes to the fact that there is a great deal of bitter criticism of this country at present. Some of it is so unfair that there is nothing to do but simply ignore it.  I have a good many friends and relatives in the United States and Canada, and I receive a great many newspaper cuttings and letters from them.  Some of these, as I said, are so obviously unfair that I do not see that anything can be done about them, but some are obviously serious and can do us a great deal of harm.  I have also met quite a number of representative people from European countries during the last year or two, and it is true that there is an impression abroad that we have, or had, sympathy with the Nazi and Fascist régimes.  We know here that this was never true of the vast majority of our people, and I think every opportunity should be taken to emphasise that fact.</P>
    <P>The visit of the Taoiseach to the German Minister did us a good deal of harm.  It received publicity far out of proportion to its importance, and some of the comments in the foreign Press <Col N="474" /> were almost violent in their character. The Taoiseach has explained his reasons in the Dáil.  There is a strong difference of opinion in this country as to whether he acted wisely or not but I see no use in discussing it further. There is nothing more that we can do about that now.  What I want to suggest to the Government or the Minister is that they should carefully consider whether the time has not come when we should do a certain amount of pro-Irish propaganda ourselves.  I think a good deal can be done to prove what we all know to be a fact&mdash;that is the fact that our neutrality during the war was a friendly neutrality both to Great Britain and America.  I shall not go into the details but there is quite a lot of things which will prove that, which are more or less known here but which are not known externally and which will be only made known through a certain amount of repeated propaganda. I know that a certain kind of propaganda is supposed to have some relation to lies, but I am not suggesting any propaganda which is not strictly the truth, and I think whereas we cannot and should not try to get away from the consequences of our being neutral, we have a right to correct propaganda, which suggests that our neutrality was not a friendly one.</P>
    <P>There is also an impression abroad that we want to keep to ourselves and that we do not desire to co-operate with other nations.  Now that is, of course, equally quite untrue and it will take time to correct it.  I think it would help if members of the Government would speak more frequently on international problems and would encourage an interest in international affairs amongst our people.  I think also that the greatest possible use should be made of international conferences of all kinds at which we should be fully represented.  Only last November there was an international business conference held in New York at which we had two representatives. Switzerland sent 13, Sweden 19, Portugal 12, and Australia 6.  I have not got the figures for other countries, but I think that we should have had at least a dozen, and they should be representative of all classes of business interests <Col N="475" /> without, of course, any regard to politics.  Personally, I should like to see the development of closer relations with some of the smaller European States, especially Norway, Sweden and Denmark as soon as this is practicable. I recognise that it will probably be some time before this is possible.  I think myself that an Irish Minister sent to these small States might be of more real value than possibly representatives sent to some of the larger States, because I think the smaller European States, more particularly those I have mentioned, have a great many interests in common with us.</P>
    <P>There are to my certain knowledge quite a number of people in England and in the other States of the British Commonwealth who really believe that we are only looking for an opportunity to leave the British Commonwealth of Nations.  I listened very carefully to everything that was said by the Taoiseach in this House last week.  It was very clear to me that he has not the slightest intention of breaking our present connection with the British Commonwealth, that he recognises our very close ties as a mother country with the peoples in Canada, Australia and New Zealand and that he desires to co-operate on the basis of mutual friendship. Unfortunately the newspaper reports, particularly in other countries, of his speeches in the Dáil and probably his speeches here&mdash;though I did not see any reports of his speeches here&mdash; were mixed up with the question of whether or not we are entitled to call ourselves a republic, about which comparatively few people outside this State are really interested.  In the past the word &ldquo;republic&rdquo; was used to mean breaking our present connection with the British Commonwealth.  The debates in the Dáil made it clear to anyone who read them carefully that in the mind of the Government it does not mean that.  Unfortunately again I am afraid that was not nearly so clear in the newspaper reports.</P>
    <P>Personally, I do not exactly know what the Taoiseach meant when he said that he was not going hat in hand <Col N="476" /> to anybody.  I do not think anybody would suggest that any Minister needs to go hat in hand to anyone.  It is only inferiors or people with an inferiority complex who go hat in hand to anyone else.  But surely there is nothing <i>infra dig</i> in stating that we are just as vitally interested in world peace as any other small nation&mdash;that we think we should be invited to all conferences concerned with the future peace of the world.  Having been neutral, we have no right to take part in conferences relating to the war but it would not be going hat in hand to say that we ought to be present at conferences at which the future relationships between States associated in the British Commonwealth are being discussed.  I cannot help feeling personally that it is unfortunate that we were excluded&mdash;I take it we were not invited&mdash;from some of the recent conferences and that it was good neither for us nor for the Commonwealth as a whole.</P>

      <P>The experience of having a new Minister for Finance to deal with an Appropriation Bill is, if I may say so, a pleasing one for me. I am more optimistic to-day I think about the future of the industry in the discussion of which I have engaged when previous Appropriation Bills were before the House, than I have been at any time since I first came into Dáil Éireann.  I think we can truthfully say that the Minister for Finance to-day has a better appreciation of the problems of rural Ireland and its needs than any of his predecessors. For that reason I welcome him to the Seanad.  I do not know whether he will be prepared to take any advice from me but if he were, I would suggest to him that he should get away to some place, into quiet seclusion, where he would forget for the time being the orthodoxy of his predecessors either with regard to finance, points of view about agriculture or anything pertaining to the future of the State, and that he would ask himself, looking at what he and the people of the country have got to exploit: &ldquo;What should I do now, when in charge of the finances of the nation, to make it possible for the people of this country to make better <Col N="477" /> use of their resources than they have made in the past, having regard to present world conditions?&rdquo; In fact I think that he can only shape a policy for himself, the Government and the country by some such thoughts as these.  I think he has got to be bold and courageous about it.  Because I think there are possibilities that he may act to some extent like that, I am expressing an optimism about the future that I could never stir up within myself for a number of years.  Obviously I would be mainly concerned with the Minister's policy in relation to the land of this country, because, unless our land is cared and tended, unless our land policy is a sound one, it cannot be looked upon as having the possibilities of success, and to the extent to which our land policy is a failure our whole national effort suffers.</P>
      <P>Although I am tempted to do so, I do not think that to-day I will enter into a discussion on our agricultural affairs.  I am aware of the fact that the committee of experts reported some months ago to the Government their views on agricultural policy.  As far as I am concerned, I wish it had been possible to have that report in my hands before this debate.  I would then have had material on which to make some suggestions about what I would regard as the Minister's best plans for the future.  I should like to have from the Minister some information as to whether or not that report will be made available to us, and whether or not it has yet got the consideration of the Cabinet.  Those are matters which are essential to our future, and they are very urgent.  Most of the countries which are engaged in agriculture to relatively the same extent as we are have been making plans, changing those plans as circumstances demanded, and making new plans for the future, and I think we have more leeway to make up than most of them. We have an immense task of reconstruction, and we know nothing about the Government's plans.  If this report which is now in the hands of the Government is to form the basis of Government policy, the earlier that policy can be enunciated and embodied in legislative proposals the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" /> It is true no doubt that the Minister is going to suffer for the sins of his predecessors in office.  He has inherited, from the point of view of the land, a run-down industry, the reconstruction of which will make an immense call on the nation's resources. When that problem is tackled, I think its magnitude will probably stagger many of the orthodox financiers who have been giving advice for a very long time.  Because this is a problem which I think the Government will have to face immediately, I should like to hear from the Minister to-day what his views are on the interest charges for the capital that must be made available to the farmers of this country immediately.  I hope the Minister's views will be rather more enlightened than anything we have had from Ministerial Benches so far. I should like an expression of opinion from him on this matter, because the agricultural industry as a whole and every individual farmer in the country is faced with colossal capital expenditure. A very considerable amount of that money requires to be expended immediately.  But what is it going to cost?  I say very definitely and explicitly that the Minister's viewpoint on this is fundamental to the whole future of the industry.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we did not get until this morning the Official Debates on this Bill in the Dáil, and I have not been able to read the discussions there.  The part of the discussion in which I am most interested is the view expressed by Deputy McGilligan and the Minister's reply.  I may say that I subscribe to the viewpoint put forward by Deputy McGilligan there, and I have to express some surprise at the answer made by the Minister.  I am going to give the Minister an opportunity of elucidating the point further, because if that is the Minister's viewpoint I have fears for the future.  The general line of Deputy McGilligan's discourse was to point to the fact that our exports are not being paid for by imports in the form of goods, and he was pessimistic about the possibilities of our being able to cash in on our sterling assets.  I am not going to follow Deputy McGilligan's argument <Col N="479" /> on that, but I want to make one or two points with regard to the difficulties of our getting goods, and I should like to have some information from the Minister on the matter.  I take it that the argument is that to-day goods are not available in exchange for those we export, so that we simply cannot get them.  I put one point to the Minister, and it is one which has been under discussion already both here and in the other House.  Take the question of our imports and consumption of tea.  In this country, the ration is half an ounce.  In Britain to-day it is two and a half ounces.  Recently, there has been an increase of a half ounce in the ration in Britain, and if 1/16th of that half ounce could have been obtained by the Ministry for this country it would have made it possible to increase our ration to one ounce per head.  In the other House, the Minister's colleague gave considerable time to a discussion of this difficulty about tea, but it is difficult to justify the argument that goods are not available in exchange for our goods while a situation like that continues. Surely, there is some answer? We are either not making a fight, or we are being turned down.  We are not getting all the information to which we are entitled, and the situation is very unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>There is another problem that we are right up against, and that is the provision of agricultural machinery for the harvest.  There again, those goods are most essential to us and are urgently required.  What are the prospects of our getting additional reapers, binders and threshers?  To-day, in every part of the country, the farmers are faced with a problem of such magnitude that at this late season of the year it is very difficult to see what we can do about gathering the harvest when the time comes.  Surely it ought to be possible to obtain imports of that kind.  I am not thinking now of a considerable quantity, but I do say that two, three or four extra machines, distributed over a wide area of the country, would make a tremendous difference between losing and saving a big portion of the harvest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="480" /> I want to draw the Minister's attention to a statement that he is reported to have made in the Dáil in reply to Deputy McGilligan.  I wonder if the Minister really gave the matter consideration. Perhaps he did, and that it would not be right to suggest anything to the contrary.  I had better read his statement.  It was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Neither Germany, the Argentine nor Russia was a financial centre of the world, and when Deputy McGilligan was talking yesterday and to-day about England's difficulty in balancing her books of international trade after the war, and pointed out that she would have to double her visible exports in order to do so, he left out of account one big factor by which Britain balanced her books prior to the last war, namely, the profit she made on being the centre of international finance, insurance and so forth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would not like to believe that the Minister's opinion about the possibility of Britain honouring her obligations was based on his hope that Britain is again to be, so to speak, the centre for the money-changers of the world.  I think that is exactly what the phrase used by the Minister means: that, apparently, Britain is going to balance her books by again becoming the centre of international finance.  I ask Senators to read that in connection with the kind of things that we want to do in this country and to contemplate what the possibilities were for us when England was the centre of international finance.  What were the consequences for us then?  We had money on deposit in the banks at 1 per cent. and 1½ per cent., but when there was any problem with regard to reconstruction on the land or in industry, the man who wanted to borrow money had to pay 5, 6 or 7 per cent. for the use of it.  We were exporting what was, apparently, surplus to our own needs or requirements from the point of view of consumption or capital expenditure.  The money was finding its way into this centre of attraction, of international finance, and because it got into the hands of those people it was quite impossible for us, apparently, to finance any scheme of reconstruction <Col N="481" /> at home.  In my opinion the Minister's hope that Britain is going to honour her obligations by reason of the fact that she will be able to balance her books by again becoming the centre of international finance will mean that high interest rates will supervene here in the future, just in the same way as they dominated our life in the past, thereby creating conditions of unemployment, a depopulation of the country and, one might say, stagnant conditions both in agriculture and industry.</P>
    <P>I would like to have some elucidation from the Minister on that point. As I see it, if it is going to be more profitable in the future for a number of people connected with international finance, insurance or the like, to spend their time in the changing of money, if it is going to be more profitable to buy and sell money in a pool than it is to manage money in industry or agriculture, then the handicaps that are going to be imposed on us, handicaps under which we laboured in the past&mdash; if, in the future, it is going to be more profitable to buy futures in wheat on the Winnipeg Exchange than it is for the farmer to grow the wheat&mdash;will make it more attractive for people to get on to the exchange and away from the field, and I would like to hear what the Minister has to say on that.  That sort of policy would scarcely be in harmony with the line that I would hope to see the Minister pursue.</P>
    <P>There are some other matters to which I desire to draw the attention of the House.  Statements have appeared with regard to the position of the national teachers.  As I understand it, the teachers' position is now being considered by the Government, and the teachers are to have an interview with the Minister at some not too far distant date.  We have been given to understand that a policy is to be enunciated with regard to the scales of salaries for teachers which are to come into operation at the end of the emergency.  The net point is, when will the emergency be regarded as having come to an end?  In what conditions would the Minister say he would be in a position to state that the emergency had come to an end?  Will, for <Col N="482" /> example, that situation depend on there being such an increase in the quantity of goods available as to prevent an inflationary position developing in the country?  In a word, what are the conditions which the Minister visualises will prevail when he can say that the emergency has come to an end?</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I want to bring to the Minister's notice. I do not know if he has any personal contact with it or not, but I am sure he will understand it.  We have here a peculiar system of licences for the export of dairy cattle.  As I understand the position, a certain number of licences are distributed to residents of Éire, within Éire.  A certain number are also distributed to English buyers who buy cows from us. More are given to residents in the Six Counties.  These, apparently, are distributed from Stormont to residents in the Six Counties, who are at liberty to purchase cows in Éire.  If my information is correct, I fail to understand why it is that we have decided to give the distribution of licences to the Stormont people. Actually, we have decided ourselves to distribute licences to English purchasers, but be that as it may, this is how the system operates: very few of these Northern buyers are coming here to purchase cattle from us.  What is happening is that the licences are being sold to traders resident in this State who buy dairy stock at the fairs in the Twenty-Six Counties.  When they exhaust the number of permits they hold and find that more cattle are being offered for sale and export than they have permits for, they purchase additional licences from nonresidents. That is what is happening. A man in the Six Counties can go to Stormont and ask for licences and obtain them.  He can come along with half a dozen of them and sell them to traders operating in the Twenty-Six Counties, the trader here paying about £1 for each licence.  But when he comes to purchase my cow, I get £1 less.</P>
    <P>The net result of this Order as it is at present operating is that the owners of dairy stock in this country who are <Col N="483" /> selling them for export make a contribution of £1 each to the holders of the licences in the Six Counties who sell them to traders in Éire.  This is causing a great deal of dissatisfaction in the country.  It is a matter that demands urgent re-examination.  It is an absurd condition that a farmer in the Six Counties who never comes here to purchase dairy stock and who has no intention of coming here, can procure a licence and can sell to a trader who is legitimately operating here.  I urge the Minister to take this matter up.  If cattle are being sold here and are being exported under our authority, the permit to take the cattle out ought to be handed to people here who are in the trade here. A situation should not be created whereby a farmer has to pay a subsidy to a person living in the Six Counties because that person is able to secure a licence by some method not available to the Twenty-Six County farmer.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that concerns every member of the Oireachtas, including the Government.  For some time a considerable number of members of the American Forces have been coming to this country.  I have made contact with some of them, particularly when travelling by train.  I suggest to the Government and to the House that we still have to too great an extent the mental attitude of neutrality with regard to these people.  I know that some of these people wander around our city, sometimes for a couple of days, without making contacts with the Irish people or the Irish mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want seriously to suggest to the Minister that if £10,000 or £20,000 were set aside&mdash;I do not know how it could be done; I have not tried to think that out; it is not my responsibility&mdash;for the purpose of setting up hospitality centres in the city and perhaps in other centres, to which these young men could go and get advice as to where they could get information about the country, its history and its people, it would be well worth while.  I do not know how many Senators have made contact with these people but I have made contact with them, and it is astonishing to find how little they know about us.  Senator Douglas referred to the lack of information about us abroad.  When one considers how little many of the present generation in this country understand what happened 30 years ago it is not a matter of surprise to find a lack of information on these matters on the part of the second generation of Irishmen who have been serving in France or Germany and who come over here.  But it certainly <Col N="485" /> points to the great need for enlightenment. My view is that we ought to do something about this and that in addition some brief précis should be made out about the country's history in the last 30 years and made available for them to take away.  In that way they would learn a great deal and would be helped to understand our position and our point of view and they would become ambassadors for us, when they returned to their homes, in circles into which we could never penetrate by our present methods.</P>
      <P>There is another point on which I should like some information from the Minister.  Sir John Anderson some time ago made this statement, as reported in the <i>Sunday Times</i>, 8th July:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As Sir John Anderson told his Canadian audience, our exchange reserves have derived substantial benefit from the personal expenditure of American troops in the sterling area.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister what advantages we are deriving in the way of being able to procure dollars for the food that we are giving the young men who are coming in here?  Is anything being done about it?  I do not see that there is any obligation on us to take British money in return for the food we give them.  If Sir John Anderson can acclaim the value that these people represent in Britain and the advantage to be derived from them from the point of view of being able to obtain dollars, and could say that it was the equivalent of a lucrative tourist traffic, what are we doing about that situation and what can we do?  If we have not been able to do anything about it, it is time we tried to do something about it.  It is not right that we should handicap ourselves in every way and that it should be open to Britain at every turn of the wheel to have every movement in the financial relations between Britain and this country turned to her advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first occasion on which we have the pleasure of meeting the Minister in his capacity as the successor of the present Uachtarán as Minister for Finance.  He is not entirely unknown <Col N="486" /> in this House.  He comes to us trailing clouds of glory from his former occupation.  I think our first duty should be to congratulate him on having obtained this high office, and to express the hope that he will be at least as successful in that capacity as his predecessor was and perhaps rather more popular on this side of the House than he was in his former capacity.  It is tempting on an occasion like this to put a new Minister through an ordeal somewhat akin to what happens to a new boy when he comes to a boarding school, and I am sure that if I fall for that temptation the Minister, if he has any affinity with his predecessor, will take it in good part, for one of the most agreeable things about the former Minister was the fact that he enjoyed &ldquo;backchat&rdquo; and was well able to give back anything that he received. In that connection I would remind the Minister of an Irish proverb which Aindrias Ó Muineacháin has lately brought to the knowledge of all of us &mdash;Níor bhris focal maith fiacal riamh&mdash; as nearly as I can remember.  It would probably be equally true if you said &ldquo;focal olc&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;focal maith&rdquo;, since the Minister and I are much more disposed to exchange &ldquo;focal olc&rdquo; than &ldquo;focal maith&rdquo;.  To get over this as quickly as may be, I would like to suggest a compact to the Minister, that is, that when we want to indulge in personal remarks about each other, we should do so in the other national language, in Irish.  That would be of great advantage to the Minister, who is known to be a fluent scholar in Irish, whereas my knowledge of the Irish language is most limited.  Any one who knows the Irish language and is a complete master of the irregular verbs is a person whom I cannot help complimenting.  I take off my hat to him and in this connection I christen the Minister, in that one respect, Gunga Din.  That is not Irish, but if you look up the references you will find it is thoroughly complimentary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it comes to the regular verbs in Irish, I am sure&mdash;bearing in mind what I had to say on a former occasion on the Minister's ability with the blue pencil censorship stick and on the <i>Irish Times</i> contention that he was <Col N="487" /> skilled at dagger play&mdash;I am sure the Minister will be able to conjugate the regular verb &ldquo;Buailim&rdquo; in all its moods and tenses, but when it comes to the verb &ldquo;Molaim&rdquo;, which is also a regular verb, I feel he would fall down in the conjugation&mdash;at all events, so far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I might indulge in that Irish lesson I learned from Aindrias Ó Muineacháin: &ldquo;Ceacht a hAon: An Chéad Cheacht.  Bhí fear beag ins an tigh.  Seán is ainm dó.  Tá sé in Árus an Uachtaráin anois, go mbeannuigh Dia dó.  Tá fear mór ins an tigh anois, Proinnsias is ainm dó.  Beidh sé fós in Árus an Uachtaráin, go mbeannuigh an diabhal dó.

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>You will have to supply it in the Béarla, if you want me to understand it.  I want to refer very briefly to one of the things that make me believe that this Minister will probably be quite successful in his very difficult role as Minister for Finance.  We have had recently a European war, in which political neutrality was the accepted policy of all Parties&mdash;not without heart-burning on the part of some persons and some sections of the community in this State.  The Minister, however, in his former capacity, managed to preserve a degree of neutrality which approximated to moral neutrality as well as political neutrality, as between the moral issues involved in that struggle. We now know, on the authority of no less a person than His Holiness the Pope, that the Nazi régime which lately came to its well-deserved end was of Satanic origin and consequently that the struggle of the last five years was a conflict between Satan and the enemies of Satan.  Now, to manage to keep us morally neutral in the strife between Satan and the enemies of Satan is no small achievement.  In fact, it is something almost miraculous, and a person able to achieve that <Col N="488" /> result will be able to achieve almost any miraculous result, even in the Department of Finance.  He might even balance the Budget, without increasing taxation and without lessening the value of any of the objects upon which the money was expended.</P>
      <P>I know, of course, that our attitude to the recent struggle was influenced, if not dominated, by the existence of Partition.  I do not want to talk about Partition in any general way, but I am all in favour of extracting whatever blessings there are from any situation, however unpleasant it may be in some of its essential aspects.  I would like to recount quite briefly some of the aspects of Partition which I think one ought to set down to the credit side of the account.  The first of them is the fact that there is only one person like me a member of this House.  If it were not for Partition, there would be at least a dozen or a score unpleasant Ulstermen like myself in this House and saying things which would probably be resented by a great many other people here.  The atmosphere of this House then, instead of being the pleasant little family party which it generally is, would approximate more closely to that of a frontier district in Belfast, somewhere between Sandy Row and the Falls Road.</P>
      <P>Another thing I would like to say about Partition is that, politically, it derives its origin from the successful appeal to force made by the Ulster Protestants in the years from 1912 to 1914, in their resistance to the constitutionally enacted Home Rule Act of 1912-1914.</P>

It is common knowledge that sea planes regularly flew from Lough Erne out over Donegal Bay passing over our territory, and I have yet to learn that any of our antiaircraft guns were stationed in that part of our territory and fired one shot at those sea planes going out on Atlantic patrol.  In other words, it was convenient for Britain to have that seaplane base on Lough Erne and others in other parts of the Six-County area and the fact that that was made possible made neutrality possible without disaster to Great Britain or us.</P>

      <P>I suggest that I reserve some of these unused explosives <Col N="490" /> for future use on an appropriate occasion.</P>
      <P>There was considerable discussion in the other House about sterling balances.  The protagonists in that discussion were Deputy McGilligan and the Minister for Local Government and, in reading the debate, I got the impression that, while there was a lot of hard facts in what Deputy McGilligan had to say, nevertheless the whole atmosphere of his speech was definitely misleading and, to a careless reader as somebody said, perhaps, even mischievous. Deputy McGilligan seemed to argue that we should refuse to increase our exports unless we had some guarantee that we could obtain imports in equal measure, and suggested that it would be a sound approach to cut down some of the things we export, if we did not get satisfaction, in the way of buying equivalent imports.  I hope I am not misrepresenting the Deputy, but if that was his point I must say that it is one with which I disagree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection it is not without interest that Deputy McGilligan rather gave the impression that while sterling balances built up in the last five years were all very well, they were not going to be of much practical use to us in the near future.  A careless listener to his speech might have got the impression that the British were not too anxious to honour their bonds, so to speak, in respect to balances, and that I think was a very undesirable point of view to suggest.  However that may be, it is interesting to know that on the occasion of a former debate in this House, the Minister seemed to share the views of Deputy McGilligan about the temporary worthlessness of sterling assets.  If Senators look at Volume 25, No. 23, page 424, they will find these remarks of the present Minister: &ldquo;Are the farmers of this country simply to go on piling up bits of paper&rdquo;?  That may have been the Minister's view then.  I have reason to believe that he is a loyal member of the Executive Council now, and that the principle of collective responsibility holds good and, therefore, I believe he now shares the point of view of the <Col N="491" /> Minister for Local Government, rather than the point of view of Deputy McGilligan which was his own point of view in February, 1941.  It is a case of living and learning or listening and learning, of becoming more grown up politically and financially, and personally I congratulate the Minister on that.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy McGilligan's approach was the right approach.  It was sound sense to point out that we simply have to produce, and to export our surplus agricultural produce, and things being as they are we had to take part payment for the exports in the form of increasing sterling balances.  In fact, what we did, and what we had to do, was to make, as a community, a long-term loan to Great Britain of about £100,000,000 in the course of the last five years, in addition to the other hundreds of millions of pounds we had already lent or invested in that country.  I saw that process taking place all through the war years, and I was gratified to see it happening, because I thought it represented Government policy, and as something that we should be very pleased to see taking place.  I think the best attitude from that point of view would be now to say to Great Britain: &ldquo;We were glad to be able to do that much for you in your time of need, and your victory was also ours and paid us handsomely, even though we never saw a pennyworth in exchange for that money.&rdquo;  I think if we wait we will see every penny of it.  If we said that, perhaps, it would be looked upon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I say that there is nothing to be ashamed of in our record here.  It compares very favourably with some of the neutral countries and with some so-called belligerent countries.  There is nothing to be ashamed of in the flight of the wild geese, and personally I hope every one of them will come back to this country as doves of peace and goodwill.  Getting back to the question of sterling balances which we have added to in Great Britain, these are part of a total sum of £5,000,000,000 of sterling balances acquired during the war years by various countries which supplied Britain with goods.  In addition, if I remember aright, Britain had sacrificed foreign assets amounting to about <Col N="493" /> £1,000,000,000 in the first or second year of the war, before the American policy of lend-lease was adopted.  Britain is not going to be able to liquidate or to pay off the whole of that £5,000,000,000 in a year or two years or even in 20 years, but sooner or later I am quite sure honour and policy will require Britain to make good the repayment of that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is recognised in the most recent edition of the Bretton Woods proposal, that Britain will not be compelled to liquidate these wartime balances at the option of the creditors in the course of the next five years, but that they will remain frozen or semi-frozen, and that it will be a matter of policy and negotiation if we are to gain any advantage from the existence of these inflated balances in the next five years.  The fact that Britain's position is not now so strong from the point of view of international credit as it was five years ago gives her an interest&mdash;which is also an interest of ours&mdash;in buying as much as she can from the sterling area, including ourselves, and limiting other necessary purchases that she must make in hard currency countries.  Recently there was much talk of agreement between Canada and Britain for a considerable increase in the export of Canadian bacon to Britain over the next few years, and a continuation of the expansion of exports during the war years. That, of course, is all very well.  But, looking at it from the point of view of international financial balances, it is extremely improbable that Britain will be able to buy millions of pounds worth of bacon from Canada over every year of the next ten or 20 years. It is extremely likely that she will be more disposed to buy increased quantities of bacon and other things from us who are in the sterling area, provided we produce these things.  It is Britain's policy to buy anything she can from the like of us and it ought to be our policy to increase our exports as much as we can in the course of the next few years and, if necessary, to get part payment for these increased exports in the form of capital goods that we need so much for the development of our agricultural industry. Indeed it is not only a question <Col N="494" /> of capital goods.  We need other things as well which are very short, for example, coal, petrol, cotton, tea and rubber.  But most of all we need tractors and other agricultural machines and the various machines which are necessary for developing industrial production and replacing plant worn out during the last few years.</P>
    <P>Now, if we want to get these things, our best hope of getting them is to say that our policy is to increase exports and that we are prepared to take part payment for the increased exports in the form of increased imports of capital goods.  We may as well face the fact that it will take Great Britain a matter of perhaps two generations or 50 years to complete the liquidation of that enormously inflated total of sterling balances that she had to owe in defence of her liberty and ours.  I think we can, in terms of a policy of increasing production both for home consumption and export, contemplate a future in which we shall be able to have full employment and in fact in which we may have to face a scarcity of man-power for making adequate use of our national resources.</P>
    <P>Looking back over the past five years, although I have criticised the policy of the Government on many occasions and in many respects, I should like to say now that, taking them by and large, they have not made quite such a mess of things as I thought they were going to make and that our national economy is not too badly fixed with a view to the problem of post-emergency reconstruction. There has been a very desirable redistribution of income in favour of the agricultural interest as against the rest of us.  That has reversed a situation which developed in the opposite direction during the economic war period.  That being so, the farmer is now in the market to a greater extent than before and any industrial development which takes place from now on will find the farmer a purchaser to a much greater extent than was possible for him on former occasions.  Therefore, such an industrial development will probably be based on a sounder economic foundation.</P>
    <P>We have had in the last few years a <Col N="495" /> certain amount of inflation owing to causes into which I will not now go in detail.  But it has been a profit inflation rather than an income inflation and the Government have succeeded in keeping down the natural tendency for wages to rise to a truly remarkable extent.  The increase in wages here in industrial occupations has been much less than it has been in Britain.  I think in Britain the wages increased by some 45 per cent.  During the war period here in industry they have increased in a very much smaller proportion. But, in agriculture, the increase in wages was in a proportion much more akin to the 40 or 50 per cent. margin of increase in the case of Great Britain.  That being so, our wage structure in industry now is such as to make it possible for a substantial fall in prices to take place in the immediate post-war period without destroying the possibility of profit or without dislocating our national economy.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, agricultural income can only be maintained in the next few years, when things get cheaper, if agriculture is able greatly to extend the volume of output and sell a greater volume of goods at a smaller price per unit.  That I think should be the principle of agricultural and public policy.  Also I think that, as agricultural wages have increased so considerably, one of the objectives of national policy should be, if possible, not to make any effort to scale down those wages, but to make possible the continued existence of that higher level by a greater efficiency in agriculture and a greater volume of output per man per acre.  If our agriculture can manage to maintain and continue paying a greatly increased level of wages, it will have achieved something well worth while and there will be a better balance of income as between the agricultural working classes and the urban working classes.</P>
    <P>One final word.  The Minister for Local Government, in the course of his remarks, conveyed the impression that he thought British monetary policy would aim at bringing about an appreciation of sterling.  I do not know whether he meant by that that British policy would seek to bring about a <Col N="496" /> higher value of the £ in terms of the dollar, or whether he had in view that British policy would seek to bring about a gradual fall in what is called the general level of prices.  There is one thing I am certain of and that is, that Britain will not attempt any such foolish deflationary policy after this war as she did after the last war and that the last thing in the minds of those people would be to bring about a gradual and progressive fall in the general level of prices.</P>
    <P>The cost of living in Great Britain has risen to something over 30 per cent. above the level in 1939.  It has only been kept down to a relatively low level by reason of the subsidising of the necessities of life to the extent of some £200,000,000 per year.  Apart from these subsidies, the cost of living in Great Britain would be 50 per cent. higher than it was in 1939.  Personally, I think that if the British can manage in the course of the next few years to abolish the subsidies on the necessities of life and, at the same time, to have the cost of living no higher than 50 per cent. above the level which prevailed in 1939, they will have done quite well. I think it is utterly improbable that they will attempt anything more difficult than that, though some people may maintain that they may have to tolerate a level of prices higher than 50 per cent. above 1939.</P>
    <P>The cost of living here is about 70 per cent. above what existed in 1939. But in our case the subsidising of the necessities of life from the public purse is not practised to anything like the same extent relatively as it is in Great Britain.  Consequently, our relatively high prices come more out of the consumer's pocket and less out of the tax-payer's pocket.  That being so, I see no difficulty about our price level, now 70 per cent. above the 1939 level, failing to some 50 per cent. above the 1939 level and remaining stable at about that figure, in which case it will be back again in line with the British price level and the purchasing power of the Irish pound will be exactly the same as the purchasing power of the British pound.  So that if we can assume the pursuing of a policy of good will and friendly relations with our neighbour, based on mutual needs and <Col N="497" /> relationships, I see no reason why we should not face the future with confidence. We can help Britain as well as ourselves in this matter, and if we make the approach in the right manner we can solve many of our difficulties and make others that might appear to be insoluble at the moment much easier of solution than they were before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a small matter to which I wish to call the attention of the Minister for Finance, and when I refer to it as a home for lost dogs, I am using the phrase literally, and not metaphorically, as it is so often used.  In the year 1906, by the Dogs Acts, there was put on the police, as they then were, and the Gárda as they now are, the obligation to take up stray dogs, maintain them for seven days and, if they could not find an owner within that period, to destroy them.  By that Act the police were also empowered to make an arrangement, with any society which kept a register, whereby they could hand over to the society the task of maintaining the dogs for the necessary seven days and of eventually destroying them, if they could not be sold or returned to their owners.  In the same year an arrangement was made between the police and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals that a sum of £400 in each year should be paid to the society for keeping the dogs for the necessary seven days and for the expenses of destruction after that.  There was an overriding maximum of 4/6 a dog, and it seems to have worked out at 6d. a day, and 1/- for the cost of destruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, that sum of £400 which was agreed to in 1906 has remained unaltered and unincreased until the present year.  I need not labour the point that the expenses have doubled.  Not only have the expenses doubled, but I find that in the year 1906 the number of dogs collected and dealt with by the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was 2,040, while in the year 1944 it had risen to 4,888, and for the last ten years it has never fallen below 3,000, except for one year, in which it was 2,910.  So you get the position that the expenses of keeping <Col N="498" /> and destroying the dogs have doubled and the number of dogs which have got to be dealt with has also doubled.  In addition to that, greater work has been put upon the society who now have to collect the dogs.  Nevertheless this sum of £400 which was arranged in 1906 has remained unaltered and unincreased, although expenditure is about four times what it then was.</P>
    <P>The position which has arisen is this. The expenditure, as I say, has more than doubled and, as a result of endeavouring to perform the functions which, by the Act, were primarily assigned to the police and which the police, under the provisions of the Act, handed over to the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the society have run into debt to the extent of £2,288 in the last ten years&mdash; that is, to comply with their undertaking to the police&mdash;and that sum of £2,288 debt is after crediting to this purpose £648 of legacies which were left to the society.  I think I have only to tell these facts to the Minister for Finance to induce him to lend a kindly ear, because to suggest that an agree ment which was made in 1906, when prices were half what they are now and when the number of dogs dealt with was half what it is now, should not receive some modification and that the sum paid should not receive a supplement, is clearly unjust, especially where the society have run into debt in endeavouring to perform a function which primarily was cast on the police. I have spoken to the Minister for Justice on this matter and I think he is entirely in favour of that grant being increased, but of course, although originally it was paid out of the dog licences fund, now, by an arrangement under our legislature, it is paid out of the general fund, and so the consent of the Minister for Finance has to be obtained before any increase can be made.  I appeal to him not to allow a charitable society to run into debt through an agreement made in 1906 when conditions were totally different from what they are now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Had I caught your eye, Sir, a few moments ago, I think I would have got myself into a jam, because it seems to me that I have now <Col N="499" /> got stuck in a rut between Senator Johnston's lost Protestants and Senator Kingsmill Moore's stray dogs, and that puts me into a quandary as to what we can discuss on the Bill, where we must stop and where we can begin. Perhaps, however, I should say that, like Senator Johnston, I am very glad to see the Minister here in his present position, not for the reason given by Senator Johnston, but for the reason that I remember that the Minister at an earlier period in his life&mdash;and I hope at this moment&mdash;held views in regard to economic questions affecting this country, totally at variance with those expressed by Senator Johnston. The Senator, I think, hopes that the Minister has become a convert to what some people call orthodox economics and what others might call British economics.  I hope that is not so.  I am not going to suggest that we should rush the Minister into any declarations now.  His views will probably colour policy over a period more suitably than by merely making declarations which at this moment might be attractive to one school or another but which in the long run may have no significance at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter with which we are dealing, of course, is the appropriation of a very large sum of money&mdash;the appropriation of over £50,000,000&mdash;and it seems to me that we have got so accustomed to an ever-increasing charge for State administration that we pay little heed to the magnitude of the sum with which we are now dealing.  Might I say, however, that this Bill represents a sum of more than £1,000,000 a week levied by the State for the purposes of national administration?  To that total there must be added sums collected by the local authorities for the purposes of local administration.  So that, when both these sums are totted up and added together, we are faced with providing a sum levied on the community which substantially exceeds £1,000,000 a week.  A question we should consider now is where that money is coming from, who pays it.  National income has not increased.  In figures, yes. Pre-war, that is, in 1938, national income was estimated at approximately <Col N="500" /> £150,000,000.  In his Budget speech in May, the Minister for Finance estimated the amount at £250,000,000. If we are to relate money to goods, that sum of £250,000,000 represents a smaller national income than the figure with which we were dealing in 1938.</P>
    <P>We have reached a stage in which more than 1/5th of the total national income is absorbed by taxation.  I do not desire to make the case that taxation should not increase.  I am not even making the case that £50,000,000, £60,000,000 or £75,000,000 is more than we can afford in certain circumstances.  I am making the case that, unless the pool of wealth out of which the taxes are drawn is increased, the growing burden of taxation must inflict injuries on an ever-widening section of the community. Some days ago, I looked at figures relating to taxation over a period of years in connection with a speech which was delivered in 1929&mdash; I am not sure whether it was a speech or a contributed article.  Its author was the then Leader of the Opposition in Dáil Éireann and is now head of the Government.  Writing in January, 1929, he pointed out that taxation in the Twenty-Six Counties was £6 19s. 5d. per head and he drew attention to the increase from 1914 to 1929.  The then Leader of the Opposition claimed that that tax burden of £6 19s. 5d. per head was an intolerable one, which the community were utterly unable to bear.  In the last year before the recent war, that figure had reached £10 3s. 8d. per head and, in the present year, the figure is £17 per head.  That sum of £17 is coming out of a pool of wealth which has not increased. Actually, the Minister for Finance, in his Budget speech, pointed out that, during the war, the volume of production in agriculture had decreased somewhat.</P>
    <P>I am not putting it to the Minister that this whole thing must be changed overnight but I am drawing attention to the fact, which should not be overlooked, that unless the situation with which we are dealing now is faced up to and handled in a drastic manner by the Minister and the Government, the day will come when there will be a <Col N="501" /> crisis.  That crisis will come at the moment to which Senator Johnston referred&mdash;when the prices of agricultural produce fall.  I do not at all subscribe to the view of Senator Johnston regarding the effects of a fall in prices.  He rather suggests that there can be an adjustment in prices without any drop in wages.  That is true of Britain because of subsidies amounting to £200,000,000 a year.  But it is not true here.  If prices fall, the main effect will be a decrease in agricultural incomes, unless there is an adjustment which would enable the farmer to produce more at less cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to pursue the point but I think I could give very good reasons why, at this stage, Senator Johnston and those who agree with him take this optimistic view.  I do not want to discuss the matter now; it can be discussed on another <Col N="502" /> occasion.  Their optimism rests, I think, on a very slender foundation. Another point in connection with taxation to which I should like to refer is this: in this country, a very large proportion of the State revenue is derived from levies on the poorer section of the community.  I have not checked up the figures recently but, at one stage, almost 70 per cent. of the State revenue was derived from indirect taxation, imposed on commodities used by the masses of the people.  In Great Britain, on the contrary, only about 35 per cent. of the State revenue is derived from indirect taxation, with the result that, as British expenditure increased during the war, the masses of the people were getting a larger share of the national income and the wealthy classes were paying an ever-expanding share of the State taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, I refer to certain figures published in <i>Hansard</i> for the 18th March, 1941.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer was supplying information as to the effect of the Finance Act then in force on certain sections of the community.  He pointed out that a person with an income of £50,000 a year would pay in income-tax £21,085 a year and in surtax £20,569, so that the State was taking away from that individual, in income-tax and surtax, a total sum of £41,654, out of an income of £50,000, this income being, of course, unearned. That left the millionaire&mdash;because he would require to be virtually a millionaire to have an annual income of £50,000&mdash;with a net income of £8,346 and the Chancellor of the Exchequer made a calculation as to what sum that person would require to spend on insurance in order to meet the charges for death duties, so as to preserve his estate intact.  The figure would be £56,802 a year, showing clearly that the wealthy classes, that is to say, the higher ranges of incomes in Britain, cannot be preserved intact in any set of circumstances.  A man with a net income of £8,346 a year is not able to pay £56,802 in insurance premiums.  What is the position here? Quite a small section of the people, some 2,500, have incomes amounting, <Col N="503" /> roughly, to £10,000,000 a year, representing £200,000,000 worth of property. That section is contributing proportionately much less to the State revenue than the section that is earning £2 or £3 a week in wages.  As a matter of fact, a person in receipt of an old age pension or a widow's pension is paying a considerable proportion of that pension in duty on taxable commodities.</P>
    <P>A moment ago I made some reference to agricultural production.  It seems to me that whether we are able to bear the burden of taxation which, of necessity, must fall on the community, will depend altogether on the extent to which we can expand agricultural production.  More than 50 per cent. of the people gainfully employed here are engaged in agriculture and a very large number of our industries are associated, directly or indirectly, with agricultural production.  Therefore, it is important to see how agricultural production has fared and is faring.  I made a calculation recently as to what was the tendency in agricultural production during the war.  Taking the volume of production in 1938-39 as 100, the figure for 1943-44 would be 87.1, so that actually during the period of the war, up to last March 12 months, the volume of agricultural production had fallen by 11 per cent., and has been falling over a period of years.  In 1929, according to the article to which I have referred, Mr. de Valera calculated that the application of the Fianna Fáil policy, when they got into office, would increase agricultural production by £11,000,000 a year.  The fact is it has decreased by 11 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>These are interesting aspects.  The net fact remains that the production is not there, that our income is less, and our taxation is greater.  Whatever the excuses may be, the net result is that certain sections of our community are, and must be, poorer than they were ten years ago.  They cannot overcome that.  It is all right to tell me that <Col N="504" /> there are less fertilisers and that there are other defects, but I am anxious to know what steps are being taken to counteract these deficiencies.  If no effective steps are being taken to counteract them, the position of the community must deteriorate from year to year.  It is, of course, deteriorating. Why are the people leaving the country in thousands?  Anybody can see the stream of people waiting outside the British Permit Office for permission to leave Ireland even though the war is over.  For weeks I have seen queues, regulated by the Gárdaí, waiting for an opportunity to go into the British Permit Office to get permission to leave Ireland.</P>
      <P>With regard to employment, there will be different points of view.  I am prepared to accept that, in the circumstances through which we have passed during the last six years, it would be a physical impossibility to maintain the volume of employment in industrial and commercial occupations.  Nobody would profess to think that could be done.  But I am not prepared to accept the view that there should be a decrease in the volume of agricultural employment.  Again, in the article to which I have referred, the Leader of the Opposition in 1929 calculated that the adoption by this country of the Fianna Fáil policy would increase by 12,500 persons the number engaged in agriculture.  What has happened? There are now 40,000 fewer people engaged in agriculture than there were in 1929.  There is no explanation and no remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were told that that was due to war conditions, good and well.  We could then look for the method by which the process could be arrested after the war, but, as a matter of fact, in the inter-censal period, 1926-1936, the number of persons engaged in agriculture decreased by 37,500.  That was before the war, and the number kept on decreasing.  Notwithstanding compulsory tillage in the war years there has been a decrease in the number of persons engaged in agriculture. There were fewer employed in agriculture and in industry and, obviously, there must be fewer in the professions and in the tertiary <Col N="505" /> industries.  Against that we have an enormous increase in the volume of money in circulation.  What has been its impact on our economy?  Does it not mean that our rural and town workers, for whom we are either unable or unwilling to provide jobs, are leaving this country by the thousand and sending home to their dependents and relatives claims on our home production?  Does it not mean that if an agricultural worker from County Mayo goes to England, gets a job there at £5 a week and sends home £3, he is establishing a claim on our production amounting to £3 a week in favour of his dependents, who are producing nothing whatever for this country?  The worker is producing wealth or goods for Britain and in return for that service to Britain he is establishing a claim against our production to the extent of £2 or £3 a week.</P>
    <P>We are, therefore, in this position, that we have attained a fictitious notion of prosperity; we have got the notion that if there are plenty of postal orders and money orders hanging around we are wealthy, but what is really happening is that these documents represent claims to wealth which must be met by wealth produced in this country.  There is nowhere else it can be produced.  All these remittances coming from Britain, while they may be of great value, and, beyond all doubt, are of considerable value to the recipients, mean an extension of our foreign balances which may or may not represent goods in future.  Senator Johnston in this matter, too, is an optimist.  He tells us that these are as good as gold, that all these moneys, amounting probably to £450,000,000, lying to our credit in England are just as good as if they were gold, steel, cotton and all the other things we need.</P>

      <P>If our assets are good investments it means that we probably have in sight an income of £20,000,000 a year.  Let us examine this for a moment.  It means, on Senator Johnston's argument, that Britain will be able to supply goods to the extent of £1,000,000, £2,000,000, £3,000,000 or probably, £5,000,000 a year over and above the value of the goods she gets from us from day to day, but that will not pay even the interest on present investments.</P>

      <P>As neither of us is a prophet, I do not think we ought to hold up the discussion.  It is, at any rate, worth noting that, notwithstanding his natural tendency to see Britain from the best angle, he is not overenthusiastic about the results of our trading relations with that great Empire during the past five years.  I rather gather that his view is shared by members of the Government.  I gather from speeches by certain Ministers that there is almost unbounded faith, not alone in the honesty of Great Britain, but in her ability to discharge her obligations promptly and faithfully.  Some people in this country have adopted as their theme song: &ldquo;There will always be an England.&rdquo; There may be, but I do not <Col N="507" /> think there will always be an England of the kind talked about in the past. The bulk of the British writers themselves are very careful to point out that if Britain is to discharge her obligations to her own people which she has undertaken in legislation and in White Papers, she must increase her current production and current exports by 50 per cent.</P>

      <P>I am accepting the 50 per cent. and wondering where the goods are to come from to liquidate old debts.  If we cannot get our debts liquidated, the net result of our trading activities for the past six years is that we have given £100,000,000 worth of our goods for nothing.  That is the net result and I want somebody to give some proof that I am wrong.  If we cannot get goods, either from Britain or some other country willing to accept sterling, in exchange for the goods we sold in the last six years to Britain, we have given those goods or, put in another way, we have made a forced contribution of £100,000,000 to Britain's war effort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Johnston is very enthusiastic about the victories.  I have yet to learn who are the victors.  We have heard all this before.  After the last war, we were told about the great victory for democracy and about homes for heroes, but we remember the labour exchanges, the workhouses, the jails and the convict ships.  I do not take that view.  I want to see more of the peace efforts before I accept the view that there has been a victory for anybody so far.</P>

      <P>What about the concentration camps?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not unfamiliar; we had a few of them in this country. A big number of people in the country are well aware of the nature of concentration camps and a fair number in this House have probably seen the insides of them, so the less we say on <Col N="508" /> that subject, the better for our peace of mind.</P>
      <P>There is one other aspect of this question of our sterling balances to which I want to draw attention.  I should like to know whether our sterling assets can be used at all to buy not merely goods from Britain but from elsewhere?  Certain people mentioned to me recently two incidents which disturbed me and which, I think, will be disturbing to everybody in the House.  One had to do with a deal entered into by some importers in this country concerning the importation of goods from Brazil.  The importers concerned made all the arrangements up to a point.  They arranged for the purchase of the cargo and for shipping space&mdash;a least, that is the information given to me&mdash;but at that point some Government Department intervened and said: &ldquo;You stand by; this is where we come in&rdquo;.  The goods, however, did not come in.  No goods were obtainable and the whole thing fell through.</P>
      <P>Another transaction mentioned to me had to do with the importation of timber, which is of tremendous importance.  Our housing programme will be influenced very largely by whether or not timber will be available, and I am informed that quite recently some timber importers made a deal with certain Swedish firms for the importation of Swedish timber. The deal fell through because the Swedes were prepared to take payment in gold only and were not prepared to take payment in sterling. That is the story told to me in the last few days.  I do not know how true it is, but it is the kind of thing which is being talked of amongst people who are normally business people and not politicians.  They do not mention it merely as a matter of politics, but as an explanation of the difficulties with which we shall be confronted when we start on our housing programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do know that a year or two years ago a difficulty arose concerning the importation of goods from Switzerland. I do not want to discuss this matter because it has, from other <Col N="509" /> angles, an aspect that I dislike.  I know, however, that certain interests in this country bought goods from Switzerland&mdash;I think £10,000 worth. The Government refused them sterling to pay for these goods.  At a later stage, the Swiss exporters were willing to deliver the goods on credit provided the importer lodged the amount concerned in the Bank of Ireland, Dublin.  Permits were, however, refused.  The goods were actually in Dublin and were subsequently returned to Switzerland.  I was rather perturbed about this and I made some inquiries.  I was told it was not the policy of the Government to release sterling for the payment of goods of this kind because the goods were not required for domestic use&mdash; they would probably be resold.  I make this point.  I said: &ldquo;Very well, if these goods come in here and they are not sold to our citizens, they will be there after the war and at least we will have goods rather than sterling in London.  On the other hand, if they are sold, as suggested, they will be sold to visitors from England or Belfast and will be paid for in sterling so that in such event the money will be returned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These representations had no effect and the Government shut down completely on the import of these goods. That raises in my mind the questions whether, in fact, the assets we hold in London are likely to be available to buy goods outside the sterling area or even within the sterling area outside Great Britain?  These are very important considerations.  Senator Johnston tells us that Britain will be unable to do more than to liquidate one, three, four or five millions per year of these large sums which we hold in London.  But nobody has told us what will be the effect if we endeavour to utilise our sterling balances to buy goods outside Great Britain and outside the sterling area.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deal at any length with certain other matters which were raised in the debate and which I think deserve consideration but I should like to say finally that in my view&mdash;I think that in this view I can claim the support of the Minister at one stage in <Col N="510" /> his career&mdash;so long as we maintain our present relations with sterling, our whole economy is going to deteriorate. All our efforts to improve conditions in this country, all our efforts to provide employment in this country will be frustrated.  Senator Sir John Keane asks what is the alternative.  To him I make this reply: to do what every other country including the countries of the British Commonwealth have done, that is to regulate the relations between our currency and that of Great Britain in our own interest. You see, it is not merely parity with sterling we have here.  We have parity at 100 per cent.  Britain determines whether there is to be inflation or deflation and we are helpless in her hands.  If the British decide in their own interests, that the British £ should buy twice as much food in 1946 as in 1945, we have no alternative, no safeguard, no remedy except to sell at her price.  That, I think, is not an unfair description of the situation.  Nobody here will quarrel with it.  But that policy is not accepted in Canada, South Africa, Australia or New Zealand.  Each of these countries determines the relationship between its currency and that of Great Britain. It fluctuates within limits, no doubt, but it is not a 100 per cent. parity. When Australia and New Zealand first went off parity, they fixed the exchange rate at £110 of local currency to £100 British.  When they found that the margin was not sufficient to enable them sell their agricultural products at remunerative prices on the British market, they widened the margin to £125 local currency to £100 British. Strangely enough when they did so, Denmark did the same thing and Holland followed suit, showing clearly the effect on the export trade of these countries of the change in relationship between local currency and sterling.</P>
    <P>I claim support for the view that this policy is bad for Ireland.  I have already quoted from other aspects of a statement published by Mr. de Valera in 1929.  I should like to quote finally this statement because I believe it was true then and that it is true now.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The financial policy which had <Col N="511" /> such disastrous results for this country was dictated by the Bank of England and the British Government with an eye exclusively on British interests.  The control of our financial policy still remains with the Bank of England and through the Bank of England with the British Government and we may be sure that it will be used in the future, as in the past, without the slightest regard for our interests.  It is vital that the power which can be and has been used to destroy the wealth laboriously created by Irish hands and to condemn to exile or starvation hundreds of thousands of Irishmen and women should be wrested from foreign control&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I subscribe to that view.  I believe it is as true now as it was then.  The law has not been changed.  So long as Section 47 remains in the Currency Act, it does not matter whether we have a Central Bank or a Currency Commission.  It does not matter what other expedients we have resorted to. The fact remains that our economy is dominated by British financial influence so long as Section 47 remains in the Currency Act.</P>

      <P>Freedom.  All I ask is freedom, that the Irish Government should be as free as the British Government is to change its monetary policy overnight.  There must be an Act of Parliament to do that.  The Irish Government cannot change its financial policy without coming to the Oireachtas and amending the existing law.  I claim freedom to change it overnight.  In 1931 the British Government went off the gold standard at 10 o'clock at night.  In the morning everybody was faced with a new situation.  Everybody remembers that the Government of Ramsay Macdonald resigned in order to maintain the supremacy of the gold standard.  A couple of months afterwards the British National Government decided on abandoning the gold standard.  They did that at 10 o'clock at night without telling anybody, and they were perfectly free to do it.</P>

There was a statement in the House of Commons in Belfast yesterday.

I believe that view to be sound.  I believe that, so long as we are tied to the British monetary system, all the efforts of this Government, and of every Government which succeeds them, to improve conditions for the masses of our people will be frustrated and destroyed.

I will be forgiven, perhaps, if I express my pleasure on the grounds of the old saying about the one sinner doing penance, as it is perfectly clear now to all of us that the Taoiseach has materially altered the views which he expressed on those occasions, and that he and his Party, in the words of our ordinary language, have learned sense.

Senator Baxter started off this dissertation on finance, and I am afraid, quite frankly, that I was not able to follow exactly all he said.  I have no doubt that he will, perhaps with some justification, tell me that because of my conversation I would not let him develop his remarks in his <Col N="514" /> own way.  Perhaps he would have some justification for raising that objection. But, so far as I could understand him, it appeared to me that he was advocating a policy which might be described as a sort of half-baked Douglasism.</P>

      <P>Oh no.  I was, of course, referring to Major Douglas&mdash; not to Senator Douglas.  I really thought that we had got away from that type of Major Douglas propaganda so far as economics and financial affairs are concerned.  It does appear to me, at any rate, that, so far as financial and perhaps trade dealings are concerned, the one place in which the Government have fallen down is not along the lines suggested by Senator Baxter but because they have always preferred to get someone to do a job that they should have done themselves. People would think very little of me as a solicitor if, when there was a question of settling an important case, I sent a clerk or an office boy to do it, and people think very little of Governments if, when there is any question of making settlements, the Ministers who are members of those Governments do not go and make an effort to effect a settlement instead of sending higher or lower civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been one of the great tragedies of the past ten years, and particularly of the past five years, that there has been no effort whatever made by the present Government ever to face up to their responsibilities as Ministers outside this country, no effort ever to face up to the responsibility to do their own bargaining, their own negotiating, instead of getting other people to do the negotiating for them.  No matter how efficient or how able a civil servant may be, if he goes to a foreign country to put our point of view to the people of that country he will only be received by civil servants, and when he gets up against a point of view that differs on a matter of policy he will be told straightaway by his opposite number in the other country: &ldquo;I cannot deal with that.  It is a matter of policy.  I must discuss <Col N="515" /> it with my Minister&rdquo;, and there is no real heart-to-heart talk.  All of us know perfectly well that, if we want to get business done, the best way to get it done is by the two people who want to hammer out the different sides of a bargain sitting down one on either side of the table and discussing the matter on face-to-face terms, rather than getting it done by intermediaries, by people who have not got the full authority that everyone likes to have when going in to make a bargain.  If I were to try and make a bargain for anybody, I would make quite certain that I was not going to be put into the position of making one with somebody whose hands were tied.  For that reason I suggest that, to put it mildly, it will be disappointing and, perhaps, disastrous for us in the post-emergency years that we have not Ministers who will do their job outside this country, quite apart from what they do inside.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy made some reference to the question of building and to the refusal, so far as I could follow him, of moneys to pay for Swedish imports. The information that I have from those interested in importing timber is that, at least two years ago, all the neutral countries, as well as Britain, made arrangements to import their timber requirements for building purposes as soon as shipping can be made available. I also have information that our Government was asked to do what other countries were doing, namely, to send delegations to try to negotiate timber purchases on the same basis as those other neutral countries, namely, that the timber would be bought and would be ready for shipment when shipping became available to the purchasing country.  That call was not listened to, and now&mdash;when I say &ldquo;now&rdquo; I mean in recent months&mdash; when we are looking for timber we are told that the timber countries, Sweden and British Columbia, have already contracted for the sale of their full output for a great number of years ahead, and that, in consequence, the only way in which we can get timber is through the British control.  As a result of our lack of foresight, we are going to have to pay from 10 to 15 per <Col N="516" /> cent. more for the timber we import than we would have had to pay if we had made our arrangements in time. As a matter of fact, the other neutral countries had delegations in British Columbia two years ago making arrangements for their timber contracts. That, as I understand it, is the position so far as timber is concerned.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I want to bring to the Minister's notice. During the past four years there has been in England an expansion such, perhaps, as has never been seen elsewhere, in the provision of blast furnaces for the production of steel. With the end of the war, those furnaces which had been keyed up to full productive capacity are going to find a sudden stop in the demand for their output.  Would it not be possible to see whether we could not take advantage of that and get them to make for us some type of light steel roofing?  I am told by people engaged in the trade that such a thing is quite possible, and that by doing so we could find a suitable substitute for a lot of the ordinary 5 by 3 and 7 by 3 timber roofing heretofore used so extensively in house building.  In the opinion of people who understand the business these short light strips of steel could easily be obtained, now that the English blast furnaces are not engaged on the production of tanks and other armaments required for war purposes.  I urge on the Minister to consider the problem from that angle, and see whether anything can be done in regard to it.</P>
    <P>This morning I was told from two sources a rather disturbing story&mdash;I was not able to get further confirmation of it&mdash;about a concern that enjoys a certain monopoly in this country. This is a matter about which we ought to be very careful.  Senators are aware that Córas Iompair Éireann enjoys a monopoly of the transport of the country.  In that situation steps should be taken to ensure that the use of its service is open and freely available to every citizen on exactly equal terms.  I am told that the practice of the company is not to issue booking tickets more than one week in advance. <Col N="517" /> I am also told that on last Monday, when many people went at an early hour to make booking arrangements to go down to Galway next Monday, they were told that all the tickets had been sold, and that in face of the fact that no queues were to be seen around the station.  I am further informed that people through the country have tickets to sell.  That same thing occurred on a previous occasion, and, at the time, we all hoped that there would not be a recurrence of it.  I am raising the matter now so as to make it quite certain that, as a result of this publicity, steps will be taken by the appropriate Minister to ensure that there will not be any type of such discrimination in the future, and that the utmost care will be taken to see that there cannot be what amounts to profiteering in transport.</P>
    <P>My last point is a small one.  It is appropriate that I should make it to the Minister for Finance as his Department is the head of the Civil Service. This is a matter in respect to which all Government Departments are, I am afraid, sometimes prone to err.  When a person writes to a Government Department he naturally, in the first place, gets a reply saying that the matter is going to have attention. That reply has on it a reference number, but in at least half the cases there is no reference whatever of any sort, kind or description by which the receiver can identify them.  It happens frequently that solicitors, and other people engaged in business, may write three or four times in the one day to a particular Government Department. They get three replies saying that the matter will have attention, but when nothing happens and you go along to the Department to see if the matter you are interested in can be expedited, you are asked for the reference number. You hand in the three replies, and you are then told that the Department cannot say which of the three relates to that particular Department: that there is not sufficient indication to identify any of the replies.  In the long run that means a good deal more trouble for the people concerned as well as for the particular Department. I suggest that that sort of thing leads to a lot of unnecessary friction in <Col N="518" /> business which could easily be removed, and that it is a matter which ought to receive attention.</P>

      <P>I have been very much impressed by the points made by many of the speakers who preceded me this evening, especially those in regard to the question of the liquidation of our sterling assets in Britain-While I have no doubt that a settlement of that matter will be adjusted at some time to the satisfaction of all concerned I am inclined to agree with Senator Baxter that the best evidence of a desire on the part of people in Britain to have a speedy settlement of that issue would be an increase of the supplies to this country of the commodities for which we depend on Britain.  Tea is one of those commodities. The scarcity of tea in this country has brought untold hardship to the vast majority of the people who depend on tea as their only stimulant. Since tea has been rationed so strictly here, many people have become accustomed to drinking coffee, liberal supplies of which were made available, but the vast majority of the people will never become coffee-drinkers. The ease with which tea can be prepared makes it particularly useful and it is very difficult to find a substitute for it that can be prepared as readily.  Considering that since the end of the war in Europe Britain has been able to increase by 25 per cent. the tea ration which was four times the ration that has obtained here during the greater part of the emergency, it is rather strange that they cannot increase the tea supply to Éire seeing that we are mainly dependent on Britain for our tea supplies. That is a matter which could best be adjusted by personal contact and I trust the Minister, who I am sure appreciates the case of these people, will see if something can be done to have the tea ration increased in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We depend to a great extent also on Britain for supplies of boots <Col N="519" /> and shoes and the quality of these articles in use here during the past five or six years has been very inferior, especially in the case of boots made available for the little people. Frequent replacements have been necessary and even when the boots were sent for repairs, the leather put in was of a very inferior kind.  As a result, parents in many cases during the severe times of the year had to let children go barefooted, as they could not make the necessary replacements to keep their feet dry and warm.  I trust that something will be done to remedy that situation.  In regard to working men's shoes, the cost of these, when they were procurable, made them absolutely out of the question for the ordinary labourer, who would need to spend two weeks' wages to obtain a pair.  These matters call for immediate attention, as they are a source of hardship to the people directly concerned.  Every effort to redress their wants at the earliest possible moment would certainly be appreciated.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased when Senator Baxter referred to the rather arbitrary treatment given to the reasonable and just demands of the teaching profession.  The national teachers are responsible for the education of the vast majority of the children of this country and I am only stating a fact to which testimony has been borne by those competent to judge when I say they are doing the work extremely well.  There is evidence that their claims in the present instance are fair and just.  They have been backed by the Hierarchy, the Catholic provincial managers' associations and various sections of the community, all of whom have expressed their approval of the demands and their desire that the Government should effect a reasonable settlement.  However, beyond the promise that when the emergency is over something may be done, no assurance has been given by the Government that they mean to do anything in this matter.  At the present time the teachers are a very discontented body; things are not well in a country where the tutors of <Col N="520" /> youth are discontented.  I trust the Government will not wait for the passing of the emergency to listen to the very reasonable claims made by the teachers.</P>
    <P>It is on account of the emergency that the teachers find their present payments not adequate to meet the many calls on their resources and it is on account of the emergency that their claims have become so urgent.  I am only stating what many people know when I say they are dissatisfied at present and, notwithstanding the various tributes paid as to the manner in which they are doing their work and the appreciation made of the readiness with which they co-operated in the various emergency services, they are at times inclined to regard these compliments, especially those which come from the Government, as nothing but an insult, in the absence of any material response to their claims.  I hope the situation will not be left to develop to an extent that might render possible happenings that everybody in the country would deplore.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in Senator Douglas' remarks regarding the pension disparity in the case of certain classes of civil servants.  I was hoping that, before he went away from that point in his speech, he would refer to the very inadequate pension given to teacher pensioners throughout the country.  At the present time and for some time past, they have had to deprive themselves of many of the necessities of life, on account of the very inadequate pension paid to them. They as a class have contributed their own share in their own time to the various means by which our independence was secured and they are deserving of more compassionate treatment from a Government of their own countrymen.</P>
    <P>I notice in this Bill that a rather substantial amount is being made available to the Tourist Board.  I am anxious to know whether anything could be done through the Tourist Board to improve the catering accommodation for patrons of the railway services.  At Athlone, which is a very important junction, the catering at present is <Col N="521" /> primitive.  Hundreds of people, on the arrival of the train, have to fight for a place at a short counter only four feet in width and when they secure a cup of tea, they have to balance it as an equilibrist would to take it to a place of safety.  Regardless of the bad impression it makes on visitors to the country, it is not fair that our own people should be treated in this manner.  They are entitled to more consideration.  There is ample space for setting up accommodation where people could have refreshments in ease and comfort, instead of having to fight for them under these adverse circumstances. I trust now that I have drawn attention to this matter, it may open the eyes of those responsible to the fact that people are grumbling and to the certainty that, if something is not done, their grievances may take a very practical form.</P>

    <P>Apart from bringing that important matter to the notice of the Minister I do not know that I have much more to say.  It is not that I do not feel like talking, or that there is not a good deal to be said, but perhaps in view of everything the least said the better. I was not in for the earlier portion of the discussion, but since I did come in I do not think I heard very much that was of outstanding interest.  One sensible remark was made by Senator Duffy in the course of his speech, to the effect that he was not a prophet, and Senator Johnston immediately conceded that he also was not a prophet.  It seemed to me though that both agreed that the Minister for Finance is or ought to be a prophet, and that they expected he would be a prophet, when he comes to reply to the points raised by them.  One thing struck me during the debate, and that was insistence by one Senator at least on the claim that the Bank of England and the British Government are masters of our financial system.  In an indirect way there may be some truth in that.  But, in fact, it is not true.  This much is true; if we wish to trade with England certain financial consequences may flow from trading with her that we must accept. She does not compel us to trade with her.  I want to know where is the evidence that we are bound to tie ourselves up to sterling?  I also want to know, where is the evidence, apart <Col N="523" /> from trading with Britain, that any power exists on the part of the Bank of England or on the part of the British Government to regulate the monetary affairs of this country.</P>
    <P>We had long discussions in the Seanad not so long ago on the question of the sterling link and, in the course of these discussions, some four or five alternatives were put before the House.  To what extent have Senators interested in this problem examined these alternatives since; to what extent have they made up their minds that any one of these alternatives would be better than the present system?  If it occurred to us in the morning that it is not in our interest to continue to trade with Britain under the conditions at present existing, I do not know of anything to prevent us making any change we think fit.  That is a fact and it ought to be kept in mind. Senator Duffy was somewhat annoyed that the power to make a change in monetary policy rests with the Oireachtas.  He thinks the power should rest with the Government.  In other words, Senator Duffy thinks that in this matter we ought to put powers akin to those of a dictator into the hands of the Minister for Finance, or into the hands of the Government, a procedure that has been roundly denounced day in and day out both here and in the other House.  It is only right, should any change be called for, that it should be put before the Oireachtas, because any change in our monetary policy is not going to affect merely those with capital, but is going to affect trade unions, trade union funds, as well as beggars, to whatever extent they exist here.  It is only right and proper that the Oireachtas should have full power, if any changes are to be made; it is only right that they should be notified, because it is the Oireachtas should authorise changes rather than that they should be made by a Minister or by the Government.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the financial independence achieved by other States.  It is all very well to talk about other States but, as I mentioned more than once, what we should always do before we proceed to discuss <Col N="524" /> other States is to find out to what extent our conditions are comparable to the conditions of these other countries. Other States broke away from sterling.  These other States had considerable opportunities in alternative markets.  Even New Zealand was not tied so closely to the British market as we happened to be.  I am not saying that it is good for us to be so closely linked to the British market.  That however is a fact we have to face. There may be the opportunity of alternative markets in the days to come. I do not know but I hope there will be. I could prophesy of course but what use would that be?  I do not like referring to this matter but I think it must be referred to even though it seems mean to do so, but when a certain State is mentioned as having secured financial independence, how has it happened that that State had to come eventually to London to try to get financial assistance from the very people with whom they sought to break?  They got that assistance at a very high cost.  If the world had been normal they might have been able to do some other things that might have been a headline for us, as to what changes we might make in our best interests, but unfortunately not very long after that particular incident, the war broke out and the whole economy of that country, as of every other country, was disturbed.  What might have evolved out of it one does not know, so that there does not seem to be much use speculating on it now. However, what I do hold is that, when we do come to make these comparisons between Ireland and other countries, we ought to be careful to see that the comparison is a proper one; otherwise I hold, as I said last week on another matter, that we are doing an injustice and an injury to our people outside, because they do not feel competent to examine these things in the way that they feel we are and they rely on us for guidance.  We ought to be careful, therefore, before making these statements and perhaps gravely misleading these people.</P>
    <P>The question as to whether Ministers should or should not go to other countries to discuss matters of economic importance is one on which I am not <Col N="525" /> very competent to speak; but I doubt very much whether it is a wise thing. I think it is a fact that, on some occasion or another, an Irish Minister did go to London and endeavour to strike an economic bargain which would be of advantage to this country. In view of the result of that experience, I think that we ought to be slow in advocating as a general policy that we should insist on our Ministers going away on any and every occasion when the necessity arises for trade discussions and that they themselves should carry on these discussions.</P>
    <P>The question arises as to what is likely to happen in the matter of interest rates in connection with certain social activities in the time to come. It is held that there ought to be low interest rates for advances of certain kinds.  I agree that, for certain social purposes, money ought to be made available as cheaply as possible.  But if we examine this matter carefully I think we will find that for most social purposes so far very considerable assistance has been given, if not in the form of very low interest rates, then in other forms no less valuable. There is one thing that strikes me about the future and about getting some advantage for the poorer sections of the community when we come to provide them with such services as houses, that is that those engaged in the building industry ought to consider to what extent it is possible for them to increase their efficiency and output and so reduce the cost and thus give those who really deserve it an advantage which, God knows, we would like them to have.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the factors are that have left costs so high in this country as they have been.  I am not a technician in building or construction, but for years before the war I spent a considerable time each year in either England or in Scotland mainly studying the social conditions of our people there, but also in getting some indication as to the lines on which social development generally was taking place in Great Britain.  The thing that struck me with regard to building was the great disparity that existed, or seemed to exist at any <Col N="526" /> rate, between building costs there and building costs here.  If those possessing capital are expected to make a contribution, if the taxpayer in general is expected to make a contribution, I think it is only reasonable that we should ask all those engaged in the building industry in particular to make their contribution.  If they do, I think it will be of no less importance than the contributions that have been made so far by the other elements of the community towards the easing of the burdens of the poor.</P>
    <P>With regard to the remarks made about the teachers, I just want to say that more than once, publicly and privately, I tried to plead especially for the younger teachers.  I should like to see the conditions of those engaged in every department of the teaching profession, whether it is primary, secondary, vocational or university, reviewed and, whatever can be done, done for them when conditions permit.  But I should like to make an appeal, above all, for improved conditions for the younger teachers when starting.  I think they are being started at too low a salary altogether and also that the length of time it takes them to reach their maximum is far and away too long.  If we can meet them on these lines, I think we would do something worth while for them.</P>
    <P>There is only one other point. Again, I do not want to enter into the realm of prophecy.  But I think that we ought to remember that things are very different now from what they were in 1931.  Senators should remember that, whatever may happen to those balances we hold abroad, whatever may happen with regard to the income we derive from these, we are in a better position to-day than we were in 1931.  In passing may I say that I hope that Britain will play the game in regard to these assets and income and that she will not default.  That would be to our interest as well as in her own.  I am one of those who believe that it would not be to our interest that Great Britain should collapse, no more than I believe that it is in the economic interest of mankind that Germany should be allowed remain in a state of collapse.  But what I want <Col N="527" /> to get at is this.  Since 1931, whatever is likely to happen to these balances and to this income, we are economically in a far stronger position to-day than we were then.  A considerable amount of independence has been achieved, not alone political independence, of which we are all so proud, but when one thinks of the ease under difficulties with which we weathered the economic stress arising out of the last war, one cannot but feel hopeful of the future. We have achieved a very great degree of economic independence, and I think that if Senators will take the trouble when they have time to look through such statistics as are available up to the time when we did not get as full information as we would like, of the imports into this country, they will agree, after going through them, that there is quite a number of items of considerable value in that list that we could very well forgo without involving our people in any substantial lowering of their standard of living and thus minimise whatever consequence might flow from a default on the part of Britain.</P>
    <P>To conclude, all I can say is that we could talk about this until the cows come home.  One may prophesy this, and another may prophesy that, and another may prophesy the other.  That was indulged in to a great extent in the Dáil, and it has been indulged in to a great extent this evening.  What help that is to the Minister for Finance, to the Government, or to the people, I find it hard to make out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a good many matters to which I should like to refer in discussing this Bill, but I shall not go into any of those questions to-night.  My object in rising is to ask the Minister to bring to the notice of the Department of Justice the matter of the speeding of lorries on the roads, and particularly turf lorries, at the present time.  Since the emergency I travel a good deal by buses, and twice within the last three weeks, in passing turf lorries on the southern roads, the buses only escaped collision by inches. I understand that there is an Order of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that lorries should not travel <Col N="528" /> more than 25 miles an hour at the present time, but I can tell the Minister that in a good many of those cases the lorries are going more than 50 miles an hour.  That is very dangerous, particularly on narrow roads, and it is surprising that very serious accidents have not occurred.  Apart altogether from the danger of accidents, those big, heavy lorries, travelling at such high speeds, are doing enormous damage to the roads, particularly at the present time when it is so difficult to keep the roads in proper condition; and, in the case of roads that have not a proper foundation to bear heavy traffic, they are broken up in a very short time. Some steps should be taken to try to put some restrictions on the speed of these lorries, and I would ask the Minister to put it up to the Department of Justice to have, as in former days, some traps put up on the roads by the Civic Guards to prevent such speeding, particularly now that we have this enormous turf traffic on the roads.  Those people have no consideration for the public, and their lorries are so top-heavy that they cannot go into the side because, if they did, the lorry would topple over.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.J. O'Reilly Mr. P.J. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, in the first place, to join with the previous speakers in congratulating the Minister on his appointment as Minister for Finance.  The fact that he belongs to a part of the country distant from here ought to make him familiar with the needs and the views of the country regarding the tendency towards centralisation which appears to be, pretty obviously, a growing tendency.  Now, this question of sterling assets has been discussed, and personally I may say that it is one of the things on which I have been trying to get a proper grip for a long time.  I was very interested in the discussion this evening, and I hoped that everybody present would get a proper view on this matter because I think it is most important that we should get the correct angle on it. Following that line, I should like to submit this.  Let us suppose that a person engaged in an industry here has got on well and invests his savings <Col N="529" /> in a firm like Guinness's.  In addition to the earnings from his original industry, he also gets profits from his investment in Guinness's.  Thus so far as he is concerned his wealth is increased.  Without going outside the country, we could imagine that happening, and I think we could get a fairly good idea of what should be our attitude towards this question of sterling assets.  If we substitute the nation for a collection of individuals, it would appear that if the nation can have investments outside, and that other people are in the unfortunate position of being obliged to earn interest which is credited to this country, I should imagine that the nation is in a happy position.  We have, I believe, an enormous sum, which is estimated, I think, at £300,000,000&mdash;at least, that sum has been mentioned&mdash;in investments abroad, and anxiety has been expressed regarding the repatriation of these millions.  How is it to be done?  Obviously, the only way it can be done is to import goods of the equivalent value.  Does anybody here suggest that we could import £300,000,000 worth of goods right away?  Have we any need for them? But we can easily imagine a small quantity of goods, say £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 worth, being imported annually that would be of advantage to the country, and what remained would still be earning interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was anxious to be told what was the nature of our external assets.  I presume that bank deposits would form a big item in the list of external assets, and then you would have people holding shares in various foreign companies. All those things go to make up that sum, and they are all earning those dividends and so are to the interest of the nation.  As far as my reading goes, the position that England is faced with at the moment is that she has lost all her external assets and has now, by increased exports, to make up for them.  Before the war the wealth of the world was pouring into England, just as it was in the case of Spain in former days. So that if we look at the matter from that particular standard we should be able to get a view on the question of <Col N="530" /> sterling assets.  New Zealand has been quoted and I might say, in passing, that I very seldom find myself in agreement with Senator O Buachalla, and whenever I do find myself in agreement with him I begin to examine my conscience and to wonder what happened.  But whatever happened, this manipulation of the New Zealand currency was I might say, not a very decent thing to do.  New Zealand said suddenly: &ldquo;We will make 125 New Zealand pounds equal to 100 English pounds,&rdquo; and, at once, out of every £100 worth of stock exported to the English market, the New Zealand exporting firms were credited with £125 instead of £100. That was all right as regards one class of the community but as regards another class the very opposite occurred.  Imports went up more than before and up went the cost of living. I admit manipulation of the currency in that way helps to establish home manufactures.  It tends to discourage imports and, from that standpoint, there may be some advantage in it. Reference has been made to the fact that Denmark followed suit.  Naturally, it had to follow suit.  We followed suit, too.  We were obliged to do so. When we subsidised our butter, was it not equivalent to manipulation of the exchange?  But all these tricks must come to an end.  They are not honest trading and, sooner or later, the matter has to be considered from the world point of view.  The whole matter was considered at the Bretton Woods Conference.  We have to face up to the fact that this dodging or tricking with currency does not bring us anywhere. We achieve merely manipulation on paper.  I was interested in the discussion on sterling but it is a rather abstract question.  I am sure the Minister would like to hear something more directly bearing on the appropriation accounts.</P>
    <P>I am specially interested in the vocational-education side of the work of the Department of Education.  As members generally know, the Department contributes substantial sums to the various vocational education committees throughout the country.  For some time, a rather curious form of financial procedure has been adopted. <Col N="531" /> If a committee appears to have a credit balance, a raid is made on that committee's revenue.  A substantial portion of that balance is cut off and given to other committees.  I think that that is not good administration. It encourages certain committees to be extravagant.  They know that their extravagance will merely mean that some other committee, which has been prudent and economical, will have its grants reduced.  I suggest that this is a revival of a very old custom&mdash;a custom which was in existence prior to the organisation of the State&mdash;and that it is time to end it.  I should like to give one example.  A reduction of £1,500 was made in the revenue of Waterford City Committee and that sum was transferred to other committees. Dun Laoghaire and Bray Committees have had a similar experience and, at the recent Vocational Education Conference, a strong protest was made against that procedure. The Minister will, I think, see that that is bad finance and that it is not an honest form of administration.  It is merely an expedient and I am not blaming those who have been adopting that expedient.</P>
    <P>The next subject to which I want to refer is that of grants for the building of vocational schools.  The report of the Commission on Vocational Organisation referred, in this connection, to &ldquo;palatial buildings.&rdquo;  If the commission had in mind palatial buildings in the provinces, then its report was, to that extent, inaccurate.  But we need not go far from where we are now to find palatial buildings which, perhaps, the commission had in view. In the case of big cities, such as Dublin, Cork and Limerick, there is no trouble in getting grants of from £20,000 to £250,000 for this purpose but if an ordinary county committee, dealing largely with the farming community, wants to erect a miserable little building, the amount of difficulty experienced would astonish the House if it were made known to them.  The net effect of administrative operations in this regard is that Section 51 of the Vocational Education Act might as well have been repealed.  It has been <Col N="532" /> virtually repealed so far as the counties are concerned.  Certain officials get together and say: &ldquo;This is costing a great deal; we cannot have any more of this.&rdquo;  The committee I am associated with was asked to promise never again to avail of that section of the Act and refused because the promise would not be worth the paper on which it would be written. Certain penal action was taken as a consequence.</P>
    <P>This is a matter in respect of which you cannot take any particular Department by the throat and say that it is its fault.  There are three Departments and four bodies concerned. With the permission of the House, I shall mention the Ministers and the Departments concerned.  The Ministers concerned are those for Education, Finance and Local Government. Perhaps the House would like to learn exactly how those Ministers enter into the matter.  The Minister for Local Government is interested in this way: if the county council&mdash;the authority for giving grants under Section 51&mdash;makes a grant, then the Minister for Local Government is concerned with the repayment of that grant.  Section 51 provides that central funds may contribute 50 per cent. of any grant made by a county council and hence the Minister for Finance is concerned so far as that portion of the grant goes.  Therefore, two Ministers have watching briefs in connection with those grants.  The Minister who nominally approves of the grant is the Minister for Education.  If the buildings go up, he gets the credit for them.  The Ministers for Local Government and Finance, who have had the responsibility of seeing that the money is properly dealt with, get very little thanks for doing so. Accordingly, you have a beautifully positioned arena for a fight amongst the three Ministers.  I am sure that they do engage in such quarrels because they are only human beings.  A county council, if it obtains the premission of the Local Government Department, may apply for the grants under this section.  Section 50 of the Act provides that the committee may raise the whole of the amount necessary. If it does, it has to repay the <Col N="533" /> whole of the amount and, since there has been a terrific strain on the funds of those committees owing to their having to pay emergency bonuses and to provide for increments of salaries, no committee is inclined to look for money under that particular section and that is the only section open to it if it desires to do anything in the way of building.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is very important from the standpoint of people in the country is the failure of the Department to implement Part 5 of the Vocational Education Act in the rural areas.  Places like Cork and Limerick have Part 5 in operation. Waterford City is soon to have it in operation.  We find provision being made for the cities and towns but not for the rural areas.  This section has been operative since 1930 and yet no country district has got the benefit of it.  This system of vocational education involves very considerable expenditure and, in my view, greater benefits and a higher degree of efficiency in the administration of the scheme would be achieved if Part 5 were put into operation. An amending Bill was put through about two years ago which enables additional funds to be provided. I think that is a matter that the Minister might discuss with the Minister for Education and he should see that something will be done about it.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I would like to refer, though I believe I would be sailing very close to the wind in doing so.  I have no political outlook at all in relation to it.  I visualise the need for a great advance in vocational education generally, if all these big schemes that we hear about in connection with post-war planning are to be implemented.  I believe vocational education will play a big part in the realisation of these schemes.  It seems to me a pity that a short time ago the man who, as it were, grew up with the whole system of vocational education, and who gained a tremendous amount of experience in that direction, was transferred to another Department.  I understand he has done magnificent <Col N="534" /> work.  I think it would be a great pleasure and would give a great sense of satisfaction to everybody connected with vocational education if it were possible to have that great official, who has built up the scheme, sent back to the Department to which he naturally belongs.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the cost of living.  Senator Douglas dealt with that matter very thoroughly.  The index figure at the moment is 294 or 295 and certain officials have been paid on a figure of 210.  There is a big gap there.  I think it was Senator Johnston who mentioned the difference in the cost of living as between England and this country, giving the figures of 70 and 50. on the assumption that the subsidies are withdrawn in England.  Getting away from the purely individual standpoint, I think it is a great pity that the Government here did not utilise the plan adopted by the English Government in subsidising much more liberally foodstuffs and other things in order to prevent the very great increase which has taken place here.  When the fall begins to operate we will have a lot of industrial unrest.  The big rise in the cost of living is something that should not have occurred.  It has inflicted untold hardship on thousands of people.  I suppose Ministers from time to time hear about these things from relations of their own and they are aware of the impossibility of keeping out of debt, even in the case of people with considerable salaries.  I join with Senator Seán Ruane in asking the Minister to give consideration to pensioned teachers, primary, secondary and otherwise.  The sufferings these people have undergone must have been simply terrible.</P>
    <P>I would like now to refer to turf.  It is a big anti-climax, if you like.  I saw a serious warning recently from our county manager as to what is likely to happen in the matter of turf production. Here is an extraordinary thing. My area is a turf area, but the curious thing is that the cost of turf in that area, right beside the bog, is greater than the cost of turf in the City of Dublin.  It is clear from this that transport, <Col N="535" /> about which we hear so much, is not the important factor in this instance; there is something else to be explained.  I objected to certain payments on the ground that they were beyond the regulated price.  It was in that way that I discovered that a person on the bog can charge more for turf than the price at which it can be supplied here.  I think that is a matter to which the Minister should give his serious attention.  The sufferings that some people have undergone in trying to provide themselves with fuel is beyond all reckoning.  It is to be hoped some effort will be made to remedy the existing state of affairs, particularly in view of the warnings that have been given by county managers.</P>
    <P>Senator Kingsmill Moore spoke of lost dogs.  I rather expected that he would have spoken of lost causes and I was surprised to hear him speaking of lost dogs.  That puts into my mind something that exists in my own town as a result of a defect in an old Act of the British Parliament.  Senator Quirke could bear out what I say in this matter.  We have three animals down our way and they have defied the resources of the law repeatedly.  All the Government forces are not able to deal with these three animals.  They eat shrubs and flowers and destroy practically everything.  The Gardaí have done everything possible, but they cannot prevent these animals from continuing their destructive tactics.  There is an Act of Parliament going back to 1882 which imposes a maximum fine of 2/- on the owner of these animals.  His goats go in on people's property and feed away for a week or so.  The owner is fined only 2/-.  The next week the animals go into some other property and the result is that everybody down there is persecuted.  I would like the Minister and the Minister for Justice to give this matter their earnest consideration. I suppose it is not so unnatural for a Tipperaryman to refer to those animals.  There are few Senators who have not heard &ldquo;The Peeler and the Goat,&rdquo; a song which was composed in Bansha, in my county.  This may be a jocose matter for some Senators, but <Col N="536" /> from the standpoint of the people down there it is a very serious matter and I should like the Minister to give it his serious attention.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Like some other Senators who have spoken, I wish to congratulate the Minister on his appointment as Minister for Finance.  As do many of us here, the Minister comes from rural Ireland and it has always been my contention that the people of rural Ireland, who produce the greater part of the wealth of the country, deserve very special consideration, and I hope, with Senator Baxter, that the Minister will, as far as means will allow him to, help <Col N="537" /> the farming community.  Those of us with experience know that in the cities and towns of Ireland you will not get a quarter of the people whose ancestors lived there three or four generations before.  It is the stream of people, of young and vigorous people, coming from the rural areas, which goes to make up our towns and cities, and a country in which the rural population decays will in a very short time decay also.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly agree with the appeal made by Senator Ruane in favour of the national teachers.  I know many of these teachers at present, and I knew them in the past, and I can truthfully say that they played a magnificent part in the movement&mdash;often doing voluntary work in teaching outside classes&mdash;for the Irish language. To my knowledge, many of them took a prominent part in the fight for independence. To be self-respecting and successful as a teacher, a teacher must be able to support his or her family in decent circumstances, because a man or woman in this country is often judged according to his or her means.</P>
    <P>The case of those teachers who were pensioned in recent years is, however, much worse.  I know that when the Teachers' Pension Fund was taken over from the British Government, it was bankrupt, but that was not the fault of the national teachers, who had consistently paid their contributions. Many of those teachers have been pensioned on miserable yearly sums. Senator Douglas instanced to-day the case of two civil servants in receipt of a couple of hundred pounds a year, but many of these teachers have been pensioned on about £50 or £60 a year, and they could not possibly live if they had no other means.  This is a matter which affects the honour of the country, and I hope the Minister will have it examined with a view to seeing that their position is righted so far as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas delivered a very interesting speech to-day.  He spoke of the Border, and said that he did not want, and very few others, either North or South, wanted a continuance of that unnatural Border in this country.</P>
    <P>This is a question which concerns <Col N="538" /> thoughtful and patriotic Irishmen, both North and South.  We may be regarded here as extremists.  We go as far in our national doctrine as Thomas Davis went over 100 years ago.  We want all Irishmen, North and South, to pull together for the uplifting of our native land.  It is not a question of the victory of one section over another.  Unification will be a victory for Ireland and all Irish men and women, both North and South.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas spoke of our outside association with other Powers and said there were certain jealousies and suspicions in regard to us abroad, owing to our having remained neutral. If there are suspicions abroad regarding us, there are suspicions in Ireland regarding those very same Powers. There is a saying in Irish: Is ar mhaithe leis fhéin a dheineas an cat cronán, which means in English &ldquo;It is for its own sake that the cat purrs&rdquo;. Those of us old enough to remember the last war know that there were many professions of sympathy for small Powers and we know there was no reality or sincerity behind the professions of that time in favour of democracy or small nations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the present position, power politics at the moment are playing as active a part in world affairs as ever before.  Poland was jockeyed into the war on the advice of other Powers and is at the moment being partitioned again by the Powers which advised the Polish people to join in a crusade in which they themselves did not believe.  A man or a nation should examine his or its conscience before judging other people. We in Ireland have, so far as we could, devoted our time to minding our own business.  With regard to the financial situation of the country&mdash;its outside assets and the like&mdash;world conditions are changing rapidly and financial considerations of a few years ago are entirely altered by the circumstances of recent years.  We cannot live in the past.  We must look to the future and do in the future what we think is in the best interests of our own country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephMeighan" hpid="Mr. Meighan Mr. Meighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meighan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the <Col N="539" /> importance of providing agricultural machinery for the harvest.  I should like to impress upon the Department the necessity of co-operating to the fullest extent with the various county committees of agriculture with a view to seeing that the utmost output is obtained from agricultural machinery. As there have been complaints from time to time of profiteering, I think it would be to the advantage of the agricultural community and the country in general if the Department or the committees of agriculture could devise some scheme or put into operation scales of charges for owners of threshing sets and ploughing sets who engage in contracts.  Such contractors are under a debt of gratitude to the Department because they got their machinery through the Department. Those people have gone to great extremes to get those sets, and, having been entrusted with them, the least they might do is to give the fullest return and to see that no customer will have to bear unreasonable charges.</P>
      <P>I should also like to impress upon the Government the necessity for pushing forward schemes of drainage, large and small.  I am sure every Senator and Deputy from rural Ireland is fully aware of the necessity for such schemes.  Anyone passing through the country, either by train or bus, for the last few weeks can see fields of hay under a couple of feet of water.  I saw them myself yesterday on my journey to Dublin.  There are a number of other meadows in the same districts which are uncut because the floods have injured them and lodged mud and sand on top of them.  Those meadows will be practically useless; at least, they have deteriorated considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to small drainage schemes, although we must all recognise that it was a generous gesture on the part of the Government to offer to pay 25 per cent. of the cost of such schemes, there are exceptional cases where the payment of the remainder of the expenditure imposes a strain on the people concerned. You may have six or seven or perhaps eight people involved in <Col N="540" /> small drainage schemes or road schemes.  There may be two or three of these people who feel that the scheme in question is not of very much benefit to them and who are not inclined to contribute towards it. The remainder of them have to contribute the whole of the balance. These are exceptional cases and I would suggest that every scheme should be examined on its merits and that schemes such as I have mentioned should get special consideration.</P>
    <P>With regard to cattle schemes, I do not know whether it is a general experience, but in the poorer areas in the district from which I come, the experience of farmers this year has been that calves got from premium Shorthorn bulls are selling at a big sacrifice.  I know that at the last local fairs in that area, good heifer calves from bulls which cost £100 each and on which a premium of £28 is given by the Department, were sold as low as 17/6 each whereas Polled-Angus calves out of inferior quality cows fetched as high as £4 each.  To my mind, that is a great pity, considering the amount of money spent on these schemes.  I think it is a matter that the Department and the various county committees will have to consider seriously to see if anything can be done to remedy it.  I find in my own district that where there is a small farmer in a creamery district who keeps from two to five cows, he is anxious to send all his milk to the creamery and to sell off the calves.</P>
    <P>I was wondering whether it would be possible for the Department to devise some means to persuade the owners of such cattle to hold on to the calves even by way of giving them a premium of a couple of pounds per head.  That at least would have the effect of retaining them in the district. In my native parish, I think I would be safe in saying that out of perhaps 200 or 300 calves this year, only ten or 12 have been retained in the parish. The people are anxious to send milk to the creamery and the calves are sold at whatever price can be obtained. The result is that very few cows are now being sent to the Shorthorn bull. They are brought three or four miles <Col N="541" /> to the Polled-Angus bull and there are complaints that there are not sufficient Polled-Angus bulls in the area.</P>
    <P>A serious aspect of the question is that the number of calves next year will not be as large as this year.  I know definitely that in my own area the great majority of the calves will be Polled-Angus crosses.  I have personal evidence of the fact that these coloured calves have sold at from 17/6 to £1 each&mdash;some even as low as 10/- each&mdash; whereas the Polled-Angus calves are reaching from £3 to £4 each.  I know an instance in which a calf from a Polled-Angus bull, and a cow worth about £10, realised £4, whereas a calf from a very fine Shorthorn bull, on which there is a premium of £28, out of a good cow, was sold for 17/6.  I mention these matters in the hope that the Department will be able to take them up with committees of agriculture or to get their agricultural overseers to keep in touch with the various districts to see if some remedy can be found for this situation.</P>
    <P>One other matter which I should like to mention has reference to the overcrowding of buses on long journeys.  I suppose that Córas Iompair Éireann is carrying on under difficulties owing to the emergency, but I think they might try to strain a point with regard to long-distance runs.  One thing I cannot understand.  Travelling a week ago by bus leaving Aston's Quay, I saw a number of people get on the Ballina bus. It was not able to take all the passengers, so they had to call on a second bus.  Those on the second bus were told to get into the first bus at Longford, and many of them had to stand on the journey further West. The funny thing about it was that the second bus followed up from Longford, at least as far as Ballaghaderreen.  I saw that bus passing out the first bus, and it would not be much more than half-full.</P>
    <P>Yesterday was a very warm day, and on the bus coming to Dublin, which was supposed to seat 32, there were for part of the journey as many as 50 or 51 on the bus.  As I say, the company is working under difficulties, but I think that is overdoing it.  I know that a great many of the passengers were <Col N="542" /> very badly affected by the heat.  If I might make a suggestion, where there is a shortage of seating accommodation and people otherwise would have to stand, I think it would be very easy to provide little folding chairs or small seats.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody minds standing during a four or five miles journey; it is better than being left behind. But in some of those buses there would be room for eight or nine of those folding chairs, on which people would be quite comfortable even for a long journey.  I should like to add my voice to those of other members who have welcomed the Minister here as Minister for Finance.  Seeing that he has sprung from the people of rural Ireland, I welcome his appointment very sincerely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just one or two points to which I wish to refer, and I assure you that I will not delay the House very long.  Before I start throwing a few bricks, I had better throw a bouquet.  I too feel that the Minister is to be congratulated, because I have a recollection that he conducted the 1936 Agricultural Bill with consummate skill, and I hope&mdash;in fact I am nearly sure&mdash;that he will do honour and credit to the exalted position which he now occupies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thinking men, irrespective of Party, are very seriously perturbed about the ever increasing national and local taxation.  If you look out the window of Leinster House and visualise the whole administration of the country, a peculiar panorama is to be seen. I think it was Senator O Buachalla who spoke about the analogy which exists between 1931 and 1945.  That entirely depends on the angle from which you see it.  I appreciate and support many of his remarks about the advances made by the Government in social services, but that does not clarify the angle from which I see the position to-day.  Subject to correction, I think in 1931 our current taxation was something in the region of £23,000,000, and the national debt was about £17,000,000.  To-day, our current taxation is £52,000,000, and the national debt has gone to over £100,000,000. <Col N="543" /> This Government, shortly after getting into power, set up a commission to examine closely the whole ramifications of finance, and to send in to the Government an impartial and carefully statisticated account of the whole position.</P>
    <P>In that report, they warned the Government against a continuation of their expenditure on wild and unproductive schemes.  In this House, the then Minister for Finance, when looking over the Budget of £30,000,000, in 1937 I think it was&mdash;and mind you he attained that eminence as Minister for Finance by giving definite and specific promises to the country that if and when he got into power he would reduce taxation by £10,000,000&mdash;warned the Government of which he was a Minister that the continuation of that policy would have serious reactions upon the finances of the whole country. I quoted him here before.  He said that he was utterly appalled at the conditions which might arise if ever the threatened world war broke out.  Did that solemn warning of the chief builder of finance restrain the Government from a continuation of unproductive schemes?  It did not.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister for Finance is here, in the person of Deputy Aiken, because I have something to say which directly concerns him.  I represent a rural council.  I was elected a fortnight ago for the fifth time, covering a period of 21 years.  In the administration of the county, I think we disbursed about £300,000 a year, but this year that budget has increased by £32,000.  While I appreciate the humanitarian considerations which inspired the Government, supported by the Dáil and the Seanad, to give an increase of 2/6 to the most needy of our people under the heading of old age pensions, it must be remembered that the burden of that 2/6 falls directly upon the shoulders of the county or rural ratepayers.  Next Saturday we are having a meeting of our council to consider the position. Because of the increasing numbers&mdash; 14,000 have already been catered for, and the number continues indefinitely increasing&mdash;we are having a meeting next Saturday to consider an increase <Col N="544" /> of £8,000 over previous years; that means £40,000 upon the shoulders of the rural ratepayers.</P>
    <P>To-day, the farmers cannot even get a man to do the most essential work. Before I came here yesterday morning, I had to beg in a most humiliating way for a man to go out and raise eight or ten acres of hay which was sodden after three weeks' rain. That is an extraordinary state of affairs, and the Minister ought to consider it, because it is axiomatic that no Government can, without giving rise to serious reactions, continue indefinitely to extract money from the chief source of wealth, which is, of course, admitted to-day to be agriculture.</P>
    <P>This Government, too, after coming into power&mdash;this is a point that I want to draw the Minister's attention to&mdash;was probably very short of money, and at the time of the land annuities' dispute extracted the sum of £716,000 from the Guarantee Fund.  That, presumably, was money that was collected from the annuitants and not remitted to the stock or bond holders.  The Government, I imagine, felt legally justified in doing that.  But let us see what were the reactions to the Government's decision. Two of our county councils&mdash; Louth and Cork&mdash;contested the legality of the Government's action in extracting that money from the Guarantee Fund and paying it into the Exchequer like ordinary taxation. They held that the Government was not entitled to do that, and took legal action against the Government. The Attorney-General moved for a dismissal of the action.  The High Court judges confirmed the effort that was being made by the two county councils in respect to those moneys. I speak subject to correction, but I think that was the first time we had retrospective legislation introduced by the present Government.  I admit that we had a taste of it from the previous Government.  In this case, however, the Government had to go to the Dáil and get retrospective legislation passed with a view to setting aside the anticipated decision of the High Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="545" /> The present Minister for Finance, when piloting the Land Bill of 1933 through this House&mdash;all honour to him for doing so&mdash;gave a specific undertaking that the amount of moneys collected, totalling, as I have said, £716,000, would be remitted in part to the various county councils when the allocation of each council had been determined.  At that time, the amount due to the Limerick County Council, of which I was a member, was £88,000, and the Minister definitely promised that the Government would remit that sum to the council over a period of years.  The Government honoured its bond after a hard fight on the part of the councils.  According to my computation, the Government remitted all the money due to the Limerick County Council with the exception of about £20,000.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister to-night that, at the moment, the rural ratepayers are very hard pressed.  The farmers cannot get workers because they are disappearing from the land as if it were a plague spot.  My house and I am sure the houses of other Senators are visited every other Sunday by numbers of people who come to us on bicycles asking us to try to get them permits to go to England. Did anybody ever imagine that the time would ever come when the dream and philosophy of Goldsmith would be realised:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But times are altered; trade's unfeeling train</P>
    <P>Usurp the land, and dispossess the swain:&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What I am putting to the Minister is that the rural population is very hard pressed this year.  There is no sale for store cattle, or at any rate they cannot be sold at a price that will leave a profit.  Most of the barley is down, the wheat is in a life and death struggle, the potatoes are blighted, and the outlook all round is bad.  There is, as I contend, a sum of £20,000 due to the Limerick County Council.  I ask him to take steps to help the rural ratepayers by remitting that sum of money to them.  It represents a legitimate debt due, over a number of years&mdash; since 1937 or 1938.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" /> There is one other thing that I want to put to the Minister.  We have the extraordinary anomaly which, in my opinion, inflicts a unique hardship on that section of our people least able to bear it.  I refer to the old age pensioners.  In order to get the maximum pension of 10/- a week, a man's income should not exceed £15 12s. 6d.  In the British days the amount was £21.  In those days one could have an income of £21 and still be entitled to get the maximum pension. But here is the peculiar anomaly that I want to bring to the Minister's notice.  If a labourer, living in a labourer's cottage, is earning 15/- a week, his wife and himself, on attaining the age of 70 years, can get only 7/- a week.  In the case of a farmer, however, who transfers his farm to his son, at the same time retaining for himself, under a contractual or marriage agreement, the right of maintenance in the house, and even though he has a sum of £600 on deposit in the bank, he is entitled to the full pension of 10/- a week.  You have that extraordinary anomaly in our legislation.  Surely, on the grounds of Christian kindness and sympathy, as well as from the point of view of the proper administration of the Act, an adjustment needs to be made there.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention. It is one which I have always raised on this Bill, and as long as I am a member of the House I shall continue to do so.  In the Report of the Registrar General given to the Government in 1937&mdash;no one, I think, can question the statistics to be found in that Report&mdash;we have indicated for us what may be described as the existence of a serious national cancer.  I think it was Senator O Máille who said that the disappearance of the rural population from the land was ruinous for the nation.  In my opinion it is the barometer of national and economic ruin.  In that report of the Registrar General it was also pointed out that 305 rural national schools had to be closed because there were no children coming along to be entered in the roll books. It was further pointed out that there were 66,000 less boys and girls in our rural schools than we had in them some <Col N="547" /> years ago.  The explanation given for that situation was that the farmers were not getting married, and that their daughters, realising and appreciating the hardship, toil and unremunerative work of their fathers&mdash; apart from the help by way of subsidies by the present Government&mdash; were fleeing from the land as if from a pestilence.  In that connection may I re-echo what some Senators have pointed out, that the sight to be witnessed at Merrion Square in this city is a sickening one?</P>
    <P>Therefore one has to take into account this colossal Budget of £53,000,000, a national debt which is ever increasing, and conditions in the rural areas such as I have described them.  Everyone, of course, realises that agriculture is the basis of our whole national and economic prosperity. If you ruin its structure then, inevitably, everything will be lost. Against that we have the panorama of the thousands of our young boys and girls who are flying across the water to undertake the remunerative work which they cannot find at home.  In conclusion, I hope the Minister will give attention to the few points that I have brought to his notice.</P>

      <P>Senator Madden and Senator Duffy have both emphasised the size of the bill with which we are being presented for Supply Services. Certainly, the total is a staggering one, and when one adds to it the burden of local rates it is still more serious.  There is one aspect of it to which much reference has not been made, and if one is to get a true picture of the present situation, it is an aspect which should not be left out. It is the fact that all this money will be spent here.  So far as one can see from this Appropriation Bill, the only items in it that represent money which is leaving the country are the £3,000,000 which we very willingly give, as a thank-offering, to help the nations that suffered during the war; £100,000 that is going to the Red Cross for the relief of distress in Italy, and our contribution to the League of Nations.  Apart from these items, all the money voted under this Appropriation <Col N="548" /> Bill will be circulated amongst our own people.  I do not say that that is a perfect answer to the doubts that have been expressed&mdash;that if the burden of taxation is laid on certain shoulders the economic balance may be too much upset.</P>
      <P>In general, the idea is to give it to the people who need it, to help them to survive.  We invest this money in the best investment any nation can have, in the people.  We spend it on pensions for widows and orphans: is it not then well spent and productive?  Is the helping of the widow to rear her children an unproductive scheme?  Is the help given for housing unproductive? Houses mean families, and families mean people, who are the real riches of a country.  When the Budgets were small in comparison with present figures&mdash;such as £20,000,000 in 1929, as Senator Duffy mentioned&mdash;there was £5,000,000 a year being paid out in land annuities.  It took a good deal of our resources to meet that, but that drain is no longer in existence.  When money is being spent on our own people, I hold it is being well spent, and it is foolish to talk of unproductive schemes in connection with it.  Perhaps Senator Duffy thinks this circulation of the £51,000,000 is not a good thing.  He was talking about the harm being done by the sterling coming in. In that connection, perhaps we would have been prudent to have instituted a savings campaign.  I often felt that the money was coming in to houses where it had not been very flúirseach before and that it was a great pity there was not a campaign to encourage investments in the Post Office Savings Bank, so that a pool of money would be available to finance productive schemes in the post-war period.  It is on the verge of being too late for that now, but it may not be entirely too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was talk of things on which we are spending lavishly.  I hold, with Senator O'Reilly and those who have spoken for the teachers, that no money can be better spent than on education.  We need a well-educated people if we are to hold our own in the struggle for existence when the world mess has been cleared up.  I <Col N="549" /> would ask the Minister to consider seriously the condition of the teachers.  We should attract to the teaching profession the very best brains of the country and if we make it unattractive we are not going to get them.  We should remember that we are laying on our teachers a burden that scarcely any other country has laid on them, the burden of restoring the Irish language.  That is a job which involves a new orientation of teaching and involves great effort on the part of the teachers, who must put their energies into the task.  We want contented teachers who are interested in their work and we want to attract the best of our young men to the profession.  Therefore, from the purely selfish point of view, they must be properly paid.  I agree with Senator O'Reilly that vocational education plays a large part in our post-war plans, and I feel that all the pleas made for the betterment of those teachers will not fall on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>There is one section of teachers who are rather orphans, that is, those in schools known as private rural domestic economy schools.  There are about 11 such schools set up by nuns and the Department gives grants for the teachers and for other purposes.  These unfortunate teachers are not very well paid.  I do not know exactly what they get, but I will give an idea of it.  In connection with the Johnstown Castle College, there was an advertisement in the papers the other day for a matron and the salary offered&mdash;Senators will hardly believe it&mdash;was £90 a year.  You would not get a good cook for that, yet this matron is supposed to have a certificate from a domestic economy college or a nursing certificate.  These teachers <Col N="550" /> are unestablished and have no pension, though they are doing most important work in these rural colleges.  There is scarcely anyone who has a harder task than they have.  We all recognise that the agricultural colleges are going to play a large part in our post-war planning.  We want our young men to be attracted to farming and the way to do that is to make them good scientific farmers interested in their work.  No farmer will succeed unless he has a good wife and these schools are designed to train the future wives of these farmers and it is to them we must look for our post-war prosperity. It is absurd that they are given such small salaries, from which it is impossible for them to put by any savings. The schools to which I refer are under the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I came across a very sad case of a woman who had been teaching in one of those colleges since the last war. She had a serious illness, having met with an accident, and could not possibly put by any savings.  When she comes out she has not one penny to get, after all those years, and has no pension to look forward to.  To my mind, we could not emphasise too strongly the importance of these schools and the necessity to pay the teachers properly.  It is the Department which pays them, as far as I can make out from the Estimates, and when their work is done they should not be compelled to turn to the county home.</P>
