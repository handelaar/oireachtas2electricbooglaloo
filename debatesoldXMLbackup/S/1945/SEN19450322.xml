      <P>I have been in consultation with the Attorney-General and his first worse fears have been realised.  I understand that there are a number of cases in which conditional orders have been made absolute and it is possible that there may be others.</P>

      <P>Actually have been. In a number of cases in which conditional orders have already been granted, they were made absolute and he made it pretty clear to me that the courts do not take any cognisance of legislation that is pending.</P>

      <P>I was only just making the point, the point which probably guided the Attorney-General, that the law must be there.  It is only the law that is there that the courts recognise. <Col N="2012" /> That is the actual position at the moment.</P>

      <P>Before this Bill becomes law I should like to register a protest against its becoming law.  That protest I would have made during the debate on the Second Stage had I been present, but I was absent through circumstances over which I had no control. The Supreme Court decision clearly sets it out that the Referee had violated the terms of the Military Service Pensions Act as he had failed personally to take evidence from the applicants for pension certificates.</P>
      <P>It is an Article of the Constitution that the decision of the Supreme Court shall, in all cases, be final and conclusive. It is also the undoubted law of the land that no court, tribunal, referee or commission can be legally established to question, determine, or dispose of the lands, goods, or any other rights of any citizen in an arbitrary manner, and because the Referee dealt with the claims of applicants under the 1934 Act in an arbitrary manner, the applicants secured a favourable decision, a decision which other applicants would undoubtedly secure if this Bill did not become law. The 1934 Act definitely placed on the applicants for military service certificates the onus of proving their claims and it set out that the claimant shall be at liberty to offer such evidence as he may consider necessary to discharge such onus.  That liberty should be fully vindicated and defended under Article 40 of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 5 of the 1934 Act, the Referee was given all such powers, rights and privileges, for enforcing the attendances of witnesses and examining them on oath, as are vested in the High Court or a judge thereof in respect of the trial of an action.  I <Col N="2013" /> do not suppose that any person would suggest that a High Court judge could be authorised to deal with actions in a similar manner as the Referee is expected to do if the Bill becomes law. The Referee should have proceeded strictly in accordance with such powers and the Supreme Court has definitely decided that he was wrong in not doing so.  He had no power whatever to dispose of any applicant's claim behind the applicant's back&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I protest against this Bill because of that.  It seeks to legalise something in the nature of a star chamber tribunal.  Such courts were finally abolished and are now things of the past.  The State, under Article 40 of the Constitution, guarantees in its laws to respect and defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.  Furthermore, in the case of injustice done it guarantees to vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen.  The Supreme Court decided in those cases before it that injustice was done to certain applicants when the Referee had failed to take evidence from those applicants.  Are not the same rights to be vindicated for every citizen who has suffered an injustice?  This can no longer be so, it seems, if this Bill is passed which is another reason why I protest against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been argued that one of the reasons for giving such powers to the Referee is that the large number of applicants necessitated the procedure he adopted.  That excuse, or reason, is not just.  I am sure that many members of the Chamber know, that under the Damage to Property Acts, many cases were heard in the different circuit <Col N="2014" /> courts throughout the country by the judges presiding there.  These cases were heard in open court.  Oral evidence was tendered by applicants whose property was damaged and reports were made to the Minister for Finance.  There was no suggestion that there was any need for unanimity so far as the decisions were concerned at all.  The cases all dealt with the same period.  I hold that a person whose rights are interfered with is more entitled to impartial justice than citizens whose goods are damaged and it is because I feel that way that I protest against this Bill becoming law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill which is now submitted to this House for final consideration has caused grave uneasiness to many, people not merely concerned as to the manner in which claims have been built, but people who are not concerned at all with the administration of the Act of 1934.  They are those who feel that there is an innovation here.  Over a period of years we have had introduced in the Oireachtas many measures which have caused uneasiness because of the tendency they disclose, a tendency to ignore settled law and to impose upon it regulations suitable to the Government of the day.</P>
      <P>That does not apply to one Government only, but to every Government which has taken office in this country for the past 23 years.  I am opposed to this Bill getting the imprimatur of this House.  I recognise that whether or not the motion now before you, Sir, is carried, the Bill will become law in the prescribed period set out in the Constitution, but we can, at any rate, so far as this House is concerned, make it clear that we do not approve of this method of approach to problems such as are dealt with in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One might talk about the administration of the Act of 1934 from many angles.  The Minister discussed it from one angle on a number of occasions, and we all recognise the difficulty he is confronted with now.  We have indicated what we consider would have been a different and a better approach to the problem but we are, at any rate, <Col N="2015" /> confronted now with the Bill and we have to say whether we are in favour of its passage or not.  When this Bill becomes law any irregularity that has taken place becomes valid.  I think the Minister himself recognises that there have been serious irregularities, apart altogether from technical irregularities. It was represented to me, for instance, that a claimant who was associated with the late Terry MacSwiney, who was on hunger-strike with Terry MacSwiney, and had actually a longer spell than Terry MacSwiney by four days, but survived, has been refused a service certificate under the 1934 Act.  There may be good technical reasons for that.  I do not know and I am not proposing to go into the details of the case, but it seems to me an extraordinary thing that somebody in that position has been refused a certificate under the Act of 1934.  It would appear now if Terry MacSwiney were alive, and an applicant for a service certificate, that he stood a good chance of being refused.  I am not talking at all of pensions.  I am talking of service certificates. On the other hand it has been reported to me by committees of the Old I.R.A. that in one particular case a person who was charged with serious offences, courtmartialled by the I.R.A., and expelled from membership, was appointed a certifying officer under the Act of 1934 and refused certificates to the members of the courtmartial.  I am drawing attention to these facts because these incidents have been validated by this Bill.  I am opposed to the Bill becoming law and I propose to vote against the motion.</P>
    <P>I do not want again to discuss Section 3.  There was a discussion on that section yesterday, and I think many of the warm supporters of the Minister felt uneasy about its implications. I am quite sure the Minister, if he were a free agent, would also feel uneasy about its implications, because let us bear this in mind, that once we establish a precedent it is going to be used by others at a later stage. Without attempting to introduce old <Col N="2016" /> incidents into this discussion, something I would deprecate very much, I might recall that a measure introduced by the Government of Cumann na nGael, which was opposed bitterly by the members of the present Government when in Opposition, and was immediately scrapped when they took office, was later revived by them to meet a situation which confronted them as a Government.  I refer now to Article 2 (a) of the old 1922 Constitution.  The Minister will probably find on a change of Government that the machinery of this Bill will provide for the successors of the present Government a headline, and probably an instrument for doing something which the Minister and his colleagues and supporters would consider highly objectionable to-day.</P>
    <P>It may be used for purposes that are not contemplated because whatever Government is in power is going to take the short cut, and if they find some instrument at hand which seems to suit the immediate purpose it is going to be used no matter how objectionable it may appear to the Opposition. I urged the Minister to have regard to the implications of this Bill and what it is going to mean in the future.  On the Second Stage I used a number of arguments to show that the Bill should not get a Second Reading. The Minister in his reply, I would respectfully suggest, did not advert once to the case I made against the Bill.  He adverted to something apart from what I said and from the case I made.  It is very easy to demolish a case which is built up for the purpose of being demolished. There was no attempt to demolish the case I made.  No advertence was made to that case by the Minister.  It may be asked, why not have opposed the Second Reading?  I will explain that from my angle, and the angle of those who sit on this side of the House.  Had we opposed the Second Reading we would not have prevented the Bill becoming law, but we would have deprived ourselves of the opportunity of amending it.  Therefore, we permitted the Bill to get a Second Reading although that attitude was misrepresented in a certain newspaper. <Col N="2017" /> It indicated that there was agreement in this House on the Military Service Pensions (Amendment) Bill.  There was no such agreement, but there was an understanding that if the Bill got a Second Reading we would have an opportunity on subsequent stages of introducing amendments.  These amendments were introduced, very moderate amendments indeed.</P>
    <P>No amendment was introduced which would in any way interfere with the principle of the Bill, but there were two or three attempts made to modify some of the most objectionable features of the Bill.  These were resisted by the Minister.  The amendments were put to the vote and were defeated.  It was notable, however, that on these divisions a number of members of this House considered it expedient to absent themselves from the Division Lobby.  The total number who voted on the first division yesterday numbered less than half the members of this House&mdash;29 Senators voted out of a total of 60.  I propose to give them an opportunity of reconsidering their position.  Those who have been abstaining so long will have an opportunity of saying on this stage whether they are in favour of this Bill becoming law or not.  If they vote for the Bill they are voting not merely to deprive men having a reconsideration of their cases to which they are entitled under the decision of the Supreme Court, but they are establishing a precedent and a principle in our law which may have very far-reaching consequences for this community in the time to come.  I content myself with saying that so far as I am concerned I propose to have this motion put to the vote and to vote against the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the time spent on the debate on this Bill seems to have been based on fears as to the consequences if we do an unprecedented thing, and perhaps create a precedent that on some future occasion may be used to the detriment of the citizens as a whole.  I am going to suggest that the basis of all law is common sense. I am impressed by the case that the Minister has made for the passing of <Col N="2018" /> this Bill, and I have no hesitation in saying that I am going to support its passing.  The Bill is surely without precedent in our history.  It is a Bill dealing in an unique manner, if you like, with an unique situation.  It deals with the consequences of the travail that brought our present political State into existence.  We hope we shall not have a repetition of the situation with which this Bill proposes to deal.  However unorthodox the procedure may seem, I feel that the Minister has convinced the House that it is sound common sense to give him the powers he seeks to deal with a unique situation in a manner which, if unique, is, to my mind, the only businesslike way of dealing with it. Without further ado, I place on record my intention to support the passing of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Béidir gurb é seo an Bille deireannach, a bhainfeas díreach le ceist seo na bpinsean, a bheas os comhair an tSeanaid agus, ar an abhar sin, ba mhaith liom beagán a rá ina thaobh.  An Seanadóir atá tar éis labhairt, mhínigh sé cuspóir agus brí an Bhille agus mhínigh sé go maith é.  Teastaíonn uainn na pinsin seo do thabhairt do na daoine a thug seirbhís don tír&mdash;na daoine a bhfuil ceart acu na pinsin d'fháil.  Teastaíonn uainn na pinsin seo do thabhairt dóibh chomh luath agus is féidir agus gan iad a bheith ag fanacht leo ach achar réasúnta.  Nuair a ritheadh an chéad Bhille, fuarthas amach go raibh sé lochtach.  Má gheibhtear amach dlí bheith lochtach, i dtreo nach féidir aigne an Rialtais a chur i bhfeidhm, agus cothrom na féinne a thabhairt, nach bhfuil de dhualgas ar an Oireachtas an dlí sin d'athrú agus do leasú.  Cad eile atá á dhéanamh san mBille seo?  Is réasúnach an rud é seo do dhéanamh agus, ós rud é go bhfuil sé réasúnach, nach ceart don Tigh seo glacadh leis an mBille?  Tá daoine áirithe míshásta toisc nach bhfuair siad pinsean.  Nílim chun an cheist seo do phlé anois.  Ach na daoiní a bhfuil ceart acu pinsean d'fháil, ba cheart dóibh é d'fháil taobh istigh d'achar réasúnach, agus ní mór linn dóibh iad.  Thuilleadar iad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2019" /> Ba mhaith liom aon iarratas amháin a dhéanamh ar an Aire.  Táimid ar tí pinsin a thabhairt do dhaoine a thug seirbhís fóinteach don tír.  Is ceart sin mar dúirt mé, ach tá a lán daoine a thug seirbhís dílis tairbheach don tír agus nár chuir isteach ar phinsean. Do réir an dlí, mar tá sé fá láthair, ní bheadh ceart acu seo pinsean d'fháil ach ar ndóigh nílid á iarraidh.  Ach ba mhaith liom dá gcuimhneodh an tAire agus an Rialtas go raibh na daoine seo páirteach go mór sa troid agus is iad na daoine sin, aithreacha agus máithreacha, dearbhráitheacha agus dreithiúracha na bhfear agus na mban fhéin a chuaidh amach sa gcath. Bhí orthu seo fanacht sa bhaile, ach d'fhulaing siad chomh mór agus na fir a bhí amuigh ag troid agus rinne siad sár obair ar son na cúise.  Arm gan ainm iad seo.  Ni bhfuighe siad pinsean. Ach ní ceart a seirbhís ná a gcuimhne a dhearmad.  Ba choir meas na tíre orthu a theasbaint i slí a bheas buan, mairtheannach.  Is ceart cuimhneamh ar na daoine seo agus chomh luath agus bheas deis ag an Aire tá suil agam go gcuirfidh sé nó duine nó dream éigin eile scéim os comhair an Rialtais chun cuimhneacháin rathúil do thógáil in onóir do na daoiní seo.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom an óráid a thug an tAire ar an Dara Céim d'fhoillsiú ar fud na tire go leir.  Dá ndéanfaí sin, táim cinnte nach mbeadh na daoine atá míshásta anois toisc nach bhfuair siad pinsin míréasúnach faoi i bhfad eile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that it is my duty to reassure the House, and especially those Senators who supported me in getting the Bill through, regarding the many misinformed statements made in respect of this measure during its passage through the Oireachtas. I want to impress on Senators that, in no circumstances, can there be any question of inflicting injustice upon these applicants.  Each one of those applicants has been heard in accordance with the Act.  Each applicant has been granted all the facilities necessary to make his case.  As I outlined on a number of occasions, the application, <Col N="2020" /> when put in, was examined.  If it was found that it established a <i>prima facie</i> case, it was submitted to the advisory board.  The applicant had an opportunity of making his case to the board.  If he had a case, he could bring whatever witnesses he deemed desirable before the board.  If he was in a position to procure written or other evidence, he was entitled to produce it.  If he was granted a certificate and was not satisfied with the period of service granted him in that certificate, he could appeal against that.  If he was not granted service, he could appeal against that also.</P>
      <P>The Referee, by way of precaution on behalf of the applicant, gave 28 days' notice to members of the brigade committees.  That was not provided for in the Act.  It was done by the Referee as an additional precaution in favour of the applicant.  That 28 days' notice allowed the verifying officers&mdash; the man's own comrades&mdash;to object either to the amount of service granted or to the lack of service granted.  The Referee held up his decision, which, in this case, would, presumably, be an adverse one, until the verifying officers came along.  They again stated their case on behalf of the applicant. At the end of the 28 days, if the Referee was still unconvinced so far as the service was concerned, the applicant was granted a further period of 21 days in which to appeal.  During that time, he was permitted to secure any additional evidence available to him.  If he again failed to convince the Referee that he had a case, he had an appeal to the Minister and that appeal was granted if the applicant could produce evidence which had not been already available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, I want to repeat that 12,000 persons availed of that appeal and, of the 12,000, 900 were heard.  And of the 900 appeals which were heard more than 500 were successful, which goes to prove that if an individual even at the eleventh hour was in a position to satisfy the Referee that there was evidence there which proved that he was an applicant to whom the Act applied, that justice would be done.  With all these precautions it amazes me to hear sensible <Col N="2021" /> members of this House and of the other House talking as if this Bill, which is, in fact, a retrospective measure, and which is merely endeavouring to validate acts of the Referee in the past, would cause injustice.  It will not inflict any hardship on anyone.</P>
    <P>I submit to the House that it would be practically impossible to provide any better means of protecting the rights of the applicants than has been produced under this Bill.  Not alone did the Act itself and the Referee ensure that the applicant's rights would be safeguarded, but on the Advisory Committee itself were two <Col N="2022" /> representatives of the Old I.R.A. to ensure that the rights of Old I.R.A. applicants would be safeguarded. Also, two of the four investigating officers were Old I.R.A. men.  If there is any better means of safeguarding the rights of the applicants, I should like to hear them.  I stated already that there has been no charge against the Referee in respect of any act of injustice against any applicant, and, if that is so, and if this is a retrospective measure to validate the acts of the Referee, I cannot see where there is anything to grumble about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's main point yesterday, in dealing with this matter, was that the difficulty had never arisen before.  Up to this, we have always been dealing with cases of imports, and never with cases, under the Customs Code, of prohibited exports, and there could only be a conveyance in the different sense of a conveyance used in exportation in the case that we are considering at the moment.  The difficulty that I envisaged and explained to the Minister yesterday, in the case of somebody buying a horse. in Naas and carrying it up to Cavan, could not possibly arise in an import case.  It appears to me that the effect of this sub-section, as it stands, is going to make the belongings of a person, who has nothing whatever to do with an infringement of the law, liable to forfeiture.  Even though the district justice, before whom any proceedings under the Customs Act may come, feels that the man who, as in the example I have given, carried the horse from Naas to Cavan, is absolutely <Col N="2024" /> blameless and had no rhyme or reason to suspect that the horse was going to be exported, thus entailing an infringement of the law&mdash;even though the district justice is absolutely satisfied, beyond any possible manner of doubt, that that man is innocent, nevertheless, under the sub-section as it stands, the Revenue Commissioners can ask that that man's conveyance be forfeited, and the justice, then, has no discretion of any sort, kind or description.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister will make the argument against that, that the Revenue Commissioners would not do such a foolish thing, but I hold that it is a very bad principle for us to be enacting legislation here which has the effect of taking out of the Judiciary the power of decision as to whether a man is guilty or not guilty, and the effect of leaving the sub-section as it stands is to take out of the hands of the district justice the power of deciding whether the goods concerned belong to an innocent man or not, and to leave that innocent man to rely purely on the powers of remission that are contained in the Customs Code. Those powers of remission which are contained in the Customs Code are intended to refer to the case of a guilty man.  They are intended to refer to the case of a guilty man who is pleading for leniency, and in such a case I am prepared to admit that the case of a person pleading for leniency, whether guilty or not, is a case that could fairly be met by the Revenue Commissioners, but I do go so far as to say&mdash;and I say it with all sincerity, and accepting completely the personal <i>bona fides</i> of each and every Revenue Commissioner and every person concerned in the matter&mdash;that the Revenue Commissioners are far too inclined to be grasping in the manner in which they want to take powers from the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a specific case in which they are trying to take from the courts the power to decide whether a man is guilty or not.  If he is innocent, his goods should not be forfeited, and, if he is guilty, then they should be forfeited, but the Revenue Commissioners are trying to take that power of decision <Col N="2025" /> to themselves, instead of leaving it in the place in which it is proposed to be left by the Constitution and by the natural justice of any civilised people.  If that sub-section is passed in its existing form, it is going to be the first time, so far as I know, at any rate, that that power is being deliberately taken out of the hands of the courts, and I think that that would be a precedent that the Minister would be very sorry to accept.  I think that the powers of the Revenue Commissioners will be amply provided for under the amended section&mdash;amply provided for. There can be no possibility that a conveyance will not be forfeited where it is proved that it has been or is being used in a guilty manner.  That, I think, is what the Minister wants to do&mdash;to get at the wrongdoer&mdash;and with the discretion that is there vested in the judge, then that can be done.  Without that, no matter how innocent a man is, he must go pleading, as a guilty man, to the Revenue Commissioners for leniency.  I think that that is not the position in which the Oireachtas should ever put an innocent person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I was unable to be present when the Committee Stage of the Bill was before this House, because I would have said many things in connection with the legal procedure set out in the Bill, concerning the trial of offenders against the Customs law, but I must now confine myself to the amendment that has just been proposed by Senator Sweetman, and I cordially support it. This sub-section, as it stands, would empower the Revenue Commissioners to seize a Great Northern Railway train&mdash;with engine, carriages and its whole equipment&mdash;because it was made use of for the purpose of exportation of goods or the conveyance of goods contrary to this Act.  That, I say, is a most drastic and most extraordinary provision in any piece of legislation. The sub-section itself is rather drastic, because it gives power of forfeiture in the case of all ships, boats, carriages, or other conveyances, together with all horses and other animals and things made use of in the exportation or conveyance of any goods which are, by virtue of sub-section (1) of the section, <Col N="2026" /> liable to be forfeited.  Now, that is a most sweeping sub-section.  Under it, everything connected with the conveyance or exportation of any goods is drawn into the Revenue Commissioners' net.  The Revenue Commissioners could seize a ship or a railway train, it seems to me.  I do not know if that is correct, but at all events, it would appear that that power is claimed under this sub-section.</P>
      <P>I do not deny that in certain cases it would be just and proper that conveyances used for the transport of goods, contrary to the purposes of the Act, should be forfeited, but I myself think that the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is rather drastic.  I would much prefer to see simply the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; alone in the sub-section.  In fact, I would prefer to see the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the amendment to the sub-section which has been moved by Senator Sweetman, because he puts in a proviso that forfeiture is in the discretion of the judge. At all events, I think that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is too drastic, and I feel that, while desperate diseases require desperate remedies, one does not try desperate remedies on healthy people, and, therefore, we ought not give powers for the forfeiture of the property of people who in a great number of cases, are absolutely innocent of any complicity in the breaking of the law. This sub-section makes it mandatory, by reason of the inclusion of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; therein, that the goods of people who are innocent of all complicity in the breaking of the law, shall be forfeited, merely because their conveyances had been used for the purpose of exporting goods, the exportation of which is forbidden by this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out also that under existing law railway companies and steamship companies are public carriers.  They are bound to accept for conveyance goods handed to them for delivery, and they cannot, as a condition of accepting such goods, require conclusive proof that these goods are not intended for exportation contrary to law.  Therefore, with one branch of the existing law requiring public companies to carry all goods tendered to them for transport, this <Col N="2027" /> section makes it mandatory on the Revenue Commissioners to forfeit the property of public carriers.  For that reason I strongly support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like once again to urge the Minister to reconsider this section.  As he pointed out to me yesterday, under Section 3 sub-section (7) a person may be charged with the offence of being &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; concerned on or about a particular date, with certain goods.  I told him that I had no objection whatever to that sub-section for the reason that the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; was in it.  As far as I am concerned I should not mind the forfeiture of a ship, carriage or other conveyance if the persons owning them had knowingly engaged in this traffic, but you will find no such provision in the section under discussion. I would suggest to the Minister that he might let the amendment into the Bill, not necessarily with his approval; then when the Bill goes back to the Dáil, as it must, as he has already accepted one amendment, he will have an opportunity of reconsidering this section.  Possibly he may agree to insert the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; or to introduce somewhere in the section the same principle as is contained in Section 3 (7), by inserting the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;.  I can see that in certain cases the Minister might not be prepared to insert this word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;, but surely when it is a question of carrying goods for somebody else, it should be put beyond question that the person who had accepted the goods had reason to believe they were intended for export.  I am afraid this Bill is extraordinarily like one or two other Acts of which we have experience, that in order to catch a certain number of guilty persons, the Minister is determined to involve a number of innocent persons and leave it to the commissioners to decide whether they will proceed against them or not. In a number of cases it is extraordinarily difficult for an innocent person to prove that he is not guilty where that onus is put upon him. Under this particular section, the Revenue Commissioners have only to <Col N="2028" /> prove that a particular ship or conveyance was used for a particular purpose and it shall then be forfeited. The Minister must see that is going unnecessarily far.</P>

      <P>I think I have reiterated, <i>ad nauseam</i> as some members of the House might think, the fact that no new principle under our law, which in this case is also the British law which we have taken over here, is introduced in this Bill.  Senator Ryan is a very old friend of mine and I am very happy to see him in this House, but I think his eloquence is used, as is also that of Senator Sweetman, in a very bad cause in this instance.  However, I am very glad to hear his voice here.  These eloquent Senators, if I may so respectfully refer to them, and Senator Douglas are using their eloquence to condemn a principle which has been in the law at any rate ever since the Customs Consolidation Acts were passed.  We have operated that law for more than 20 years now, and since I became a member of the other House I never heard any complaints that it was tyrannical or drastic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  But what the Senator complained of, the likelihood of the forfeiture of a Great Northern Railway train, cannot take place without the courts being brought into operation nor can a ship be forfeited without the same procedure because, as I am advised, this section must be read and construed with another section of the Customs Consolidation Act of 1876.  It must be read in connection with Section 207 of that Act.  The lawyers will forgive me if I remind them of that fact that, perhaps, is not immediately before their minds. This is a quotation from Section 207 of the Customs Consolidation Act of 1876. It provides that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;whenever any seizure shall be made unless in the presence of the offender, master or owner as forfeited, <Col N="2029" /> under the Customs Acts... the seizing officer shall give notice in writing of such seizure and of the ground thereof to the master or owner of the things seized.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The next stage is the condemnation. The section provides that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;all seizures made under the Customs Acts...shall be deemed and taken to be condemned, and may be sold or otherwise be disposed of as the Commissioners of Customs may direct, unless the person from whom such seizures shall have been made ...shall within one calendar month give notice that he claims the things so seized.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On such notice being given the State must take proceedings in the courts for the forfeiture and condemnation of the goods.  Section 208 provides that all seizures under the Customs Acts shall be disposed of in such a manner as the Revenue Commissioners direct. I think that that meets Senator Ryan's points.</P>

I think it might be a very useful provision, if <Col N="2031" /> we had that power, to help us in a shortage of wagons.  It might be a way of helping out our services, but the fact is that we cannot use that power without going to the courts&mdash;and the courts have not their hands tied in the way Senator Sweetman suggests&mdash;&mdash;</P>

For the last five years, since I became Minister for Finance, I have had appeals made to me or to the Revenue Commissioners against the seizure of lorries.  There have been seizures, admittedly, but where seizures were made, they were fully in accordance with the law, and I think the power is necessary to meet the problem we are up against.  I have replied to the strong arguments made against using that power by saying that it is used only in accordance with law, which means that the cases must be submitted to the courts.</P>

      <P>We discussed this question, also, at great length yesterday, and I have examined it a little bit further since. Quite simply the position is this: with all respect to the Minister, I do not think his advisers will go farther than to say that there is a possible element of doubt as to whether my view is not the correct one.  The Minister will recall what happened in the Brennan case and the Gethins case.  Reference was made in the latter case, in a minority judgment only, which meant that the previous decision had affected his opinion, but I would suggest to the Minister that I think that what he wants is to secure that the defendant gets his costs under the circumstances in question, and I do not think it can do any harm to have a specific proviso inserted in the Bill.  Probably, the Parliamentary draftsman might not like my exact wording, but I do not think that it can do any possible harm to put it in the Bill, and if this doubt does exist, I think it will be much safer to include it.  If the Minister does not like my wording, I would be happy to agree to any other form of wording that would meet the point.</P>

      <P>In view of the exhaustive review made by Senator Douglas on the previous occasion, there is no need for me to make another detailed statement.  During the past year, the Federation of Irish Manufacturers, both in deputation to the Minister and in correspondence with the Minister, submitted the views of manufacturers generally.  We indicated the avenues in which we felt the Minister might be more accommodating in the matter which is the subject of Senator Douglas' motion.  I rise to support very strongly the motion that a commission should be set up to examine the entire matter of the incidence of direct taxation&mdash;income-tax, corporation profits tax, and the other forms of direct taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, the present system is a hand-me-down from John Bull, and, like most hand-me-downs, it is a misfit as far as this country is concerned. Does anyone suggest that if we started from scratch we would have inflicted on ourselves so unwieldy and complicated a system as the one now under discussion?  The mover of the motion and others did not stress one important point, that is, that the existing system is so intricate and puzzling that its administration costs absorbed too great a proportion of the gross yield.  A simplified system should reduce the cost of collection.  I suggest further that the present system is definitely unfair.  People with fixed incomes, <Col N="2035" /> shopkeepers and industrialists upon whose morality an implied slur was cast the other day, these people with audited returns, together with the people with fixed incomes, are probably the only sections of the community who do pay their proper share of direct taxation.  What of the others?  Farmers on a valuation basis, professional men and others who do not submit audited accounts, are assessed by guess work or hit-and-miss methods, and it is common knowledge that in such cases there is wholesale evasion.  There should be some ceiling fixed for the amount of direct taxation to be taken from business, or agriculture for that matter.  All forms of direct taxation combined should not take more than 10/- in the £ from any activity, and I doubt if the man in the street has any idea of the heavy burden of direct taxation on industry at present.  It is no exaggeration to say that industry yields more to the State than to its owners.</P>
    <P>British post-war plans already disclosed offer considerable relief to industry, and full details of these are in the hands of the Minister.  During the course of this debate we have had reference to capital, and it is well to ask: What is capital?  It certainly is more than the original amount paid up on shares.  To this must be added all loans, debentures and overdrafts, indeed all moneys needed to run the business.  The total of these should be the basis on which taxation would be based.  The future of the country depends on high standard efficiency from agriculture and industry.  That efficiency will only be attained by ability, enterprise and foresight, and these qualities will be stifled unless we evolve an intelligent and equitable system of direct taxation to suit our peculiar Irish economy.  A prosperous and progressive community will yield more revenue than a stagnant and indignant one.  Retrospective taxation is bad in principle and cannot be justified. We hope the Minister will not continue it.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House does not suggest to the Minister for Finance that he must be content with less revenue, but that he should examine or <Col N="2036" /> cause to be examined the present system of direct taxation, with a view to its revision to suit our needs.  I hope, therefore, the Minister will find it possible to accept the motion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with a great deal of interest to the statement of Senator Douglas last night.  I am very interested in this question from different points of view and different angles, from the academic and theoretic points of view and also from the practical. <Col N="2037" /> I would like to compliment wholeheartedly Senator Douglas on his presentation of his case, but at the same time there were some matters drawn in by him that I think in good taste would be much better left out&mdash;his references to the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government in regard to certain aspects of recent taxation were hardly called for on this occasion.  In view of everything I think it would also have been better if his reference to the Great Southern Railways shares were left out altogether.  I would like to have a good deal more time than there is available to go into this question. As I mentioned a few minutes ago&mdash;I think I frightened the Minister and those Senators who understood me&mdash; I could hold forth for a very long time on this question.  For a long time I have been interested in the question and I have compiled some views in regard to it generally.  I would like very much to have an opportunity of reading my views, following Senator Douglas' example.  But that would cover, roughly, about five hours, so Senators will see that any comments I may be able to make on this motion must fall very far short of what I would like to make.</P>
    <P>There are two parts to the motion. One calls for the simplification of the income-tax code and with that I do not think anyone will disagree.  I would like to see the whole code simplified but I cannot see how it is going to be done.  Senator Douglas did not himself show how it was going to be done.  As a matter of fact I think, if I remember rightly, towards the end of his statement, he admitted that it is a matter that, to use the common phrase, bristles with difficulties.  The difficulty lies in this, as far as I can see, that the income-tax code goes very far in its endeavours to hurt people as little as possible.  Therein lies the difficulty.  In the code all kinds of allowances may be made and all kinds of reliefs and deductions may be granted in order to ease the burden on particular classes of taxpayers.  As long as we agree that special conditions and special circumstances may be taken into account it seems to me that it will be almost impossible to achieve the simplicity that we desire.  We can <Col N="2038" /> simplify the code by levying your tax at a definite firm rate and having no exceptions.  If we make up our minds to do that, then I think we can achieve a good measure of simplicity, but whether the cure would not be very much worse than the disease is a matter on which Senators can come to their own conclusions.  For myself, I doubt it.  Another point raised by Senator Douglas is one of current interest and importance, that is, the question of taxation of profits.  We may argue for a long time as to whether a tax is too heavy or not, but in any case we have accepted the principle of taxation.</P>
    <P>I think the principle that we have adopted in taxation is that for all practical purposes profits only may be taxed.  Capital may not be taxed. Unless it can be shown that under the system capital as capital is being taxed, that capital as capital is being taken away by the State I do not know that we can agree very much with Senator Douglas' contention.  I would like to say that I do not at all agree that it is an ideal thing to attempt to level incomes by means of taxation.  In theory, at any rate, that is wrong.  At least it is inadvisable.  Whether the law is so designed as to take away that part of the national wealth that is capital which is used for the production of that further wealth which is essential if incomes are to be levelled in the way they ought to be, whether that is being done is something that Senator Douglas did not, I think, attempt to prove.  If it were true it would be indeed very dangerous.</P>
    <P>There is one other point to which I would like to make reference.  It is one I think the public would like very much to have some enlightenment about. There is a certain feeling abroad to some extent that in the ordinary course of events taxpayers, unless they employ one of these people generally described as income-tax experts, lose something.  There is growing up throughout the country a certain feeling that unless they go out and get somebody who is really an expert to come in to prepare their accounts and then go and deal with the inspector of taxes on their behalf, they are going <Col N="2039" /> to pay in taxes something they should not properly have to pay.  I do not myself subscribe to that view at all. I think that the inspectors of taxes are among the most reasonable of our civil servants.  I think the difficulty has arisen in this way, that very many people fail to fill up their forms when they should be filled up, with the result that there is considerable delay, and then eventually the income-tax inspector must himself make the assessment. Then, because of the delay, and because, perhaps, of the magnitude of the assessment, the people get a fright, and they feel they must go out and get someone in the nature of an expert to prepare their forms and their accounts and present them to the inspector of taxes.  Probably this is as good an opportunity as we may get for the purpose, and I think it would be in the public interest if this matter could now be explained publicly and cleared up. I think Senator Douglas will have achieved something worth while, and the community will thank him if as a result of his bringing this motion some assurance can be given that taking things by and large, whether they employ an income-tax expert or not, tax-payers are not mulcted for more than their proper share.</P>
    <P>With the idea of a commission, I agree.  I would like to see a commission appointed that would investigate this matter.  It often occurred to me that it would be a good idea.  I think the British appointed a commission a good while ago.  How many years ago I do not know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>Correct.  Income-tax law was not anything as involved then as it is now, but I think that after that commission had sat for a considerable time investigating the simplification of all forms of the code they eventually came to the conclusion that they could do no better than had been done already.  Whether we are now more enlightened than the people were then is another matter.  It might be worth while to have the commission to examine the question, as I say.  I <Col N="2040" /> agree we should have a commission, but the question arises who is to compose it.  I have felt for a long time that there is in its own way a permanent commission sitting investigating this matter.  I know that certainly in the towns of the west of Ireland the income-tax inspectors and their staffs have to work not an ordinary working day, but considerable overtime in order to keep up with the work that they have to do.  I am sure that these men are not at all keen on a more involved system than is necessary.  I also feel that the Revenue Commissioners are not people who are keen on retaining an involved system if it can be avoided. I believe from such inquiries I have been able to make that there is an effort on the part of the Revenue authorities in consultation with their staff throughout the country to seek a more simplified system than obtains.</P>
      <P>In any case I should like the Minister to assure us that he and his Department are interested in and are watching this matter.  However, if we agree that there should be a commission, it seems to me that the only people who can properly compose it would be representatives of the Department of Finance itself and the Revenue Commissioners. The time I allotted myself to devote to the motion has passed. Whether I have said what I wanted to say as effectively as I should have done is another matter.  The only thing is that all my thought and all my study of this has been done in the Irish language, and I would rather that I should deal with it in the Irish language, but since Senator Douglas went to such great pains in preparing the case, and was anxious to have it discussed and to hear the views of other people, it was really in deference to him that I spoke in English.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for allowing me to intervene.  In doing so I am sorry, on account of the variety of matters I have had to deal with in the last few days, that I have not <Col N="2041" /> been able to give to Senator Douglas' motion, and to his address of last night, the serious consideration that I would like to give them, and that I believe they are worthy of.  The motion is a very comprehensive one; it is an all-embracing kind of motion as far as taxation is concerned, and would require a good deal of time, but, elaborate as it is, it would require from anybody who intends to deal with the matter seriously, and more especially from the Minister for Finance, very considerable time to make an adequate reply.  Therefore, all I am saying to-day is not to be accepted as an adequate reply.  I listened with great attention to Senator Douglas last night.  I like to have subjects of that kind brought before this House, and the other House, and dealt with in the objective way that, with one or two exceptions, Senator Douglas dealt with the subject of income tax generally.  While I listened with great attention, I must frankly confess that I was a bit irritable towards the end, because in a third of his speech the Senator went into detail on small matters relating to the Budget and the Finance Act of last year which, I humbly suggest to the House, did not add anything to his case, and almost took away some of the good impression that the earlier part of the statement had made on me. There is a time for such discussion when the Finance Bill is before the House.  I suggest respectfully that it was not his fault if he was not here last year to make the speech he made last night.  Having dealt first of all with the big principle he worthily raised, and that we have discussed, he might easily have left the other matters until the Finance Bill came to this House, when I would be quite willing to meet and to debate with him or with any Senator subjects relating to corporation profits tax and a variety of other questions, judged in the light of discussions that we were going to have, that are of rather less importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said so much, I think the main things in Senator Douglas' address to which I listened with attention and interest related first to the fact that we ought to have an Irish system of taxation.  I do not think <Col N="2042" /> anyone here will object to that.  We ought to have one.  But that is a very big undertaking and I hesitate to make any remote promise that I am going to tackle it.  Frankly it is a very big job, and as Minister for Finance I think I can honestly say that I have two men's work to do in the normal year.  I am kept going night and day. I am kept in the Dáil and in the Seanad&mdash;I think too frequently&mdash;with legislation of one kind or another. One Senator who was very courteous and kindly politely said to me the other night that he wished he could hear me more often in this House.  I do not think Senator Baxter would agree with that.</P>

      <P>As Senator Hayes reminded us in a debate the other night, I try to be.  Therefore, when Senator Douglas asks for a new code of law relating to taxation it is a very big job to tackle.  The laws of Britain were taken over here holus bolus, a very natural thing to do when the new State was set up.  If the circumstances when this State was set up had been different, it is quite possible that after a year or two, if things had run more smoothly&mdash;they did not run smoothly for a time&mdash;in the normal course probably the Government of the day would gradually have set up a variety of different commissions&mdash;it could not be done in a hurry&mdash;one to deal with a code of law, based naturally on common law with which we grew up, and taxation laws would probably come in their turn.  That was not done.  I believe it will have to be done some day.  I believe we should have working now expert lawyers starting, if you like, with the system of local government law.  I tried to <Col N="2043" /> do something by getting that law consolidated. We have passed one or two Acts dealing with local government which consolidates that law.  I believe that the time has come when more or less these laws must be taken section by section, and that the best and most competent men we can get on the legal side should be employed to deal with them.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Finance, I am talking against myself there because some of these things have been put up to me, and I am fighting them on the question of cost.  I believe that this thing should be done and will have to be done.  We will have to devise for ourselves a legal code that will suit ourselves.  In saying this I do not want to be taken as suggesting that the code of tax here is not suited to us or is out of harmony with our lives.  We have grown up with it and it has grown up with us.  But I do believe that the people who will have to devise a new code will find it very difficult.  They may modify it, there are always changes taking place both in our customs and in our taxation and there are other things, too, that will have to be taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be wise, some time, that a commission should be set up to examine the position.  I do not know whether that is the best procedure or not.  I am just suggesting that without giving it adequate thought or consideration. I do not know whether it would be the best method but, however, I make the suggestion that we might set a number of lawyers to work. You may not get many of the senior men because they would be probably more profitably employed elsewhere but certainly the younger men could be found although some of them too, might prefer pleading in court to this office or chamber work.  It may be difficult to get the type of man who will fit into this work.  I am just offering these criticisms in passing.  I do not know how many of these lawyers would be required, I hope not too many and that the cost will not be too much. Take for instance, the law regarding taxation.  These lawyers could be set <Col N="2044" /> to consolidate and codify the law first and give it to us as it stands and another group of lawyers might be asked to propose amendments to that law that would suit us best. There are eminent and distinguished lawyers in this House and they appreciate what would be required. I am just offering this suggestion as some day the House may be asked to approve of proposals to bring the laws up to date and, as Senator Douglas suggested, to bring the income-tax law into harmony with our Irish lives and Irish economy.  I do not know how long it would take, probably a considerable time, even if one section were put to deal with the tax law and another section put to deal with the local government law.  I would not like myself to be faced with the job of piloting through the Dáil and the Seanad the necessary amending Bills. However, if it comes my way, I will do my best, but I do think we should have the lawyers at work even now.</P>

      <P>I have not suggested this to my colleagues who have already considered this matter on several occasions.  I know very well that the Taoiseach has been interested in the subject of revising those laws for a long time.  He has not got his way yet, however, either because of finance or other reasons, but at any rate he has been pressing it, and I suppose a beginning will be made, as the supporters of John Redmond used to say about the coming of Home Rule: &ldquo;At no far distant date.&rdquo; In addition to what I say about the lawyers, they would have to be helped and guided by our experts on income-tax law and customs and excise law, and I may say in passing that I know no set of officials in this State, and goodness knows we have admirable civil servants, no better in the world, especially amongst the senior men, who work harder than the income-tax officials. They are hard-working men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>He is a lucky man <Col N="2045" /> to have something to worry about. Senator Foran and I do not worry so much.  It is easy to reckon our income-tax, and everybody knows what I have. As I said, the lawyers would have to be guided by those experts, and in present conditions it would be difficult to spare them.  I assure the House that if I were asked to put at the service of the lawyers revising our income-tax code two or three experienced men, I do not know how I could do it in present circumstances.  I know some Senators and some of my own colleagues and particular friends will answer: &ldquo;Get more staff&rdquo;, but you cannot make this kind of staff in a year or two.  Therefore, you can see the difficulty of getting a commission or committee of this kind to work.  I was very happy to hear Senator Douglas pay the compliment he did last evening to the staff of the Revenue Commissioners. I know the Senator knows those men and has contact with them and that he realises that in them he has a first rate set of officials despite the jokes made about them.  I remember seeing somewhere, I was reminded of it the day before yesterday, a series of cartoons on the rearing and breeding of a revenue officer&mdash;a tax inspector.  He was seen in a perambulator being fed on vinegar and as he grew up he was fed on various acidulous types of food.  Before I became Minister for Finance I had a very slight knowledge of the revenue people.  I filled up my forms for my income-tax for years and then I began to get the idea that I was paying too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was 20 years or more ago.  I went to the inspector in my district and showed him my form.  I told him what I had signed to pay and what I had paid, and he said: &ldquo;Let me have a look at it for a day or two.&rdquo; I did so. I was not a Minister at the time; and it was not a case that I was recalcitrant, or one who was not prepared to accept his obligation.  Now, so far as that inspector of taxes was concerned, there was no obligation on him to pay any more attention to me than to any ordinary taxpayer.  He asked me to come in in a day or two while he could look over my papers covering a few years past, and, when I went back, a <Col N="2046" /> considerable sum of money was refunded to me.  That is the common practice of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners so far as I know.  You have to be frank with them and tell them the whole facts, and, if you do so, you will get a fair and square deal from them and they will not demand from you or from anybody else one fraction of a cent beyond what the law requires.  I should like to give the assurance, if it is necessary to give it, to Senator O Buachalla; that where the income-tax payer gives the full facts, the instructions of the Revenue Commissioners to all their staffs is to help the taxpayer and give him the full benefit of every concession or allowance that the law allows, and to see that he gets it.  If the taxpayer overlooks it himself, then it is the duty of the officer concerned to see that full justice is done and that every allowance that should be given is allowed to the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>Now, so much with regard to one important aspect of Senator Douglas's motion and the remarks he delivered to us yesterday on that motion.  That aspect was concerned with the reformation of our law, and I do not think it is necessary to say any more on that.  Another suggestion, however, was that in the framing of the new law, it should be made simpler.  In that connection, I might quote the words of Lord Stamp, a former Revenue official in the British Civil Service, who started life as an income-tax inspector, and who, when he was asked for simplicity in connection with income-tax, said, in effect, that it was &ldquo;asking for the moon&rdquo;.  In the same way, when the Senator asks for a simplifying of this matter he is asking for the moon.</P>

Stamp before the Royal Commission on Income-tax on 1st August, 1919.  The reference is No. 9581.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is what he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It may not be out of place at this point to register a deliberate opinion that the clamour for a simple...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>the word &ldquo;simple&rdquo; is underlined;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...income-tax, which he who runs may read, is an absurd one.  In many particulars, not always the most important, the existing chaos of rules can indeed be greatly simplified, but if the tax is to be so highly subjective as to reflect every slight difference in ability, on <Col N="2048" /> grounds of aggregate amount of income, marital condition, family responsibility, character of income, elements of capital, origin and source of profits, and all the other differentiae which are now urged, then, unless it is to be reduced to the status of a voluntary offering, it must be a complicated system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, the system was brought in in the United States&mdash;I interpolate that remark myself.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The United States had a full opportunity to get a simple system, having no previous commitments, and the great advantage of a prolonged study of other nations. Within a few months there were widespread complaints that the law and system were &lsquo;irritatingly incomprenensible&rsquo;. In 1915 I was prompted to write: &lsquo;There is the usual failure to see that modern life and modern commerce are so complex and diversified that to expect a tax form which shall read like a pill advertisement on the railway, and yet close down upon every case, is asking for the moon.&rsquo; It is almost pathetic to see how reformers propose smooth graduations and curves based upon formulae as a part of their contribution towards &lsquo;simplifying&rsquo; the tax.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I think that that is as good a piece of evidence against the possibility of supplying this or any other country with simplified income-tax forms as could be found anywhere. Those who have had any acquaintance with the United States of America will remember&mdash;I do not know whether it was immediately after the last war or during the war&mdash;that income-tax was introduced into the United States for the first time, and, as Lord Stamp has pointed out, they had a full opportunity of getting a simple system, as they had had no previous commitments, and had the advantage of the experience of other nations. They had, for instance, the British code before them; they had the Irish code, which was the British code at that time, before them; and they also had the French code; and, God knows, our system, bad as it is, as compared <Col N="2049" /> with the French system would be simple enough for anybody from the primary schools.  At any rate, the United States had before them these systems upon which to build their own system and erect an income-tax code for themselves.  Notwithstanding that, there have been constant and bitter complaints by tax-payers all over America, reflected almost every year in the Congress of the United States, in regard to their income-tax code and the difficulty that their people find in filling up their forms and complying with the law.  Yet, there they had the opportunity of devising a simple code &mdash;as simple a code as could be devised &mdash;based upon the experience of other countries.</P>
    <P>I am afraid, Sir, that I have to go down now to the Dáil to deal with the Committee Stage of the Racing Bill, and there is a large number of amendments that I shall have to look into before I go there.  Therefore, I hope I shall be forgiven if I do not say very much more now.  I believe that I am as much interested in this matter as anybody in this House, although I have not as much money invested in Irish industries as some members of this House.  As a matter of fact, I think I have hardly any money invested in any industry, Irish or otherwise, but I am interested, as a citizen of this country, in the welfare of the country and the welfare of its people and, naturally, for that reason, I am interested in the development of Irish industry&mdash;sincerely interested and willing and anxious to help, even as Minister for Finance, in that direction.  I think it was this morning I read in the <i>Irish Times</i> an article on taxation wherein the writer&mdash;I do not know who he was; there was no name given&mdash; referred to the millions that had been retained in Irish industry even since the war despite our very heavy taxation.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I know it is true.  I have had the advantages as Minister of seeing the results.  I do not want to deny that taxation is very heavy and I am not sorry to see that millions have been reserved over the whole industrial and commercial field. Possibly, too, money is reserved now which would normally have been spent during the war if it were possible to spend it on the betterment of materials of industry that are required to improve and extend industry.  Many of them will have to spend very large sums to put their industries in a position to develop and extend so that they will be able to meet competitors in the world markets.  But bearing that in mind and realising that the taxation now imposed on industry is heavy, it would be wrong, I think, knowing the circumstances as it is given to me as Minister for Finance to know the circumstances, to overstate the claim.  In the case of any special industry or commercial undertaking or in the case of any individual I do not look for the names of the people concerned. I do not get any information but sometimes it comes to me officially in a variety of ways when appeals are made.  If people ask me what is the income of such and such a body I say I do not know.  I do know, taking the figures as a whole, that taxation is very heavy, but it is marvellous how well industry and commerce&mdash;certain types of commerce&mdash; have thrived under the very heavy load of taxation that is imposed on all sections of the community at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to see that heavy taxation continue, and it cannot continue if we are to develop industry.  It cannot continue if we are to make this country industrially sound and developed as I think everybody here would like to see it developed.  We cannot give encouragement to our industrialists to give that full employment we want to see, if we do not allow them enough profit to make it worth their while to develop and extend their enterprise, their industry and their ingenuity. I go that far with Senator Douglas.  I want to see everybody who has an industrial bent in this country&mdash; whether he be a capitalist or a worker, <Col N="2051" /> given full opportunity to exploit his ingenuity, his industry and his enterprise. If the load of taxation is too high here, we shall not get the development we would like to see.  I should like to see the State encourage that development in industry in every way. It has done so in the past to a very considerable extent.  It might be wise, as Senator Douglas suggested, to have that development directed by a system of taxation, but whatever way it be done&mdash;by direct tariffs, by quotas, reduction of taxation, grants or subsidies through the medium of the Industrial Credit Organisation, or by helping industrialists by a reduction of taxations to build up their industries&mdash;it must be faced and faced soon.  Please God, the war will come to an end soon and we shall live, I hope, to see this country as industrially prosperous as I think it is agriculturally prosperous at present with all respect to Senator Baxter. Senators will pardon me if I do not say anything further at present, in view of my pressing engagements elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened last night to Senator Douglas with great sympathy and great admiration.  He was approaching this problem from the point of view of the practical industrialist, the practical business man and the accountant.  I am afraid there was more sympathy in some respects in my attitude than understanding because I have always admitted that where figures are concerned, I am the sort of person who if he divided two into an even number without getting a remainder would feel relieved. In so far as I could follow them, I had nothing but sympathy with Senator Douglas's aspirations.  It was when I looked at the question from the point of view of a lawyer that I was somewhat appalled because I realise that however necessary, desirable and reasonable were Senator Douglas's suggestions, to embody them in the existing code would involve such an alteration in the structure as almost to cause it to fall to pieces.  If we were to have an entirely new code, the consequences of a taxation system, departing as widely as they might have <Col N="2052" /> to from what I might call the English system, which is substantially our system now, might involve us in very great difficulty when we came to considerations of double taxation relief and the other interconnections there are between the incomes of people derived from Ireland and from England. Speaking for myself, that is to say, as a lawyer who has occasionally to try to find out what this code means, I could wish that there were much fewer departures from the English code.  We are much too apt to wait to see what they do in England and then take that over here, making some slight alterations.  The result of that is that English textbooks are misleading, and that English and Irish case law tends to diverge in a number of respects.  The differences between the laws are not so great as to call for any real differences in social policy, and departures only make matters more difficult.</P>
      <P>I think it is probably unnecessary to give examples of that.  I am sure my colleague, Senator Ryan, knows exactly the kind of case I am referring to.  First of all, if we are going to make any departure at all, if we consider a departure is necessary, let us do it after skilled and careful consideration. Let us not do it just for the sake of doing it, which I am afraid has occurred even in the case of Finance Acts in the past.  That is the first point I should like to make&mdash;as far as possible for the sake of simplicity of the laws and for the sake of understanding amongst accountants and for the payers of income-tax, let us keep our code parallel with the existing English code and <i>vice versa.</i> If commissions are set up, either in this country or in England, to consider what modifications are necessary, and what improvements can be made, I think that both countries, as far as possible, ought to try to keep their systems running on parallel lines, because with intercommunications of travel and investments and the way in which the finances of the two countries are interwoven, it may cause very great difficulties if you get a substantial departure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This code of income-tax started with <Col N="2053" /> a series of Acts now about 100 years old.  They developed with the years, one after the other, a bit of tinkering here and a bit of tinkering there, just as is done in the modern Finance Acts. In 1918, you had an Act which is frequently referred to as a code, but it is nothing of the sort.  It was a consolidation which, with a few alterations, merely took sections from the old Acts.  It was merely an attempt to put into one Act the substance of the other Acts, and to remove sections which were inconsistent.  It is very likely that the time has come&mdash;after all, it is a good stretch from 1918 to 1945&mdash;to introduce another Consolidation Act which will introduce other alterations made in the Finance Act, and again, to bring it up to date.</P>
    <P>I would very strongly support the view that as much of the principles of Senator Douglas' motion as can be fitted into the framework of the present code should be introduced but I doubt whether it would be possible to introduce as many as all of us would feel to be desirable.  If we are going to have a completely new system, speaking for myself, I think that it would take five to ten years' preparation among accountants, lawyers, and Revenue officials, to block out the system.  And, when you do get it, you will find that the imagination of man has not kept pace with the possible diversity of facts which human experience will produce, and you will probably have a period then in which you will have to amend, amend, and amend.</P>
    <P>In other words, while I sympathise with Senator Douglas in everything he has said, as I understand it at any rate, there will be enormous difficulties in putting it into force, and I suggest that our first policy should be one of caution to avoid mere differences for the sake of differences.  Secondly, if we cannot give effect to what Senator Douglas has said, that we should do it in the way he envisages, a commission with at least three elements represented should be set up and if necessary, should take evidence from people outside the country as well as from people inside the country, and, after a full and thorough examination, <Col N="2054" /> should make their alterations with prayer and fasting.</P>
    <P>When I say evidence from people outside the country, I do not want anyone to misunderstand me.  Such a misunderstanding took place the other day.  Science and knowledge are international things.  Genius is not the perquisite of any geographical entity or of any national State.  To a certain degree, these are problems of pure science, combined with experience. There is a mathematical element, a statistical element and a logistical element in it, in which the brain of a Chinese may be capable of giving assistance as valuable as the brain of an Irishman.</P>
    <P>On the other side, there is the element of experience.  Conditions are changing, and there are the mutable elements which you must consider, the surroundings of the country in which you are, and the mathematical basis of your plans.  Let us enlist, on the mathematical side, brains from anywhere in the world, not to supplant our own, but to supplement them.  Let us enlist in this, as in all things, experience from outside which will enable us to see how far our problems differ from those of other men because of the circumstances.</P>
    <P>If we do that we will go as near to meeting Senator Douglas' motion as we possibly can.  But I do not know whether reforms can be carried out immediately at all, and I am torn in two, because I have sympathy with the view of Senator Douglas from the point of view of practical desirability, and appreciation of the difficulties that would be involved in fitting them into the present code without a very lengthy examination which might reveal difficulties none of us at the present moment can conceive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I had not the advantage of hearing the speech of Senator Douglas.  I happened to be in the country, and, therefore, I am compelled to take into consideration only the wording of the motion itself and the speeches I have already heard to-day.  I agree, generally, with the opinions which have been expressed by my colleague, Senator Kingsmill <Col N="2055" /> Moore.  While everybody feels that the income-tax code is complex and difficult to understand, very few people have been able to find a solution which would enable that code to be simplified with any prospect of practical success.</P>
      <P>This income-tax, as has been stated over and over again, is a tax upon income.  That may seem to be a truism, but it was necessary to repeat those words from time to time because in the carrying out of the Income Tax Acts, the revenue authorities in England, and in this country, often appeared to overlook the fact that the Income Tax Acts do not empower a taxation on capital.  So, therefore, in order to tax income in all its branches, it is necessary to have this rather complicated code.  The revolt against the intricacies of the income-tax code is not confined to this country&mdash;I am sure it has been very strong in England and that it is still strong.  There, up to the present, they have been unable to find a satisfactory solution, and I think myself that it would be unwise for us at the moment to break away from the existing income-tax code and to form a code of our own, unless we see clearly ahead where such a code would lead us.</P>
      <P>Now, the Income Tax Acts began with the origin of income-tax, with Pitt, at the beginning of the 19th century. The Acts have been in force for over 100 years, from 1842 until 1853 when they were temporary, and from 1853 until the present day they have been permanent.  The English people have found the income-tax code in England to be very complicated.  In fact, they have in England Law Reports called &ldquo;Tax Cases&rdquo;, confined solely to decisions of the courts relating to the Income Tax Acts.  They were commenced in the 'eighties and now comprise 25 volumes.  We have here our income-tax cases, but they are hidden away in the Law Reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that about 60 of them have been reprinted by the Revenue Commissioners for their income-tax inspectors, and I suggest that they ought to place those Irish income-tax cases at the disposal of the purchasing public. Some of these cases are, no doubt, <Col N="2056" /> supplied to libraries, but I think they should be available generally for purchase by the ordinary taxpayer and the ordinary lawyer as the English cases are available.  It would be very easy to bind these cases together and to sell them in one volume or in two volumes as the case may be.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Kingsmill Moore that our, so to speak, economy, being so bound up with England, requires that we should be slow to depart very far from the basis of taxation at present prevailing there.  The Income Tax Acts in England are not very different from our own, even since the setting up of this State, because I think it can be said that when the Revenue Commissioners in this country read the English Finance Acts, they derive from them excellent ideas which were incorporated afterwards in our own Finance Bills.</P>
    <P>In the old days we have heard that our legislation often lagged behind English legislation.  For example, the English Statute of Frauds was passed in 1677, whereas the Irish Statute of Frauds was not passed until 1695.  If we review our Income Tax Acts since 1922, we will find the very same provisions in our various Finance Acts as have been adopted in England in Finance Acts passed a few years previously.</P>
    <P>Senator Kingsmill Moore said there was a slight difference between the Income Tax Acts in England and in this country which created a certain difficulty in the use of suitable textbooks. That may be so, but I do not think that it is an insuperable difficulty. This motion presupposes, of course, that the income-tax law or code is very difficult, and is to a certain extent inequitable.  I cannot at the moment speak on the latter part, although I can speak on the first part,</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>And with much feeling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Income-tax law is probably, with the exception of the death duty law, the most difficult to understand of all laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is worse than the death duty law.</P>

    <Col N="2057" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>But in any case, it is a law for experts, and I do not agree that all experts are experts on income-tax law.  It is very easy for a man to call himself an expert when he has a smattering of the subject and when 99 per cent. of the people he deals with know nothing of the subject.  If a law is so difficult that an expert is required, then, of course, something must be done.  But, at the moment, I think it would be unwise, until something similar has been done in England to simplify the law here.</P>
      <P>As regards the setting up of a commission here to simplify the income-tax law, the Minister for Finance has stated&mdash;I think rather optimistically&mdash; that this law could be simplified in a different way.  That might be, so far as consolidation is concerned, but it might not be sufficient for Senator Douglas or for those who hold with him that the law is in need of simplification.</P>
      <P>I think there is a great deal to be said for the simplification of the Acts passed in recent years dealing with corporation profits tax.  The Minister for Finance, I think, did not approve of the reference made by Senator Douglas to recent legislation on corporation profits tax, but if income-tax law is difficult, corporation profits tax law is impossible.  I think it is so complicated and impossible that the Minister might adopt a suggestion to leave the income-tax code alone and to do our best in the next Finance Bill to simplify the corporation profits tax law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is.  I feel that the corporation profits tax law has become impossible to work with any degree of satisfaction.  If Senator Douglas had done nothing else by his motion, which, I am informed, he moved with great ability, than to induce the Minister for Finance to consolidate and simplify the law relating to corporation profits tax, he will have done a good day's work for the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been greatly impressed by what Senator Ryan has <Col N="2058" /> said with regard to corporation profits tax.  That tax has, I know, been a great source of wealth to the Exchequer, and I suppose it is very badly needed.  There is a great danger about it, particularly in the way it affects industries.  The older industries had a chance because they could take the best of the years up to 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>That is excess profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am dealing with.  They could take the best of these three years as a standard year, and it was only the amount of profit on that that was liable to excess corporation profits tax.  But new industries had not that advantage, because very often they came in at a time when they were struggling&mdash;when they were training workers and incurring a great deal of expense and had no profit for a certain period.  The result was they were liable to pay excess profits tax, excess corporation profits tax, I think they call it, on practically all their profits except for the allowance of £2,500 or something more or 9 per cent., I think, of their capital.  That was not very much of an advantage, and the result was they had to pay tax on practically every penny they earned. Paying 7/6 in the £ in income-tax and I think 50 per cent. on what was over a certain figure of their profit meant they paid a very large proportion of what they earned to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>75 per cent. on the average.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems a startling figure, but it is a true figure.  Then these industries made money because they had foresight, and because they did what the Government asked them to do.  They got in sufficient raw material to keep them going during the entire period of the emergency, and they were able to give employment during that period.  As the House knows very well, a lot of factories did not do that.  They did not hearken to the advice that they received, and they did not get their raw material, with <Col N="2059" /> the result that in many cases they threw a lot of workers out of employment. The people who had the foresight did not gain anything out of their foresight.  They are paying tax, as I say, with the result that if they were manufacturing much less than they are, they would make the same profit.  That would be a great disadvantage to the community and to the consumer, and would probably reduce the amount of labour employed.  They should get some encouragement for not being idle and lazy and for not producing less.  If they were producing less, they would be using less raw material, which will have to be replaced probably at three times the original cost, and in some cases probably four, or five or six times the original cost. They will have no reserve because of the amount taken from them in taxation to meet the stress of times to come and to give them a supply of raw materials and keep industry up to the standard that is required.  That is a danger particularly for a new industry. I think that it is a matter the Minister ought to take into consideration very carefully.  Perhaps it would be a good thing if the excess corporation profits tax were abolished as early as possible in order that industry would be allowed to develop.  Industry does not want to develop if it is to be taxed out of existence.  It is a case on the one hand of heads I win, tails you lose, because if there is a profit the profit will go to the Exchequer, and if there is a loss the industry loses.  That is the only matter I would like to deal with, but I would ask the Minister to give it very careful consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the members of the House for their references to the remarks that I made, and generally for the response that was given to them.  I would like also to thank the Minister for his speech.  I did not expect him to deal with mine.  He is much too wise a Minister for that, and I would not expect a Minister to deal with a motion of this kind after a few hours unless he thought it was not worth anything at all.  I have no complaint on that account.  I would like first to deal with one or two of his <Col N="2060" /> criticisms, but perhaps first I should like to say that I am in substantial agreement with Senator O'Dea.  I would point out that the only criticism I got from the Minister was about the part of my speech which referred to problems mentioned by Senator O'Dea. May I say first that it was suggested with my full consent that the Minister should intervene and should not be present when I was replying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to mention that so that it might not look in any way that there was any discourtesy.  I should like to say that the very part of my speech which rather irritated the Minister is the part I put in, because it has been expressed to me and because it is the view of the people whom I think I may say I more or less represent in this House.  I did not show the whole of the speech I had prepared to anyone. I kept very closely to it although I did not keep to it exactly.  I did show portions of it to a leading accountant and his criticism of it was the exact opposite of that of the Minister.  He said that I was taking up far too much time in dealing with the future about which the Government would do nothing, and that it would be very much better to deal with matters which were urgent, on which people felt strongly, because there was some possibility that action might be taken.  I agree with almost everything Senator O'Dea has said about corporation profits tax and excess corporation profits tax.  Inequities have arisen out of last year's Budget.  The Minister thought I was trying to say something which I would not have said a year ago.  If I had been here a year ago I could not have said what I said, because I would not have had the knowledge.  I felt it was wise not to give details of the cases given to me by accountants and for that reason I dealt in general terms with hardships.  Both Senator O'Dea and Senator Ryan seemed to think that corporation profits tax and excess corporation profits tax most need revision. I would be very much inclined to agree and would certainly say that there is very little inequity, there is some but very little, in the administration of income-tax, but a great deal of inequity in corporation profits tax. May I withdraw the word &ldquo;administration&rdquo;, <Col N="2061" /> because that might be taken as suggesting that it was in the operations of the officials?  I do not mean that at all, but there is very little inequity in the law and practice of income-tax and there is a good deal of inequity as regards the law and practice of corporation profits tax and excess corporation profits tax, especially in regard to excess corporation profits tax.</P>
    <P>I could speak for hours on that, giving details which have been brought to my notice.  I have not referred to any personal problem or grievance.  Fortunately or unfortunately, I have not made much in the way of excess profits. I was bringing forward matters which had been brought to my notice.  They have no political significance of any kind.  Ninety-nine out of a hundred of the people concerned may be people with whom I disagree politically.  If anybody thinks that, by voting for a particular Party, he is going to get rid of income-tax, he is an extremely foolish person.  I cannot see, therefore, that this is likely to influence any election.</P>
    <P>A few points have arisen in the course of this debate to which I think it is only right I should refer.  I am not at all so impressed with the danger of a difference between the British system and our system as my friend, Senator Kingsmill Moore.  I do not think that he knows how different these are at the moment.  After he had spoken, I asked him if he had ever tried to fill up a form under the British war-code of income-tax.  He said he had not.  I have.  I have relatives in England and I was surprised at the difficulty I found in helping them.  I bought a <i>Daily Mail</i> book, which was not very good.  Then, I bought another book and I had three times the difficulty in ascertaining the liability of the relative of mine who asked me to help her than I would have had here&mdash;and I have had quite a lot of experience in filling forms for relatives, friends and staff here.  I am not an expert, but I do not believe that the ordinary income-tax form is at all as difficult as people think it is.  The Minister once spoke about the difficulty he found in filling in the form.  I do not think that it is difficult.  On the question <Col N="2062" /> of the Irish and British codes; there are considerable differences.  One of the greatest is that we had a corporation profits tax years after it had been abolished in Great Britain.  That does not seem to have caused the lawyers much trouble, I am not sure what the present position is, but I think that the tax has been revived during the war at 5 per cent.  When it had been abolished in England, we kept it on with a £10,000 limit.  I have a shrewd suspicion that it was kept on to catch one or two firms.  However, we did keep it on and it was a source of temptation to the Minister for Finance.  The limit was brought down to £2,500 and, now that it is at that figure, the temptation is to tighten it up.  I do not quarrel with the tightening up if it is equitable, but I am convinced that it is not.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dea put his finger on the cause of the greatest sense of grievance. I have attended meetings of manufacturers at which older manufacturers would have no grievance but a new one would feel that he was being taxed at a completely different rate from his competitors because he had not commenced business earlier. Then, there is the case where very small fees were being paid to directors before the war, even though they gave their whole time to the work.  That was not because they were not earning larger fees but because they felt that the business needed capital.  They were penalised because they left their money in the business whereas I think that they should be rewarded for doing so.  Again, as I emphasised in my speech, it is in the national interest that you should make it easier, from the tax point of view, to retain money in a business than to pay it out to individuals.  At the moment, the tax is generally less if you pay the money out to individuals.  That, I think, is bad.</P>
    <P>Another point with which I should like to deal is that made by Senator O Buachalla.  I do not think that the Minister replied at all adequately to Senator O Buachalla.  I am not in the position of the Minister, but I should say, without the slightest hesitation, that there is no need whatever to go to <Col N="2063" /> an income-tax expert to get your tax properly measured.  It may be necessary to go to an accountant so as to be able to give the income-tax inspector the correct figures.  It is generally advisable to do that, but my experience has been&mdash;I have gone on behalf of others to the tax inspectors &mdash;that the inspectors and their assistants are always prepared to help and prepared to make suggestions as to where you might be able to avail of one or other of the provisions.  I have never yet come across the case of an inspector who took up the attitude that the taxpayer had made a mistake and that he would tax him accordingly. It cannot be emphasised too much that one does not have to go to an income-tax expert to get his tax properly assessed.  It is very advisable, nevertheless, to have reasonable assistance, whether expert or not, so as to provide the inspector with the proper facts and figures.  A taxpayer may often mistakenly withhold facts or figures which are in favour of himself. I had one such experience.</P>
    <P>My father, who was an extremely conscientious person, received back a capital payment.  He asked me whether he should return it to the income-tax inspector.  I told him that he certainly should not, as it was a capital payment. I went to America and, on my return, I found that my father had some qualms of conscience, that he had returned the payment and paid income-tax in respect of it.  I went down to the inspector&mdash;this was before I was in public life so that there was no question of influence&mdash;and told him what happened.  He said: &ldquo;Are you really coming here to tell me that a man deliberately paid more income-tax than he should have paid?&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;You do not know my father&rdquo;.  He did not take my word for it but examined the matter and a refund was made.  I give that as an instance of what may happen.  My experience has been that, so long as one is acting honestly, if <i>bona fide</i> mistakes are made, the income-tax inspector will rectify them.  But one must realise that a great many people take up the attitude that, if they can evade income-tax, it is legitimate to evade it.  My <Col N="2064" /> personal opinion is that I have no more right deliberately to evade payment of what is a legal tax than I have to put my hand in a Senator's pocket.</P>

      <P>I do not think that I said that, and I certainly did not mean to say it.  It is perfectly right to get every possible assistance, but I say that you will get that from the average inspector, so that you need not pay anything that you are not legally bound to pay.  So far as I am concerned, I am prepared to get the best advice, whether from lawyers, accountants or any other bodies, to secure that I get every allowance and concession to which I am entitled, but I am not prepared to return false figures or to give false information or to withhold information for the purpose of securing those allowances or concessions. The Minister quoted Lord Stamp regarding simplification.  The question all depends on what one means by simplification. If one means that income-tax law should be such as could be read by an infant at school, then I say that that cannot be done any more in respect of income-tax law than in respect of any other law.  If one means that it is not possible to simplify income-tax as applied to individuals, I respectfully disagree.  In my speech, I suggested that one way in which income-tax could be simplified would be to make the tax payable on the taxpayer's actual income in an actual period of 12 months and not have a number of different assessments except where that cannot be avoided.  I think that there could be quite a good deal of simplification done in that way. Senator O Buachalla thought that I was trying to make a Party point by referring to Fianna Fáil.  I am prepared to make him a gift of that if he thinks that my remark was injudicious.  I was puzzled as to why that particular form of taxation was chosen, because it seemed to be most inequitable from the income-tax point of view.  I mentioned the Great Southern Railways only <Col N="2065" /> because the public mind had been concentrated on very substantial profits which were disclosed.  I do not think my friends in business will agree with me at all, but I am not convinced, until you have some way of dealing with profits on capital realisation, that you are dealing with it equitably.  If a person buys shares I cannot see how profits made on them differ from the profits I might make earning my livelihood.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>If you tax profits on realisation you must allow losses also but only on realisation.  In conclusion, I should like to say a word about the proposed commission.  I would like to see a body set up, and I do not mind very much whether it takes one or two years but composed of persons with experience.  The Minister thought young lawyers might do the work and young accountants; I presume he would include them, but I think we have men&mdash;I will not mention names, obviously&mdash;who are retired officials with experience.  They are not people who might be expected, having regard to their age, to give the same amount of work as younger men, but they could be willingly and extremely usefully employed at work of this kind. These retired public servants would be a very useful body.  By all means have young people as well, but the body should not be very large.  The commissioners could not do the work themselves.  The reason for that is probably the same reason why the Federation of Irish Manufacturers could not do it themselves.  They could not see the wood for the trees; they could not see the position of the Revenue Commissioners, although they could see their own position.  Some of them could but, speaking generally, I would not trust them to put up a code that any Minister would accept.  In the same way the Revenue Commissioners, trained in a difficult and intricate job, cannot see clearly how it affects trade.  The man who could give the most valuable assistance would be a qualified accountant who is a company secretary.  That kind of man would be most useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2066" /> I do not think it would be difficult to get such a commission.  It is not only that you would have a commission, and it is not only that you would get results from it, but I suggest that the setting up of such a body would have a good effect.  There is dissatisfaction&mdash;a lot of it reasonable&mdash;because of recent changes which have taken place.  This is an Irish State and an Irish Parliament, and we have got to a stage, after 20 years, when it would be a very good thing to get the income-tax, surtax, corporation profits tax, and excess profits tax considered by a body set up with the approval of the Minister, and even if there was not much of a change as a result, these codes would be examined by experts and it could be said that they had been examined by Irishmen and were to a large extent Irish codes. What I hope for as a result is an income-tax which would be a tax on the individual's income and a corporation profits tax which, even if higher, would be a tax on business and manufacturers' real profits.  I do not know in which tax I would include agriculture, or whether there might not have to be a third.  I thank the House for having listened to what I have had to say, and I am hopeful that the discussion here will help to consolidate opinion in favour of a change.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2067" /> I should like, in the first place, to congratulate the Minister on this Bill, generally, and, in particular, in relation to the clauses relative to compensation for fisheries, the part of the Bill in which I am specially interested. That, I hope, will save me some trouble later on, because I wish to assure the Minister that there is no doubt in my mind as to the satisfactory nature of the compensation clauses.  However, just as Senator Sweetman this afternoon expressed a doubt as to the utility of speaking to amendments concerning which the Minister has already arrived at a decision, I, too, am doubtful whether, in speaking now, this is a case of wasting one's sweetness on the desert air.  There has been a certain amount of prejudice exhibited, in some of the previous discussions, regarding the question of fisheries, and I should like to deal with these matters for a little while.  To begin with I should like to point out that the birds in the air, the animals in the field, the fishes in the river and, I might say, in any portion of the sea surrounding our coasts are all, just as much as the people of this country, part of our nation or of our native land and our environment.  Hence, it would be a serious matter to allow to take place the destruction of any of those components which go to make up our native environment.  Accordingly, I want to have an examination made into this matter from a broadminded standpoint.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that we are proceeding rapidly towards the mechanisation of everything, and that we may ultimately arrive at a condition of affairs in this country such as exists at present in some of the very large cities of the world, where they are surrounded by nothing but artificial things and where everything is mechanical.  Our only chance of living a natural life at all is to get away from that kind of thing. In these large, modern cities of the world, the dwelling places are only places in which to shelter for the moment, instead of being places in which to live.  I do not know whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce is absolutely impervious to <Col N="2068" /> argument.  Had I the opportunity of dealing with the Minister for Finance, I think I could have got at his soft spot much more easily, since I had the privilege of knowing him many years ago, and of being in very close personal contact with him.  Now, on a previous occasion, I mentioned that our fisheries at the moment are valued at about £242,000.  That, perhaps, is not a very large sum in proportion to the sums we have been speaking about lately.  Still, it is something, although it is not by any means an adequate sum for fisheries, if conditions were normal.  I should like to quote here from an article by Dr. Went, who is, I think, the Chief Inspector of Fisheries. He says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In recent years a considerable number of local angling associations have been formed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he refers to the good work these have been doing in protecting brown troust fisheries, and so on, and he stresses, above all, the value of fostering a healthy state of public opinion with reference to the protection of our inland fisheries, particularly during the spawning season.  He says that the Department welcomes the formation of these angling associations, and then he goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The value of Ireland's trout fisheries from the point of view of our tourist traffic is very high, and I am inclined to agree with those persons who would place trout fishing before that of salmon as a means of attracting tourists to this country.</P>
    <P>Just before the war the anglers' association in Manchester had arranged for large numbers of coarse-fish anglers to visit this country... As an indication of what can be expected I need only cite the example of a small hotel in County Cavan, the proprietor of which was guaranteed 30 guests for the whole of the period from April to September.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He gives that as an indication of what can be expected from the development of our fisheries.  Now, I am sorry that the Senator I expected to be here is not here to continue a sort of opposition to this motion, because if he were <Col N="2069" /> here I think I would have something to say later on in reference to his possible attitude.  However, since he is not here, I shall pass on to the next point.  My amendment provides for the inclusion of two committees in the Bill. One of these committees we may call, to be brief, an amenity committee. There may be a better name for it, and I am quite prepared to admit quite frankly to the Minister that this is taken from a Scottish Bill dealing with the same matter, and accordingly I am not claiming any originality for these two amendments.  I admit that right away.  Under the Scottish Bill the Secretary of State for Scotland was given power to appoint those two committees, but since our Constitution here is rather different, naturally some changes were required.</P>
    <P>Perhaps since the three amendments standing in my name are more or less related, I might be permitted to deal with the amendment providing for an amenity committee.  With regard to that no change is suggested and no addition to the public expenditure is involved as under the National Monuments Act of 1930 there is a National Monuments Advisory Council already in existence.  Similarly as Senators know the Tourist Board is in existence. In a nutshell, the object of the first amendment requires that these two boards shall be consulted in the first instance.  When the Minister first introduced the Bill, I called his attention to the fact of which he appeared to be ignorant, that preliminary plans for the development of the Boyne had been lodged by the Electricity Supply Board with the Meath County Council more than 12 months ago.  Since I made that statement, I have been making further inquiries and I find that, as a matter of fact, the National Monuments Advisory Council was consulted by the Electricity Supply Board as to the possibility of interference with the various national monuments in the Boyne valley.  The Minister himself claimed that the Tourist Board is a sufficient protection and that they had all the powers necessary for the preservation of historic bits of scenery, etc., so there is nothing new being suggested here.  What I am afraid of <Col N="2070" /> is, supposing the present Minister, sympathetic as he appears to be from the provisions of the Bill, is promoted to a higher post and that the Senator who spoke so strongly here against the protection of monuments, and the preservation of fisheries in particular, takes his place as Minister for Industry and Commerce, could he not ride the high horse and say he has no obligation whatever in this respect?</P>
    <P>I simply want to make arrangements for the future by providing for consultation between the bodies concerned. Surely there is nothing unreasonable in that?  The Minister for Agriculture necessarily belongs to the same Government as the Minister for Industry and Commerce and it is impossible to conceive that they will get into a warlike attitude, one to the other, and fight in an unreasonable sort of way.  There is an opportunity for reasonable consultation between the two Ministers provided in these two amendments, and I feel that even the terms of the Bill make it certain that the Minister for Agriculture would not act in an unreasonable fashion.</P>
    <P>I want to be quite frank as regards the fishing side of the question.  I have been interested personally in fishing for a considerable number of years and a close relative, a brother in fact, is a member of a board of conservators.  I can speak, therefore, with a certain amount of authority regarding the unsatisfactory nature of the arrangements relative to the protection of fisheries which exist at present.  There are no doubt a number of inspectors of fisheries.  I find, analysing the public estimates on the subject, that there would appear to be six officials of one kind or another whose special function is to look after fisheries.  In addition to the six officials, there are various clerks, but that is not very much use when you consider that these six officials have to deal, not only with inland fisheries, but with sea fisheries as well.  Now you have Dr. Went in his excellent symposium read at the Royal Dublin Society on the occasion of the centenary of Dr. Kane, referring to the importance of the subject.  I should also like to refer to its importance from the tourist standpoint, the sports standpoint, and its importance <Col N="2071" /> generally from the financial standpoint.</P>
    <P>I shall give the House one example of which I have personal knowledge. One of the most valuable fisheries we have is at a place called &ldquo;The Mollies&rdquo;, near Navan.  I am not quite sure what the name is derived from.  It covers a very short distance, but it was formerly one of the most valuable fisheries in the whole country.  An attempt was made by some conservators to try to get diseased fish removed from that stretch.  These fish were suffering from that dreadful disease, furunculosis, to which fish are liable and there was no method by which the conservators could assert their rights and protect the fisheries by removing dead fish.  The result is that this year it is absolutely valueless as a fishery. In fact that has been the case for some years.  The hatchery has been out of action for some years.  Similar remarks apply to the Suir, a river of which I have also an intimate personal knowledge. What harm would it be to link up these various anglers' associations and conservators of fisheries and provide that an advisory committee would be established and that that advisory committee would have an organised method of putting their views before the Minister for Agriculture?  Then the inspectors of the Ministry of Agriculture will have an opportunity of discussing these matters with the members of the advisory council.  I am not even suggesting that the Minister be asked to provide any additional money, because I feel and know that the people associated with these boards would be spirited enough to pay for any expenses that may be incurred in connection with attendance of meetings of the advisory committee.  It is the one sport that remains where the purely material side of things does not count so much.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Bill in the Dáil the Minister made some statements which I went to the trouble of analysing. I wish to say that there appeared to be some slight mistakes made by the Minister as to matters of fact and I should like to avail myself of this opportunity of pointing them out.  To begin with, he points out that their source is the Scottish Hydro-Electric <Col N="2072" /> Bill.  He says that the amendments submitted in the other House were proposed without reference to the other provisions of the Bill then before that House.  That may have been true with reference to the amendments in the form in which they appeared in the Dáil, but I maintain it is not true as regards the amendments before this House.  He says that these provisions may have been necessary in Scotland but that they are not necessary here. It will be my job to convince the House that they are as necessary here as in Scotland.  The Minister says that an amenity committee is not required to enable persons to bring matters to the attention of either the Electricity Supply Board or the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Now let us consider what that means.  Does it mean that any individual can write to the Electricity Supply Board and call attention to this, that or the other?  Are matters of great importance to be left to the good will of a public-spirited citizen?</P>
    <P>I pointed out that the provisions of this Bill were such that in relation to the River Boyne, the burial places of the ancient kings of Ireland would have been submerged and that many raths of great cultural and historical interest would be damaged.  I am not talking about Newgrange.  I know every inch of that country because I have sailed through it in canoes; I swam and cycled there; but Newgrange is on a higher level.  What I am calling the attention of the House to is the fact that there are certain raths, and there are places like St. Erc's Hermitage, which would be submerged. Probably one of the most beautiful pieces of scenery, not excepting that of Killarney, would have been lost for ever.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister that this is part of the nation, and if we are to get rid of our national monuments in that way, we should not do it until the public have some organised means of giving a verdict on the subject.  The organised means I suggest is that the parties interested should be given an opportunity to make reasonable representations. I do not for a moment suggest these parties would try to hold up a scheme for ever.  There is no danger <Col N="2073" /> that they would adopt an unreasonable attitude.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the House could be in no doubt that he would be as interested as anyone else in the preservation of amenities, where that is possible by administrative action. Another Minister is concerned in this, the Minister for Local Government, and there are the local bodies.  Some organised way of doing this should be devised, and the people concerned should have an opportunity of expressing their opinions.  The Minister stated that reference to fisheries is completely irrelevant and that no account is taken of the provisions of Section 19 of the Bill.  I have already stated that the section is very satisfactory indeed.  In fact, I was more than pleased at the generous provisions made for compensation. I have taken the reference to Section 19 from the existing Dáil Reports and by now it may not be correct.  The Minister says that Section 19 obliges the board to comply with the requirements of the Minister for Agriculture in the avoidance of injury to fisheries, but emphasis was laid on &ldquo;during the construction and before&rdquo;.  Presumably he was referring to the design of the works.  I say if the construction effects a big disturbance of the natural contour of the river, it may not be noticed for several years, and it is in these after years that the greatest damage would possibly arise.</P>
    <P>The Minister further stated that the Scottish Bill contained no provision for the protection of fisheries.  I have a copy of the Scottish Bill here and it contains express provision for compensation for the acquisition of land.  Will any member of the House say that legislation adopted by the British Parliament has ever failed to provide for the acquisition of land without reasonable compensation?  I do not think that that can even be imagined.  The Minister may have been misled in the use of the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; but if he reads up the fishery laws he will find that land really includes the water passing over that land.  If a person owns the land on one side of a river, then the land up to the mid-point of that stream is his property.  If he <Col N="2074" /> happens to own land on both sides of the river, it is all his property.</P>
    <P>When, therefore, provision is made for the acquisition of land, that provision also includes compensation for fisheries.  To that extent the Minister was not right in saying that there was no provision for compensation for fisheries.  There are a number of other items which I should like to raise, but I shall confine myself to one or two of them.  The report of the fisheries section of the Department refers to the high prices obtained for salmon by persons engaged in pelagic fishing, and also to the pollution of rivers.  It is stated that some of the cases of pollution were such as to cause some concern.  I know that there is very great dissatisfaction generally with the present arrangements regarding the protection of our rivers.</P>
    <P>I see no reason at all why more attention could not be paid to the advice of people who have given very considerable thought to these matters because they are interested in them, and not always interested in them from a material viewpoint.  I do not see why they should not be given an opportunity of organising a means of expressing what they think should be done, and of getting into contact with the officials who are the advisers of the Minister for Agriculture.  There is nothing unusual in that.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that there even should be one penny of additional expenditure. In reading this amendment it will be found that certain of the words are taken from the Minister's own Bill regarding transport.  He wanted an advisory committee regarding transport and the House consented. The Vocational Act also provided for an advisory committee, and you have the Minister for Agriculture getting the advice of an advisory committee about post-war plans.  In every way, this, I suggest, is a reasonable amendment. I do not want to incur any expense&mdash;I merely wish to ask the Minister to take account of the future and to remember that a Minister may have a bias such as the bias expressed by one of our Senators earlier in this debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2075" /> At one time, I must say I greatly fancied myself because I knew all about the calculus and a wide variety of engineering formulae.  I had a feeling when I was going along the street that people should turn around and look at me because of the immense knowledge I possessed, but no one ever turned a hair, and in later years I became convinced that it was only one part of the knowledge which a human being should have.  Therefore, if a person is suffering for a while from what Dr. Freud called repression, he may, meanwhile, do very considerable harm, particularly if he is in a representative capacity.  It is for all members of this House to see that the contours of our rivers, such as the Boyne, will not be seriously upset without proper consideration.  I would appeal to the Minister to consider this in a sympathetic way.  The Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Arterial Drainage Bill made a remark that fishermen and those interested in fishing are not always to be believed.</P>
    <P>There is a fisherman's prayer, for example, to which is attached a sort of stigma.  It is somewhat jocular, and I do not know whether members of the House are familiar with it.  There is also a fisherman's curse, and I certainly would be very reluctant to incur the hostility of the vast number interested in this very genuine and innocent sport.  I appeal to the Minister that he should not do anything to interfere with it.  I wonder would it be possible for the Cathaoirleach to bring him down to Lismore, and if he caught a salmon and had the experience I had on one or two occasions I would have very little difficulty in convincing him that something ought to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments somewhat similar to these were moved in the Dáil, and I gave my reasons for opposing them.  Senator O'Reilly has repeated them and saved me some of the trouble of doing so.  In fact, I have no further arguments to advance against these amendments than those I <Col N="2076" /> advanced in the Dáil.  These amendments, as the Senator said, are based on the provisions in the Scottish Hydro-Electric Bill, but the other provisions of that Bill were so different from those in the Bill under discussion that I submit they are entirely irrelevant. In so far as the protection of fisheries is the concern of the House, I submit that the provisions of this Bill are not merely satisfactory but far more far-reaching than those contemplated in the proposed amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the setting up of a commission of fishermen to consult with the Minister for Agriculture would be half as effective as the proposal in Section 11.  The section I refer to is Section 11, and not 19.  It is there proposed to give the Minister for Agriculture, who is in charge of the protection of fisheries, direct power to require the Electricity Supply Board to take precautions and make provisions during the construction of a hydro-electric works so as to avoid damage to fisheries.  I was, in fact, twitted by a member of the Seanad for having given way to the Minister for Agriculture in that regard and for having agreed to insert in this Bill a clause which gave the Minister for Agriculture power to interfere with the construction of electricity generation works greater than he had been given in previous measures of the same kind. That is, in fact, true.  The proposals in this Bill are more far-reaching than similar provisions in the legislation which authorised the construction of the Shannon works and the legislation which authorised the construction of the Liffey works.  They give the Minister for Agriculture more power to direct and require the board to undertake works that will avoid damage to fisheries.  Furthermore, the Scottish Bill did not provide for compensation for damage to fisheries and certainly contained no clauses such as appear in this Bill providing for the acquisition of fisheries by the electricity authorities. I submit that the proposals in this Bill and the powers given to the Minister for Agriculture in relation to the actual construction of works and the provisions in relation to payment <Col N="2077" /> of compensation or the acquisition of fisheries are far more satisfactory and workable than the proposals contained in the amendment.</P>
    <P>In respect of ancient monuments and similar amenities.  I do not think it is desirable to set up the machinery which is suggested here.  There is a National Monuments Advisory Committee functioning under the auspices of the Board of Works.  If hydro-electric works are contemplated it is desirable that there should be some authority to identify national monuments and to suggest the precautions that may be taken for their protection. I should imagine that the main trouble that will be experienced will be in the identification of the monuments that are of such national interest that they should be preserved at the public expense.  We have this National Monuments Advisory Committee and they are, I am sure, competent to identify any national monuments of the class that the State should be concerned with their preservation.  The board have at all times consulted with the National Monuments Committee in their work, and they have given me an undertaking that they will afford that committee every facility to identify and, so far as may be possible, preserve the monuments or other items of historic interest on the site of any hydro-electric works.  Again, I think that is more satisfactory and workable than the elaborate proposals that have been suggested in these amendments. It is wrong to assume that the members of the board or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or other persons who will be concerned with the preparation or approval of schemes of this kind will not be interested in the preservation of amenities and historical monuments.  It is only fair to assume that they will, and that in so far as it is practical to do so, schemes will be prepared which will cause the least possible interference.  Apart altogether from the natural interest we all have in the preservation of monuments, there is the assurance that the board will consult with the National Monuments Advisory Committee and give every possible facility to identify monuments and items of general <Col N="2078" /> interest.  I fear that Senator O'Reilly is unduly concerned in this matter because he fears works are contemplated on the Boyne.</P>

      <P>The only hydro-electric scheme that is in contemplation is that of the Erne, and that involves the submerging of only 750 acres.  There is in fact a very small acreage of land to be submerged compared with the Liffey scheme which involved the submergence of 5,000 acres, although the total generation capacity was much smaller than the estimated generation capacity of the Erne works.  The board stated in their report that the examination they made of the Boyne and the tentative development plans which were prepared did not appear to justify further consideration at the present stage.  If at any time it should appear desirable to the board that the Boyne should be developed for power purposes, then special consideration would be given to the particular plans prepared because of the historical monuments and places of historical interest in their locality. The same applies to other rivers but not to the same extent.  In all proposals for hydro-electric works the National Monuments Advisory Committee will be consulted and given every facility to preserve these monuments and places from damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit, however, that the very practical procedure contemplated in the Bill is preferable to that adopted in the Scottish Hydro-electrical Bill and proposed in these amendments.  For the protection of fisheries there are special powers given to the Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister for Agriculture has technical officers to advise him.  No doubt these technical advisers can contact local representative bodies and secure any detailed information which they require.  We are proposing in this Bill that the Minister for Agriculture should have far more definite powers than are suggested in the amendments.  I know that Senator O'Reilly in the course of his speech on the amendment indicated a more general interest in fisheries <Col N="2079" /> than would be relevant to the provisions of this Bill.  If he wishes to improve the general arrangements for the protection of fisheries, and I have no doubt there is a great deal of force in what he says in that regard, he must take the matter up with the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture is responsible for the administration of the legislation for the protection of fisheries.  In so far as the Electricity Supply Board will acquire fishing rights or have acquired them under the Shannon Acts they are of course subject to the fishery law just as any other fishery proprietor.  It would not be practicable to effect an improvement or amendment of the general law relating to the protection of fisheries through the provisions in this Bill nor would the committee which is proposed in this amendment have any functions unless a hydro-electric works were proposed for a particular river.  If the Senator desires to have brought to the attention of the Minister for Agriculture suggestions for the improvement generally of the fishery law or to urge upon him the need for the strengthening of that law, I suggest he should do so by motion or upon some occasion upon which the Minister for Agriculture will have legislative proposals relating to fisheries before the Seanad.</P>

Supposing an advisory council for fisheries were established, it could be asked to extend its functions to every branch of fisheries.  There is a very small attendance in the House and the Minister might change his mind.  I hope he will, but I can assure him that if he has the same fixed idea and does <Col N="2080" /> not accept these amendments I will not press them very strongly on the Report Stage.  I think the House is far too small to judge a question of such importance and would ask permission to withdraw the amendment.

      <P>In sub-section (3), page 11, line 54, to delete the words &ldquo;or for any other reason&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section relates to the compensation which will be payable to certain people in the event of interference with their employment or income by the action of the Electricity Supply Board. As I understand it, the position is that, where it can be shown to the arbitrator that a person who was engaged in fishing, or who was employed by somebody engaged in fishing, is entitled to be paid compensation, that compensation is to be awarded by the arbitrator. Sub-section (2) is concerned with the manner in which the compensation is to be calculated.  In sub-section (3), there is some difficulty regarding the words which I seek in my amendment to delete.  That sub-section states that a person shall not be entitled to compensation where it is shown to the satisfaction of the arbitrator that, by reason of an undertaking by the board to continue the employment of such persons or for any other reason, such person would suffer no loss or diminution of earnings or employment. I draw attention to the insertion of the words &ldquo;or for any other reason&rdquo;. The way I read that is that the person shall not be entitled to compensation where it is shown to the satisfaction of the arbitrator that, by reason of an undertaking by the board to continue him in employment, or for any other reason, he will not suffer a diminution of earnings or employment.  It may be that the Minister has in mind something in relation to those words which is not clear to me.  I cannot understand the general inference to be drawn from the words &ldquo;or for any other reason&rdquo; in relation to the undertaking by the board.  I do not propose to argue that the matter is not satisfactory. <Col N="2083" /> I did not put down the amendment for the purpose of challenging what the Minister is doing but for the purpose of enabling the Minister to show to the House that there is adequate protection for a person whose livelihood may be interfered with by the action of the board.  I do not want the Minister to think that I am endeavouring to put any difficulty in the way of the board's carrying out its duties under this Bill.  I am anxious that there should be no impediments in its way but I recall that, in the case of former legislation relating to fisheries, some difficulties did arise in respect of certain people not in this particular area but in other parts of the country &mdash; persons whose livelihood was interfered with.  My information is that there was substantial cause of complaint in that case. If the Minister satisfies the House that the provisions of the Bill are adequate to ensure that there will be proper compensation if there is diminution of earnings, I shall be satisfied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Senator will agree that it is reasonable to provide that a person will not be entitled to compensation where the arbitrator is satisfied that, for any reason, the person will suffer no loss or diminution of earnings or employment. It is only where there has been loss of earnings or employment that compensation will be payable at all. This section relates to the compensation of fishery employees.  Other sections provide for compensation of fishery owners.  Unless these words are inserted, it is feared that a person who is both the owner and manager of a fishery may secure double compensation. As owner, he would be compensated for loss of profit, including loss of his own income, but he might have a subsequent claim under this section as an employee of the fishery.  The matter is left entirely to the discretion of the arbitrator.  If the arbitrator is satisfied that a person has suffered loss, he can award compensation. If he is satisfied that a person has suffered no loss, he is entitled to refuse compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

The sub-section could have been worded: &ldquo;Where it is shown to the satisfaction of the arbitrator that, for any reason, a person would suffer no loss or diminution of profit in consequence of interference with the fishery by the board...&rdquo; The words &ldquo;by reason of an undertaking by the board to continue the employment of such person or for any other reason&rdquo; are put in because it is the most likely circumstance that will arise.  That is designed to put on the board a certain amount of pressure to deal with those employees, where possible, by reemploying them in its own fishery interests rather than by paying them compensation.  The intention definitely is that a person who suffers loss of earnings or loss of employment by reason of interference with the fisheries will be compensated.  That is clear&mdash; that the section merely operates to exclude from compensation those who have, in fact, suffered no loss.</P>

It is necessary to have some wording here to prevent his subsequently claiming for compensation for loss as an employee.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 18, to delete sub-section (2).</P>
      <P>In proposing to delete sub-section (2) I will admit right away that there is likely to be a conflict of view between the Minister and myself in regard to the object of the amendment. The section relates to the manufacture of electrical apparatus by the board, and sub-section (1) of the section appears to me to be a complete statement in itself.  It provides that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;where the Minister is of opinion that the existing or future requirements <Col N="2086" /> in the State in respect of any particular class of apparatus, machinery, or equipment, for the generation, and so on, of electricity, are not being used and are not likely to be met sufficiently and efficiently by businesses then lawfully established in the State, the Minister, if he thinks fit, may authorise the board to manufacture or arrange for the manufacture of that particular class of apparatus, machinery or equipment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be a very complete statement.  It leaves it to the Minister to decide whether, in order to supply the needs of the people, the board should be authorised to meet whatever deficiency there may be, but in sub-section (2) he limits his authority considerably.  I should say, before I refer to that limitation, that in the first instance, sub-section (1) is merely permissive, it imposes no obligation on the Minister to authorise the board to do anything.  It merely authorises him, if he thinks fit, to empower the board to do certain things; but in sub-section (2) he is inserting a provision that, before giving an authorisation, he must publish a notice so that anyone who wants to object may be enabled to come along and make objections.  I do not say that the Minister will not deal with such objections.  He can ignore them, but he must take notice of them.  I cannot understand why there is this limitation in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In subsequent sub-sections of this section he is authorised to proceed on certain lines, after having heard the objections that may eventuate from the notice referred to in sub-section (2).  I want the Minister to take the view that if he is satisfied that the requirements of the community are not being met or are not likely to be met in an efficient or satisfactory manner in the matter of the provision of apparatus or equipment, he should be free, without having recourse to all the roundabout machinery here, to issue an authorisation to the board to make good that deficiency.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the provision <Col N="2087" /> contained in the sub-section here is an assurance to private interests, not with regard to what they are doing, but to what they may do in the future, and I do not think it would be in the public interest that the Minister should be restrained in this manner. I could understand members of this House putting down sub-section (2) of this section as an amendment to the section, if it were not here already, but I cannot understand the Minister himself putting forward a sub-section of this character, and I would strongly urge that he should do something such as I have suggested in my amendment, because, if this were inserted, it would make a very big difference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, it is rather extraordinary that the Senator should propose that the Minister should extend his powers in this matter.  He is quite correct in saying that without sub-section (2) we would have had an amendment by some Senators anxious to limit the growth of Ministerial control.  May I say that the intention here is that the Electricity Supply Board should not undertake any process of manufacture where private firms already established are satisfactorily producing the goods concerned, or where private enterprise is likely to produce these goods, under competitive conditions, <Col N="2088" /> in quantities and qualities which would be regarded as satisfactory?  I think it is undesirable, on the whole, that the Electricity Supply Board should have to go into the manufacturing business, except in circumstances where the board itself is likely to be the sole purchaser of equipment of a particular kind.</P>
      <P>I mentioned here, in the course of the Second Reading discussion, that I would regard it as more desirable in the case of consumers' apparatus, that is equipment required in the ordinary household, farmstead, or industry, that it should be produced by private enterprise and, if possible, under competitive conditions.  The development of electrical apparatus and equipment has proceeded very rapidly in recent years.  Nobody could possibly suggest that it has reached perfection.  On the contrary, most electrical equipments or apparatus on sale at the moment are still a long way short of being reasonably efficient, and one may expect very substantial improvement in their efficiency in the years to come.  I think we are more likely to get the benefit of new designs and new technique if we have the production of such equipment by private enterprise rather than by a State monopoly undertaking such as the Electricity Supply Board.  Sub-section (2), therefore, is deliberately inserted on grounds of policy.  While it is giving powers to the Electricity Supply Board to manufacture certain forms of equipment, if there is no other way of getting it, nevertheless, the Minister's power is subject to the restriction that he must make this inquiry as to the intentions of private enterprise because, if private enterprise is willing and able to do the job, it is the policy of the Government to encourage it to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the view that, in the Minister's Department in particular, there seems to be a case for authority to get things done.  That is dealing with the economic matters. Other Departments of State might be criticised on other than the administrative grounds.  I have the feeling <Col N="2089" /> that where a Government Department is dealing with things of the mind, with political activities, there is a danger in permitting them bureaucratic power.  I have put the view that where a Department's functions are connected with the economic activities of the nation, they must have power and I have argued along these lines on the Minister's behalf in this House very recently on the Minerals Bill.</P>
      <P>I think my view has generally been consistent in that respect.  I do say that the remedy, if there is a tendency for the Minister's Department to spring too far ahead&mdash;of course there is not the slightest danger of that&mdash;is a report to both Houses.  I think the Minister will recollect that I argued to some extent to that effect on the Transport Bill and therefore my activities are of a piece.  I am not taking one attitude in regard to one thing and another in regard to something else, simply for the purpose of being at loggerheads with the Minister.</P>

    <P>I have the feeling that there is a case for part of the proposition advanced by the Minister, that is to say, if there were private firms manufacturing, on a competitive basis, equipment and machinery and the other things that may be required by the Electricity Supply Board, there should be no interference either, but this goes further.  This section deals with the possibility of creating these institutions, private institutions&mdash;in other words, profit-making institutions &mdash;and as we shall see from later sub-sections, creating these profit-making institutions, with the assistance of grants or loans from the board.  I do not think that is good policy.  I think it would be a better line for us to take to say to the Minister that while he is not himself directly responsible for producing machinery and the equipment needed by the board, he should have no hesitation in authorising the board to go into the field themselves as competitors.  That will not rule out anybody else coming in with new designs, new plans and more efficient machinery if they can.  I think the <Col N="2090" /> Minister should not hedge his activities around in the manner suggested in this section.</P>

      <P>I do not like the section at all.  I suppose it is necessary to have this section to give the board power to manufacture, but it is inconceivable, if they go about their business in the right way, that the country need ever be short of electrical apparatus.  It is only because there is this very undesirable element of protection behind the whole mentality of the Government that this section is necessary at all.  Why, electrical apparatus will be manufactured all over the world.  If we are allowed access to the markets of the world, we shall have an infinite range and variety of apparatus.</P>
      <P>Surely it should be the desire of the Government and the Electricity Supply Board to give the public the widest choice of electrical equipment and machinery at the cheapest possible price?  How can that ever be done if the Minister or Senator Duffy have in mind the closed shop, which is certainly intended by this section?  It may be that I am trying to flog a dead horse, but I shall not cease to plead that the unorganised consumer has not got an adequate voice in securing the best amenities of life.  I shall resist at every possible opportunity this tendency to shelter manufacturers, to limit variety and price and to give us home-manufactured articles irrespective of whether they can stand competition. I dislike the section and I shall resist any effort to limit the full play of private enterprise in these matters.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 19, sub-section (4), lines 16 and 17, to delete the words &ldquo;either alone or in conjunction with other persons&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2091" /> It deals with the authority which the Minister may give to the board to permit them to form a limited company either alone or in conjunction with other persons.  I suggest that the words &ldquo;other persons&rdquo; be left out.  If it is to be a company promoted by the board, let it be a company of the board and not one of private enterprise. The case made earlier by the Minister was that he wanted to get private enterprise to do this job, if they could do it on a competitive basis.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane is very anxious that private enterprise would display its talents, wisdom and resourcefulness in regard to this problem of providing machinery and equipment.  If they are going to do that, let them do it, but I do not think the board should associate itself with the formation of a company which, although promoted by the board, will to all intents and purposes be outside its control.  I think the Minister will see that there are going to be difficulties in the promotion of such a company.  The board merely comes in as a kind of step-brother, taking the risks, if they are risks, and, I am very much afraid, not getting much of the gains, if they are gains.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Other Departments do that frequently.  You have the Condensed Milk Company and a number of other concerns promoted by the Minister for Agriculture in which the officials of the Department are constituted a company for the purposes of the Companies Acts.  The same applies to a number of other companies.  This means something different.  My argument is based on the assumption that the Minister will give an authorisation to the board to promote a company <Col N="2092" /> for the purpose of manufacturing machinery and apparatus.  The statute will authorise the board in promoting that company to do something either alone by incorporating a number of their own officials or members of the board as a company, or in conjunction with other persons.  These persons may be nationals or may be aliens.  I hope I am not annoying Senator Sir John Keane by drawing these distinctions, because there are no such things in the capitalistic world as aliens.  We know here in Ireland that there have been suggestions that there are aliens, and I have no doubt that if Senator Summerfield were here we would have heard something from him on this matter.  I have suffered the rest of the section to stand so far, with all the restrictions imposed by the Minister on his own activities, but I think, at this stage, having got to the point when the company is promoted, it ought to be a national company&mdash;otherwise, leave it to private enterprise.</P>

      <P>I may say that I agree with the Senator as to what ought to be, but here we must deal with the practical realities that may arise.  A great range of electrical apparatus is covered by patents.  The board may decide, in the discharge of its functions, that a particular type of transformer or a type of switch gear manufactured in Britain, Sweden or Switzerland is best suited to conditions in this country.  To get that apparatus manufactured here may not be possible except in conjunction with the owners of the patent rights.  The manufacture of electrical equipment is a different proposition from, for instance, the manufacture of boots or other commodities of general application, because of these patent rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am certain that these rights will continue to exist as various improvements are made from time to time.  If we have to manufacture in this country, by the board or under the auspices of the board, electrical apparatus of that kind, we must be prepared to consider, in certain cases at least, to associate with the board <Col N="2093" /> other people who have the patent interests and, in fact, it may be necessary and desirable because these people will bring to the process what the board could not itself supply, namely, the technical experience and competence in the work.  I think, therefore, that it is desirable that we should retain in this section this power to enable the board to promote companies in conjunction with other people.  If we are to delete that power, we might make it impracticable for the board to undertake the work connected with the projects we have in mind.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 24, sub-section (1), line 5, after the word &ldquo;rate&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;not exceeding three per cent. per annum&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2095" /> This is the section which makes provision for the repayment by the board of the advances which were made to it by the Department of Finance from the Central Fund.  The provision is that every sum advanced out of the Central Fund shall be repaid by the board at such times and in such manner and with such interest as shall be prescribed. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the Minister shall not prescribe a rate of interest higher than 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not, want at this stage to go over the ground that was covered on the Second Stage of the Bill, but I do submit that there is available for the Minister for Finance very large sums of money which are costing him less than 3 per cent., moneys, for instance, in the Post Office Savings Bank.  I think that money is to a considerable extent invested outside this country. I remember seeing a return some years ago of the moneys held by the Government or by different Departments of State in foreign securities, and the Post Office Savings Bank figured prominently in that list.  It may be argued, of course, that there is a theory of finance that you cannot borrow short and lend long.  I have heard that so often&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that it has penetrated into my mind, but I have heard so many doctrines and canons of finance enunciated in the past 25 years and all blown sky high by the practical facts of life that I am no longer impressed by these doctrines.  I believe that the previous Government utilised the Post Office Savings Bank receipts for financing the Shannon scheme. The Minister shakes his head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That was stated in the Report of the Vocational Commission, but it is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was asserted in very <Col N="2096" /> many quarters that that was so.  In fact, there was a rumour floating around Dublin some years ago that certain important officials found their souls and consciences so scared by that practice that they resigned their positions.  I do not know if that is true.  I did not participate in the investigations of the Vocational Commission. I do suggest that if money is obtained by the Post Office on deposit at 2½ per cent. there is no reason why that money should cost the Electricity Supply Board more than 3 per cent. I make this further suggestion&mdash;that, if the Post Office Savings Bank were permitted or induced to go out on a campaign to increase its deposits, that could be achieved.  If the Minister refers to the report of a commission&mdash; I do not suppose it is more sacrosanct than the report of any other commission&mdash;which investigated the affairs of the Post Office in 1922 or 1923, he will find that this was one of the questions adverted to.  I was a member of that commission and it considered this question of inducing the public to use the Post Office Savings Bank on a large scale.  It was subsequently pointed out to me that bankers did not like the idea of the State going into the market to induce depositors to put their savings in the Post Office.  It was represented that there was some virtue in placing money in a commercial bank and that, therefore, it would be bad for commercial banking if the Post Office were a serious competitor with it, as it would be if it set out in a commercial way to induce the public to put money in its savings bank.  If that were done, the amount of deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank could be doubled in a short time and it would provide the Minister for Finance with a large sum of money for State investment at a cost of 2½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is on the assumption that that can be done that I am endeavouring in this Bill to fix the maximum rate of interest which the Minister may charge to the board at 3 per cent.  I feel quite sure that, as the Minister responsible for the success of this undertaking, the Minister for Industry and Commerce would not be averse from that suggestion.  I do not know <Col N="2097" /> what his powers in this matter are. He is a member of the Government and I suppose his voice in the Government is as loud as that of any other Minister and his influence as great.  I know that the Government acts collectively and that the Minister for Finance is, in the long run, the arbiter in these matters, but, if the Minister for Industry and Commerce believes in this proposal as practical, I am sure he will be able to induce sufficient of his colleagues to overwhelm the Minister for Finance and induce him to accede to these proposals.  I know that the Minister may say that this is not his function, that he will do his best, but that the Minister for Finance must have the last word.  Up to a point, that is true, but I submit that the Government is a unity and that there is collective responsibility.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and all the other Ministers are just as much responsible as the Minister for Finance for seeing that the economic activities of the State are not throttled by the policy at present being pursued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator appreciates that the proposition he has put down is somewhat different from that which his speech would convey.  He is proposing that, no matter what rate of interest the Minister for Finance has to pay on the money he borrows, he must not charge the Electricity Supply Board more than 3 per cent.  That would be an entirely wrong provision to insert in the Bill.  If that provision were inserted in the Bill and the Minister for Finance found that he could not borrow money at 3 per cent., he would not only, in my opinion, be entitled to refuse to make advances to the board but it would be his duty to refuse.  As custodian of the national finances, he would, I think, act wrongly if he were to subsidise the board without the consent or the cognisance of the Dáil.  Therefore, if the Minister for Finance found himself in a position in which he could not make advances to the board at 3 per cent. without losing on the transaction, it would be his duty, in my opinion, to go to the Dáil and inform it that this situation <Col N="2098" /> had arisen and that he was refusing to make any advances until the Dáil would vote money which would recoup him the difference between the rate of interest he had to pay and the rate of interest which he would receive from the board.</P>
      <P>Whatever may be said about the possibility of reducing the rate of interest which the Minister has to pay upon Government borrowings, I do not think that this amendment should go into the Bill.  I agree that the Government should not make a profit upon the business of financing the capital requirements of the board.  I agree that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would have the obligation of protesting to the Minister for Finance if he considered that the rate being charged upon advances was more than sufficient to recover the cost to the Exchequer of borrowing the money.  But it would be wrong to fix an arbitrary limit in this way to the rate of interest without any advertence to the rate which the Government may have to pay for money which it obtains on loan.  If done in this manner, it might arrest the whole of the development contemplated by the Bill.  I take it that the Senator has not in mind the idea of subsidising the capital requirements of the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Duffy and I will never see eye to eye on this question.  Suppose I said to the Senator that the price of milk should be 2d. a pint, under all circumstances, what would he say?  He says that the price of money should be a certain figure.  You can get the price of milk fixed at a certain figure provided the State is prepared to give a subsidy. If you want to stabilise in advance the price of any commodity, you must be prepared to subsidise that commodity. For some extraordinary reason, money is supposed to stand in a different category from all other commodities. I know that it is different in the sense that it is a general measure of purchasing power but it is a commodity just the same, though it is a commodity with a variety of uses.  For that reason you have short-term money which carries a very low rate of interest and long-term money which carries the rate at which the public is prepared to lend.  That is why you have applied to this electricity finance the rates at which the Government can borrow from the public.  These are the only possible rates except you give a subsidy.</P>
      <P>You cannot possibly utilise the moneys of the Post Office Savings Bank in borrowing for a long-term proposition.  It would be utterly useless to do so.  We cannot, with safety, use a certain proportion of the Post Office savings money on the assumption that you will never have it drawn out.  Post Office savings may be withdrawn at any moment, and long-term borrowing would have to be on a very different basis.  I do not think the Senator would be able to give us very many instances to show that that could be wrong, unless the arithmetic table is found to be wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2100" /> I should like to join issue with the Minister that the Government should make no profit out of the financing of the Electricity Supply Board.  I go so far as to say that a profit is being made now, and I think it is generally common knowledge that the rate charged is 5 per cent.  Surely that presupposes a profit.  That could only be a non-profit rate if all the Electricity Supply Board finances came from borrowing at 5 per cent.  The Minister, surely, does not suggest that all the Electricity Supply Board finance has its origin in 5 per cent. borrowings. When I interposed on the Second Reading debate, the official record says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sir John Keane: At this stage, would the Minister deal with the point as to the extent to which the original 5 per cent.  advances have been redeemed by the Exchequer? Surely portion of the earlier loans has since been redeemed?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Well, they have been redeemed at an average of 3¼ or 3½ per cent.; and, on the face of it, if the Electricity Supply Board is to be financed at the actual rate of borrowing, the rate of borrowing should be less than 5 per cent. Perhaps the Minister did not understand me, because he went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Certainly, and that is a point which I think the Senator should have taken into account before he suggested that the board should be charged the average rate of interest which the State is paying upon all the loans floated from time to time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the very thing I had in mind. The only fair way, in my opinion, to arrive at a fair rate is to take the average effective rate because you cannot attach the Electricity Supply Board's borrowings which are distributed over a certain period.  It does not follow that because you pass an Act to-day and give power to the Electricity Supply Board to borrow, that the borrowings take place to-day. It may be in two or three years' time when the rate may be lower, and so I submit that the fair way is to charge the effective rate on funded borrowings <Col N="2101" /> with, if you like, a small charge for administration.  That is the only way in which you will arrive at the position in which the Exchequer is not making a profit out of electricity finance.  Of course, the fact is that the State is certainly making a profit, because the Electricity Supply Board can go out to-morrow and finance for 3¼ per cent., or even less, and that would be substantially less than what the Electricity Supply Board is paying to the Exchequer to-day.  For that reason I feel that there is an element of taxation in the rate the consumers are paying for their electricity.  Will the Minister deal with this point about the 5 per cent.?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say that a large part of the capital of the Electricity Supply Board was advanced when the State was paying 5½ per cent.  The board did not commence repayment of these advances until many years later, and in later years capital has been provided by utilising its own funds, and it therefore gets the benefit of the different rate, but it is not correct to say that the current rate of advances to the board is 5 per cent.  What the rate of money advanced to the board now will be, I cannot say.  That will depend on future circumstances, but it would be difficult to decide what the average rate charged to the board should be to enable the Minister for Finance to recover in full the amount which the money cost him in interest charges. There are these factors to which I have referred to be taken into consideration, such as the high rate of interest paid by the Government at the time the advances were made, the delay in the repayment of these advances by the board, the difference in the times during which the State must repay the money and the board repays it to the State, and the method of utilising the funds by which the board gets the benefit of the higher rate, when operative. All these factors make the thing difficult.  It may be that the State may have made a slight profit on these advances, but it may lose it again and the rate in the future will have to be <Col N="2102" /> different and certainly will not be 5 per cent., so long as the Government can borrow money at prevailing market rates.</P>
