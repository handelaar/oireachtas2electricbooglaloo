      <P>If the House is agreed, I will call on the leaders of the political groupings to express a vote of sympathy on the death of Rajiv Gandhi.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my outrage and the outrage of the House at the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi.  His untimely death has clearly robbed the political world of a statesman of great resilience.  We knew him as a man of peace, whether in Opposition or in Government.  In a country that has been badly divided by strife he was a unifying force.  That was particularly obvious after the death of his mother, Mrs. Indira Gandhi.  I hope his death will not stop the elections but will fortify the people <Col N="2" /> of India and their leaders and provide them with a democratic workable government. If this can be achieved his death will not have been in vain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>For all of us in this House, where the democratic parliamentary process is central to our lives, the death in this way of any parliamentarian is an attack on all of us and on the values which sustain House of Parliament across the world.  In this case the death of Mr. Gandhi is not just a great personal tragedy for his family and for his party but it is an attack on the whole democratic process in his country. In offering our sympathy to his family, to his party and to the people of India, we can only hope that the democratic process is sufficiently strongly rooted in that country that it can sustain this foul attack.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is another occasion when we have to bow to the people of violence who have once again assaulted democracy and the democratic structure, when we see the largest democracy in the world being assaulted by the people of violence.</P>
      <P>Many people might disagree with the views of Mr. Gandhi, but it has to be said he sought to establish a state with equality for all people irrespective of caste or station. His passing is a loss to the democratic world.</P>
      <P>I am not one to support the idea of a dynasty, but it must be noted that of his immediate family he is yet another victim with his brother and his mother before him, who has fallen victim to the assassin's bullet or, in this case, bomb. There is now a long list of martyrs to democracy which the men of violence have created during this century.</P>
      <P>As a democratic forum we wish to express our sympathy to the Ambassador and to the Indian people, to Mr. Gandhi's party and to democrats everywhere.</P>

      <P>I would like on behalf of the Labour Party to extend my sympathy to the Gandhi family and, indeed, to the people of India on this terrible outrage which took place yesterday.  It is absolutely dreadful that people should resort to violence to advance their cause.  The Gandhi family, as has been mentioned, have already paid a terrible price because of their involvement in Indian politics. Three of them have been shot down and murdered.  I hope this dreadful event will not bring further instability and bloodshed to India.  Mr. Gandhi helped to unite and stabilise India after the assassination of his mother and it is awful that he should have gone the same way as his mother before him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party, the Progressive Democrats, I would like to join with the other leaders in their tributes to Mr. Gandhi.  We are all united in abhorrence at what has happened.  We can only hope that the resilience of democratic politics which India has shown in <Col N="4" /> the face of a succession of similar incidents since the time of Mahatma Gandhi will once more be evident and that the country will survive and go forward as the largest democratic nation in the world, with 514 million people going to the polls at over 600,000 polling stations. I hope the present instability will soon be removed.</P>
      <P>I join in the tributes to Mr. Gandhi in relation to his manifest sense of moderation and of trying to unify his people. We send our sympathy from this House to his family, to the Congress Party and to the people and Government of India.</P>

      <P>Will this House have an opportunity to debate the terms of reference of the public inquiry into the beef industry?  What is the present status of The Altamont (Amendment of Deed of Trust) Bill, 1990?  I am concerned at the very light amount of work which appears to have been ordered for today; it looks as if it will be a very short sitting, which is not good for the House.  I ask the Leader of the House and the Whip to see that this sort of thing does not happen again.</P>

      <P>I would like to join with Senator Manning in asking the Leader of the House if it will be possible to debate the Goodman affair and, in particular, the terms of reference which are to be discussed in the other House on Friday. I would also like to ask him to consider making time available for a debate on the employment situation, given the report of the ESRI which has been produced indicating that things are very turgid at present.  May I also ask what is the situation in relation to the numerous requests for a debate on agriculture?  Is the debate going to be held, and is it likely to be held in the near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he would give further clarification with regard to item No. 6.  He will recall that I asked him sometime ago and he said he would come back to the House on this matter.  It is about a resolution concerning the continuation in operation of certain sections of the Criminal Justice Act.  I wonder if those sections could be circulated to Members in advance of any such resolution being passed, particularly since a <Col N="6" /> number of us would have strong reservations about the continuation in operation of these sections.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House another two questions, if I may, the first being about the situation with regard to the control of pit bull terriers. This is extremely serious and there has been considerable pressure on the Minister for the Environment on this matter.  He has eventually yielded and indicated he will use the regulations attaching to the Control of Dogs Act. However, there is, I believe, a very strong feeling that regulations alone will not be sufficient, that muzzling or keeping dogs on leashes is not going to resolve the problem.  As he himself has given some indication that the introduction of legislation will be necessary, I would like to remind the House that in England what is being contemplated is the restriction of importation and the destruction of these dogs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>You have indeed.  I believe the point has been made, so I will pass on to the third and final item.  With regard to a very worrying situation that was adverted to in the other Chamber last night, I would like to ask what proposals the Government have to introduce a legislative remedy for the extraordinary situation in which apparently somebody who has applied for a barring order against a husband can be certified mentally ill and incarcerated.  This is a matter of very considerable concern to anybody who has respect for the democratic process in this country and I believe there must be an examination.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that some Senators have asked the Leader of the House if there likely to be a debate on what they have described as the Goodman affair, I would like to say I regret that there is such inquiry.  I think all we are doing is destroying ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I support my colleague, Senator O'Toole, in regretting the absence of the man who normally fills the seat I am sitting in?  I was not sure whether I should leave it symbolically empty or simply attempt to fill it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have made my point sufficiently.  May I ask the Leader, in the light of what Senator Norris said if he could find out from the Government when they propose to bring into force the 1981 Mental Treatment Act, which contains within it provisions which would make the event Senator Norris referred to very difficult?  It is ten years since that Bill was passed and it has never been given the force of law.  It is quite an extraordinary situation to have a major piece of legislation ten years after it was passed by both Houses and signed by the President still not having the force of law. Perhaps the Leader would inquire on our behalf.</P>
      <P>Can the Leader of the House tell me what is happening to the Child Care Bill, item No. 5 on the Order Paper?  As Senator Manning said, we have, to say the least of it, a somewhat thin Order Paper.  I am astonished that item No. 5, which has been waiting &mdash; apparently with considerable impatience on the Government's part &mdash; to be dealt with, could not have been taken today.  Perhaps the enthusiasm for Irish-American educational exchanges is greater than I imagine, but I would have thought we would have considerable time to deal with item No. 5 today.  The Child Care Bill has been awaiting attention as well as item No. 6.  I would be grateful for the Leader's guidance as to when he proposes to take that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Leader of the House to convey to the Minister for Justice our concern that in a week when we discussed the difficulties in the prison service a 17-year-old was incarcerated for <Col N="8" /> not paying her fare on the DART while, at the same time, it was announced that one of our citizens obtained a concession of £4 million on his tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if we could have a debate on a very small but most unfortunate group of people.  I refer to the haemophiliacs who are HIV positive through no fault of their own and who are not getting much help from the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I wish to ask the Leader of the House for a debate on agriculture and on health in the near future.  These are two areas that should be addressed and I respectfully ask him to arrange for the debates at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the questions raised by Senator Manning and Senator Upton regarding the inquiry into the beef industry, as Members know a motion for the setting up of the judicial inquiry into the beef industry is being discussed in the Dáil on Friday.  It is the intention that Seanad Éireann would discuss the same motion, on Tuesday of next week.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning also referred to the Altamont Bill.  I must confess, it is something I, too, would like to advance and I will certainly talk to people about it.  I agree it has been on the Order Paper for too long and something should happen one way or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole's point was not relevant to the Order of Business.  Senator Upton requested a debate on employment. I have no such proposal.  He also asked, as did Senator Hourigan, for a <Col N="9" /> debate on agriculture.  Again, I have no proposals at this time.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris referred to item No. 6 on today's Order Paper.  The position in regard to that item is as follows: section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, provides that each of the sections of the Act referred to in item No. 6 shall cease to be in operation at the expiry of four years from the commencement of the section unless a resolution has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas resolving that that section should continue in operation. As the Senators may know, there is a similar item on the Dáil Order Paper. The sections in question commenced by order of the Minister for Justice on 30 June 1987 and item No. 6 should, therefore, be passed before 30 June of this year.  It may be passed with or without debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>How could it be passed without debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would assume that that is not what the Senators would wish and obviously there will be some form of debate.  It is something for discussion with the Whips.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris and others asked about the ongoing problem of the barring orders we read about.  I will make inquiries about that matter.  I have no information that anything positive is being done; maybe it is.  I will make inquiries and advise the Members.</P>
      <P>On the other matter raised by the Senator, I have no information except what I read in the papers, that the Minister, Deputy Flynn, is about to take action in regard to the control of pit bull terriers and other vicious dogs.  A small number of breeds are clearly not suitable for this country and I hope the Minister will take action.</P>
      <P>Senator Brendan Ryan asked about the Child Care Bill.  Obviously, that is something we will have to deal with fairly soon and I can tell him that it will be taken as quickly as possible in this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Neville raised a matter which is not appropriate to the Order of Business. I note what Senator Hanafin said in <Col N="10" /> regard to the Goodman affair.  Senator Raftery asked about haemophiliacs; I have no proposal for a debate at this point on that matter.  I noted also what Senator Lydon said.  In regard to Senator Hourigan's request for a debate on health, I have no such proposal in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>With the other Senators, I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  The commitment to extend this excellent programme goes back to 1984, as other speakers have said, when President Reagan came to this country.  Looking back for a moment to the post-war period of 1948, up to £6 million sterling came to this country to help us to rebuild and to improve our infrastructure.  Out of that, £500,000 was taken to invest in scholarship exchange so that academics and post-graduates could travel to the United States and similarly qualified people could come to Ireland to study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no harm to refer to the close cooperation between Ireland and the United States, which goes back to post-Famine times.  Looking at it from the <Col N="11" /> American viewpoint, the interest in culture, language and literature by American visitors to this country is enormous, apart from the interest of students, post-graduates and highly qualified academics coming to this country to study.  From our viewpoint, as one of the EC countries looking towards the United States, one need only note the number of multinationals in this country and the close links between ourselves and industry in the States to realise the benefit for post-graduate academics studying in the United States.  They are studying highly competitive industries using state-of-the-art technology, etc.  It is a time of great scope for those of our students who will be able to avail of this scholarship to travel.</P>
    <P>It is sad in one sense because for many of our students it is not just a question of travelling on exchange scholarships; it is a question of sending out our talented and our best and sometimes they may not come back to us.  That is the major problem in relation to exchange.  Once you have an outflow of talent and experience from this country there is always the risk our graduates will be snapped up, as indeed has happened within the EC countries where industries queue up to get our graduates.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately for this country there is not a great deal of funding available for post-graduate courses.  Families are barely able to assist their children when they reach third level &mdash; those who cannot avail of grants &mdash; to achieve primary degree status.  In many cases the chances of going on to do MAs or PhDs is very slim.  This exchange certainly gives an opportunity for those people to study, to go forward and do their PhDs.  It is not just in the world of academe; it is also in the world of commerce, industry and business, and it can only bring us enormous benefits.</P>
    <P>I did not see numbers in the Minister's presentation to us last week with regard to those who actually apply and those who have achieved the opportunity of studying abroad.  I would be very anxious <Col N="12" /> to know how many students in this country have availed of the exchange programme going back to the Fulbright days and also the moneys that have been expended on an annual basis between ourselves and the United States to ensure that they get the benefits of that exchange.</P>
    <P>I notice, too, that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have responsibilities in this area.  I know Senator Raftery when speaking on this Bill was particularly keen to ensure that the Department of Education would be involved.  I would be inclined to think that it would be a far better vehicle to have, in order to streamline the whole educational aspect.  I would have thought that the Department of Education would have been the vehicle for the organisation and implementation of the exchange programme.</P>
    <P>On going through the Bill I find I have a few points to raise, which were also raised by other Senators.  Does the body that will be set up report back to the Dáil, the Seanad or to the Department of Finance?  I was not very clear about that. Likewise, I have a point in relation to the moneys which would accrue to this country in relation to the dissolution or the eventual termination of the agreement. It is obvious that the moneys coming from the United States are greater than the moneys that we are actually putting into the programme.  What would be the situation if there was an eventual termination of the agreement? It is stated here that funds revert to the Government of Ireland.  Obviously, it is laudable, since the commission is to be established for charitable purposes only, that the funds would be donated or transferred to another institution having similar objectives.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting point in relation to individuals.  There is very little that I was able to find out about Mr. Fulbright himself.  I would have liked to have seen some reference to the Fulbright programme in the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister would be able to give us some information on William Fulbright and how he <Col N="13" /> came to be organising scholarship exchange schemes.</P>
    <P>In my own area, the mid-west, we have the University of Limerick, which is a university with strong United States links and, over the last few months, Japanese links.  There have been bursaries from which American citizens, with Irish blood going back over several generations, have endowed institutions to create opportunities for study for young students.  I have found that the moneys of one individual, Mr. Friedman, to the four universities &mdash; the three constituent NUI colleges and Trinity &mdash; and now the University of Limerick have given opportunities for young girls, particularly young girls in need, to study in America. Therefore, it is not just Fulbright and this education exchange programme alone which is creating opportunities for study abroad; we could enumerate many individuals who have honoured Ireland in their wills, etc., to ensure that, in recognition of whatever they got from their country going back over several generations, future generations of young people here could study abroad.  It is interesting that that particular man Mr. Friedman, married a young Irish girl of very poor means, and it was from seeing how destitute this young girl was coming from Ireland to America that he realised that perhaps there were similar young girls in Ireland who would not have an opportunity to study abroad.  It is interesting that the emotional contact with the country is never forgotten and is put to good use; except for such programmes many students would not have the opportunity to study abroad.</P>
    <P>I am not familiar with the Fulbright programme in the early stages but I welcome it and there will be benefits in it for our students and for the Americans. Although we may underestimate our contribution to American universities, staff records of major Irish third level and business and commercial institutions reveal the number of Irish graduates who have studied for post-graduate degrees in America and returned to managerial and chief executive positions <Col N="14" /> in our major industries and universities. This phenomenon has not been quantified but one becomes aware of it when doing research on something like this.</P>
    <P>We can contribute to America in the area of literature and the humanities which the Americans, being a newly-discovered continent, look for to compensate for their lack of roots.  Our writers have been lauded throughout the world and many have received the Nobel Prize for literature; we are not far from June when we will have our Joycean walks and all the rest.  We should not underestimate our potential contribution to a country which is fast, competitive, innovative and consumer-oriented.  All over the world, in EC countries and particularly in America they are beginning to realise that there is more to life than high technology, that graduates in computers, electronics, etc. need the leavening of the humanities to bring about a more civilised, humane and developed lifestyle for all.  We can contribute toward that objective.</P>
    <P>As a country that is almost totally dependent on exports for survival, we need to be aware of how institutes operate abroad in those areas which are important to us such as commerce, industry and education.  There is no better way for us to gain that experience than for our young people to be able to achieve the heights of academic success in American universities.  I hope we can quantify the numbers who have come back to contribute to our economy rather than giving up their best to the multinationals abroad, as has happened in the past.  I thank the Minister and welcome this Bill.</P>

      <P>I would like to welcome the Educational Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Bill, 1991. It is important that Ireland should increase the number of its exchanges with other countries.  The original Fulbright programme was initiated by Senator Fulbright to foster mutual understanding between the people of the United States and other countries.  These were very noble and worthwhile aims and is to the credit of the Senator that he initiated <Col N="15" /> such a programme.  That was in 1946 and great work has been done since in the United States and in other countries to increase the level of exchanges.</P>
      <P>Since 1957, 800 Irish students and 300 American students have benefited under the Fulbright programme.  Irish people who have gone to America have benefited from the industrial technological point of view.  Some speakers have mentioned what we in Ireland can offer to the United States.  We can offer our writers, our poets, our culture and much more.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Ireland-United States Commission for educational exchange will be to encourage other related educational and cultural programmes and activities.  Ireland, as a neutral country, has an important standing and we are admired in many parts of the Third World and in certain troubled areas such as the Middle East.  In this context our exchanges should include and show a greater understanding of Middle East cultures.</P>
      <P>I am a great admirer of the United States.  I have been there on a number of occasions.  In fact, I have lived there and some of my family live there.  I believe the United States is a wonderful country, and a lot of the criticism about that country actually comes from it.  I remember a film director talking about political films that were critical of the United States, for example, the film &ldquo;Missing&rdquo; about the Chilean coup and which criticised American foreign policy, and he said: &ldquo;We may be criticising the US but it is one of the few countries in the world where we could make the film which is why we made it there.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should encourage the United States to appreciate the culture of Third World countries and get a better understanding of what is happening.  The conditions of many people in the Third World, in South America and in the Middle East are very bad and we could perhaps get across to the United States that many such countries take up a certain political stance because they do not see any other way out of their economic <Col N="16" /> predicament other than by adopting a radical political stance.</P>
    <P>There is great potential for Ireland to convey to the US aspects of cultural differences which they have not previously understood.  I visited Iran last year and one would have to be sympathetic about their treatment by the United States. There is an opening there and a great potential for Ireland to establish improved cultural relations between America and Iran and America and other countries in Latin America and elsewhere. As a member of the European Community, cultural exchanges between Ireland and the United States will enable the United States to learn how the Community is becoming more united in cultural and economic matters, on monetary union and political union.  It is important that the United States understand the process taking place in Europe and appreciate that Ireland is enthusiastic about European unity and that we are part and parcel of that Community.</P>
    <P>A great many benefits have accrued to Ireland and to the United States through these exchanges since 1957 and I hope, under the new programme, that many more people will benefit.  There are strong connections between the United States and Ireland and I hope we will continue to enjoy our good, friendly relationship with them for many years to come and that the cultural and academic exchanges will be a success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Educational Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Bill, 1991. It is desirable that there be a wealth of exchanges between countries.  We are dealing here with the United States but provisions are also being made in the European context for exchanges of an educational and cultural nature.  It is in everybody's interest that there be an inter-linking of people, particularly at educational and cultural levels.  I welcome the main provisions and the scope and extended terms of reference stated in the Bill compared to its predecessor, the Scholarship Exchange Bill in 1957.  It is gratifying and useful to see provision <Col N="17" /> made for exchanges of students, research scholars and teachers between the two countries.  Such exchanges are taking place to a lesser degree at present but are soon to be increased between European Community member states.</P>
      <P>I am glad the proposed exchanges will extend to cultural programmes and activities as well as to educational matters. A rigid line cannot be drawn between education and culture; there is an overlapping and the two areas are better addressed jointly rather than by a narrow interpretation or definition of education.  I would like to see it as broad as possible and spelled out even more.</P>
      <P>The Scholarship Exchange Board will now go into demise under this new legislation and it would be appropriate for us to have a comprehensive review of the activities of that board.  The board had to make an annual report but an annual report is not always made annually; the last annual report was made in 1983. Consequently, our understanding of how the scholarship exchange board operated, the extent of its operation, the funding that was available and the number of students covered by it is out of date.  It would be useful to have a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the work of that board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disappointing that only 800 Irish students and 300 US students availed of or were able to avail of this exchange scheme, either through shortage of funding, or availability of places in responding institutions in almost half a century, since 1957.  Those numbers could and should have been greatly exceeded and we should inquire why this was the case. Were the terms of reference interpreted too narrowly or exchanges limited to certain institutions?  Was the existence of these exchange facilities widely known to our post-graduate students?  Perhaps there was a degree of elitism in the exchange scheme whereby a first class honours degree was required of the person doing post-graduate studies in order to avail of the scheme, not to talk of whether there was sufficient funding available so that body and soul could be <Col N="18" /> kept together during the period of the exchange programme.</P>
    <P>I do not find it convincing that only the brightest of our students should be recipients of a bi-national arrangement between the US and Ireland.  If we are talking about mutual educational and cultural contact between two nations we must not pitch the level of that exchange so high that we deter ordinary men and women who could benefit from the exchange.  All of our society would benefit from that extra leavening process if the exchange did not stop at a particular level, class, or whatever.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear a statement from the Minister in relation to the breadth and balance of the proposed exchanges and whether we are going to find ourselves imposing limiting qualifications for limited institutions.  Are the terms of reference available to the commission sufficiently open to enable them to interpret them in the best sense of the education and cultural arena?  I am anxious to hear the Minister's response to that.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable student exchange for studying and research purposes and to enable teachers to be exchanged between the two countries. I would be interested to hear more about how the exchange of teachers is likely to take place.  Are we talking about exchanges between third level lecturers and professors which take place to a degree already since there is mutual understanding between many universities in the States and here and many visiting professorships, or are we coming to the area I would be most concerned with, post-primary and primary education? Will there be scope for exchanges of teachers at primary and post-primary level?  That would have beneficial educational value since there would be an exchanging of experiences throughout the entire education sector and not just at the top level.</P>
    <P>I am not talking solely of post-graduate studies, professorships or lectureships, but that the benefits of the scheme should percolate down to students and teachers at second level and to teachers at primary <Col N="19" /> level, so that a mutual exchange of educational methodology and ideas of professional competence takes place.  If we add that extra dimension to the original Fulbright proposals where funds were available, we will have done a good day's work which will be of considerable mutual benefit to us all.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to know how the former exchange scheme worked.  The number of Irish students going to the United States exceeded these coming here by almost 3 to 1.  Did those students return?  Our brightest and best went, because they had first class honours to do post-graduate studies at certain designated institutions that were glad to receive them.  How many of them were then sucked into the American system and assisted in building up that country and how many came back to Ireland to contribute to areas of education, science, industry and so on?</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to assure us that a limitation in terms of areas of research or study or other educational activities will not be imposed so that the broad humanities and the expressive arts will be covered as well as the sciences, industry, commerce, business studies, and so on.  We are talking about broad educational and cultural exchange which should not be limited to programmes of cultural activity but extended to performers and performance arts such as drama or photography.  The social sciences should also be included.  I would be interested to see what the breadth and scope of the Bill is going to be and whether or not there is an improvement on the original 1957 Bill.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the commission being established in the proposed format as an independent commission as distinct from the former board who were under the strict operation of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I hope when the commission is established that it will go about its business without fear or favour or interference from either the Minister or from the United States Embassy.  I understand that two officers of the United <Col N="20" /> States Embassy foreign service establishment will be on the board though I am not sure for what purpose.</P>
    <P>The commission exists for the purpose of choosing the best qualified people for this educational and cultural exchange and properly qualified people are required for that purpose.  I am not sure about the status of those two officers from the foreign service or about the required qualifications of the rest of the commission.</P>
    <P>There will be a chairperson, a deputy chairperson, a treasurer and an assistant treasurer which makes it top heavy with administrative people whereas it should be strong on qualified people in the educational and the cultural fields.  I will be putting forward an amendment to section 3 (1) to install a representative of the teaching profession on the commission. This would be one way of ensuring that educational matters are represented and that there is a qualified education person on the board to examine applications.</P>
    <P>I wonder how the exchanges are going to take place?  Will they be between designated institutions, as obtained under the old system where universities were the designated institutions?  That was unacceptable because it did not allow for the breadth of exchange one would have welcomed.  Exchange does not always require institutional exchange so how is it going to take place?  Will it be between universities, third level institutions, second level institutions, primary institutions, cultural institutions or is it to be broader than all that?  I would be interested to know how participation in the exchange is going to take place, how it will be monitored and evaluated and how we might ensure that there is a regular review and an up-to-date examination of the operation.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education are not involved at any level in this proposal; it is the concern of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the United States Embassy and the Department of Finance. I am not sure why the Department of Education are omitted from this arena because they would seem to have a role in the matter of educational exchanges. <Col N="21" /> Perhaps the Minister would refer to this matter.</P>
    <P>No development is possible without suitable funding.  Ronald Reagan conferred one benefit on this country by indicating an increase in the levels of exchange and in funding for the exchange.  Since only 1,100 people between the United States and Ireland availed of the previous scheme we would require substantial funding to make this new scheme worthwhile.</P>
    <P>What level of funding will be made available?  We may find the scheme operating with minimal funding since section 6 (2) states that all the liabilities of the scholarship exchange fund have to be discharged by the commission and shall, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, be paid out of the funds of the Ireland/United States Educational Fund. We do not know what funds remain in the scholarship exchange fund.  It may be in a debt situation and initial funds may go to pay those debts.  Existing funds from the winding-up of the scholarship exchange fund should be transferred into the new Ireland/United States Educational Fund but the former board are in debt, the new commission should not be encumbered with debts it had not incurred itself and which would jeopardise its operation.  I hope there are no liabilities to be paid.</P>
    <P>I would love to see an enormous extension and development of the educational exchange system to our mutual benefit. I have the greatest admiration for the United States of America where I have travelled widely and found the people friendly and generous.  Our policies differ on a number of issues, such as neutrality, and while some of us would disagree with some US policies nevertheless it is a very fine country.  We each have much to learn and to gain from each other.  We owe them a huge debt for receiving our forebears who left here in dire circumstances and who became part of that country; we will be forever grateful for that.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a requirement for an annual report built into the new legislation which was not in the old legislation. <Col N="22" /> An annual auditor's account is requested but not an annual report of the activities which we need.  It is absolutely essential that there is adequate funding for the extension and expansion of the service. We need to know the selection procedures for those who are going to participate in the exchange programme and the extent of the terms of reference, not just the description given in the objectives of the agreement in the Bill and in the explanatory memorandum.  Finally, we need to know the institutions and processes which will facilitate the exchanges.  That would be useful information in dealing with this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister on bringing it before the House.  The Bill proposes to establish a commission for educational exchange between Ireland and the US. In general, it represents an important contribution to the cultural side of Ireland's external relationships and, in particular, it highlights the close ties between our two countries.  They have a long and honourable history and have been defined in a number of ways both politically and economically.  However, of equal importance, if not of greater importance, are those connections that derive from people.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a continuation of many policy agreements with European countries. It will give the citizens of Ireland and America an opportunity to understand their traditions and culture better, especially in areas of educational research.  The proposed commission will replace the Scholarship Exchange Board who have operated since 1957.  Over the years this board, and their associated organisation, the Cultural Relations Committee, have worked very well.  In 1988, the Government confirmed the importance of their work by doubling their funding.  By establishing this commission the important work of educational research and cultural activities will be put on a sound and solid footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important for any Government not to confine themselves entirely to the relationships of politics and economics. <Col N="23" /> It is also important to develop cultural diplomacy, not only for their own sake but for the benefit of the organisations and institutions which are doing excellent work in this area.  In the United States one of the leading institutions of this kind is the American Cultural Institute.  This organisation was founded in 1962 for the specific purpose of fostering an appreciation of Irish culture and traditions to give Americans a better opportunity to understand the traditions and culture of our country.  For several years the organisation have been organising and sponsoring all types of Irish related cultural activities and research.  They also organise and stock libraries with books on Irish history and culture.</P>
    <P>The historical links between Ireland and the United States can never be denied.  The cultural and educational links and the identities of the two countries are extremely close.  This is the result of historical favours over the years, especially with regard to emigration.  I am pleased to see an improvement in educational exchanges between this country and the United States.  It is a tribute, not just to American education but to our own very high standard of education, of which we can be justly proud.  It is fair to say that American students could travel to many countries in the world before they would find educational establishments as good as those here.  We can be proud of the standard of education provided in our universities, regional colleges and so on.  US citizens coming to Ireland can look forward to one of the finest educational environments in the world.</P>
    <P>Down through the years Irish people have been extremely interested in education and our second level colleges, universities and regional colleges have produced some of the best students in the world.  United States specialities, which are now available here, can be availed of by scholars leaving this country under exchange programmes.  It is desirable that the Government, in conjunction with the US Government, seriously consider the possibility of extending the <Col N="24" /> sphere of the influence to those not as highly qualified as those for whom the Bill is intended.</P>
    <P>We are often critical of the United States but the present exchange scheme heralds another close link between us and America.  We should pay tribute to the United States for the generosity it has shown to our students and young people who, over the years, have been fortunate to secure work there.  The United States has from time to time, been the subject of a lot of criticism but we must give credit where it is due.  We should thank the United States for getting this scheme underway with a donation of approximately $500,000 in 1957.</P>
    <P>The functions of the new commission will be broadly similar to those of the Scholarship Exchange Board, namely, to finance studies and research by Irish and US students in the educational institutions of the other country and to select students, research scholars and professors for that purpose.  The new commission will be more autonomous in management and administration than the existing board.  That board consists of seven members, four appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and three by the US Ambassador to Ireland.  The chairman is appointed by the Minister who also provides the board secretariat and accommodation.  The new commission will have eight members, four appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and four by the US Ambassador. The chairman and treasurer will be elected by commission members.  In addition, the commission will be empowered to provide their own accommodation and secretiariat.</P>
    <P>The activities of the commission will be financed by income from the New Ireland United States educational fund to be established with a capital sum of £500,000 which will become available on the winding-up of the scholarship exchange fund.  This new fund is expected to yield an annual income similar to its predecessor of, approximately, £55,000. In addition, the commission will receive direct funding from the United States. Since the 1984 announcement an annual <Col N="25" /> sum of $127,000 has been provided by the US and administered by the Scholarship Exchange Board on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. Overall, this is a tremendous achievement and there is a great future for our students.  I have no doubt that we will see tremendous benefits and improvements in this scheme in the coming years.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or objectivity in the last few weeks.  Like the Government and the members of my new party I find no embarrassment in welcoming this Bill which I believe is also welcomed by the Independent benches.  It is welcomed by all sides of the House because it establishes a principle of which we can all approve, even if it does not go as far as we would like it to go.  My understanding of the reason for the consensus behind this Bill from all sides is because educational exchange is a broadening experience. It greatly benefits not only those who are participants in this scheme but also those who mingle with the people who travel abroad and here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we approve the principle we should also follow it through by advocating and pursuing a policy of educational exchange right through the educational system of Ireland.  Whereas this Bill is very limited &mdash; it surprises me that legislation is required to do what it does &mdash; what we ought to do, as Senator Costello said, is make a resolution that the principle of educational exchange, not just to America but elsewhere, should be established and extended.  I do not agree totally with Senator Costello that it should be limited to secondary and third level education.  It should extend to primary education.  It should not be limited to professors and teachers but extended as far as possible to primary, <Col N="26" /> secondary and third level pupils and also to academics.  This Bill only scratches the surface but it should be an opening and a clarion call to us to extend that principle right through the educational system. One of our problems, which is not a problem of our making but that of the good Lord, in whom all parties believe &mdash; even the Progressive Democrats&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>Just.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;just &mdash; is that we are a small island cut off from the mainland of Europe and, by definition, we will be insular in many of our attitudes.  Our educational system will also be insular unless we take measures to remedy it. That is something of which we are not very conscious in modern times for many reasons, one of those reasons being that the educational system here is extremely good.  It is of a high standard internationally in pure terms because successive Governments have quite rightly put such an extraordinary emphasis on education.  There is no doubt that in Ireland over the last 20 or 30 years, compared with other countries, the standard of education, relatively, has risen dramatically.  Our educational system in absolute terms is something of which we can be justifiably proud and for which all Governments are to be congratulated. There is no doubt that the enormous emphasis that has been put on education is sometimes expressed in the form that a maximum amount of money must be spent on every pupil here and in order to educate Irish people, which is the worthy principle behind it, we have excluded people from overseas.  We have lost sight of the main object of education which is a broadening of the mind.  It should not be difficult to arrange many more exchanges which would not affect Irish people and with very little, if any, cost to the Exchequer.  I have not done any sums on this but, instinctively, I do not think it would mean a charge on the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government should examine education at all layers and introduce broad schemes for sending pupils abroad and for accepting people here, not just from <Col N="27" /> the United States but from countries all over the world.  In order to support that argument I must emphasise that I represent, despite my new allegiance, the graduates of a third level university, not all of whom totally approve of my new allegiance but I still speak for them.</P>
    <P>In the sixties and seventies Trinity College, Dublin, was a very cosmopolitan &mdash; many would say too cosmopolitan &mdash; university.  It contained a proportion of undergraduates from overseas, not just from the United Kingdom but from elsewhere, which was probably too high in terms of Governmental policy and too difficult to defend in terms of the absolute objective of educating Irish people. Many said at that time &mdash; with some justification &mdash; that Trinity College, Dublin, in particular, was excluding Irish people because it was taking in too many foreigners.  There were other reasons also but that was a justifiable argument in some ways.  It gave the university a reputation of being an élitist university, if nothing else.  That has changed and, like any changes of that sort in 20 years, there are advantages and disadvantages.</P>
    <P>The advantages are clear.  More Irish people, particularly from Dublin, are being educated at third level and, as the university has expanded, more Irish people generally are being educated at third level.  However, the disadvantages, which I hope this Bill will help to counter if only in a very small way, are that Trinity College, Dublin has become a far more provincial university because of the lack of an international intake.  That occurred as a result of pressure from various Governments, fiscal pressure, financial constraints and the fair argument that no Irish university should be subsidising &mdash; as all university undergraduates are &mdash; the education of people from overseas. That is a fair argument but, unfortunately, it is to the detriment of the overall and broader education of third level students if they are educated almost exclusively, as they are here, with students with whom they spent their school days and do not mingle with people from outside Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" /> As a result of this Bill, I hope the Government will look at exchanges in a more comprehensive way.  Twenty years ago, to take a very relevant and potent example, and certainly pre-1969, Dublin University &mdash; I do not know about the NUI &mdash; had an enormous number of undergraduates and entrants from Northern Ireland.  I am not sure of the figures &mdash; I do not think they were ever available &mdash; but approximately 20 per cent of the intake was from Northern Ireland at that time.  Because of the pressures to which I have referred, that intake is down to less than 3 per cent.  That, in itself, is a tragedy because universities in the South and universities in the North could easily, by exchange programmes of this sort, act as a catalyst and a centre for an exchange of views between Protestant and Catholic, Nationalist and Unionist, which they used to do but which they no longer do. If Queen's University and Dublin University or Coleraine University and UCD were to enter into an exchange programme similar, but obviously, not identical, to the one referred to in the Bill it would, in the long term, help to promote understanding between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  It would lead to an exchange of views which, unfortunately, is lacking now because of the lack of communication between the two parts of this island.</P>
    <P>The benefit of this scheme is not really what Irish people who participate in it will learn by going to the US, nor is it the detailed technical knowledge which those who come here from the US will get, it is the side benefits US students will get by living in Ireland for a certain time and the side benefits which Irish people will get by living in America and, indeed, the knock-on effect which this will have on the people with whom they mingle.  That is the real educational benefit which this Bill will produce.  It is not the immediate soaking up of knowledge students can pick up from books that is important but the actual soaking up of the culture in which they mingle, the lessons which they will bring back here and the knowledge they take abroad with them when they <Col N="29" /> visit other countries.  That is the great advantage of this particular principle.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider &mdash; I have to admit I have not worked it out &mdash; whether this would, in fact, mean any great cost on the Exchequer and whether anybody would be deprived of education as a result of it.  The numbers would remain the same, they would not increase or decrease.  It would simply mean students from two universities exchanging positions.  Would that mean any great cost to the Exchequer?  I do not believe it would, provided an agreement is reached about the grants system in the two countries involved.</P>
    <P>This should not be confined to Northern Ireland, although Northern Ireland must be the most obvious choice because of the lack of understanding between the North and the South.  I also think that the pitiful numbers of undergraduates who come from Third World countries is one of the reasons there is so little understanding and sympathy in the western world for the Third World.  While exchanges between Ireland and the Third World might cost us something small in terms of Exchequer funding it would be of great benefit to the international community, to ourselves and to our educational system.  Therefore, we should promote such exchanges far more vigorously than we do at present.</P>
    <P>Because I have a special interest in South Africa I suggest now that sanctions are crumbling and are acknowledged to be crumbling by the European Community, the Minister should take the initiative and develop a similar exchange between Ireland and South Africa. Undergraduates from Ireland should go there and find out what is really happening in the universities there.  We should accept black and white people from South Africa in our universities so that we can find out what is going on there instead of hearing about the ignorant prejudices of both sides in the newspapers. That is what the Bill should seek to do.  It is the seed this Bill has sown that interests me, not its specifics.</P>
    <P>The agreement we have reached with the EC in relation to a liberal exchange <Col N="30" /> of undergraduates between this country and the EC countries is stymied because of the rule that students who come from the European Community to Ireland have to pay the same fees as Irish students. Ireland benefits from that but our undergraduates who go to England, Scotland, Wales or any EC country pay no fees.  Inhabitants of the UK pay no fees, but if they come here they have to pay similar fees to students who live here.  I suppose that is meant to be equitable but it acts as a major deterrent which deprives us of the benefit of a large number of students from overseas.  Our universities do not lack a high standard of education <i>per se</i> or a high level of technical or academic standards; they are extremely high and something of which we can be proud.  However, we must promote an international dimension to prevent our universities and or third level educational system from becoming parochial by world standards.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>At a first reading the Bill does not, perhaps, seem to be as important as some of the legislation which has gone through the House.  However, on closer inspection one quickly acknowledges that it is important.  In former times we sent abroad many scholars, some of whom, indeed, were saints, who brought learning to other countries of Europe. However, it is not all one-way traffic.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach on 20 May 1991 on the occasion of the announcement of the establishment of Ireland House at New York University in the Elmer Holmes Bobst Library of New York University said:</P>
      <P>Irish people, perhaps even more than others, contribute to the culture of many countries, but are all always inestimably refreshed and invigorated by renewed contact with their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where would we find more of our own than in the United States of America? Since 1957 about 800 Irish people have been awarded grants which have enabled them to study in the United States.  Many obtained training and gained experience <Col N="31" /> and have returned here to take up many top positions.  During the same period about 300 citizens of that great democracy, the United States of America, have been awarded grants to come here and we welcome and acknowledge the contribution they have made to the work in our academic institutions.  They have something to offer us and we have something to offer them.</P>
    <P>I will refer again to the Taoiseach's speech because I believe it is germane to the Bill and I quote:</P>
    <P>In proportion to its size, Ireland is a country of great cultural influence and achievement.  The temptation for such a country might be to neglect the practical and the material in favour of intellectual and spiritual status.  Indeed, we have been inclined to undervalue our very real achievements in the scientific and practical spheres.</P>
    <P>The entrance to the building in which I go to work every day is flanked by two statues.  One is of Rowan Hamilton, the discoverer of quaternions. The other is of Robert Boyle, the author of the famous Boyle's Law, without whom so much later scientific discovery would not have been possible.</P>
    <P>The presence of these two great Irishmen reminds me not only that Irish people have distinguished themselves in mathematics, physics and chemistry and that the national genius is as fitted for science as it is for any other sphere, but also that the opposition between scientific values and humanistic or spiritual ones is often unreal.  Rowan Hamilton was a friend of the great Irish novelist Maria Edge-worth and of the English romantic poets Robert Southey and William Wordsworth and wrote quite an amount of poetry himself; while Robert Boyle was deeply learned in Greek, Hebrew and Syriac and was instrumental in having the Bible translated into Irish.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="32" /> In the matter of any possible opposition between practical and other systems of value in the educational sphere or elsewhere, I am a firm believer in having the best of both worlds and I am encouraged in my belief not only by the history of western civilisation since the Greeks, but by what can be regarded as the abolition of the barriers between the spiritual and the material in much contemporary scientific inquiry, most notably of course in contemporary physics.</P>
    <P>The leaders of Europe after World War II looked into the future and envisaged a free and united Europe.  They saw first a sort of economic foundation and out of this they expected the exchange of goods and services, a free flow of capital and, finally, the creation of conditions which would promote the free flow and exchange of people.  There is a rough parallel between that and the establishment of Ireland House.  As I already stated, for many years there has been a free flow of ideas between Ireland and the United States of America and this has been increasing in recent times.</P>
    <P>The creation of an institute, like Ireland House, will provide a framework for our interchanges and will facilitate an expanded emphasis on Irish studies in the United States.  In time I am sure we shall come to see the establishment of a Chair of Irish Studies which will provide a focus for the endeavours in this diverse field.</P>
    <P>Too frequently we see exports from the United States which are inane in the extreme, for example, the hulahoop, the twist or Bart Simpson.  However, one has to go to the United States to see just what that country can provide and I have had the opportunity of travelling widely in the US.  Many beneficial developments originated in the United States in recent times.  Many developments in science, physics and medicine originated there and, indeed, many great concepts, such as freedom of speech and access to information developed there also.  Any mutual exchange, no matter how small the cross-fertilisation, can only be of benefit.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ross, that <Col N="33" /> exchange programmes should extend to primary education because travel broadens the mind.  I also believe that when one travels it serves to eradicate prejudice and to dispel preconceived notions.  Irish people have been great travellers.  It was with some regret that I learned recently that only 10 per cent of citizens of the United States possess passports.  I hope that will change in the future.</P>
    <P>I think the Bill will do what it sets out to do; to expand programmes that promote mutual understanding between the peoples of Ireland and the United States of America, through a wide exchange of knowledge and professional talents.  It is for that reason I support the Bill and I hope it will get a speedy passage through the House.  Even though it is not a major Bill, it is very important and will serve its purpose to some extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I offer my sincere thanks to all the Members of the Seanad who contributed to the Bill and who gave it such a warm welcome.  I am pleased at the welcome the Bill has received because it will provide a valuable opportunity for increased academic and cultural exchanges with the United States.  I would like to comment on some of the very interesting points that were made during the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may not be widely known, but there are Members of the Seanad who have been Fulbright scholars &mdash; at least two of them &mdash; and that has probably given the Seanad a much better insight that it might otherwise have had.  I do not know why the Seanad has been so hard on the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Many Senators wondered why the Bill was being handled by that Department and not by the Department of Education. Indeed, some felt it would be more appropriate to the Department of Education. The Bill arises from an international agreement, and international agreements are generally handled by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Also, responsibility for the 1957 Bill was taken by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It <Col N="34" /> is, therefore, appropriate that this Department should deal with the replacement of that Act and the extension of the related programme.</P>
    <P>The programme not only deals with academic exchanges but it also contains a major cultural element.  Grants have been awarded and will be awarded for the individual and performing arts.  Senator Costello made the point that grants should be awarded in the cultural area and I would like to assure him that it has been done.  Generally, cultural relations with other countries are a matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs and for all these reasons it was felt appropriate that the Department should deal with this matter.  As was acknowledged in the Seanad and in the Dáil, the existing scheme has been a very a successful one. It was operated under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs &mdash; not under the control of the Department of Foreign Affairs but under the aegis of the Department.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald asked how much of the balance remaining in the scholarship exchange fund will be likely to be available for transfer to the new fund.  This point was raised also by Senator Costello. Senator Costello's fears can be put aside. There is approximately £533,000 in the old fund, at present.  Of course, on the winding-up of the old fund, any liabilities outstanding would have to be taken into account and discharged before the remaining moneys are transferred to the new fund.  I am not in a position to say how much that will be until all the balances are transferred, but I would expect that the balance for transfer would not be significantly below the amount currently in the old fund.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald and Senator Jackman asked for details of the number of beneficiaries to date under the programme. I mentioned in my introductory speech that approximately 800 Irish citizens have benefited from awards under the programme and approximately 300 US citizens.  The average annual cost of the awards would normally be in the region of £100,000 between US and Irish funding.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="35" /> Senator Lanigan asked whether the scholarship exchange scheme is operated on a one-to-one basis.  The answer to that is no.  There is no rule laid down for the number of people granted awards from each country, or indeed for parity to operate in this regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan asked why there were eight members on the commission rather than an uneven number of seven, as in the old committee.  The reply is relevant to many other questions that were raised. The number eight was chosen for the new commission on the advice of the United States whose programme this is.  That is a very important point, one that can be made time and time again.  This programme is similar to one which the United States operate with 120 other countries.  The United States have been operating this programme most successfully in a number of countries for many years and we can be confident that the number chosen for the new commission will operate satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Some Senators pointed to what they said were drawbacks to the Bill, what they saw as defects in it.  I would like to point out to the House that the new arrangements are being introduced to bring our structures in line with the Fulbright structures operating in other countries.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan also proposed that former participants should be able to contribute to the funding of this programme and asked if a mechanism existed for them to do so.  I agree with Senator Lanigan. It would be most desirable if the commission could accept contributions from former participants and other sources. I am happy to say that this possibility is provided for under section 12 of the Bill.  Senator Lanigan also asked if there was any possibility that Ireland would consider putting extra money into the fund in addition to the income from investments.  It is not ruled out; we may decide to do that in the future.  At present, we will be putting into the fund the income from the investments.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan also asked whether Fulbright scholars had to pay the full <Col N="36" /> amount an ordinary student would have to pay in American colleges.  The question of what fees have to be paid to colleges is a matter normally arranged between the individual college and the student concerned.  Sometimes funds are offered to the student by the college, sometimes certain fees are waived.  It depends on the financial arrangements entered into by the individual colleges.</P>
    <P>Senators asked about the new chairman. The terms of office of the commission members will be two years.  I would expect that at the end of the first two years of the Commission there will be the appointment or reappointment of members to form a new commission and that the new chairman will be elected from among the members of the reconstituted commission.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello and other Senators wondered if the members of the US diplomatic service who might be appointed to the new commission would be the most appropriate appointees, having regard to the work of the commission.  I cannot preempt the decision of the US Government concerning its nominees to this commission. As regards a diplomatic category it would seem that the practice in other countries has been for the US to nominate those embassy officials with experience and responsibility for culture and educational affairs.  I feel the Seanad can be well satisfied that all of the appointees to this commission both the Irish and the US side will be well qualified for their tasks.  Many Senators complimented the commission on its work and that is an indication that people are satisfied with the work done.  I do not think that the new commission will be found wanting either.</P>
    <P>Senator Raftery was a little worried that the word &ldquo;Fulbright&rdquo; was not mentioned anywhere in the Bill and felt that, because of the tremendous contribution of former Senator Fulbright, it should be mentioned.  It has not been the practice for the word &ldquo;Fulbright&rdquo; to appear, formally in agreements or in legislation relating to this programme.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, the word &ldquo;Fulbright&rdquo; had become a common name <Col N="37" /> given to this programme, because the legislation was introduced by Senator Fulbright.  However, the legislative authority for this programme comes from the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 which is the former title of the Act.  As I said, the word &ldquo;Fulbright&rdquo; is not used in the formal text.  I am sure Senator Raftery will agree with me that there is very little chance that the word &ldquo;Fulbright&rdquo; will be forgotten.</P>
    <P>Senator Raftery and other Senators asked if the new commission will report. The commission will report annually to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and to the representative of the United States. Reports are in the Library up to 1989. They were placed there only after the matter was raised in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Senator Raftery questioned the imbalance in the exchanges between Irish citizens going to the United States and US citizens coming to Ireland.  Perhaps I could explain that the practice under this programme to date has been to try to enrich and contribute to the further development of our third level institutions by bringing in a smaller number of very senior American scholars to lecture and carry out research here.  On the Irish side, however, the focus has been on sending to the US as many junior academic lectures and post-graduates as possible to enable them to benefit from further training and development in their chosen disciplines.  This has been the practice in the past.  However, the new commission will, no doubt, have its own ideas on programmes for the future.  I am sure it will be looking at and examining all options and possibilities with regard to the focus and the balance of the programme, a point that was stressed by Senator Costello.  I am sure the Senator's fears in this matter will be unfounded and that the commission will ensure that there is a focus and balance in the programmes.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris raised a number of points in relation to the equivalence of academic training and qualifications as between the United States and Ireland. <Col N="38" /> This is a very important question.  As I said, it is not possible to resolve this question here.  I can assure Senator Norris that I will draw his very detailed comments to the attention of the new commission.  I would like to stress that the commission will have the power under this Bill to recommend to the board of foreign scholarships the qualifications for the selection of participants in the programme.  This should help to sort out any difficulties that might arise regarding qualifications.  I will certainly bring Senator Norris' comments to the attention of the commission.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross raised a number of important points in relation to other exchanges.  While I can accept the importance of the points he raised, many of them do not come under the ambit of this Bill and are for another day.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris also asked if I would indicate what would cause the Minister to remove a commission member from office.  It is not only the Minister for Foreign Affairs who has the power to appoint and remove commission members.  The representative of the United States also has this authority in relation to US appointees.  This Bill, of course, reflects closely the international agreement with the United States signed in October 1988. It has not been the practice to spell out in agreements of this nature the reason for a person being removed from office. The Senator can be assured that such a removal would take place only for very serious reasons and would follow lengthy examination and consideration.  This provision is also in section 12 of the 1957 Act.  There has never been reason to use this provision since 1957 and we need not fear it will be used indiscriminately in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris and a number of other Senators were concerned that the appointment of the commission members should take place in consultation with the people principally and directly involved. May I assure the House that appointments to this new and very important <Col N="39" /> commission will only be made following very careful and detailed consideration and indeed appropriate consultation.</P>
    <P>The question of the commission's accommodation and staff was raised by Senator Norris and I agree with his comments. However, the provisions of the Bill in this area are designed, as I said before, to bring our structures into line with the usual Fulbright structures operating in other countries.  It is normal for the Fulbright commission to have power, if it so wishes, to provide its own accommodation and secretariat.  We can all feel confident that the new commission will operate sensibly in this regard and will wish to keep its administration costs to the minimum conducive to efficient management. This has been the experience with Fulbright commissions in other countries.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello asked whether any first or second level teachers had benefited from the Scholarship Exchange Board.  While I have not all the details, I am assured that some second level teachers have benefited from the exchange.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank all the Senators who contributed to this very important Bill.  Many of the points raised were important.  Many of them, however, are outside the ambit of the Bill but they will be brought to the attention of the Minister.  I would also like to thank the House for the way it has welcomed the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister in summing up mentioned the Minister for Foreign Affairs and this section states that &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I did not catch why it was limited to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and why there was no role for the Minister for Education.  I can see a situation where there would be a role for the Minister for Foreign Affairs but to exclude totally the Minister for Education would seem to be deliberate because, obviously, it is referring to educational matters.  It would seem to any ordinary person that there should be some role, if not the critical role, for the Department of Education and the Minister for Education in relation to the contents of this Bill.</P>

      <P>As I said, this is just a repetition of the 1957 Act. The Minister in that Act was also described as Minister for Foreign Affairs. There is no reason why the Minister for Education should be excluded.  However, the reality is that this Bill reflects the agreement which was drawn up between the United States and Ireland in October 1988.  Of course consultation is carried out between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Education on certain matters.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (7) (c), lines 26 and 27, to delete &ldquo;educational and cultural activities&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;educational, cultural and individual and group artistic activities, expositions and performances&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this amendment I am seeking to extend and broaden the parameters of the operation of the Bill.  The reason is that we have a fairly clear and defined range of <Col N="41" /> programmes set out in the Bill and, quite clearly, that is the way the old Fulbright operation worked.  There was research work, there were studies, there were institutions and designated areas.  I am seeking to expand on that, to include the broader area that may not be clearly defined, such as performances, individual activity, group activities and exhibitions, for example, of paintings or poetry readings. You could hardly call those programmes.</P>
    <P>There is a broad area of educational cultural activities that do not come within the definition of &ldquo;programme&rdquo;.  It is a real problem because the danger is that by the wording used you are simply precluding from the word go, a number of people and their activities which should come properly within the ambit of this legislation. This is particularly true if what we are seeking to do is to extend the range of cultural and educational contact not simply to institutions, to post-graduates or to research facilities, but to the broader educational and cultural arena and the inter-relationship between two communities.</P>
    <P>I am particularly worried about it when I look at section 7, where the powers of the commission are described.  It is categorically stated in section 7 (1) (a), (b) and (c) that we are talking about programmes and the planning, adoption and execution of programmes.  Paragraph (b) refers to &ldquo;students, research scholars and teachers to participate in the programmes envisaged by this Act&rdquo;.  Paragraph (c) relates to the arrangement &ldquo;for the placement of Irish institutions&rdquo;, which is the return sector, and it reads: &ldquo;as presented by that Board to participate in the programmes envisaged by this Act&rdquo;.  There is no reference to activities or the broader area of cultural relations that I hope are included in this Bill.  I am worried that while it mentions activity at an early stage it goes on in section 7 to tell the commission that they must operate within narrower parameters and confines.  The confines are <Col N="42" /> the old traditional ones that were there under the 1957 legislation on the Scholarship Exchange programme &mdash; designated institutions and programmes, studies, and research.  I think it will be a grave disappointment if the new legislation simply allows that situation to continue. Therefore, the amendment proposed here is worth while.  It is in keeping with the spirit of the legislation and it would be an invaluable contribution to expanding the parameters of the exchange programme and its activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Costello is looking at it from the wrong angle. There is no limitation whatsoever on the programmes referred to in the Bill other than that they will be of an educational and cultural nature.  That gives a very broad range of subjects.  We have deliberately left this vague so as to ensure that no appropriate element could be excluded from the programme, and in order that the programmes could be broadly based and have as wide a scope as possible, in line with what Senator Costello has just pointed out.  I honestly think Senators can be confident that their concerns have already been taken care of.</P>
      <P>I would also like to say that the wording of section 2 (7) (c) reflects that of Article 1 (d) (iii) of the agreement which was signed in October 1987 between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United States.  It is the normal wording for agreements of this nature and for the related legislation.  The whole purpose of the agreement and legislation is to bring the procedures and the structures into line with the usual Fulbright procedures and structures, so that they may be able to avail of the additional funding that is now being offered to us.  The existing wording of the Bill is broad enough to include each of the elements mentioned by Senator Costello.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Artistic and cultural exchanges were already a feature of the programme <Col N="43" /> under the 1957 Act.  I can give the Senator examples of the wide diversity of grants that have been made available under that Act.  It has always been the practice under the programme &mdash; and I would like to repeat this &mdash; to award grants in the different areas of the visual and performing arts; that is something that Senator Costello would like to have included.  It is already there; grants have already been awarded to people in the visual and performing arts.  Provision was also made for the continuance and expansion of this cultural element in the new Bill under section 2 (7) (c) and section 7 (1) (i).  I honestly think that everything Senator Costello wants is already included.  Therefore, I ask him to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly accept the assurance made by the Minister that there have been instances in which there has been broader definition of the use of the words &ldquo;programme&rdquo; and &ldquo;cultural activity&rdquo;.  From what I know &mdash; and it is largely hearsay &mdash; the problem about the operation of the old Fulbright scheme was that it was very much a post-graduate scheme, it was very much a third level scheme.  It was a fairly rigid scholarship exchange of post-graduate activities and there was no great focus on a broader exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to do is to introduce into the legislation that necessary focus to ensure that we are now moving from exchanging the best and brightest in an academic sense to exchanges in a broad cultural and educational sense, with breadth and balance in every area and at every level.  I am concerned that that needs to be put into the legislation. Otherwise I would be afraid it would continue to operate more or less along the same lines as the old legislation.  I am anxious to ensure that the new commission sees the particular concern we as legislators have for ensuring that there is not an imbalance.  It is not just good <Col N="44" /> enough to say there are some in the categories of the visual and performing arts who are able to avail of it.  I do not think the old Fulbright scheme had a balance and that is my concern in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>May I try to reassure Senator Costello that what we are doing is a continuation and broadening of the old scheme.  Under the old scheme such things as ceramics, photography, music, sculpture and various other forms of the arts were awarded scholarships.  I honestly feel that the concerns the Senator is expressing are catered for.  I would be afraid we would tie ourselves into something a lot more rigid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), lines 30 and 31, to delete &ldquo;and an Assistant Treasurer&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;, an Assistant Treasurer and a representative of the teaching profession&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is certainly an important amendment. Its purpose is to introduce into the commission at least some person or some body with relevant qualifications as part of the eight member team.  What we have there at present is:</P>
      <P>The commission shall consist of eight members including a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman, a Treasurer and an Assistant Treasurer.</P>
      <P>We are, I might say, top heavy with named administrative people: 50 per cent have already been named in that administrative capacity.  I find this somewhat disappointing because that would suggest that at least some of them are there for very specific functions which certainly do not seem to be selection functions.  The treasury is very strong.  Whether or not the chairman and deputy chairman are going to have the academic, educational and cultural qualifications for the job is not clear; but certainly the legislation indicates that they would have to have certain administrative qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is to be a broad educational and cultural operation, then it is important that we add that there should be a representative of the teaching profession as part of the commission.  I say that because the terms of reference extend to students, studies, research work, teachers, cultural activities, obviously the whole area of curricular development in the educational context of teaching and the professional development of teachers. Therefore you need somebody with expertise in the education and cultural area.  Who is going to sit on the commission? Are we going to have two citizens, two officers of the foreign service from the United States who are part of <Col N="46" /> the diplomatic service and may or may not have some knowledge of cultural and educational affairs?  The Minister suggested that in other countries this is often the case.  But there you have six members identified already who need not necessarily have any educational or cultural knowledge and by their description they are there for different reasons rather than because of their expertise in the cultural and educational fields.</P>
    <P>It alarms me to a degree that we have no indication in terms of what is provided in the Bill about any expertise for the commission.  I feel that the most relevant expertise is qualifications and experience in the teaching profession.  May I ask the Minister if he would be agreeable to accept this amendment as it is an amendment which seeks to ensure that at least one person is specifically designated as a professional in the area of education and cultural activities?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I am afraid that Senator Costello seems to have interpreted section 3 in a different light than I have.  The commission shall consist of eight members and, like any board or commission, they will have a chairman, and a deputy chairman will be appointed from the eight members, not necessarily that a deputy chairman is going to be appointed.  All the Minister for Foreign Affairs can appoint is four.  The other four are, under the terms of the agreement, to be appointed by the United States.  May I just give you the names of those on the Scholarship Exchange Board so that you will see the calibre of people that have been appointed to that board by various Ministers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As of now, the chairman is Professor Lee, Department of Modern History, University College, Cork; Dr. Watts, the Provost of Trinity College, Dublin, Dr. Colm Ó hEocadh, President of University College, Galway, and the former member, now unfortunately deceased, Mrs. Sarah Nangle, B. Comm., FCA.  So you can see that already three of the <Col N="47" /> four people appointed are people who are eminently associated with teaching.</P>
    <P>I can understand the thrust of Senator Costello's amendment that he would like to ensure that there is somebody there, at least one, who has educational qualifications. You can can take it that the Minister will, of course, be in consultation with the Department of Education. As the Senator can see from the people who are on this board, the appointments to the new commission by the Minister for Foreign Affairs from Irish citizens will certainly reflect the kind of people who are on the outgoing board. The Senator, therefore, need not have any worries at all about people of very high educational qualifications being on this commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly that is helpful, but the names that the Minister has given lead to another point, that is, that they are all third level.  That again is what I have been saying: that the old Fulbright scholarship was very much identified with third level and post-graduate.  Therefore, while these are excellent people, they are excellent people at third level.  That explains one point, but it creates another problem.  It ties in also with my second amendment, which we are also discussing, that they be nominated by organisations in the field of education.  What I wanted was that at least one person would be representative of the teaching profession, that the organisations involved in educational matters would be responsible for making nominations and then that the appointments would be made by the Minister.  Obviously, I would be looking for a greater breadth of educational representation, that it would not all simply be from third level but that there would be one or two from other levels as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the combined effect I hoped for from those two amendments: that there would be a specific representation, then nomination rights outside, but hopefully that it would also be of an educational <Col N="48" /> nature.  I still feel it is a bit lopsided that we have the functions of so many of the members identified without having any member identified in terms of his or her expertise for selection purposes.  That was my point: that at least we would write in our concern that there would be people on the board with the expertise.</P>
    <P>In practice, I have no doubt the Minister will choose very wisely, but we as legislators have a responsibility to ensure that we point the Minister in the right direction, because there is a Minister now and there will be another Minister again. In my previous amendment I wanted to ensure that we pointed any future members of the commission to our view that there would be as broad as possible a cultural and educational exchange programme. In this case I want to ensure that the selection process would be by people who are eminently qualified to do it.</P>

      <P>Obviously, I cannot give the Senator any more guarantees than I have given him.  I think that the three people who are still members of the board appointed by the Minister &mdash; and indeed, may I say, by successive Minister since the board was set up &mdash; are all highly involved and very well qualified in the educational field.  The provisions of the Bill &mdash; I am sorry for repeating this so often &mdash; reflect the international agreement which has been signed by the United States Government and by the Irish Government and they just generally bring into line our procedures and our structures with the usual Fulbright procedures and structures so that we may be able to avail of the additional funding being offered.</P>
      <P>I accept the thrust of Senator Costello's amendment.  I can sympathise with it, but I think I have been able to show him that his concerns are adequately covered in the expertise and integrity of the people who are already on the board.  I am sorry I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying that a condition of the 1988 agreement is that it would preclude us from adding this amendment, that we would not get the funding if we were to introduce an amendment that would specify the origin or nature of one of our representatives on that commission?</P>

      <P>I am not saying at all that you cannot recommend to the Minister. If Senator Costello is going to put in that the teaching profession should nominate an individual, then that individual is nominated not by the Minister but by the teaching profession.  It is not the normal practice in agreements of this nature to specify details relating to commission members other than what has been provided.  We have followed the normal practice.  I can assure Senator Costello and the Seanad that any appointments to this commission will only be made by the Minister following very detailed and comprehensive consideration. I can assure the Seanad that all appropriate consultations will be carried out and that the concerns expressed in the House will be brought to the Minister's attention.</P>
      <P>The agreement took a long time to finalise and there were suggestions in the Dáil that it took a long time to bring in this Bill.  The reality is that we had to get agreement on many points.  It is important that we get this legislation through as quickly as possible so that we can benefit from the extra funding which is being given to us by the United States under the Fulbright programme.  I will put to the Minister the suggestions that have been made by Senator Costello.  While I have every sympathy with the thrust of this amendment, I cannot accept it.</P>

I am delighted with this legislation and far be it for me to suggest there is something fundamentally flawed with it.  However, it is our function to try to improve legislation where we think it requires improvement.  I believe it is incumbent on us to ensure that somebody is named and that a professional body with the necessary expertise would be involved in the selection process rather than simply stating a commission with a chairperson, a deputy chairperson, a treasurer, an assistant treasurer plus two officers of the foreign service and not defining any expertise other than administrative expertise or diplomatic expertise.</P>

Even if I take the second amendment which seeks to insert &ldquo;nominated by organisations in the field of education&rdquo;, I could well make the same point to Senator Costello as he is making to me.  How many organisations have we in Ireland that are involved in the field of education? One would have a job to define those organisations.  Nearly every organisation, from Macra down to the Senator's own organisation, would feel they have a right to be part and parcel of what the Senator described as organisations in the field of education.  While I can sympathise with and acknowledge the thrust of the Senator's amendment, unfortunately I am not in a position to accept it.</P>

      <P>Section 12 is an interesting section which states that the commission may accept and use in accordance with the provisions of the Act such other funds, goods or services as may be made available to the commission by contribution from any source, public or private. This indicates not that the new body is being set up on a charitable basis but that it is open to the reception of funds from any generous donor whether from a corporate or an individual source.

      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Annual Report of the Commission shall be published.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is important that an annual report be made to the Minister and to the representatives of the United States on the activities of the commission and that that report be available for public inspection. I have seen too many internal reports in the past gather dust on shelves in various Departments.  It is difficult to get reports of the old Scholarship Exchange Board; they were not available in the Library up to recently.  Reports should be made available to the public to provide up-to-date information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we review the situation to know what is going on, how it is working, what progress is being made, <Col N="56" /> how many members are availing of the exchange service being provided and how the funds are being used.  It is important to publicise the operation so that people will be made aware of its existence unlike the old Fulbright structure which was known to a limited number of people. We want the new scheme to be known about and available to a much greater degree so it is important that we publish a report of its activities on a regular basis so that the public may be aware of what is happening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill reflects the agreement with the United States and is designed to bring our structures and procedures into line with the normal Fulbright procedures and structures.  Provision has been made in the Bill for information to be provided to the Oireachtas through the medium of the audit and related reports thereon of the new fund and of the commission's accounts.  Under section 15 (3) the form of the commission's accounts is to be agreed between the Minister and the representative of the United States.  The House can be assured that both parties will be anxious to provide as much information as possible about the work of the commission and that the form of the accounts will therefore be very detailed. The audits and reports of the audits will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas which was considered to be the most useful and efficient method of providing information on the work of the commission.  There is nothing in the Bill to preclude the reports of the commission being published.  I would see no reason why this should not be done.  However, it would require the consent of both the Minister and the representative of the United States and should be left to be decided and arranged by both of these parties in consultation.</P>

If the annual report were part of the package presented to the Oireachtas, that would constitute a degree of publication.  Without Government publication there will be limited public access to information on the activities of the commission we are about to set up.</P>
      <P>I cannot see why the Government of the United States would not be delighted to ensure that the people of Ireland knew of its generosity and largesse through the exchange relationship that it had, by agreement, made with Ireland for the benefit of both countries.  Similarly, our Minister should have no objection to the broadest dissemination of information on the operation of this new facility.  The Minister says there is nothing in section 15 that precludes publication of the annual report neither is there anything in section 15 which requires its publication. That is my problem.  The Minister might give us some assurance that he will bring to the commissioners the concern of the House that the annual report be published or at least that both the US representative, the US Government and the Minister might discuss the matter and come to agreement on it.</P>

      <P>Under subsection (1) all moneys that come to the commission or to the fund from whatever source accrue to the Government and should there be a dissolution of the fund for whatever reason all moneys would be transferred to another institution with similar objectives. If we operate section 12 to receive or invite funds from corporate or individual donors &mdash; some philanthropic old lady or wealthy gentlemen or previous Fulbright scholar might wish to make a contribution &mdash; it would seem improper that their money, if there was a termination of the 1988 agreement, should go to the Government.  The proper course would be to restore that money to the donor since it would have been intended for the purpose of cultural and educational exchanges.  Why should the Government be the net beneficiary seeing that this operation is going to be funded largely by non-State funding?</P>
      <P>The provisions of this section are Government-orientated and are too simplistic and rigid concerning the manner in which such funding would be dealt with irrespective of the source of donation in the event of the commission being wound up.  Excess funds should go back to the sources from which they have come, particularly if a section allows for public and private sources of funding.  Should we not provide in this section for the return of money to private sources?</P>

      <P>This section is based on article 10 of the 1988 agreement which provides for the division of the funds and the property of the commission upon termination of the agreement.  Why should we look forward to the termination of the agreement?  Should we not look instead for an extension of the agreement? In relation to Senator Costello's point concerning funds sourced from outside the two Governments, this money would be put to use immediately.  The point at issue is the capital sum which has been there for a considerable time and I do not see why that capital sum cannot go <Col N="59" /> back to the Government or Governments that contributed in the first place.  Senator Costello need have no worries about the commission's capacity to spend any moneys they can acquire in relation to scholarship exchange.</P>
      <P>A point made by many Senators throughout this debate was that not enough people are availing of the exchange programme and that more money should be made available to enable greater numbers to avail of the scheme.  If the commission succeeds in attracting money from private or semi-private sources or from State organisations, that money will be used quickly and to the benefit of many young people.</P>

      <P>It is no exaggeration to say that Irish motorists are becoming punch drunk from the rising costs of insurance year after year.  We not only have the second most expensive cars in Europe but we have by far the most expensive insurance in the Community and it goes on rising.</P>
      <P>Young drivers are finding it impossible to get insurance at anything but prohibitive prices.  I have known several cases where young drivers who bought a secondhand car for £1,000 or £1,500 were quoted figures for their first year insurance premium which were higher than the price paid for the car.  Some of them had to return the car because they could not afford the premium.  Some will not need a car but many find the car a necessity nowadays to do their business, to get to their work and so on.  It is an appalling situation and we seem to be unable to do anything about it, or perhaps we are not committed to doing anything about it.</P>

    <P>Three years ago an application was made by our Government for a derogation in the non-life insurance sector to provide protection not for consumers but for insurance companies.  That derogation was granted which means that while I could get car insurance in Northern Ireland for roughly one-third of what I pay in Cork I cannot use that insurance certificate to get road tax to drive my car in the South.  That is naked protectionism and it is not in the best interest of the country because the present cost of insurance is making industry and services uncompetitive against foreigners who have much cheaper insurance costs.  This morning by chance I happened to get figures, unofficially, from an insurance company.  The man who showed them to <Col N="61" /> me did not know that I was going to speak on this subject.  The company in question insures about 50,000 cars in Ireland each year.  The legal costs incurred for every car insured with that company arising from claims made in respect of accidents amounts to £70 for every person insured with them.  I am sure other insurance companies would have the same experience. Uninsured drivers are costing each insured driver with that company £20 per head.  Other costs which arise due to mistakes made which are of no concern to the insured person are £10 per head for the ICI/PMPA debacle.</P>
    <P>Extraordinarily generous awards are made in Ireland.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said years ago &mdash; and I agreed with him thoroughly &mdash; that these awards were out of line with other countries and that when we got rid of the jury system we would solve this.  We got rid of the jury system and awards have gone up, not down.  Judges seem to be more generous than the juries and there is a lack of consistency in the making of awards.  Other countries have a reasonably consistent pattern of awards for injuries such as losing an eye, an arm or a leg or for a back injury, or whatever. Awards seem to be made at the whim of every judge in this country and there is little consistency between them on penalising or awarding following an accident or crime.  I suggest judges need regular in-service training courses.  They would want to get together to make up their minds on issues like these so as not to lose credibility with the public because of the inconsistency of the law.  If the law is not an ass it certainly appears to be an ass at times.  The generous awards system needs to be examined to see how it can be revised.  It has been revised in other countries and there is no reason why it should not be done here, if the commitment to do so exists.</P>
    <P>We should also look at what part alcohol is playing in our accident rate.  The evidence of the Garda campaign last Christmas against drunken driving shows <Col N="62" /> clearly how effective that was in reducing significantly the serious accident and death rate.  The condition of our roads is leading to extra costs as far as insurance and maintenance are concerned.  The generous awards systems is giving rise to a growing industry of arranged crashes where people arrange to have their car bashed and claim for it.  The award system is so generous that it is profitable to get your car hammered by some truck by arrangement and then take it to the insurance company and get far more than the cost of the damage incurred.</P>
    <P>Part of the reason for this practice is that insurance companies are no longer prepared to contest claims because of the high legal costs involved so the company pays up or reaches a very generous settlement with the person making the claim. Our politicians are not sufficiently aware of the gravity of this matter, if they are I cannot understand why they are not doing something about it.  It is serious for the economy and for young people trying to get car insurance.  The more the insurance cost goes up the greater the incentive for people to drive without insurance.  It is a vicious circle.  As costs increase young people cannot afford insurance so they drive without it.  The more people drive without insurance the more the cost of insurance goes up.  The problem must be tackled.</P>
    <P>Other countries tackle this problem and I have here before me an information leaflet on the Ontario protection plan for motorists.  This plan was devised by the Government of Ontario because of the rising costs of insurance.  I understand New Zealand also tackled it head-on but I am not aware of the details.  I will read for you what is in this information leaflet.</P>
    <P>The Ontario protection plan is a new insurance system that balances the goal of affordable insurance with the need to provide swift, humane and adequate compensation in the event of an accident... The new plan is designed to keep automobile insurance rates as low <Col N="63" /> as possible and to ensure that more of the premium dollar goes to those who need it most, those injured in accidents. If you are injured in an accident you will be protected by the guaranteed benefits available under the new plan and in cases of serious injury you will continue to be able to sue for additional compensation.  Serious injuries are those which meet what is known as &ldquo;the threshold&rdquo;.  The threshold is defined as &ldquo;death, permanent, serious disfigurement or permanent serious impairment of an important bodily function caused by continuing injury which is physical in nature.</P>
    <P>The Ontario motorist's protection plan also introduces a new approach to vehicle damage.  It states:</P>
    <P>Under the new plan you will recover to the extent that you are not at fault for damage to your automobile and its contents from your own insurance company.  For example, if you are 75 per cent at fault for the accident you would receive 25 per cent of your loss. If you have purchased optional collision coverage it will make up the other 75 per cent for which you were at fault.</P>
    <P>I will read a conclusion from this long document.</P>
    <P>The new system is the Government's response to public concern that car insurance in Ontario was becoming too expensive.  The new plan should help to stabilise costs and premia.</P>
    <P>I wish the same concern was shown in Ireland.  It is unacceptable that we should be paying two and three times as much for our insurance as drivers 150 miles from here.  It is even more unacceptable to me that if we buy our insurance 100 miles from here we are not allowed to use it to drive our cars in this part of the country.  That shows much more concern for the companies than for the consumers. I hope the Government will do <Col N="64" /> something in the near future to solve this difficult problem.  It is difficult for all of us, but particularly for those young people who are already having enough difficulty finding work but having got a job are unable to pay the insurance on a car to get them to the job.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Raftery's motion.  I live only 40 miles from Northern Ireland where insurance is only one-third what it is here.  That is inexplicable to constituents.  I had a case last week of a young man of 22 years whose father had 23 years insurance cover with an insurance company with only one claim for £4,000.  The young man had a five year old diesel Toyota car valued at £6,000, and after a long hassle the principal insurance company here agreed to give him insurance cover for third party, covering only himself, for £2,580. That is a shame and a scandal.  I do not want to name the people involved but I can give the Minister the details.  I agree with Senator Raftery that there should be a standard rate paid to people who lose an eye or a limb; it should not be left to the discretion of the courts.  That would tackle some of the problems insurance companies are facing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to inform both Senators Raftery and Cassidy, and the House, of what the Minister for Industry and Commerce has said in the Dáil on numerous occasions over recent months, in that, as the insurance supervisory authority he has a responsibility to ensure that insurance companies meet their statutory solvency and reserve requirements.  He does not have responsibility for the day-to-day operations of insurance companies.  Therefore, he must respect the right of insurance companies to make their own underwriting decisions in the light of their particular circumstances and assessment of the market.  In the case of motor insurance there is, of course, a legal obligation on <Col N="65" /> all motorists under the Road Traffic Acts to have minimum third party insurance. However, no legal obligation can be placed on any individual insurer to quote in respect of any risk, to quote at any particular premium, or to quote in any particular manner, although I intend to return to this matter later.</P>
      <P>The price of insurance, including employers, public liability and motor insurance, in this country, as indeed in any other market, is directly and substantially dependent on the frequency of claims and the cost of settling those claims.</P>
      <P>In 1988, insurers sustained underwriting losses of £48 million on their motor portfolios and £18 million on their liability accounts.  The corresponding figures for 1989 were £116 million and £30 million, respectively, and losses are expected to be even higher for 1990.  Confronted with losses of this magnitude and in order to maintain their viability, insurers have considered it necessary to increase their premiums in line with their claims experience and-or to exercise more selectivity in the type of risk undertaken.</P>
      <P>The fundamental cause of high insurance prices for all consumers in Ireland is the high claims rate, which, regrettably, is on the increase, allied to the high cost of individual claims which is also rising.  These factors bear on the level of insurance premia quoted to those who seek employers, public liability insurance and also to young drivers as well as those quoted to more mature motorists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is aware that when an insurance company quote in respect of motor risks, in particular, for young people, the premiums may be regarded by those concerned as excessive.  The cost of motor insurance for young drivers, however, tends to reflect the claims experience of motor insurers.  While he sympathises with the situation in which young drivers find themselves, statistical evidence has <Col N="66" /> shown that they are more likely to be involved in accidents and, therefore, to give rise to claims being made.  The cost of these claims can be met by insurers only if a realistic premium is forthcoming to cover the risk involved and one cannot expect the cost of insurance to come down or even stabilise when the number of claims and the cost of settling those claims are going in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has, for some time past, been most concerned at the high cost of motor insurance and active in seeking ways of achieving reductions.  In essence, Irish society as a whole has two options with regard to insurance.  We can accept the relatively high levels of risks that exist at present which can only result in relatively high prices for insurance.  On the other hand &mdash; and this is the course which I hope we will take &mdash; the level of risk can be reduced which, in turn, should see significant improvements with regard to the price and the availability of insurance. To this end an interministerial group, comprising of the Ministers for Industry and Commerce, Justice, Environment, the Attorney General, are at present examining ways and means of improving the environment for motor insurance in particular.  This group are focusing on strict and sustained enforcement of existing road traffic legislation, amendments to the Road Traffic Acts designed to reduce the motor accident rate, suggestions to improve the cost and availability of motor insurance and improvements/alternatives to the courts system for the resolution of personal injury claims.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that this may result in a number of positive proposals which can be implemented in the very early future. I would add, however, that Government action of itself will not reduce or stabilise motor insurance costs.  Consumers must play their part by increased awareness of the need for safety.</P>
    <P>In relation to the quotation of premia, as Senators are aware there is in existence <Col N="67" /> a declined cases agreement.  An agreement exists with the insurance industry for dealing with cases of inability to obtain motor insurance through a body called the Declined Cases Committee. This committee, established under the declined cases agreement, are comprised of representatives of the authorised motor insurance companies.  They examine cases which have been declined by five or more motor insurance companies and nominate one of the companies to quote for the risk involved.  Before a case can be submitted to this committee for consideration it is necessary to approach and obtain written refusals from five motor insurance companies.  Those should then be forwarded to the Declined Cases Committee, Irish Insurance Federation, Russell House, Russell Court, Stephen's Green, indicating the order in which they were approached, together with details of previous insurance, if any, held in the last three years.  It should then be possible to have the necessary cover arranged and thus ensure that all motorists can comply with their legal obligation to have motor insurance.</P>
    <P>Senator Raftery mentioned derogation in relation to insurance which under EC regulations was obtained and is in operation. That matter is being reviewed by the Government and by the Department of Industry and Commerce with a view to <Col N="68" /> having it changed, if necessary, to bring about more competition.  At the end of the day, Ireland is not the most attractive location for insurance companies because of the high claim risk experienced here, the awards which have been granted to individuals and the claims which have been submitted by individuals through the courts to insurance companies.  That is causing us great concern and is why the Government decided to set up the ministerial committee which are now reviewing and bringing forward new legislation or amendment, if necessary, to existing legislation to enforce it.  They will also bring in new regulations to try to bring down the cost of insurance and allow young people to obtain insurance.</P>
    <P>It is a complicated issue and I would like to thank Senator Raftery for putting down the motion to give us an opportunity to focus our attention on this issue and to report to the House the concern of the Government and our Department in this regard.  My colleague, Minister O'Malley, has spoken on many occasions on this issue and I am hopeful the ministerial sub-committee of the Cabinet which was established will bring about changes which will be of assistance.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 23 May 1991.</P>
