      <P>I have notice from Senator Neville that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to designate Foynes harbour as a commercial seaport under the EC operational programme on peripherality, roads and other transport infrastructure.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Neville as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>In the knowledge that I understand Item No. 13, Motion No. 51, has been ruled by you as being out of order in its present format, the Order of Business for today is as follows: Item No. 2 which deals with the annual report of the Ombudsman; a sos from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. and from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. we will complete all Stages of the Adoption Bill, 1990.</P>

      <P>I would like to put on the record my party's regret at the ruling on <Col N="1866" /> the Independent's motion this evening as a lot needs to be said about this vital area and we feel that the House has been denied the opportunity of having the record set straight. We look forward to further in that regard from the Independents themselves.</P>
      <P>I would like to request, through you, Sir, the Leader of the House to give the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, the opportunity of putting on the record of this House his and indeed the Government's response to the allegations of impropriety in a section of our vital beef industry that were made in the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme on Monday night. We all know in this House the seriousness of those allegations. We all know the need to put the matter straight and I ask the Leader of the House that in the next day or two, or perhaps even this evening if there is a gap of a couple of hours in our schedule, that the Government's views be given. The allegations may be substantiated or otherwise, but at least let us have the facts; let us clear the air and move forward from there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to propose that motion No. 51 be added to the Order of Business. I am sure Members are curious as to why it is not being ordered for 6.30 p.m. as expected. As the House will probably know, it is my turn to propose a motion and the motion I put down is motion No. 51. In what is a very rare decision, you, a Chathaoirligh, have ruled it out of order. As far as I understand, one has to go back to 1965 to find a Cathaoirleach ruling a tabled motion out of order under Standing Orders&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before you go down that road I want to point out that I have made my ruling on the matter and, while I have allowed you a few moments to give expression to a view you hold, I have to remind you at this stage that I have made my ruling on the matter. There are other methods by which you can pursue it. I would be glad to offer you an opportunity to discuss the matter with me in my <Col N="1867" /> office after the conclusion of the Order of Business, but I will not allow further discussion on it at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is, I suggest, such a rare decision that I think I am perfectly entitled to explain why&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will again point out to you that you have no entitlement whatsoever. I have made my ruling on the matter. The motion is out of order because it is repetitious and for that reason I have disallowed it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the Senator is entitled, I presume, to propose an amendment to the Order of Business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is not entitled to propose an amendment to the Order of Business. Senator O'Toole has stated something that is not correct. I want to make a response to you that will put you in the picture as to the correct procedure. The motion has been ruled out of order and you cannot at this time propose that the Order of Business be amended to allow it to be admitted on the grounds that it has been ruled out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Your interpretation is so obviously untenable that I think the House should be informed as to the reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained the reason. It is repetitious. It is as simple as that. There was a precedent back in 1965.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Talking about roads and houses last week is not the same thing as talking about the Irish language and the Gaeltacht. It cannot possibly be repetitious.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is a thing that <Col N="1868" /> Senator Murphy wants to get into a confrontational situation with the Chair, he may proceed with that; but the Chair will have to make a further ruling if the Senator persists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made my ruling. I have gone as far as I am prepared to go at this time. The Senator cannot question the Chair's ruling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of being disorderly. There are items on the Order Paper to which I want to contribute and I do not want to incur that kind of censure. All I am looking for is a small degree of latitude to explain why I think the Chair's ruling is untenable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Murphy must know at this stage &mdash; he is a very experienced Member of this House &mdash; that Standing Orders preclude him from questioning a ruling of the Chair. Obviously, the Senator must be reminded of that on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Chair's ruling is notoriously partisan.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>My ruling is correct and the Senator is now questioning it again. I am again asking the Senator to resume his seat and, failing that, I will have to take other steps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do so under great protest. I think your ruling is appallingly partisan. You, a Chathaoirligh, have abused the Chair.</P>

      <P>A number of Senators, including Senator Doyle, requested a debate on the beef industry which I will seriously contemplate and will ask the Whips to have a discussion on it this evening with a view to doing something positive in that regard. Senator Murphy's position has been explained.</P>
      <P>Senator Upton also raised a question on the beef industry. Senator McGowan asked a question not appropriate to the Order of Business but he certainly raised the serious matter of gifts being confiscated by the Customs and Excise people from Irish soldiers. I share the Senator's concern in this matter. It is deplorable that gifts were taken from Irish troops returning from Lebanon. I understand that one of the gifts was a gold chain and a United Nations medal which was a gift made to each member of the Irish army. It is wrong and Senator McGowan has my assurance that I will take it up with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Senator Cosgrave's query about the Local Government Bill, appropriate time will be given to it and there will be discussions with the Whips on that matter. Senator Lanigan asked about <Col N="1878" /> postering at local elections which is a matter for the local political groupings. Senator Hourigan asked questions on the beef industry. Senator Bryne asked for a debate on agriculture. There is no plan for one at present; we had a debate before Easter and perhaps in the future we will have another. I accept it is an important issue and I will examine it again. Senator Howard asked about a Competition Bill which I understand is in the other House. As soon as it is finished there we will have it and I will keep him informed on the matter. Senator O'Toole and Senator Ó Foighil raised another matter. I do not want to reopen the issue but the Cathaoirleach made a very reasonable offer to Senator Murphy and to the Independents in this regard that they meet with him so that an amended form of the motion might be prepared.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report of the Ombudsman and I am delighted to welcome a report for 1990 so early in the year. We get many reports from various bodies such as those from the European Community which are so much out of date that they are irrelevant to the business in hand. We have not yet debated the second six monthly report of the European Community dated August 1989.</P>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Ombudsman on the tremendous amount of work done by him during 1990 and also to commend his staff for the manner in which they handled the complaints made to the office during that period. It appears that because of the setting up of the office of Ombudsman complaints do not seem to be increasing at the rate one would imagine they should. The report states that approximately 3,000 complaints are made to the office of the Ombudsman every year. When one considers the number of transactions through Government offices, semi-State boards, health boards and local authorities it is extraordinary that only 3,000 people put their cases before the Ombudsman. It is equally unbelievable that so few cases merit being sent to the Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare carry out approximately 40 million transactions every year. The total number of complaints received by the Ombudsman in 1990, or carried forward from 1989, was 4,310. When one considers that there were 40 million transactions in 1990 and that there were only 3,000 with a carry forward of 1,310 from 1989, it seems as if that Department are carrying out their job in accordance with the wishes of the people; 137 cases relating to the Department of Social Welfare were carried forward from 1989 and in 1990 they received 675. They finalised 734, therefore, there is a carry forward of only 78 to this year. The cases settled for the complaints in 1990 by the Ombudsman were 113 and for the Department, 237. Clients were helped to get other benefits in 351 cases, two cases were dropped and the Ombudsman saw no merit in 31 claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his report, the Ombudsman mentioned expressly that he is getting more and more co-operation from various Departments and this is to be welcomed. When the Ombudsman's office was first set up there was a fear in many Departments that it would be an anti-Civil Service office and that it was set up to express dissatisfaction with the operation of various Departments. Obviously, this is not the case. I am disappointed that in his report this year the Ombudsman mentions that there are still some authorities who feel they are being got at by the <Col N="1881" /> Ombudsman and that claimants who go to the Ombudsman are just trying to jump queues. However, this is patently not true when one reads the statistics.</P>
    <P>The report should be studied by everybody in the public service who deals with the public because it covers in detail various investigations in to Telecom Éireann, the health boards, the Department of Social Welfare and An Post. The report goes into the details of certain cases and shows the complexities involved in dealing with some issues. Students of the public service should read the report as it would give them a better insight into the complexity of the cases that can come before the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>There are statistics in the report which should be addressed by people other than public servants. On page 7 it states that there were 2,727 complaints received within his jurisdiction. There were 1,111 direct complaints about civil servants, 282 about local authorities, 249 about health boards, 1,032 about Telecom Éireann and 53 about An Post. Many people would have thought that when the new semi-State bodies of Telecom Éireann and An Post were established the number of complaints would drop as the staff were no longer civil servants but the statistics show that the figure for Telecom Éireann and An Post and that for the Civil Service is almost equal.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the office of Ombudsman has given strength in certain Departments to the belief that appeals offices and areas where the public can make complaints should not be forgotten. I am glad the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, has opened a new social welfare appeals office in D'Olier House in Dublin. This is a major development in the public service as it gives the public direct access to an appeals office where their complaints can be dealt with in private. This is to be commended because too often people with social welfare or tax problems have them dealt with in full view and in full hearing of other members of the public, something which should not happen. The fact that the social welfare appeals office will act independently of the social welfare office is an indication <Col N="1882" /> that the Department of Social Welfare are serious about trying to build up the confidence of the public.</P>
    <P>I am glad that other institutions are now beginning to realise that an Ombudsman is a necessary adjunct to many sectors of Irish life and recently two new offices for the Ombudsman have been set up. One office is being set up &mdash; I do not know if it is operational yet &mdash; for the insurance industry and one for financial institutions. Anybody dealing with either insurance companies or financial institutions will realise that there is just as much need for an office of Ombudsman in those areas as there is in the public service. Instead of having a number of separate Ombudsmen dealing with various problems &mdash; financial, insurance, tax or whatever &mdash; perhaps it might be better if the office of Ombudsman was extended to deal with all those cases. The insurance Ombudsman's office is being set up by the insurance industry and the Ombudsman's office for financial institutions is being set up by the financial institutions. Unfortunately, all the financial institutions will not be involved, therefore, a full range of services will not be available to the public. Nevertheless, I am glad that those new offices are being set up.</P>
    <P>The office of Ombudsman in the past was treated with a certain amount of disdain by public servants. However, they now realise that the Ombudsman is there not to hinder the work of the public service but to ensure that the public have their problems, which arise from the operation of the public service, dealt with to the full legal limits.</P>
    <P>I will not detain the House any longer. I again compliment the Ombudsman and his staff. I am glad he found his visits to offices around the country to be of importance and that with sufficient finance, time and staff, he will be able to visit more areas in the coming year. This is an excellent report and it is very welcome. I am also glad it is before the House so soon after its publication.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the report and commend the Ombudsman, Mr. Michael Mills, and has staff for an <Col N="1883" /> excellent job and for the time limit within which the report has come to us. It is seven years since the office of the Ombudsman opened its doors for the first time and the response from the general public has been enormous and very welcoming. As a nation, though we are small, our system of government and local government because of the nature of funding through block grants and so on from the Exchequer is centralised to a large extent. The power is held centrally and there is, perhaps, a tendency on the part of the Irish public to be a little reticent in filing complaints. We do not crib about a bad meal in a restaurant, a shoddy piece of merchandise or a faulty car. Perhaps that is because we rub shoulders with so many people in the community whom we know. We are shy about raising complaints, unlike our European neighbours, particularly the British, who are extremely insistent on getting value for money and ensuring that they have access to their services.</P>
      <P>It appears from the nature of complaints in the report that perhaps we feel incompetent in making our complaints because we are unable to put them succinctly on paper, or because we cannot communciate by telephone to the bodies involved. There is that characteristic in the Irish that we feel guilty about making a complaint. It is really only now that we are beginning to take responsibility for ourselves in realising that it is our duty, if we feel we are not getting service, to ensure that we get it.</P>
      <P>The role of the Ombudsman is extremely welcome. The power of the Ombudsman to solve people's problems, as seen in the 1989 and 1990 reports, is enormous considering the resources available to him. Although we do not have enough resources for any area in our society I am surprised at the level of success of this office given the complexities particularly of the social welfare system and various other Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The office of Ombudsman was established in 1983. Prior to that no agency had the power to receive, obtain or seek documentation or information in regard <Col N="1884" /> to complaints. Public representatives, both at local and national level are the vehicles though which the general public have filed complaints up to now. I do not know why there should have been any resistence from public representative at either local or national level as we do not have access to the relevant documentation. We should view the Ombudsman and his staff as a complementary role to our ourselves as they certainly take a great deal of the burden from us. There is absolutely no way that we as public representatives would have the time or the resources to go through the tangle of intricacies surrounding many of our Departments. It is right that the files of Government Departments and public bodies should be open to scrutiny by an independent office and that unresolved complaints over the years were found to be justified and settled.</P>
    <P>When the office first opened its doors Mr. Mills said that if a person was entitled to a benefit of one kind or another and had failed to obtain it through administrative error, the office of the Ombudsman would ensure that benefit was obtained. At that time, and Senator Lanigan also mentioned this, Mr. Mills instanced resistance he encountered from public bodies. However, he stuck to his guns and even though he is a conciliatory person and neither he nor his office would ever seek confrontation with public officials he has constantly shown he has the courage to pursue and resolve any reasonable case, notwithstanding objections from officials. He obviously welcomes the goodwill and support he has received from the public service and public representatives.</P>
    <P>The teething problems experienced by the office during the first six years of its existence were enormous. Obviously, the progress was going to be difficult because there was a backlog of complaints and the office was set up at a time of financial cutbacks and severe reductions of his investigative staff. However, over the seven year period the public have come to realise the assistance the office of <Col N="1885" /> Ombudsman can give them. It is interesting to note that there are Ombudspersons &mdash; which is, perhaps, what we should be calling Mr. Mills &mdash; in more than 40 countries at present.</P>
    <P>I believe that more resources should be given to regional visits; we would welcome decentralisation of the office. The Ombudsman will pay a visit to Limerick in two weeks' time. I hope there will not be a large number of complaints but I am sure the people will be aware he is coming to the area. I presume that the feedback from his visits to Sligo, Waterford, Wexford, Tralee, Cavan and Dundalk will be of benefit to us all.</P>
    <P>The report states that during 1990, 265 people called to his temporary offices; obviously the news is filtering through. The people who went to the regional offices did so because they may have had doubts about their ability to make a complaint in writing or over the telephone and, also, because of the difficulty and expense of travelling to Dublin. All school children, particularly at second level, should be aware of this office. In the course of their English lessons they should be taught how to set out their complaints and given examples of case studies. It should be part of the school curriculum.</P>
    <P>If people felt assured that they could take responsibility for themselves and communicate their problems there would not be as great a need for the office of Ombudsman but, having said that, I do not wish the role of the Ombudsman to be ruled out completely. The Ombudsman could deal with extremely difficult complaints that are beyond the capacity of people to solve themselves. Today I heard of his intended visit to Limerick but I did not realise it was in a fortnight's time and I have not seen any newspaper coverage of this visit. Local newspapers should carry such news items well in advance. Perhaps there is a need for more resources to create a public awareness of those visits.</P>
    <P>Reference has already been made and we have only to look at the excellent graphics on pages eight and nine of the report &mdash; to the number of complaints <Col N="1886" /> received. It is interesting to note, particularly with the controversial discussions over the past few months, that there have been only 75 complaints in relation to An Post. That should be an indication that An Post have a very good record of dealing with complaints. They do not have many problems when one compares 75 complaints to 2,052 in relation to Telecom Éireann, 399 for local authorities and 374 for health boards. Local authorities or health boards should not have any cause for complaint if we had a true local democracy with decentralisation in local areas. One would imagine that people should have access to their local authorities and health boards and, therefore, not really have any complaints at all. I am sure we will be debating this on the Local Government Bill but do we understand local democracy? Do we have local democracy and is it accessible to the people? This will be a big issue running in the local elections because people are dissatisfied with the lack of local input into their local authorities.</P>
    <P>The anomalies in the social welfare system were thrashed out when we were debating the Bill and in all the reports of the Commission on Social Welfare. I will not go into that now because it would be too complex. Certainly, those anomalies should be removed in the operation of certain aspects of the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>I will deal with one issue which got media coverage prior to this. This is very important, particularly as when we will be debating the Adoption Bill later; it relates to the lack of provision for adoptive mothers. We know there are not enough babies here for parents who wish to adopt. This was evidenced by the steady stream to Romania by Irish parents who wished to adopt children. There is discrimination against some people as there is no provision for adoptive mothers in the area of leave from work, social welfare payments and social insurance credits. It is extraordinary that it was the Ombudsman who highlighted this. I would have imagined that we, as public representatives, should have been very much aware of it. Certainly, there should be a strong lobby to assist Mr. Mills in <Col N="1887" /> this because he states that the bodies are acting within the law but that consideration should be given to the statutory provision of adoption leave and adoption benefit, including the granting of social insurance credits in the case of adoptive mothers.</P>
    <P>The complainant was a married woman with whom a child had recently been placed for adoption. She was in employment and we know that some years ago if a woman who was interested in adopting was employed she was prevented from doing so. That is no longer the case but it is extraordinary that this anomaly is still there. Obviously, there is no difference between the care a mother gives to an adopted child and her own.</P>

      <P>I am reluctant to interrupt the Senator but I am sure she will agree she is straying somewhat into the area of social welfare rather than dealing with the report. I appreciate that the Senator is referring to a specific item in the report but she has made her point in relation to that. I respectfully suggest that she may have an opportunity in another debate to elaborate on that very worthwhile contribution.</P>

      <P>Yes, but I am sure the Senator will appreciate that while it is a major issue, at present we are addressing the report of the Ombudsman in total. I accept the Senator has been making a passing reference but I have given sufficient latitude specifically on the case she has raised. Perhaps the Senator could take the opportunity at some future time of raising the issue that has been brought to the attention of the House? I am reluctant to have to interrupt the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have liked if <Col N="1888" /> you had been more reluctant to interrupt me because I consider that if it is left to the annual report of the Ombudsman to raise this matter it is a reflection on all of us. If I had to spend the 20 minutes debating this I would consider my time well spent. More than likely it may not be taken up by others but at least I have made my point. It is not something the Ombudsman can resolve; it is, as he states here, statutory provision of adoption leave and adoption benefit and it can be taken up again.</P>
      <P>The most vulnerable people in society are using the services of the Ombudsman and I can understand the reason. They may be vulnerable in relation to putting pen to paper as I have noticed that they are in the old age category. I have noted references to deserted wives and I am very saddened by this. I would have felt that we have the reputation as a nation of being extremely respectful towards our own people and towards the vulnerable people in our society. Right through the 1990 report and the previous one, it is clear that the people who appealed to the Ombudsman are in great need. They are looking for grants for disabled persons and are finding anomalies there. I mentioned the case of deserted wives and also the matter of disabled person's maintenance allowance. Complaints in relation to Telecom Éireann deal with telephone accounts and so on. There are references to widows' pensions, arrears of old age pension, arrears of retirement pension, pension increases, review of insurance of employment 25 years earlier, the case of a deserted wife being unable for the third time to prove desertion. This is a list of the most vulnerable people of our society and it saddens me that they have to resort to the Ombudsman. I am glad that he and his very hardworking staff raise those issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Department of Education, higher education grants and the difficulties and anomalies associated with them are the contentious issues. There are complaints about unsuitable local authority housing, water supplies, refusal of a disabled person's grant, hardship <Col N="1889" /> cases and calls for recoupment of overpayment of disabled person's maintenance allowance from a handicapped woman and so on. We should ask ourselves whether there is something wrong with our system where the most deserving people of our community who have worked so hard during their lifetimes, seem to have to fight for their benefits. I hope the 1991 report will show a reduction in complaints from those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this report. When the Ombudsman was first talked about I thought it would be just another unnecessary layer of bureaucracy. I extend a hearty congratulations to the Ombudsman. I welcome the report for two reasons. First, it is neat, concise and readable. Very often we receive reports which are so long-winded that one would need back-up services to interpret them. This report is in very simple form and is readable all the way through. I congratulate Michael Mills and his staff in that regard.</P>
      <P>The report vindicates public representatives at local and national level. Deputies were often accused by the media and others of wasting time putting unnecessary questions to Ministers in the Dáil. When one sees that 41 per cent of the complaints refer to the Civil Service it clearly vindicates the point that there was a need for us to make representations on behalf of those people, putting the case in a fair and humanitarian manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirty-eight per cent of the complaints refer to Telecom Éireann, but before dealing with that I pay tribute to our local authorities and health boards. Those two organisations serve the most weak and vulnerable sections of our community. Only 9 per cent of the complaints were against the health boards, and only 10 per cent were against the local authorities. I am very pleased that my own county of Sligo had only two complaints and that Senator Mooney's county also had a low rate of complaint. Only three complaints were made about the health board. That <Col N="1890" /> is a great tribute to the people who work in local authorities, in county councils and health boards despite their being castigated by the media. It proves those bodies are doing their job in a very able and efficient manner and I congratulate them.</P>
    <P>I noticed one very interesting case in education, where a student had been promised a grant. She failed an examination after completing one year, did a repeat and succeeded, but was then told that she would have to undergo a new means test. Eventually the student got the grant. I was pleased, because I had a similar case in Sligo which did not succeed as I did not take it to the Ombudsman. If it was now, we would certainly win it because the case was exactly similar. The council asked the Department for advice because we felt the case was border line. Thank God, this <i>ultra vires</i> rule is to be abolished shortly. Our officials were afraid of being surcharged and had to take the advice from the Department which meant that a student was treated unfairly. This report is a great reference book for politicians. One is likely to find in it something relating to almost any problem.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why we still have so many problems with Bord Telecom and why they are so dictatorial. I have had several problems with Bord Telecom but I have never succeeded in winning. They have set themselves up as infallible. On reading the reports, it is clear that the Ombudsman had a very tough job and had to initiate many interviews to successfully solve cases. Many of those cases need not have been pursued if Bord Telecom had been a little more in touch with their customers. Unfortunately, Bord Telecom treat all their customers by remote control.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the remit of the Ombudsman is not widened to include CIE and the ESB. There would be few complaints about the ESB because they work with their customers. If accounts are not paid, they send a man out to collect them. The ESB know their customers. There is a link between both parties, but unfortunately this does not <Col N="1891" /> exist between Bord Telecom and their customers. If a bill is not paid, the customer is disconnected. Those who were reconnected had to pay up to £4,000 or more in back payments. It is a pity they did not claim for loss of income and inconvenience during the period of disconnection.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a more humanitarian approach by Bord Telecom. We have many complaints about them because they do not treat their customers in a personal way. It is all done in a very autocratic manner and it is one reason so many complaints are made to the Ombudsman. Perhaps Bord Telecom will listen to sense, realise the folly of their ways and start talking to their customers.</P>
    <P>I was also interested in another case where somebody living outside the State found on return that the customs would not accept that he had owned the car for six months. There are many cases like this which I hope will be highlighted. I know of people who came into the State with cars and who had to pay duty even though they had owned their car for six months. What could they do? They either had to leave the car or pay up. I am glad the Ombudsman has solved this problem which crops up very often in my part of the country, being so near the Border. It is also common in the west where many emigrants are away for the regulation time, and then return. If anyone feels he has been surcharged unfairly by the customs, even at this late stage, he should take it up with the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why Bord Telecom like the ESB cannot install meters in people's houses. We are totally dependent on somebody reading the meter. A customer cannot see for himself or herself how the system works. Customers get a bill; it is a <i>fait accompli.</i> Customers must pay up or risk being disconnected. Surely, technology should have reached the stage whereby meters could be installed in people's homes, so that they could read their meter, see it being read and have some control over what is happening? Unfortunately this is not the case.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report. It will be a great <Col N="1892" /> help to all politicians who may have to make a case for people who have been wronged. I am quite satisfied the Ombudsman has done a good job and I wish him well in continuing the good work. The report is efficient, easily read and yet it has great detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report of the Ombudsman. Despite some reservations and observations on the behaviour of corporations, agencies and so on, made by previous speakers, all public representatives should be very pleased that there is an Ombudsman with an office and staff, who has, over the past seven years, without fear or favour, dealt with and solved many difficult and complex problems. The Ombudsman must often, with tact and understanding deal with people in order not to antagonise or influence them. We should be very grateful for this because, as public representatives, we run into many procedural difficulties with Government Departments and we cannot deal effectively with cases which require the fullest possible re-examination. We all suffered procedural frustrations before the setting up of the Ombudsman's office.</P>
      <P>The effectiveness of the office shines through, not only because of its success rate, but because they only push a case if <i>prima facie</i> evidence exists. Evidence of the need for this type of investigative procedure is there in abundance in the report. On the basis of that evidence I welcome the idea of the Ombudsman and what he stands for. Irrespective of which Government are in office we should all ensure that the Ombudsmen's office will never again suffer from lack of resources, particularly with regard to the staffing of the office. I say this not to knock anybody with regard to cutbacks but because, if democracy is not to be eroded, citizens need a fall-back position when they become frustrated in trying to deal with bureaucracy. They must have this facility available to them at a time when normal procedures for dealing with problems have failed them or appear to have been exhausted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public representatives must see to it <Col N="1893" /> that the backlog of matters causing serious concern which may deny individual rights is eliminated. This is an essential service which has revealed that there are a lot of grievances of a peculiar nature which cannot be dealt with through the normal processes. These problems seem to be growing, and they need attention. It is the essence of democracy that a citizen can have access to the Ombudsman's office. Democracy does not work for the individual citizen if every possible means of having his grievance thoroughly examined is not available to him.</P>
    <P>The report clearly shows that a substantial number of cases dealt with by the Ombudsman's office could not be resolved. That is understandable as the Ombudsman's office have their difficulties as well. In the overall context, it has been a very successful seven years, because many of the problems dealt with by the Ombudsman's office could not have been satisfactorily resolved by public representatives acting in their own right.</P>
    <P>All the evidence is there to convince us that not only must we support the work undertaken and the results achieved by this office, but we must also ensure that it is allowed to develop its competence to deal with the ever-growing range of complaints. I welcome the idea of regional visits on an ongoing basis. For many reasons many people do not have easy access to an office in Dublin. This represents to some extent, a decentralisation of the office and that will always be welcomed.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on me, on behalf of the Labour Party, not only to congratulate the Ombudsman office on their report and on the way it is set out, but to them for their work in the past seven years. The Ombudsman deserves a special word of appreciation for the leadership and dedication he has displayed since taking up office. He is the first Ombudsman appointed and he had to deal with the difficulties that that entailed. The Ombudsman with his staff, despite many difficulties, has put in place a system that is an example of how fair play and justice <Col N="1894" /> can and should be pursued. This work lays a good foundation for any successor in the future. The first Ombudsman has done the groundwork; he has given leadership and encouragement without antagonising Government Departments or public representatives, who in the early stages were a little bit resentful that an Ombudsman's office would take on problems that they might have dealt with. When public representative realised that cases in which they had been unsuccessful could be fully explored through this office on the basis of <i>prima facie</i> evidence, their resentment evaporated. The office helped public representatives in their work and did not hinder them in any way.</P>
    <P>Departments might have been resentful at first when the Ombudsman took up problems with them. It is a bit difficult to ask a Department to re-examine a decision, but that has been done very successfully. The Ombudsman's office deserve great credit for that. It is something that all public representatives should applaud. Public representatives should defend the resources of this office, because every citizen has the right to act in his own interests, right up to the highest level possible. When one is frustrated by all the bureaucracy that one can encounter from time to time, this office is available.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that imaginary grievances should be entertained. The Ombudsman quickly rejects any such grievances. I welcome the report which speaks for itself. We could nearly pass it without discussing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On reading the report, I found it rather interesting that there were certain coded words and phrases being used by the Ombudsman to indicate to those who read this report that the office of the Ombudsman, in the personage of the very affable Michael Mills, is the iron hand in the velvet glove, in the sense that while Mr. Mills is a very personable and affable gentleman his powers are far reaching and they have reached very far into various Government bodies. In the context of the coded statements and words, I hope I am not doing Mr. Mills <Col N="1895" /> an injustice in interpreting the reports in that way, but having listened to him on a very entertaining and informative radio interview, following the publication of the report, I think I can understand to some degree, the nuance of what he was saying then and what he has written here. For example, he says the original intention of the Houses of the Oireachtas in setting up the office of Ombudsman was to solve difficulties that public representatives could not resolve under existing procedures, and that the recognition of the restrictive nature of public representatives work led to the establishment of a similar office in more than 40 countries around the world. He says:</P>
      <P>The only reason the Office of the Ombudsman is in a position to resolve complaints is because the Members of the Dáil and Seanad gave the Office powers which the members themselves do not have... With these powers every justified complaint can be remedied.</P>
      <P>He says also:</P>
      <P>In some cases had my request for a genuine review of the case on the basis of the evidence presented being accepted, the need for an investigation with its attendant findings and recommendations would never have arisen.</P>
      <P>Let us take that with the following comment he made in his introduction:</P>
      <P>It is a matter for regret that more careful attention is not given, at times, by public bodies to the suggestions by my Office, that, in the light of the evidence presented, they should carry out a genuine review of a case... [and in the same context] ... The attitude of a small number of public bodies, who regard the Office of the Ombudsman as making representations on behalf of complainants, continues to be a matter for concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ombudsman obviously feels this is a problem. It might be interesting to see if in his report to the House next year this perceived attitude of reluctance among <Col N="1896" /> certain public bodies and the officials working in them has improved.</P>
    <P>Like Members on both sides of the House, I welcome the decision of the Ombudsman to continue his series of &ldquo;getting to know you&rdquo; visits around Ireland. He mentioned in his report that he intends visiting Cork, Leitrim, Donegal, Limerick, and Ennis in the earlier part of the year. To the best of my knowledge, he has not reached County Leitrim yet. Indeed, in one of those radio interviews to which I alluded earlier, Mr. Mills commented that the smallest number of complaints were received from County Leitrim. I am not sure whether that is due to the intelligence of the people of County Leitrim or to the activities of its public representatives, or whether the people do not have complaints that need to be channelled through the Ombudsman's office. As Mr. Mills said, it is an interesting question. Until very recently, I had not used the office of the Ombudsman for queries and representations I received from members of the public. Having listened to Mr. Mills within the last week to ten days, I have remedied that and he now has a number of representations from County Leitrim on his desk. I hope he will be able to solve them in his usual efficient manner.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell commented that Sligo County Council had a very low rate of attrition, if that is the right word to use, and they have indeed. I was pleasantly surprised to note in the statistics the Ombudsman's report gives, that throughout the year under review he received no complaints at all in relation to County Leitrim. It must be a tribute to the efficiency of the Leitrim County Council officials at all levels that not one complaint was issued to the Ombudsman's office not only this year but in 1989. Long may it continue.</P>
    <P>In going through the statistics, in relation to local authorities, I was again pleasantly surprised to find that the Ombudsman had been responsible to a large degree for the improvements in the licensing arrangements for motor vehicles. As Senator Farrell quite correctly pointed out, the report is a gem in <Col N="1897" /> terms of the information it provides for public representatives and like my colleague, I will be using it as a reference over the coming years.</P>
    <P>The question of motor registration now seems to be something that has been consigned to the dim and distant past but at the time the Department of Finance relaxed the laws in relation to the importation of vehicles as a result of our membership of the European Community, an increasing number of vehicles were legally imported into the State and the secondhand car market, and ultimately the consumer, was finding some difficulty in establishing whether these cars were registered in the year stated on the licence plate or if they had been registered many years previously. Sadly, the case was that an increasing number were given a new number when the car had been on the road for some considerable time. It is interesting that the Ombudsman under the heading &ldquo;Local Authorities&rdquo;, says that his office were active in ensuring changes for the better in that area. The ordinary consumer, and I place myself in that category for the purposes of the argument, would not have known that the Ombudsman's office had been responsible for that matter.</P>
    <P>All Members of the House have made references to the fact that Telecom Éireann comes out on top in the Ombudsman's report. The report speaks for itself on that company. Senator Farrell made a contribution with which all of us could agree in relation to Telecom. Let us hope that by this time next year we will see a dramatic reduction in the number of cases referred to the Ombudsman on that subject.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in the Revenue Commissioners. If the truth were told, everybody in the country is interested in the activities of the Revenue Commissioners because they impact on our lives to such an extraordinary degree. Looking at the statistics on a year-to-year basis, it was interesting to see that the largest single increase in complaints to the Ombudsman's office was on matters which come under the ambit of the Revenue Commissioners. I was a little <Col N="1898" /> disappointed therefore, that Mr. Mills in giving his examples under the heading seemed limited somewhat in the two items he included, one on the refusal to grant exemption from stamp duty, which is to do with housing, and the other a refusal to allow duty-free importation of a vehicle. It would seem to me there was an interesting chapter all of its own on the sort of complaints which the Ombudsman's office had received and on which they had been requested to negotiate a solution with the Revenue Commissioners. I say &ldquo;interesting&rdquo;, because in reading the headings of the items which the Ombudsman cannot investigate, it throws up one where there is a right of appeal to an independent tribunal or appeal bodies such as the appeals commissioner of income tax. One wonders what it was, that the people concerned, some 243 of them, had written to the Ombudsman about, if it was not to do with income tax.</P>
    <P>As someone who comes from a Border county, and Senator Farrell will be familiar with this as he comes from Sligo, I know that the question of vehicle importation has been something of a <i>cause célèbre</i> in our area for the past number of years, especially since the relaxation of importation laws as a result of our continuing development towards the completion of the Single Market. I would have liked to have seen more evidence of whether many of the cases the Ombudsman was dealing with were to do with car importation. I am talking about people who are living in the South and working in the North or people who come from the North and have moved to the South temporarily. It is a very confused area.</P>
    <P>In the context of the completion of the Single European Market at the beginning of 1993 I am awaiting with great interest to see how it is going to affect residents caught up in this bureaucratic tangle. I have some sympathy with the Revenue Commissioners in attempting to interpret the law as it is currently constituted and as it will presumably be constituted in the future. I am not sure whether it is within <Col N="1899" /> the Minister's brief to make any reference to this &mdash; although the Ombudsman and his report come within the Department of Finance which, of course, is responsible for the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; and whether we can look to any changes in the law that might necessitate the Ombudsman stating at some future time that he is not receiving all that many requests to investigate complaints about the Revenue Commissioners. Those are the general points I wanted to make in relation to this report.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Ombudsman should follow through with his promise not only to indulge in his meet-the-people visits, but there is also the question of publicity and the publicising of the Ombudsman's office. Again, I am not sure whether this comes under the office itself or whether it is something for which the Department of Finance would be responsible. I am thinking of the most basic publicity &mdash; posters in public offices, for example; that even Members of the Dáil and Seanad and local authority members would be circulated with a short précis of what the Ombudsman's office is all about which they could have in their clinics or in their constituency offices for the benefit of the public.</P>
    <P>It seems to me on the basis of this report &mdash; and the Ombudsman makes reference to it &mdash; that wherever he or his office have had a physical presence on the ground there has been a resultant increase in applications to him. Therefore, the publicity aspect of the Ombudsman's office is something that may have been neglected. The Ombudsman himself, as I said earlier, addresses it to some degree but perhaps this might be something the Department of Finance should address. Perhaps it is a question of funding, but it is something that would be help to all of us. I can only re-echo what speakers on both sides of the House have said, that while there may have been some reluctance and some cynicism about the establishment of the office of Ombudsman some years ago, that has now been eliminated. I, for one &mdash; and I know that this has been echoed on both <Col N="1900" /> sides of the House &mdash; welcome the establishment, the continuing success and the influence of the Office of the Ombudsman in our daily lives.</P>
    <P>As an aside, in looking at the applications for an investigation of An Post there were five that related to television licences. The Ombudsman in his report does not go into any other detail, but when I traced it through the graph I discovered that the five had not been resolved. Three of them had been assisted and two had been solved to some degree, but they had not actually been resolved. I am just wondering why would anybody want to complain about paying their television licence. The problem seems to be that there are people out there who are not paying their television licence and perhaps this is as good a chance as any to encourage them to cough up, to be like the rest of us and to help our friends in RTE to get in a little extra money.</P>
    <P>I welcome this report. I look forward to further reports and opportunities to discuss on an ongoing basis the workings of this most welcome of offices.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh thuairisc an Ombudsman. Is léir ón dtuairisc go bhfuil sárobair déanta aige ó bunaíodh an oifig agus go bhfuil ard-mholadh tuillte ag Michael Mills, an t-ardstiúrthóir, as ucht an tuairisc a chur le chéile agus as ucht an chaoi a ndeachaigh sé i mbun oibre. Tá cur síos leathan déanta aige ann ar réimse mór fadhbanna a bhíonn ag pobal na tíre le institúidí éagsúla.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá an-díomá ormsa agus ar dhaoine eile maidir le gearáin a dhéantar leis an Ombudsman i dtaobh na faillí atá á déanamh ar lucht labhartha na Gaeilge. Dúirt Michael Mills ina thuairisc anuraidh go bhfuil sé de cheart ag gach saoránach a gcuid gnó leis an earnáil phoiblí a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge. Bhí fáth leis an ráiteas sin uaidh agus is deas an dearbhú é ach is beag maitheasa atá ann do lucht labhartha na Gaeilge ná do mhuintir na Gaeltachta nuair a dhéanann siad iarracht a gcuid gnó a dheánamh trí mheán na Gaeilge. Deir Michael Mills freisin gur ceart bunreachtúil atá i gceist anseo, agus <Col N="1901" /> is eol dúinn uilig an t-ómós atá ag dul don Bhunreacht.</P>
    <P>Tá sé ráite sa tuairisc chéanna anuraidh go bhfuil sé de dhualgas ar an earnáil phoiblí socruithe cuí a dhéanamh le go bhféadfaí gnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge. Glactar leis an bprionsabal ach táimid i bhfad uaidh go praiticiúil.</P>
    <P>D'éist mé leis na Seanadoirí eile ag plé na casaoidí éagsúla a bhfuil cur síos déanta orthu sa tuairisc. Ní mór a thuiscint go bhfuil na casaoidí céanna ag pobal na Gaeilge. Deir Michael Mills go bhfuil sé sásta gur féidir dul chun cinn a dhéanamh má ghlactar leis go bhfuil cearta bunúsacha i gceist. Dar liomsa tá rud éigin mór mícheart anseo agus caithfidh an Ombudsman tabhairt faoi seo láithreach. Ní leor a rá go bhfuil an Ghaeilge agus an Béarla ó thaobh aitheantais de ar chomhchéim nó go bhfuil sé seo amhlaidh de réir an Bhunreachta agus is beag, is cosúil, gur féidir leis an Ombudsman a dhéanamh chun é sin a chur ina cheart. Fiú amháin bhí cás achomhairc ann a triaileadh san Ardchúirt agus ba é breithiúnas na cúirte sin ná nár chóir go mbeadh aon mhoill thar an ghnáth ann maidir le lucht labhartha na Gaeilge seirbhís trí Ghaeilge a fháil. Tá glactha leis sin freisin, ach cén mhaith dúinn bheith ag caint faoi rud a bhfuil glactha leis nuair ba cheart dúinn bheith ag caint faoina chur i bhfeidhm.</P>
    <P>Ní raibh faoi bhráid an Ombudsman an mhí seo caite ach scór casaoid ach tá a fhios agam go pearsanta go bhféadfadh na céadta bheith ann in aghaidh an lae. Léiríonn an figiúr seo, scór, easpa muiníne lucht labhartha na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus sa Ghalltacht sa chóras Stáit maidir len a gcearta a thabhairt do dhaoine sna cúrsaí seo. Tá mise, chomh maith le daoine eile, ag plé leis an gceist seo ó lá go chéile, chuile lá den tseachtain agus is é an chasaoid is coitianta a bhí á plé ag an Ombudsman i rith na bliana ná gan foirmeacha i nGaeilge a bheith ar fáil. Tá an fhadhb sin ann ó bunaíodh an Stát, nach dtugtar aon aitheantas san earnáil phoiblí do lucht na Gaeilge mar dá dtabharfaí, bheadh gach cineál foirme ar fáil: foirmeacha cháin ghluaisteáin, faoirmeacha a bhaineann le sláinte, le dlí, <Col N="1902" /> le feirmeoireach agus chuile shórt eile. Ach níl siad ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Tá rud eile ann atá coitianta go maith. Má scríobhann duine litir i nGaeilge chuig aon cheann de na Ranna Stáit, tarlóidh ceann amháin de dhá rud: freagrófar i mBéarla é nó b'fhéidir go mbeidh ar an duine a scríobh fanacht sé mhí sula bhfaigheann sé freagra i nGaeilge. Is feasach do Michael Mills é seo. Ach tá sé cinntithe agamsa, ar chaoi ar bith, nach féidir leis tada a dhéanamh faoi. Mar sin, cén réiteacht atá ag lucht labhartha na Gaeilge chun an neamhchothroime seo a chur in a ceart. Tá an Ombudsman, Michael Mills, ann lena chinntiú go bhfuil an saoránach in ann na cearta atá dlite dó de réir an Bhunreachta a bhaint amach. Sin é an fáth go bhfuil sé ann. Má tá casaoid agat cuireann tú chuig an Ombudsman é agus déaneann sé é a fhiosrú, agus tugann sé freagra duit. Ach tá rud amháin ann nach bhfuil sé in ann a dhéanamh, os rud é nach bhfuil sé ag fáil aon chúnaimh ón Stát, ná na casaoidí ó lucht labhartha na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht nó sa Ghalltacht a réiteach é féin.</P>
    <P>Glacaimis, mar shampla, an tseanbhean nó an seanfhear ón Ghaeltacht, atá ar bheagán Béarla, a théann isteach san ospidéal, níl lucht an ospidéil réigiúnaigh i nGailimh, mar shampla, in ann freastal go cuí ar na seandaoine sin agus níl siad in ann a gcuid dualgas bunreachtúil a chomhlíonadh i leith mhuintir úd na Gaeltachta. Is i mBéarla amháin a labhraítear leo, i mBéarla amháin a líontar foirmeacha dóibh agus a cheistnítear iad faoina sláinte. Mar sin, tá easpa uafásach mór ann ó thaobh na Gaeilge de. Tá eisceacht mhór ann ar mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh dó agus is é sin Telecom Éireann, dream atá le moladh go hard as an tseirbhís a chuireann siad ar fáil do lucht na Gaeilge. Má scríobhann duine i nGaeilge chuig Telecom Éireann bíonn freagra ar ais aige le casadh an phoist. Má tá do chuid billí ag teastáil uait i nGaeilge, gheobhaidh tú é sin, agus gheobhaidh tú duine a labhróidh Gaeilge leat ar an teileafón más mian leat do ghnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Sin an chaoi a bhfeicfinn an Ombudsman ag feidhmiú freisin, lena chinntiú <Col N="1903" /> go bhféadfaimis an tseirbhís ceannann céanna a fháil is atá Telecom Éireann ag cur ar fáil dúinn. Ní rud iontach é sin. Má tá Telecom Éireann in ann é a dhéanamh, cén fáth nach bhféadfadh seirbhisí eile san earnáil phoiblí é a dhéanamh. Tógaimis sampla níos fearr fós, an Roinn Oideachais. Is é an Roinn Oideachais, mar a déarfá, caomhnóir na teanga &mdash; níl aon chaomhnóir ná Aire na Gaeltachta againn, mar a dúirt mé ar maidin. Go bunúsach, ó thaobh na Gaeilge de, mhúineadh na Gaeilge agus chur chun cinn na teanga de, agus chuile shórt a bhaineann leis an Ghaeilge, is cúraimí iad seo a mbíonn an Roinn Oideachais ag plé leo. Bhí am ann go bhféadfaí gnó a dhéanamh i nGaeilge leis an Roinn Oideachais, ach cuirfidh mé geall le Seanadóirí anseo anocht, má labhraíonn siad leis an Roinn Oideachais amárach gur in mBéarla amháin gheobhaidh siad freagra ar an malartán. Déarfaidh na hoifigigh seo leat nach bhfuil aon Ghaeilge acu. Ní féidir leis an gcainteoir Gaeilge a gcuid gnó a dhéanamh trí mheán na Gaeilge, ach is gcorrchás. Ba mhaith liomsa dá bhféadfadh Michael Mills, an bhliain seo chugainn, a intinn a dhíriú ar an gceist seo agus iarrachtaí níos treise agus níos iomláine a dhéanamh lena chinntiú go mbeidh feabhas ar an scéal seo, go mbeidh seirbhís trí Ghaeilge le fáil ón earnáil phoiblí faoin am a thiocfaidh an chéad tuarascáil eile uaidh.</P>
    <P>Leis sin, a Chathaoirligh, ba mhaith liom Michael Mills a mholadh as an tuarascáil seo a chur os ár gcomhair, agus as an mbeagán Gaeilge atá ann; ar a laghad, tugann sé aitheantas don Ghaeilge, ach tugann sé le fios, mura bhfuil tuiscint ag daoine nó mura dtugann siad aitheantas don rud bunreachtúil, gur beag is féidir leis féin a dhéanamh. Ach, b'fhéidir i gcomhar le chéile amach anseo go n-éireoidh linn.</P>

      <P>Ceann de na hathruithe is tábhachtaí, ó thaobh chóras riaracháin an Stáit de, dar cuireadh i bhfeidhm sa tír seo ná oifig an Ombudsman a bhunú. Is iontach an rud é nár leanamar cleachtas na Ríochta Aontaithe, mar is nós linn, <Col N="1904" /> agus an córas á chur i bhfeidhm againn maidir le post an Ombudsman. De réir dlí sa tír sin, ar feadh m'eolais, is éigean gach ceist dá gcuirtear faoi bhráid an Ombudsman teacht ón bhfeisire parlaiminte, agus ní bhíonn teagmháil dhíreach idir an Ombudsman, nó an Parliamentary Commissioner mar a thugtar air, agus an ghnáthphobal. Is feabhas iontach an córas s'againne ar an gcóras sa Bhreatain, mar in Eirinn tá ceangal nó teagmháil iontach idir oifig an Ombudsman agus an ghnáthdhuine.</P>
      <P>Tá a lán rudaí sa tuarascáil seo a raibh fúm iad a phlé, ceann amháin acu an pointe faoin nGaeilge a ndearna an Seanadór Ó Foighil trácht go cruinn baileach air, agus ba mhaith liom tacú leis. Níl sé éasca é a chur i gcrích, ach tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh sé de cheart ag gach éinne sa tír, pé gnó a theastaíonn uaidh nó uaithi a dhéanamh as Gaeilge, go mbeadh áiseanna ann chuige sin. Tá sé deacair a leithéid a eagrú, ach tá mionlach réasúnta mór sa chóras Stáit, sa Státseirbhís agus sna comhlachtaí Stáit a bhfuil Gaeilge maith acu. Ach dá mba rud é gur tuigeadh go raibh de dhualgas ar gach aon eagras a chinntiú go mbeadh seirbhís iomlán i nGaeilge ag gach duine den ghnáthphobal ar mhaith leis Gaeilge a úsáid, bheadh ar na húdaráis phoiblí an córas riaracháin a chur i bhfeidhm a chinnteodh a leithéid. Is ábhar scannail go speisialta é, agus níorbh é an Ombudsman a dúirt é seo, go mbeadh míbhuntáiste de shaghas ar bith ag cur as do mhuintir na Gaeltachta os rud é gurb í an Ghaeilge a ngnáth-theanga labhartha.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá an cuma ar an scéal, agus bunús leis, go bhfuil an córas Stáit ag dul in olcas. Tá gearáin agam faoi FAS agus eagrais eile atá ag gníomhú sna Gaeltachtaí, nach mbactar mórán le cumas ná líofacht Gaeilge na bhfeidhmeannach ná na múinteoirí a chuirtear ag obair sna Gaeltachtaí; gur beag aird a thugtar ar cháilíochtaí Gaeilge na ndaoine a roghnaítear le cúrsaí oiliúna a reachtáil i measc phobal na Gaeltachta. Is masla é sin do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, agus ní chabhraíonn sé leis an drochstaid ansin. Ní bheidh seans againn an cheist sin a phlé <Col N="1905" /> mar gheall ar rudaí a tharla níos luaithe sa lá.</P>
    <P>Is é tuairim mhuintir na Gaeltachta anois nach bhfuil ach seafóid i gcaint an Stáit faoi cheist na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta, nach bhfuil an Stát féin dáiríre faoi, go léiríonn an Stát féin nach bhfuil tábhacht ar bith leis an Ghaeilge, nach gcabhraíonn an teanga le héinne, gur míbhuntáiste Gaeilge bheith ag duine ó thaobh na seirbhísí poiblí de. Mar a cuireadh i mo leith sa Ghaeltacht, bhí jab maith agam lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht agus teacht isteach mór agam ón dá phost a bhí agam. Dúradh liom go minic go raibh sé éasca agamsa bheith ag caint faoi thábhacht na Gaeilge agus thábhacht na Gaeltachta, ach má tá cónaí ort in áit iargúlta in iarthar na tíre agus míbhuntáistí eile ag cur as duit mar easpa fostaíochta, drochbhóithre agus chuile shórt eile &mdash; agus anuas air sin má tá tú féin nó do chlann ag iarraidh Gaeilge a úsáid le córas Stáit gur cuma leo faoina leithéid &mdash; is é an rogha is fearr atá agat ná Béarla a úsáid agus do chlann a thógáil le Béarla sa dóigh is nach mbeidh aon deacrachtaí ann leis an gcóras Stáit, mar go bhfuil gach seans ann go mbeidh tú féin agus do chlann mar ábhar magaidh má chloínn tú leis an Ghaeilge. I wanted to make that clear at the very beginning because the Ombudsman's report raises very disturbing questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must remind the Senator that we are dealing with a debate on the Ombudsman, not on the Irish language. He is entitled to make reference to it, but perhaps he could get back to the report on the Ombudsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought you were going to pull me up for being repetitive in terms of what Senator Ó Foighil had said. I cannot appreciate, I must say, a distinction between what I have said and what Senator Ó Foighil had said. Nevertheless, I have completed what I wish to say about the report of the Ombudsman. May I say, in a brief passing reference that this is totally out of order, that I took the opportunity of listening for the first <Col N="1906" /> time to the translation here of Irish to English and it is a credit to those involved. It is fluent and idiomatic. I have reasonable fluency in the language but people like Senator Ó Foighil give others like myself a good impression of what our Irish is really like. The translation staff did a fine job on a particularly colourful and idiomatic brand of Irish that nobody other than an expert would be able to keep up with.</P>
      <P>There are a number of themes in the Ombudsman's report that I would like to develop, some of which I have been asked to introduce by my now excluded colleague who was prepared to speak on this subject. In the report's introduction, indications are given that the Ombudsman is regarded as a threat by some people in the public service. The public service should remember that the Ombudsman offers effective protection to them as well as to the public against unfair complaints, misrepresentation or distortion. Where a complaint is made to the Ombudsman about the activities of a State body, if the person concerned has done his or her job conscientiously and according to the law, the Ombudsman will declare, publicly if necessary that he has adjudicated and has decided that the work concerned was done properly and correctly within the law. That is a defence not only of the public but of public servants who do their job properly and 3,000 complaints suggest that the vast majority do.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman's office is underdeveloped, under-resourced and perhaps not as well known as it should be. There is evidence that it has become, like all State services, the preserve of the slightly wealthier classes, of those who can afford, for instance, a telephone since the vast majority of complaints are about telephone bills. I, too, have experienced frustration with telephone bills but they are hardly the most pressing social problem; other areas of public administration have a more critical effect on people's lives. We should not allow our public servants to worry unduly in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public representatives are sometimes <Col N="1907" /> afraid of appearing incompetent before their constituents when cases referred by them to the Ombudsman are resolved by him, where the public representative has previously failed. The Ombudsman, unlike the public representative, has enormous powers which is why the establishment of the post of Ombudsman was such an enormous step forward. The Ombudsman can demand to see and read the complete file on a case and may adjudicate on it to his satisfaction. He enjoys extraordinary investigative powers. A Member of either House may, in contrast, make a request but cannot exercise similar powers. This powerful office has worked extremely well.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman's capacity to improve the lives of ordinary people is limited only by the extent to which people know of the office and potential exists for further development, if permitted. There is no Member of either House who would not be relieved if the burden of routine representations to various public bodies and Government was reduced; they could then do something other than write hundreds of letters a week which are identical to those of their colleagues from all political parties in the same geographical area, which generate identical responses, one ahead of the other, depending on current party political preferences.</P>
    <P>If we could persuade citizens to deal with administrative delays through the Ombudsman's office and if the Ombudsman's office had the resources and was geographically accessible, many routine problems of delay or inconsistencies associated with large organisations could be dealt with efficiently. Perhaps a truce might be called so that agreement might be reached within a constituency that all problems of delay would be referred to the Ombudsman and adequate resources sought to ensure rapid processing of complaints. A parliamentary question produces an even faster response but questions of delay are an abuse of the concept of parliamentary question. However, it often produces a remarkable concentration of the mind <Col N="1908" /> in a Government Department when the Minister has to get up in public to defend the issue and even produce a written answer. That does not obscure the fact that the Ombudsman could do this work adequately.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman's office has developed in various directions and I am grateful to my colleague, Senator Murphy, for drawing my attention to the degree to which the Ombudsman has begun to point in the direction of necessary policy changes. In this report the problems of adoptive mothers are mentioned. The law excludes adoptive mothers from many benefits available to natural mothers. He is serving society well and he has contributed already to the alleviation of certain anomalies in the social welfare codes. I hope he will receive a similarly positive response to the welfare problems of adoptive mothers. It would not place an enormous burden on the Exchequer to extend the various provisions available to natural mothers to adoptive mothers. The Ombudsman testifies to the value of openness in public administration at local and national levels which depends on the greatest possible public access to information.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman's office is also tied up with our perpetual problem of centralisation. The Ombudsman is, for instance, allowed to investigate complaints against local authorities and health boards but the procedure for investigating a complaint against, say, the Southern Health Board, must be enormously cumbersome when the office of the Ombudsman has no permanent geographical base outside Dublin. Every investigation of such a complaint would have to be done through a tedious process of correspondence and communication over a distance of 160 miles. There is good case for increasing the funding of the Ombudsman's office and setting up sub-offices of the Ombudsman's office in the major regional centres and extending them throughout the country. This would enable local investigations to be carried out locally through personal contact with <Col N="1909" /> the Ombudsman's local office. The independence of the Ombudsman's office would be protected and its accessibility dramatically improved.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman's report indicates that he is concerned about the extent to which ordinary citizens are aware of his office and it powers. The Ombudsman is not some sort of Mr. Nice Guy; he is an extremely powerful figure with extraordinary and justifiable powers which should provide an incentive towards efficiency in the public sector. The knowledge that someone with no axe to grind other than look after public welfare is entitled to see all records on a case and make an independent and fair assessment of how the person is being treated must be a remarkable incentive to a public servant to ensure that procedures operate efficiently and effectively.</P>
    <P>The Government should expand the office of the Ombudsman to facilitate public access and to improve relations between State and citizen. An extended and improved Ombudsman's office with more resources, staff and geographical accessibility would guarantee greater sensitivity on the part of public bodies.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman makes clear in his report that public bodies should understand the duties of the Ombudsman. He does not accept cases simply because they land on his desk but assesses the <i>prima facie</i> basis of each case before accepting it. It is pointless and unnecessarily defensive for public bodies when approached by the Ombudsman to resort to bureaucracy rather than complying with his request and facilitating the inquiry. Such bureaucracy impugns the goodwill of the Ombudsman who will not take on gratuitous complaints.</P>
    <P>Once <i>prima facie</i> evidence has been established all public bodies should as a matter of policy provide him with the maximum possible co-operation. A good company operating in the market place offers a parallel when it deals with customers complaints without putting them through a series of hoops.</P>
    <P>Recently I dealt with a retail shoe business in Cork; it was a model of how to deal with the customer. When there is a <Col N="1910" /> problem with a pair of shoes one can be told that the matter will be investigated and that the shop will get in touch with the customer. This shop said: &ldquo;You have a problem; it is up to us to solve it now.&rdquo; They made three offers of replacement and were extremely helpful. Consequently if anybody in my family wants to buy a pair of shoes this shop would be one of the shops to go back to because they responded satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Public bodies when dealing with the Ombudsman ought to respond to him in the same way. Delaying or obstructing the inquiry causes public frustration but does not conceal the truth because the Ombudsman does not go away. Delaying an Ombudsman investigation consumes scarce resources in that office which could be used otherwise. All public bodies ought to be reminded by their board members or chief executive officers or in bodies such as Telecom by whoever is responsible, that the Ombudsman is entitled to full co-operation. The Ombudsman's judgment will vindicate the company if it is proved right, and if proved wrong the company will learn how to deal with such matters in future.</P>
    <P>We should be proud of the office of the Ombudsman, and proud of the man. The present Ombudsman had earned a reputation for integrity long before he took on this job. He has expanded the office imaginatively, while not breaching his statutory position, to relieve the frustration of those who find themselves enmeshed in bureaucracy. In the process he has done wonders to increase both the accountability and the self-confidence of the public sector. Large sections of the public sector must now know that the office work reasonably efficiently and that deal with large numbers of public complaints promptly and rapidly. The report mentions the case of a health board which tried to insist that school-going children between ages 16 an 18 can be refused disabled person's maintenance allowance for some reason thought up by itself. Such cases are spectacular only because they constitute exceptions. It is wonderful to have a non-bureaucratic process not involving recourse to courts <Col N="1911" /> or tribunals which can ensure that offending individuals or State bodies can be dealt with efficiently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual report of the Ombudsman is always well-documented and prepared and makes interesting reading for a public representative. Anyone in public life with an interest in local authorities and State bodies should examine the role they play and the complaints made against them.</P>
      <P>The report reveals that the number of complaints made in 1990 was 3,099 and that 51 per cent of these were not upheld; 49 per cent of complaints were upheld, emphasising the need for the Ombudsman service. Many investigations proved financially rewarding for complainants. One could argue that these people received what they were genuinely entitled to. Many case histories mentioned in the report revealed sizeable refunds or rebates, particularly in the area of telephone accounts. The following case appears on page 84: a telephone subscriber complained that his bill had increased from £200 or £300 to over £1,200. He had pursued the matter with Telecom Éireann but the company maintained that the charges were correct. The reply of the Ombudsman read as follows:</P>
      <P>Telecom Éireann informed me that faults had been discovered on a customer's telephone equipment. With a replacement of defective equipment the fault was cleared.</P>
      <P>Telecom Éireann claimed that the fault was intermittent and had not been detected during previous tests. They were unable to indicate the exact duration of the fault and in the circumstances they agreed to rebate the entire arrears totalling over £2,500.</P>
      <P>This is a very substantial figure. In page 87 of the report there are references to refunds of £289 and £1,329. These were serious overcharges for the people concerned and the Ombudsman was extremely helpful in those situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1912" /> In his report the Ombudsman suggested that Telecom Éirean should introduce a code of practice to deal with billing complaints. This is a very worthwhile and constructive suggestion which would save much time and effort by Telecom, by the Ombudsman and, indeed, by the general public.</P>
    <P>The report also revealed that complaints about Telecom &mdash; this is to be welcomed &mdash; have dropped slightly from 1,087 in 1989 to 1,032 in 1990. One might believe that Telecom Éireann are getting their billing act together and being helped along the way by very worthwhile promptings from the Ombudsman. I hope that, as the itemised programme of Telecom continues, fewer complaints will be made.</P>
    <P>Many county councillors, TDs, Senators and politicians are effective ombudsmen. Even though the number of complaints to various local authorities has increased, they represent a very small percentage of all complaints made to the Ombudsman. This reflects the good work of county councillors and public representatives nationally.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman gives good value for money. He has enjoyed much success and has shown various Government Departments the value of his position. He is an effective protector of public rights and as such is to be congratulated for his work.</P>
    <P>I welcome his report and congratulate Mr. Michael Mills and his staff for doing a good job for all of us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a privilege for me to present this Bill to the Seanad. I am proud of the fact that this legislation was initiated and drafted by Deputy Alan Shatter. I wholeheartedly welcome and <Col N="1913" /> appreciate the fact that the Bill has been accepted by the Minister almost in its entirety. When we proposed the Bill in Dáil Éireann we said it would come up for a certain level of finecomb discussion and amendment. We are delighted that that process should take place and we will co-operate fully with it. It is particularly heartening for us to have been ahead in this area of important social legislation.</P>
      <P>Basically, the Bill prescribes, for the first time, the legal rules applicable to the recognition of adoptions from outside our country. Children adopted from outside the country will now have legal equality with children adopted in Ireland. The Bill empowers the Minister for Health to designate specific registered adoption societies to become directly involved in making arrangements for inter-country adoptions and imposes a duty on health boards to carry out family assessments and prepare home study reports when requested. It is significant, and we were very conscious of this in preparing the Bill, that no legislation of this kind previously existed. The 1989 report of the Adoption Board requested this type of legislation. It is clear to everyone that the number of children available for adoption here has fallen dramatically, as the number of single mothers who keep their children has increased over the years. None of us would quibble with the desirability of that, when the circumstances are correct. Whatever attitudes we might have on that question are irrelevant to this debate in that what we are discussing here is the social reality that many more single mothers are keeping their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under our current law there is no recognition for children adopted under the domestic laws of other countries. It is a feature of contemporary society that many people go to work abroad for short periods. With the EC becoming more widely understood and accepted there is greater mobility within EC countries. Up to now an anomaly existed whereby a person could go abroad for a short period to work and while abroad adopt a child but that child, while properly adopted abroad, would not have proper legal <Col N="1914" /> status here when the parents returned with it. All of us in political life welcome the return of emigrants or people who have lived abroad.</P>
    <P>It was unquestionably the plight of thousands of children in orphanages in Romania that was the catalyst for the initiation of this Bill. A number of people in the Minister's constituency, which is also my own constituency, have adopted children in Romania. The Minister will be aware and will have met a number of those people in the Cavan-Monaghan area. This situation has been repeated throughout the country. There are harrowing tales home from Romania from those people. I have heard dreadful stories of orphanages that lack any form of colour, decoration or ornamentation. One of our colleagues here, who will be speaking later, has been to Romania and he will corroborate this. The orphanages in Romania are absolutely barren and dreadful places. Added to that, children are sleeping in cramped conditions with six or seven to a cot. There is an appalling lack of emotional support for the children, an appalling lack of physical support, manifested in malnutrition, and an appalling lack of any kind of environment that would lend itself to proper emotional, psychological or creative development. That is the dreadful reality of Romania. One could hold up the House &mdash; and, God knows, it might not be a futile exercise but I do not propose to do it tonight &mdash; for a long time talking about the harrowing stories of people who have been to Romania and witnessed the tragedy there.</P>
    <P>It was the ordinary people of Ireland who took the initiative on the Romanian question. It is regrettable that it was the ordinary people solely who took the initiative, although that in itself is desirable, but the initiative came completely from ordinary people rather than from the Government. Another human tragedy is that much of the aid that was sent to Romania by well meaning people throughout this country was sold on the black market. I am very proud of the fact that in the capital town of County Cavan there is a very active support group for <Col N="1915" /> Romania. It is a horrific concept that items such as soap being sent to the orphanages has to be marked so that it will not be possible to sell it on the black market. We have heard stories of children who got beautiful clothes and were properly dressed one evening only to have them removed the next morning. The conditions that exist in the orphanages in Romania are harrowing and this is being manifested in many ways. I know a person who has adopted a Romanian child of three and a half years of age and that child is not yet able to walk. Those are the kind of physical manifestations of an absolute horror story.</P>
    <P>The Romanian orphanage appeal fund in Ireland raised £900,000. They raised that money without any help from central Government and that was a significant achievement. It is only right that public representatives should put on record our admiration for those people. I again urge the Minister and the Government to consider a much more active role to assist people who give voluntary aid to Romania.</P>
    <P>There are two orphanages, specifically, where Irish voluntary groups have had a particular input. In one of those orphanages in Tirgoviste there are 150 children who range in age from three to 18 years. In the other orphanage in Videle there are 170 children ranging in age from three to 18 years. In this institution there is grim, harrowing evidence of undernourishment, total deprivation and great human affliction. Again, this raises the question of what we can do to help those people. The World Health Organisation estimate that there are 160,000 children institutionalised in Romania. Those are children of the Ceausescu regime.</P>
    <P>I will depart from the essence of the Bill to make this relevant point on this stage. This must undoubtedly nail the lie once and for all with all age groups here that there is anything attractive about the regimes of eastern Europe or that there is anything attractive about the philosophy which gave rise to those regimes. This is an important point and I hope other public representatives will echo this <Col N="1916" /> observation. The horrific end product of the philosophy behind regimes such as that of Ceausescu must be brought home clearly to third level students, in particular, and to all young people who may be victims of misguided idealism. The same human tragedy has been repeated throughout eastern Europe. All of us in democratic politics right across the western world should make this point at every available opportunity. I have no doubt that those who ever flirted with or were in any way associated or sympathetic to that kind of philosophy or those kind of regimes must now have egg on their faces and it is not wrong to remind them of that in public. I know that may be slightly extraneous to the matter under consideration but it is a valid observation.</P>
    <P>It is worth remembering that the human tragedy recorded by the World Health Organisation was brought about by draconian issues such as the fact that every married woman in Romania was expected, by law, to have five children. Regular tests were held under the Ceausescu regime &mdash; and I had this explained to me in harrowing detail by people from the Romanian support group &mdash; who were out there in factories and so on to ensure that women were having the maximum number of pregnancies. Of course, all forms of contraception were outlawed.</P>
    <P>During 1990, approximately 150 Romanian children were adopted by Irish couples and couples are still going out there. There are currently 450 adopted Romanian children in Ireland. Each couple going to Romania had to have a family assessment carried out to comply with Romanian law. Neither the health boards nor the adoption societies in Ireland co-operated with this process. It is extraordinary that the health boards refused to give them assessments already made when they sought to adopt the Irish context. There was an urgent need to do something about this and that is what this Fine Gael legislation proposes to do. There is an urgent need to establish an adoption agency with responsibility for foreign adoptions and that is the function of this legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1917" /> The Bill deals with all foreign adoptions and this is an important point. It deals with recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission in May 1989. That report noted that increased mobility within the EC probably added to the number of people adopting abroad and coming back to live in Ireland. It was important that the position be regularised.</P>
    <P>The Bill specifically proposes that assessments be carried out by the health boards or adoption societies and that those assessments are used in foreign adoptions. Information is coming back to colleagues of mine over the past few weeks &mdash; the Minister spoke on this in the Dáil last week &mdash; that the health boards are not co-operating with this process and that they are saying it could take up to two years to prepare the assessments.</P>

      <P>That is dreadful and I ask the Minister to assure the House that it will not continue. This kind of tardiness in such a sensitive and important area is totally without justification. I know the Minister has already instructed the health boards to give the reports, prior to the enactment of the Bill. Health boards in general are not co-operating fully on this matter. I understand that a meeting has taken place with the Minister on this subject and I ask him to clarify the up-to-date position for the House. A number of my colleagues told me this evening that they have been getting telephone calls from people who had difficulties in this area.</P>
      <P>One of the Minister's amendment to the Bill allows the addition of two extra people to the Adoption Board. I strongly recommend that those two people come from the Romanian support group in Ireland because it is important that those people be actively involved. I ask the Minister to respond to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation brought forward by Deputy Shatter, sought to deal with an anomaly in the law. He sought to deal with the situation of children resident <Col N="1918" /> here who are in a legal limbo and the human distress in relation to this. For that reason I recommend that the Bill be accepted and enacted as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators are aware, this Bill began as a Private Members' Bill introduced in the Dáil by Deputy Shatter. The Government at the time were in the process of bringing forward a Bill to deal with foreign adoptions when the Private Members' Bill was introduced.</P>
      <P>The Government shared the widespread concern about the various difficulties which people who had adopted abroad were encountering with their adoptions and were committed to finding a workable and lasting solution to this problem.</P>
      <P>In spite of the serious reservations which they had about some of the provisions contained in the Bill, as introduced, the Government magnanimously decided to accept the principle and overall objective of the Bill, in order to demonstrate their support for parents who have adopted children in Romania, and elsewhere, in recent years and who wanted their position under Irish law regularised.</P>
      <P>An important factor which influenced the Government's decision was that, by not opposing its Second Reading, the Bill would be referred to a special committee of the Dáil to be considered in detail. The Government were confident that the special committee appointed to examine the Bill would be successful in devolving and improving the proposals contained in the Bill to ensure that it would provide a secure legal framework for the recognition of foreign adoptions, and to rectify the various defects that existed in the original Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very pleased to report that the Government's approach was successful and that the Bill now before the House has been substantially improved as a result of the deliberations of the special committee. I would like to pay a tribute to those Deputies from all sides of the Dáil who were associated with the special <Col N="1919" /> committee and to acknowledge the important contribution made by Deputy Shatter to our work. I had a number of discussions with him to tease out a number of issues in relation to the Bill. We succeeded in reaching broad agreement on the issues concerned with the result that a number of the amendments brought forward at the special committee were in our joint names. I am pleased to record that these amendments were accepted by the other members of the special committee in a constructive, non-party political spirit. This all-party co-operation greatly facilitated the work of the special committee and enabled the Bill to proceed quickly through the Dáil, without a division.</P>
    <P>This illustrates the level of goodwill on all sides towards the legislation and its objectives. I am confident that the same co-operation will be forthcoming from all the Members of this House. We are all agreed on the desirability of having the legislation enacted as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that section 1 of the Bill now contains a definition of what constitutes a foreign adoption for the purposes of the legislation. I was particularly concerned to ensure that recognition would be confined to adoptions effected in foreign countries which operate a system of legal adoption broadly similar to our own and which provide proper safeguards for the three principle parties involved in any adoption, namely, the child, the natural parent or parents and the adopters.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that the legislation will apply to adoptions effected in any country in the world. I wish to emphasise this, as some reports in the media may have given the impression that the legislation deals exclusively with Romanian adoptions. This is not the case and in examining the Bill it has to be borne in mind that it will apply to adoptions effected in countries throughout the world, some of which have very reputable systems of adoption, whereas in other countries, unfortunately, the buying and selling of children is not unknown. It is essential to ensure that our legislation <Col N="1920" /> does nothing to facilitate the trafficking and exploitation of vulnerable children. I believe that paragraph (e) of the definition of a foreign adoption contained in section 1 achieves this objective. It should be noted that only those foreign adoptions which comply with all of the terms of the definition will be entitled to recognition in the State.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the recognition of foreign adoptions granted to people who were domiciled or habitually resident in the foreign country at the time of the adoption. These recognition principles are in line with recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission in their report on the recognition of foreign adoption decrees. The adoption would, of course, also have to satisfy the criteria set out in the definition of a foreign adoption in order to be entitled to recognition.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the recognition of foreign adoptions granted to people who had been ordinarily resident in the foreign country for at least 12 months at the date of the adoption. Our law permits adoption orders to be made in favour of people who have been ordinarily resident in the State for at least one year. It is reasonable, therefore, that adoptions effected abroad in similar circumstances should be entitled to recognition in the State. Here again, the particular adoption would have to comply with the terms of the definition of a foreign adoption in order to qualify for recognition.</P>
    <P>Section 5 sets out the circumstances in which a foreign adoption granted to a person or couple who are ordinarily resident in this country will be entitled to recognition. This section replaces a proposal in the Private Members' Bill which would have conferred recognition solely on the basis of the nationality and residence of the adopted child. I had grave reservations about the advisability of that provision which would have resulted in a completely open-ended system of recognition and which would have seriously undermined our own legal adoption system and the important safeguards it contains. I am extremely glad that it was deleted in favour of this alternative <Col N="1921" /> approach which I brought forward at the special committee.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with Irish residents who travel abroad for the sole purpose of adopting a child. Since the adopters' main connection is with this country, their entitlement to recognition must depend, among other matters, on whether they fulfil the eligibility requirements of our own adoption laws.</P>
    <P>Section 5 has been designed to cover three categories of adopters. The first category are those people who adopted abroad before 1 April last. Their adoptions will be recognised provided they are eligible to adopt under Irish law and their adoption complies with the terms of the definition of a foreign adoption.</P>
    <P>The second category of people are those who applied to the Department of Justice before 1 April for written immigration clearance for an adopted child and who received such a clearance. They did not have to receive the clearance before 1 April; once they applied before 1 April they will have received the clearance since. Where their adoptions are finalised before 1 July next they will be recognised on the same basis as the adoptions completed by people before 1 April last.</P>
    <P>The third category of people are those without written immigration clearance from the Department of Justice and who wish to adopt abroad. These people will be required to have their eligibilty and suitability to adopt established before they travel to a foreign country, if their adoption is to be entitled to recognition on their return to this country.</P>
    <P>The assessments as to suitability may be carried out by the health boards and the registered adoption societies only, and must be approved by the Adoption Board. In response to Senator O'Reilly, we did meet representatives of each of the health boards and the health boards have a designated person who will now give advice to people who wish to travel to Romania what the best course for them is.</P>
    <P>I consider it essential that the procedure for the recognition of foreign adoptions granted to Irish residents in the future must include a proper pre-adoption <Col N="1922" /> assessment of their suitability. This is particularly important in the case of adoptions granted in countries which do not require the adopting parents to have had the child in their care of any length of time.</P>
    <P>The assessments carried out by the adoption agencies and the Adoption Board in the case of domestic adoptions provide an important safeguard for the welfare of the child. It is vitally important that any child involved in an inter-country adoption enjoys similar safeguards. While the primary responsibility for providing these safeguards rests with the authorities in the foreign country, the State also has a duty to protect the welfare of the child.</P>
    <P>This approach is in harmony with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which includes a special provision in relation to inter-country adoption. It requires states to ensure that the child concerned by inter-country adoption enjoys safeguards and standards equivalent to those existing in the case of national adoption.</P>
    <P>I believe that section 5, which is the result of a substantial amendment that I brought forward at special committee, is fully in compliance with that requirement. Section 6 was also incorporated in the Bill as a result of another amendment which I brought forward. It provides for the establishment of a register of foreign adoptions which will be kept by the Adoption Board. It will be open to adopters and adopted persons to apply to have their foreign adoptions entered in the register.</P>
    <P>Where the Adoption Board enters a foreign adoption in the register the adopters and the adopted person will then be able to obtain a certified copy of the entry. This certificate will be similar to a birth certificate. It will be acceptable for all the purposes for which the adopted person's birth certificate may be required. Moreover, the certificate can be produced, whenever required, as evidence that the foreign adoption is recognised in the State.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a register of foreign adoptions is an innovative measure <Col N="1923" /> which will be of enormous practical benefit to adopters and adopted persons alike. I am sure it will be warmly welcomed by them and that they will be keen to avail of the new procedure in order to obtain documentary evidence that their foreign adoptions are recognised.</P>
    <P>I also availed of the opportunity presented by this Bill to extend the categories of persons eligible to adopt under domestic law and to reduce the minimum age limits for adopting parents. These important changes are provided for in section 10.</P>
    <P>The current distinction between the entitlement of a widow and widower to adopt is being abolished.</P>

      <P>No. In addition, a single person or a separated married person will be permitted to adopt in exceptional cases where the Adoption Board is satisfied that this would be in the best interests of the child.</P>
      <P>A standard minimum age of 21 years for adopting parents is also being introduced, except where a parent or relative is adopting the child jointly with a spouse, in which case only one of them will be required to be 21 years of age. The present minimum ages are 21, 25, or 30 years depending on the relationship of the adopters to the child and the duration of their marriage. I do not see a good reason for maintaining these age limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final charge to the Bill as initiated that I would like to draw attention to, is the short Title. The Bill is now called the Adoption Bill, 1990. This change in title was required as a result of the important new responsibilities assigned to the Adoption Board by the amendments accepted in the special committee. The original provisions in the Bill did not envisage any role for the Adoption Board. The changes made in special committee will ensure that the board will have <Col N="1924" /> a central role in administering the new legislation. In recognition of this, section 11 provides for an increase in the present membership of the Adoption Board from seven to nine members to cope with the additional workload arising from the processing of applications under the legislation.</P>
    <P>I am well pleased that the Bill now before the House is a better Bill as a result of the amendments made in the Dáil. I acknowledge once again the contribution of Deputies of all parties and I look forward to a similar response from the Members of this House.</P>

      <P>Yes, I am happy to go ahead. I do not want to hold up the proceedings. This Bill is a difficult Bill to deal with. On the one hand there is the enormous human problem of the people who have, for the most understandable of reasons, taken the opportunity to adopt children who, quite clearly, in the initial phase of the wave of adoptions from Romania in particular, were in desperate need. Everybody could feel that what was being done was a gesture of enormous human worth. The image, which was a <Col N="1925" /> true image, was of people who were rescuing children who had no future and bringing them into loving homes where they would have a much better, a more positive future. How could any human being, not least somebody like myself who has three, I hope, cherished children feel anything but compassion and sympathy. If one was to leave it at that, then the whole area of adoption could be left at that.</P>

      <P>Senator Honan and I might not be too far in disagreement on some of her recent remarks.</P>
      <P>The simplest thing to do with this Bill would be to say it is a great idea and leave it at that. The Bill, as it now stands, is very good legislation which deals with the problems as they exist. On the issue of the adoption of children, whether they be foreign or native adoptions, it is extremely important that always and in all circumstances a couple of principles prevail. The first is, that the rights of the child must always be predominant. We cannot fudge that right of the child by a misguided or uncritical compassion which does not acknowledge that right. The second principle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considerable respect for Senator O'Reilly and I do not want to start an argument with him, but the emotional climate in which this legislation was introduced had at least in it the potential to forget some of the basic principles that should underly adoption law. There were undoubted deep human reasons that made people feel that what was happening was wonderful, but the two principles that need to be enshrined in this are that the right of the child is paramount and that the natural parents, if they can be identified, must have made a free choice to give their children up for adoption without inducements or pressure. It is a tragic fact that before the Romanian babies issue arose, there were and there continue to be considerable reservations about the number of children adopted from Third World countries. Such countries tend to have societies where children are very poor and where women and families are under considerable pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is still right, notwithstanding all of the human problems, that we should regulate adoption procedures in the interests of the children and with proper respect for the rights of the natural parents where they exist or where they can be identified. No amount of perfectly legitimate compassion should prevent us from making sure that those rights are enforced. It is difficult in this case where there has been a large number of adoptions, for instance, to be absolutely certain that the procedures that would have applied in an adoption that took place in this State, in terms of assessing the bonding between the child and parents and of assessing the way in which the adoption process has worked, have been applied and it is impossible in many of the existing cases to ascertain that. A two-tier system of adoption could have developed so that people who adopt children from within this jurisdiction, would have to undergo a very rigorous, and in <Col N="1927" /> some specific cases, a too rigorous process, of assessment and, on the other hand, we would have almost a <i>carte blanche</i> approach to people who adopt children from outside the State. The enormous humanitarian instincts of the Irish people should not have allowed us ever to get away from that.</P>
    <P>The situation as it currently exists in Romania is not quite as simple as the situation that existed 18 months ago, at the end of the not in the least bit lamented Ceausescu regime. There is some evidence that it is not the children, for instance, for orphanages that are now being offered for adoption. There is some evidence, according to Professor Irene Hillery, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 15 April, that couples are paying £3,000 to £4,000 for a baby and even £10,000 for a &ldquo;very good baby&rdquo;. That is the sort of material which justifies dispassionate legislation. It is the sort of material which makes it obligatory on all of us not to let feelings run away with us and to insist that the same principles must apply. It is very difficult for those who have the privilege of having children to say to people who, for one reason or another, are not in a position to have children, &ldquo;We must insist on regulating and interfering bureaucratically,&rdquo; as they would see it, in their right and desire to do what we have the right to do and are able to do without an external interference. If we believe that adoption should be regulated and that there is a proper way to do it in the interests of the natural mother of a child, or indeed, the natural parents of a child, in the interests of the adoptive parents and above all in the interests of the child, then we have to grasp the nettle of the sort of legislation we have here.</P>
    <P>The legislation is welcome. Many of the amendments introduced by the Government were both necessary and worthwhile. This Bill should not have become an issue for the exchange of what on a couple of occasions came close to party political abuse. It is far too sensitive an issue for that. It is not an issue on which I would want to score party political points. For instance, it would have <Col N="1928" /> helped if the Minister left words like &ldquo;magnanimously&rdquo; out of his script about the Government decision to accept the Bill. He could have simply said that the Government decided to accept the principle of the Bill. Sticking in the word &ldquo;magnanimously&rdquo; is to a certain extent rubbing people's noses in it a little bit, and we could have done without it. It is a little out of tone with the spirit in which this legislation has moved through both Houses of the Oireachtas. It is not the sort of comment that I would normally expect from this Minister. He is not a man given to revelling in controversy. He has survived controversy by not revelling in it and by rolling with a lot of the punches over the last three or four years with considerable expertise. It is not like him to create a controversy out of nothing by the injudicious use of language.</P>

      <P>Since the occupancy of the Chair changed the Senator has stopped being nice to me. I am now suspicious. I do not want to delay the House unnecessarily, but we are still waiting for legislation to deal with the report of the adoption review body. There are a considerable number of problems identified by a review board which was representative of people who knew a lot about the issue. We need, not just legislation to deal with adoptions, particularly foreign adoptions, but to ensure that proper standards are met in the whole area of adoption, particularly in the insistence on training and skills for people who work in the area of adoption societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad we have grasped the nettle, that we have been prepared to insist on standards. In the case of Romania, in particular, the Minister, the Government and all of us may well have to be <Col N="1929" /> extremely vigilant to ensure that an adoption industry does not develop. I do not care who says it to me, it is not right, however compassionate the motives, that we should ever allow anything that looks like, or remotely resembles, trade in babies. It is extremely important that however heartrending the human cases may be, that principle should be established. This legislation will go a long way to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill which is of considerable importance to me and to the nation. As was rightly pointed out by Senator O'Reilly, as a result of a severe reduction in the numbers of babies for adoption here, a crisis point had almost been reached in that couples had been waiting sometimes ten and 12 years with little or no hope of getting a baby for adoption at home. Senator Ryan condemned Ceausescu and to a certain extent a lot of the parents who ended up in this situation did so because of the Ceausescu regime and what developed in Romania.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Shatter of Fine Gael on his initiative on this matter. The Minister and his staff, with the assistance and co-operation of all parties, were instrumental in bringing in several important amendments to this Bill. Even though the tenets and concept of the Bill presented by Deputy Shatter were right, the Minister must be lauded for making necessary major amendments to the Bill. I am not being political. All the newspapers gave credit solely to Deputy Shatter, whose involvement I acknowledge, but the Minister must be complimented for taking up the task and dealing with it so expeditiously, as it is only four or five months since Deputy Shatter's Bill was brought before the House. The Minister in his wisdom, instead of throwing it aside, decided to sit down with Deputy Shatter and set up a special committee to get this legislation more or less agreed by all parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to compliment the parents who went to the trouble of going to Romania and making a very major, serious decision. The <Col N="1930" /> number of adopted children who have come here from Romania as Senator O'Reilly said is somewhere in the region of 450. The register, when eventually compiled, will sort that out. It is a difficult, traumatic decision, for a couple here to take it upon themselves to get social reports, home study reports, visas and a letter of consent from the Department of Justice to bring an adopted child in here.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that I am the uncle of adopted Romanian twins. I was delighted to go to Romania last October-November and see at first hand the situation in the homes, and so on. It was very noble of couples who went to Romania to see the children. It was not an easy task. I concur with Senator Ryan who said that the whole idea of Romanian adoptions has become very flowery and attractive. It is a very serious step to take.</P>
    <P>Unless couples were extremely lucky they spent six, eight or ten weeks going through the various systems out there. In one case when parents were ready to return to Ireland, it was discovered that the child had AIDS. In a second case, on the morning of the court hearing before the notary public, the child and mother disappeared. Possibly American or Canadian dollars ensured that the mother and child disappeared to another town and fulfilled the adoption process there. I met at least six couples from different parts of Ireland who had a difficult time there. It is wrong to glorify the idea of Romanian adoption. However, there was a basic need here. Many couples had been waiting for six or seven years to adopt a child and they were frustrated. The floodgates had opened. The rush has peaked and even though the new legislation will provide for people who wish to adopt in the future, in Romania, the rush is over. There will be a levelling off.</P>
    <P>Some of the officials in Romania who cared, regretted that Irish, English, and, indeed, Americans were arriving to adopt healthy children, leaving those with physical and other disabilities behind. It is what happened. It has been a difficult experience for many couples who had to spend weeks there in difficult <Col N="1931" /> conditions. One would have to live there for a couple of days to experience the lack of basic things such as shops and so on. The people are very subdued. Senator O'Reilly pointed out that children are living in desperate conditions in overcrowded orphanages. A bottle was given to those children maybe once or twice a day, and if they could not fend for themselves, or if the bottle fell out of the cot, that was it. Now that some of these children have some love an attention, it is amazing how they have developed physically. They have really progressed in a few weeks.</P>
    <P>For many couples it has brought endless happiness. It is a dream come true for many couples who were really trapped in a situation here. I admire and compliment the couples who for many years could not succeed in adopting a child here but took it upon themselves to travel to Romania, sometimes on two or three occasions to fulfil their dream. They have given an opportunity and a home to infants and children as old as three and four years, who otherwise would probably never experience life as we experience it, but would have been left in institutions for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>The amended Bill before us basically regulates our laws as up to this we could not legally recognise foreign adoptions. The Government and all parties have made sure that this lack was put right in this Bill. As the law stood, if one brought children back from Romania there would have been serious problems in relation to succession laws and so on. The adoptions would not have been recognised. Under this legislation children who have now been brought in will be treated in the same way as if they had been adopted in this country. This is welcome and essential.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and all those concerned in that this Bill also allows single people to adopt in restricted circumstances. Our Adoption Board have very high standards, possibly the best in Europe. There was a free-for-all in the last 12 months. To get us back on the rails it is important that the Adoption <Col N="1932" /> Board play a leading role in ensuring that the welfare of the child is at all times of paramount importance. The Minister introduced a vital role for the Adoption Board and this must be lauded. He has increased the number on the board from seven to nine. It is important that an agency such as the Adoption Board which has wide experience here will be given a leading role to play. The Minister must be complimented for that. It is a step worthy of praise.</P>
    <P>There were some adverse comments about the health boards and the Adoption Board in that up to now they were slow or reticent in assisting couples who wanted to go abroad to adopt. The reality is that up to the introduction of this Bill, the Adoption Board and the health boards had no jurisdiction whatsoever to deal with this situation. It is unfair to criticise the health boards or the Adoption Board for their lack of interest. They had to take a neutral stance. In all cases the Department of Justice were very cooperative in issuing a letter. There was tacit agreement that the Department of Justice would issue a letter so that when a couple entered the country with a child they were entitled to do so. I compliment the Department of Justice for their work to date.</P>
    <P>Another advance that must be attributed to the Minister and to his staff, was the setting up of a register. It is vitally important that this be done, for a number of reasons. To date, there is uncertainty as to who has adopted which child. There is an urgent need to compile this register as soon as possible and get the facts and figures regarding these children on record. In the long term, this register will provide records for the children as they grow older and need certificates and so on when they wish to go to college or whatever. I understand that certificates will be issued in the same way as birth certificates. This is crucial. The Minister should be lauded for this amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the details of the Bill. This legislation is very straightforward. The Minister and all parties recognised and dealt with the problem. <Col N="1933" /> There were three different types of situations. First, there were the couples who went abroad last year and adopted independently. Second, there are the people who are going abroad with their letters of consent and provided they have their letter in by 1 July they will be allowed go ahead, the only assessment being necessary is the one they themselves will do.</P>
    <P>The third situation is the regulatory situation. After 1 July, the Adoption Board will be playing a crucial role for any couple who want to go to Romania. Perhaps I am over-emphasising the situation in Romania because it could also take in places like Brazil, South America and possibly some eastern countries, such as Bangladesh and Turkey, where there are serious problems at the moment. I am glad the Minister cleared this up because there was a concept abroad that this was a Romanian Adoption Bill. That is not the case. It is broader than that. It covers the whole world, and that is very important.</P>
    <P>It is a very personal decision when a couple, or in certain cases a single person, take it upon themselves to adopt. In future they will have to go through the Adoption Board and be properly assessed so that when the children &mdash; the child is of paramount importance at all stages &mdash; are brought back they will get a good home and it is ensured that the people who go abroad to adopt are both suitable and eligible. That is crucial and that is the role that the Adoption Board will play in the future as a result of the Minister's amendment.</P>
    <P>The net result of this legislation will be to bring peace of mind to 300 or 400 couples who have already gone abroad and adopted children, primarily from Romania but not exclusively. Previously, it was a great source of worry. There was the trauma of going out there, bringing the child back, getting AIDS tests done, checking for different diseases, having blood samples done, trying to decide which child to take, travelling from orphanage to orphanage. It was a very harrowing experience. But, having done <Col N="1934" /> all of that, they were coming back here to the uncertainty that the laws in this country were not adequate to deal with the situation. The Bill now before us recognises the difficulties and ends a situation that was most undesirable.</P>
    <P>I could speak on this topic for another two or three hours because of my own experiences, but I do not think that politics in Romania should be brought into it. This is legislation that is being put expeditiously through both Houses. All concerned must be lauded, because the Romanian problem arose only about 12 months ago. This is a typical example of parliamentary teamwork whereby all parties put this very sensitive issue to the forefront.</P>
    <P>The Minister complimented Deputy Shatter. He is a man for whom I have great respect and I have read his book on family law. He is a leading figure in this field and I think the Minister and the Government recognised the sensitive issue. They sat down together; they set up a commission and within two to three months this matter had been ironed out and some very crucial amendments have been made, because the Bill as originally submitted to the other House by Deputy Shatter contained certain flaws. I am not being derogatory in any way, but the old saying is that two heads are better than one and when all the parties came together on this these flaws were ironed out. If it had been rushed into last December or January we would be dealing with deficient legislation, we would be forced to make amendments and that would be an undesirable situation. All parties have agreed on the Bill as it now stands.</P>
    <P>I welcome the support from other Senators and I think that the concept and principle of the Bill can only be welcomed. I am quite satisfied that it will bring peace of mind, happiness and a sigh of relief to parents who have brought children from Romania to this country. They deserve this, because it was a very noble gesture to travel abroad and take it upon themselves to bring a child, and in some cases three and four children, back to Ireland and give them a home. <Col N="1935" /> These people are the winners and they deserve praise. I hope that by the end of this month the position will be resolved in their favour, that the register will be set up immediately and that the new role for the Adoption Board with regard to future adoptions will be in place.</P>
    <P>There is a fear among certain couples currently thinking of going abroad &mdash; possibly to Romania &mdash; to adopt a child that this legislation is in some way going to stop them. That is not the case. In fact, it gives a legal sanction to new adoption and they will be guided by the Adoption Board. The Minister has said that in each health board area a person will be assigned to assist couples looking for information on foreign adoption, etc. When the new system is working, hopefully before the end of this session, or certainly before the autumn, it will be welcomed as a desirable approach to this situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I compliment Deputy Shatter on introducing the Bill and, indeed I compliment the Minister on his open-minded attitude to the Bill by way of adopting a proposal from a party other than his own and modifying and improving it.</P>
      <P>Unlike Senator Ryan, I would not take exception to the Minister using the term &ldquo;magnanimous&rdquo; in reference to himself, because the last thing I would have associated with this Minister is triumphalism. There would be many other aspects on which I might criticise him, but certainly I would never ascribe triumphalism to him. It must also have been something of a consolation to the Minister to see Senator O'Reilly introduce his legislation with such dexterity. Indeed, I am sure the Minister must have felt that should he ever move into opposition and should Senator O'Reilly's party ever again get into Government, which seems a trifle unlikely at present, Senator O'Reilly would make an excellent Minister for Health and would keep the Health brief in the Cavan-Monaghan constituency, which I am sure must be a consolation to both of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, too, am pleased that the anxieties of <Col N="1936" /> the 500 or so Irish couples who will benefit directly from this legislation will be alleviated. This is desirable, and it was somewhat touching to hear Senator O'Donovan talk about his own immediate family experience in relation to this matter. However, having said that and having acknowledged that the Bill is much improved on when it was introduced initially, I also share Senator Ryan's concern about the welfare of the child being the first priority above all other priorities. I would also be concerned about the protection and safeguarding of the rights of these children's natural parents.</P>
    <P>I make these statements not by way of scaremongering or to disturb anybody, as that is the last thing I would wish to do, but because of some of the information which is at hand. It seems to me that we are going to be dependent on Romanian standards and Romania's capacity to see that those standards are adhered to. We in Ireland will to some extent be dependent on that when these adoptions take place. I am very concerned that these standards, which may appear to be all right on paper, are actually adhered to in practice. I am very concerned that we would have copperfastened guarantees that that happens and I am not at all satisfied that that is the case.</P>
    <P>I express these concerns for a number of reasons. I express them for the same reason that Senator Ryan saw fit to quote the statement from Professor Irene Hillery from University College, Dublin. At the risk of repeating what Senator Ryan said, she spoke in terms of £3,000 to £4,000 being paid per baby and £10,000 for a &ldquo;very good one.&rdquo; That is very disturbing by any standards and it has to give rise to great anxiety. I am further concerned because of reports in <i>The Observer</i> newspaper of 27 January 1991, in which a report written by Victoria Clarke headlined &ldquo;How You Can Sell Your Kids for $500&rdquo; spoke of a gypsy woman offering two girls for sale for £500 a pair adding: &ldquo;But Lousie baulks at buying the toddler when she clings to her mother.&rdquo; You could say there is an element of sensationalism in that. You <Col N="1937" /> can make what you like of it but it is there in black and white in what is by any standards a reputable international newspaper.</P>
    <P>I will go further and quote from a statement by Mr. Hans van Loon of The Hague Conference on Private and International Law. I gather he was speaking in Trinity College on 8 May 1991. He spoke in fairly grim and disturbing terms. He had just returned from Romania and he said:</P>
    <P>... there are now well established Romanian &ldquo;Mafia-networks&rdquo; of adoption black marketeers. The greatest demand now is not for those children in the institutions but for new-born babies. Women are being targeted in the early stages of pregnancy, with a view to the sale of their babies at a few days old.</P>
    <P>This is from an international expert. I do not know the man and I do not know of his reputation personally, but I am disturbed that somebody who has a reputation like that should say such things and I am not satisfied those allegations have been adequately refuted.</P>
    <P>I fully understand and I have the greatest sympathy for the tremendous anxieties which drive people who want to adopt children. The last thing I would wish to do would be to disturb those people but, at the same time, we have to bear in mind the principle enunciated by Senator Ryan when he spoke in terms of the welfare of the child being the first priority and the rights of the parents also being very important. Children come into this country and I have no objection to that happening &mdash; indeed, in many ways it can be very desirable &mdash; but I am concerned that appropriate standards, in other words Irish standards, should be applied in those situations. It is very disturbing when you see that kind of thing, when you read about money changing hands, hear the stories going the rounds of all sorts of things going on, of people going out to Romania and some of them apparently agreeing to pay money and then finding that the ante is jacked up half-way through the process. I cannot <Col N="1938" /> quote direct figures or sources on that as it is hearsay. The nature of these things is that most of it will hinge on hearsay but there are the hard statements from Professor Hillery, from this gentleman who spoke in Trinity College and indeed the report in <i>The Observer</i> newspaper.</P>
    <P>These are my anxieties and my concerns. I am very anxious that under no circumstances should standards be applied to Romanian children that would not be acceptable in this country. If Irish standards are applied to their adoption then, as far as I am concerned, it is great; but if that does not happen I would be very concerned and anxious that the Minister would reassure us that in all circumstances the basic buying and selling of children will not happen. I think that is appalling and Irish people, no matter what awful situation they might find themselves in, should not be part of it.</P>
    <P>There is one other item of concern and that relates to the role of health board social workers in monitoring and looking after these children, ensuring that proper standards are applied to them in Ireland. My concern about that provision relates to the crisis in the health boards at present and the fact that the boards are nearly broke. They are stretched to the ultimate for money and I have great difficulty in seeing how that extra work can be funded. I am very anxious that the Minister would reassure us that adequate funding will be provided to support social workers who are designated to do this type of work. Having sounded those notes of caution and concern about the whole process, I welcome the Bill. I hope it will solve the anxieties of the 500 or so Irish parents who have adopted children from foreign countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to place on record my unreserved support for the Bill before us this evening. I would also like to say how happy I am that there is so much goodwill and support both in the Dáil and in this House for this Bill. It is nice to see everybody agreeing to a piece of legislation. It is only right that we should congratulate Deputy Shatter <Col N="1939" /> for introducing this Bill, and also to congratulate the Minister for the many improvements he made to the original Bill.</P>
      <P>I would also like to say how happy I am that the Minister clarified what is called the second category of people who applied to the Department of Justice before 1 April for written immigration clearance for an adopted child and received such a clearance. Where the adoption is finalised before 1 July they will be recognised on the same basis as the adoptions completed by people before 1 April last. I had a number of people who were very concerned who had applied before that date, as it looked at one stage that they were not going to get a clearance to bring a child into the country. Happily, all of them have now got that clearance and they are now either in Romania or planning to go to Romania so that they can adopt a child. They are all very happy that situation has been clarified.</P>
      <P>This proposed legislation represents a timely initiative in seeking to regularise satisfactorily an undesirable situation which has arisen over the past 12 months or so in Ireland. This relates to adoptions effected abroad, particularly in Romania. No legislation exists in this country which states the particular circumstances in which a foreign adoption can be recognised and due status conferred. Equally, as I understand it, there is an absence of any case law in this area which gives any indication of how this anomalous position which has arisen could be regarded. Nevertheless, the report of the Law Reform Commission indicates that some statute law does proceed on the assumption that recognition and principles exist. Given the complexity and intricacy of the law relating to adoption procedures in Ireland, this Bill represents a comprehensive and sensitive piece of legislation which should confer proper status and insert the correct safeguards for parents who have gone through an adoption process abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appalling spectacle in Romania <Col N="1940" /> touched the hearts of many people here, particularly couples who were seeking to adopt. The plight of abandoned babies and children who could not be properly looked after by their natural parents provoked a singularly humanitarian and compassionate response there. The Irish couples who despite all the obstacles travelled to Romania and secured adopted children deserve our congratulations. Moreover, they are now entitled to have their adoptions duly recognised in this State and to avoid any difficulties which might arise, we must ensure the necessary safeguards are put in place as a matter of urgency. It is critical that formal legal status be confered so that the interests of the children and the adoptive parents are adequately safeguarded and that any doubt or uncertainty surrounding the adoption and the circumstances be cleared up once and for all.</P>
    <P>I would agree with a number of the other speakers who discussed the trafficking and exploitation of children in certain countries. Obviously, it is imperative that we make sure that there is no adoption industry. Because of the falling birthrate in Ireland and because there is an increasing number of people who wish to adopt children, we have to be very watchful of the source and make sure that people are not using a difficult situation in certain countries to make fast money on the quick adoption of children. I think that will be vital in future, because I believe that in future we will see more pressure in this area and I hope we will keep a very close eye on what could be a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the law relating to adoption in Ireland is of an extremely complicated nature. By its essence the legislation must be sensitive and relevant to the interests of all parties involved. In Ireland the interests and welfare of the child are afforded paramount importance. The rights of the natural parents are observed, together with the rights of the adoptive parents. These necessary elements are also incorporated in this Bill, given the peculiar circumstances relating to foreign adoptions. These <Col N="1941" /> interests must continue to be vigorously protected and reinforced.</P>
    <P>I believe there are approximately 150 to 200 Romanian children now adopted in this country. It is of the utmost importance that the welfare of the children be safeguarded adequately and, equally, that the adoptive parents be given security of having the foreign adoption order recognised as properly enshrined in legislation. More and more couples are seeking to adopt children outside the State. In recent years the number of children available for adoption has been diminishing rapidly. This situation has brought into very sharp focus in the Romanian situation these adopted children who would otherwise have been confined to an orphanage enjoying no legal status here. The Bill before us is absolutely vital to ensure legal protection for these children. Recognition principles must be thoroughly defined particularly in view of increasing foreign adoptions with the imminence of 1992 and increased freedom of movement between member states. It is now important to have the situation regularised and that express provisions be inserted which affect such fundamental rights as the capacity to exercise parental rights and attendant matters relating to succession, maintenance and taxation. At all costs, uncertainty must be avoided,</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. There are many people out there who are very happy about it and also there are many children who are going to be very happy and secure in proper homes because of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers I welcome this Bill without reservation and I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome the Minister here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is good to see a combined effort on the part of Deputy Shatter on the one hand and the Minister and his colleagues on the other, who have put together legislation that in my view offers great hope for the future. This Bill will make possible the adoption of children from outside this country for the first time. We had a situation in existence here for some time <Col N="1942" /> whereby children could be adopted but never before had we the position where people could adopt from outside the country. This is very significant and I would like to pay tribute to Deputy Shatter, to the Minister and to all concerned in bringing this legislation before the House.</P>
    <P>As was said earlier, we are not talking here exclusively about Romania. Romania happens to be the country on which attention is focused at present. We are effectively talking about the world. This legislation will be relevant to all parts of the world as time goes on. It is vital that we all fully recognise that we are talking here about legal equality. We are talking about matters that relate for instance, to such vital documentation as passports; we are talking about the whole area of inheritance and the full legal status of these children. We are not talking about bringing in children and making them part of a family. We are bringing in these children and they are part of the family just the same as any other members of that family or, if there are no other members of the family, they are fully fledged members of the family with total equality from a legal point of view. This cannot be overstated, nor can the attention the Minister and others took to ensure that that is part and parcel of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill also enables the Minister for Health to be involved in the whole area of regulations and the designation of particular agencies with regard to adoption measures in the future. This is also important. Some months ago certain individuals took the initiative to go to Romania to adopt children. They did this on their own initiative, there was no legislation in place, there was no official mechanism or any official formula by which they could operate. I personally know of a number of people, including some of my own relations who have been to Romania and have adopted babies. They are extremely happy and proud of these young children.</P>
    <P>Adoption for those persons who do not have a family of their own is something of vital importance. While adoption here <Col N="1943" /> was perhaps a thing of the past, because of the scarcity of babies for adoption, it is indeed a matter of great encouragement that there is another market &mdash; I use the word &ldquo;market&rdquo; with the greatest of respect in this context &mdash; whereby people can go to get children that they cannot and could not get at home. For example, from the years 1964 to 1984 we had 1,200 adoptions here. Since 1984 there has been a continuing decrease in that figure. In 1989 a meagre 615 children were adopted. Indeed, 400 of those were to couples who were not related to the child being adopted. These figures illustrate very clearly that the concept of adopting children in Ireland was fast coming to an end unless we had measures of the sort contained in this Bill which hopefully will bring joy to many people for many years to come. It is vital that we look on matters in that light.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to age limits. I would like to put a question to him. It was not absolutely clear in his speech whether the current age limits for adoption in Ireland will still rigidly apply. I would say strongly to the Minister that the current age limits are a bit prohibitive, severe and restrictive for couples who could adopt. There are many couples over the age of 40 who could make excellent parents if given the opportunity, but legislation so far has prevented them from being considered. That might be a separate question, but it is relevant.</P>
    <P>There are thousands of people in this country who for one reason or another are not blessed with a family of their own. Those of us who are fortunate to have our own families do not always appreciate what the other people are missing. We take it for granted when we have a healthy family but it is indeed a blessing from the Lord. We do not sufficiently realise the great blessing it is to have a family. I often say to friends that those childless couples are fortunate that they do not realise the happiness children bring to a marriage because otherwise life would be more difficult for them. Thankfully the road has been opened up <Col N="1944" /> and for those who wish to adopt there would be great possibilities here.</P>
    <P>As I said, Romania is only one country. There are many other countries from where adoptions have been made over the last ten years, countries like Peru, Ecuador, Chile. Though small in number perhaps, 30 or 40 in all, these adoptions were not or could not be recognised in this country. It indicates to us the possibilities that are out there for people who genuinely want to adopt. There will, and correctly so, be positive and definite standards laid down by the Adoption Board when the legislation comes into force. There will be a total and regular scrutiny of the position of the adoptive parents and there will also be a fair scrutiny of the children being adopted. This is a mutual protection for the parents and indeed for the children who will be adopted. It is important that children be placed in secure, stable homes and not thrown to the winds. Many of the children we have in here, in Romania, Chile, Ecuador, and elsewhere, have not known security. It would be tragic if these children were again confronted with instability. For that reason I support the measures put forward by the Minister whereby there will be careful scrutiny of people proposing to adopt foreign children to make sure that these children will be received into established homes.</P>
    <P>From a report published by OECD we understand that 160,000 children remain in institutions in Romania, an indication of the number of misfortunate children hoping to be adopted. People who have been to these orphanages in Romania have spoken of heartrending scenes when youngsters of two and three years of age come to them in the unspoken hope of being adopted. We have also heard of cases in some Romanian orphanages before the overthrow of their famous leader where children were left in cots for six or more days with broken limbs and uncared for. This intolerable situation cannot be accepted now or in future. We must look to parts of the world where children are in need of adoption. Let us do the best we can for <Col N="1945" /> Romania but be careful not to bring children into the country if we cannot provide for them or offer them the lives they are entitled to expect.</P>
    <P>We are talking about countries throughout the world that will seek to adopt children from Romania and from other countries. We are a small island on the periphery of Europe but we can and will do our share to take up many of these children who would otherwise be left in a hopeless situation. Regardless of what is done it has to be acknowledged that many children, including those who are mentally or physically handicapped, will be left in residential homes. There is a well-known home in Videle, housing 170 handicapped children. It is frightening to think of that number of severely handicapped children in one home. Several other homes have large numbers of handicapped children too. I am certain the problem is even greater than we imagine. Irish people have visited Romania but have not perhaps seen the worst sights of all. We have seen enough to tell us that the situation is grave.</P>
    <P>We must make sure that all qualifying functions referred to already by other speakers and myself are fully met. Unless parents are equipped financially, emotionally and in every other way to cope with a family situation they should not be involved in foreign adoption. We are not talking about a trading situation but about a personalised one. The Minister and all concerned have done trojan work in formulating this legislation and I hope it will meet with the full acceptance of this House and go on the Statute Book shortly to enable people to go to Romania and other countries with the full assistance of the Irish Government to adopt children, bring them home and give them lives they would not otherwise enjoy.</P>
    <P>Sufficient numbers of children for adoption are not available in Ireland because many people who bear children outside marriage do not give them up for adoption. Coupled with that, a high proportion go to England and other <Col N="1946" /> places for illegal abortions. Those facts are regrettable but must be acknowledged. There has been a long waiting period for adoptive parents up to now which is connected with the question of age, which I raised with the Minister earlier. Couples at present have to be married three years before they can apply to adopt a child; they are then placed on a waiting list and when that waiting period is over many would have exceeded the the age limit, which as far as I can recollect, is 40 years for a woman and 45 years for a man. The Minister might clarify that point.</P>
    <P>The Departments of Health, Justice and Foreign Affairs all have a vital role to play working in unity to make this effort operate meaningfully and effectively. I am certain that these three Departments, their Ministers and the various persons working with them will establish clear records essential for all children coming into our country. We welcome these children it is for us as a nation and as individuals to do the best we can for them.</P>
    <P>Reference was made earlier to independent adopting and to 1 July as a date of departure. Official adoption measures are necessary to enable individuals to go to Romania and other countries to select their own children. The journey may not be necessary in all cases. People who have been to Romania say there is an efficient policing system to ensure that no money changes hands, something which is very important.</P>
    <P>This legislation when fully approved should be made retrospective to cover all foreign children adopted over the past couple of years. We will be governed by foreign standards and must, therefore, face up to our responsibilities and make certain we are prepared to deal with any situation. The social workers mentioned will play a vital role in this area.</P>
    <P>I am overjoyed with this legislation because many people over the years have tried unsuccessfully to adopt children and <Col N="1947" /> this legislation offers a major breakthrough. I salute the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, and my colleague, Deputy Shatter, for their combined efforts in introducing this legislation. Let us not try to score points; that is not the intention of the Minister. Their combined efforts have brought about an excellent result. I wish this legislation every success and I hope it will do what I expect it to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>We have enjoyed an excellent Second Stage debate with high level of contribution in terms of content and sincere motivation. I welcome the Minister's attitude to the debate and I do not share Senator Brendan Ryan's sensitivity about the choice of words used. I admire the reforming work done by Deputy Shatter during his time in this Legislature. He will be recognised by social historians as one of the great reformers of this era, a person of forward looking views with an in-depth understanding of the present needs of society.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a great tribute to Deputy Shatter's understanding of social legislation, of contemporary society and to his reforming outlook. Senator Brendan Ryan, a person with a commitment to social legislation and reform, made one or two comments I would like to respond to. I think he would accept that babies brought into Ireland from the institutions in Romania were leaving horrific situations, that they have become the centrepiece of the activity. There was no sense in which the rights of the child in that context were compromised; a tremendously positive endeavour was made on behalf of those children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept Senator Ryan's point generally about the abhorrent notion of a trade in babies. We must be vigilant on this matter. This Fine Gael legislation contains subsections in which recommendations are made about the Adoption Board and about the regulation of assessment methods which indicate sensitivity for the rights of the child. On <Col N="1948" /> an international level, we must guard against any possibility of a trade in babies.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Senator O'Donovan on becoming an uncle; he has reason to be proud of that. I welcome his contribution and that of Senator Upton who made complimentary remarks about my presentation of the Bill. He also referred to the question of payment for babies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody, least of all Deputy Shatter, would entertain such a horrendous concept. The contributions of Senators Eoin Ryan and Richard Hourigan were also welcome. Senator Hourigan brought his general breadth of knowledge to the debate. However, I would take issue with him when he identifies abortion as a significant factor in terms of the number of babies available for adoption. There are fewer babies available for adoption because family size has reduced where two parents work, which is the modern economic set up. Single mothers tend to keep their children since the social stigma associated with that has been removed. I do not accept that abortion is a major factor in the non-availability of babies for adoption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation accommodates people until 1 July who have already received letters of permission to adopt. Prior to Deputy Shatter's legislation there was no legal status available in the Republic of Ireland for children adopted internationally, whether by parents who lived for periods abroad or by people on a once-off mission to somewhere like Romania. Such children had no rights of inheritance or citizenship rights and occupied a position of inequality relative to Irish-born children in the same family. The salient aspect of this legislation relieves the psychological trauma and economic implications involved for those parents. That situation is rectified by this <Col N="1949" /> legislation which also acclaims those people motivated to go to Romania to adopt children. It acclaims those who voluntarily &mdash; and regrettably I have to say without Government assistance &mdash; raised money for Romania during the orphanage appeals. It gives those people an assurance by the Legislature that they are being supported.</P>
    <P>The third significant point is that further important recognition might be given by including Romanian people specifically on the Adoption Board so that they receive formal recognition at that level. Given the attitude displayed by the Minister to the legislation so far, I am hopeful. It is important that the boards contain people with expertise in foreign adoptions, the foreign situation and its difficulties.</P>
    <P>This extremely timely legislation is another example of Fine Gael reforming social legislation and we are happy with the Minister's acceptance of it. It would be churlish not to admit that. We are proud we initiated it and are gratified by the thoughtfulness and sincere conviction of contributions to the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The admirable provision of subsection (1) (e) making trade in babies illegal is something to which we all subscribe. May I say mildly to Senator O'Reilly that whether the children are extremely deprived or not, it would still be wrong to have any suggestion of a trade in babies. Half a million children die each year from malnutrition around the world, many of them in worse conditions than the very visible babies in <Col N="1950" /> Romania. However, it would still be wrong not to protect Romanian babies because of the possibilities of exploitation.</P>
      <P>How is subsection (1) (e) to be enforced by investigation to ensure that a foreign adoption comes within the definition? We could be talking not only of Romania but about the Philippines, for instance, or about distant countries outside the normal range of communications and with different cultures. What procedures does the Minister have in mind to ensure that there will not be a covert, if not overt, exchange of money?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of speakers have mentioned the question of trafficking in babies, etc. Speaking as somebody who was in Romania for some time and who has personal knowledge of the situation this fear is over-exaggerated, although I understand Senator Ryan's concern. I know of at least one dozen couples from Ireland who went to Romania for very honourable reasons and although it was difficult to deal with interpreters, etc. Irish couples would shy away from any type of trafficking in babies.</P>
      <P>It would be incorrect for other countries to assume that Irish couples were getting involved in a black market situation. The Romanian authorities, despite their shortcomings, were quite thorough in appearing before the local magistrate or equivalent to a notary public, of being satisfied that both the mother and father in each case I am aware of consented and that the consent was obtained legitimately. I accept that from time to time this procedure of consent could be abused. Other nationalities &mdash; it would be wrong of me to go into it &mdash; did use the power of the dollar to persuade mothers to give over children but that was the exception rather than the rule. It would be remiss of me not to mention that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an excellent Bill. Whatever other countries do, my experience of the <Col N="1951" /> Irish couples indicates they would avoid trafficking in children. The vast majority, if not all, of Irish couples who brought in Romanian babies were above-board in what they did and they should be admired and congratulated.</P>

      <P>It was my information, talking to some parents who adopted Romanian babies, that in so far as extortion was involved it was by taxi drivers, petty officials and people other than parents.

      <P>I agree with Senator O'Donovan that trafficing in babies is not an issue and it has not come to light that Irish couples are trading in babies or buying babies abroad. Nevertheless, it is important that we provide for such an eventuality in law. The implementation of the subsection raised by Senator Brendan Ryan will be a matter for the Adoption Board who will have sole discretion in that. One way in which they may do it is to ask for a sworn affidavit. As they gain experience of foreign adoption from different countries &mdash; at the moment the majority of Irish couples are going to Romania to adopt babies &mdash; they will build a relationship with the country in which the adoption takes place. I have no doubt that they will be able to ensure as time goes on that they will be able to control such a situation and implement that subsection.</P>

      <P>Even when the law is implemented, perhaps, people will adopt children abroad and bring them into the country. This Bill purely recognises foreign adoptions. At the moment children who have been adopted abroad are not recognised by the State. In future, if people do not comply with the legislation, when the baby comes into the State the baby will not be officially adopted. There are many babies in the State at present who have been adopted in countries around the world, not just Romania, whose adoptions are not recognised.</P>

The health board will be responsible for that but the health board may, if they wish, delegate that authority to an adoption society. When their suitability is established to the satisfaction of the health board it will then be sent to the Adoption Board who will give a certificate of eligibility which will entitle the couple to receive a clearance certificate from the Department of Justice to bring a baby into the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 deals in great detail with a retrospective facility for <Col N="1954" /> recognition of adoptions of children who are already in the State. In the case of children brought into the State before 1 April, provided certain criteria are met, their adoptions will be recognised without the parents having to establish their eligibility. After we announced in the Dáil on 15 March that there would be a cut-off time of 1 April we recognised that it would pose a problem for certain couples who, perhaps, were in Romania on 1 April or who had a substantial amount of their procedure for adoption completed, and, therefore, we decided to extend the date. In the case of a child brought into the State before 1 July, where the couple had applied to the Department of Justice for an emigration clearance certificate before 1 April, those people have now got an extension until 1 July to have their adoptions declared in the country of adoption. Again, that is subject to certain criteria being met but I expect a very small number of couples, if any, will be ineligible. It is a special facility for people who have already adopted children. Following the enactment of this legislation it will be necessary for a couple to have their eligibility established. I would advise couples to consult with their local health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reference to a number of points made during Second Stage about health boards, the health boards have designated at least one person and, in some instances, up to four people, depending on the number of counties involved, to respond to queries from the public. I understand the difficulty for the boards in providing a facility to establish eligibility in the absence of legislation. We wrote to the boards in March and asked them to be sympathetic to people who approached them. We met a designated representative of each of the boards last week and the boards are co-operating. It is understandable, in the absence of legislation, that there was a certain reluctance and, indeed, confusion as to what their role should be. They have accepted <Col N="1955" /> this and are quite sympathetic to the situation.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer to a point that was raised about the facilities available to the health boards to ensure that they will be in a position to carry out the assessments. We have provided funding for 40 extra social workers to the health boards in the current year. They are provided for child care generally. That will ensure that the boards will be in a position to carry out the assessments. It is fair to say that the boards will carry out the assessments in a reasonable time. Reference was made to two years during the Second Stage debate, but I do not think it will take that long. However, it is important to point out that an assessment is not something that can be done like an examination in a doctor's surgery, it will take a certain length of time. A number of Senators referred to the need to ensure that the highest standards are maintained in the interests of the child, therefore, assessment and establishment of eligibility will take time. It will take a number of months but I have no doubt that the health boards will do a thorough job and they will not take any shortcuts.</P>

Perhaps from time to time there has been a shortfall but from my experience they take their work very seriously and maintain a very high standard. They employ social workers of a very high calibre.

The title, Adoption Bill, 1990, is also relevant, because not alone does it cover Romanian children, it also covers children of other nations.

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome my constituency colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, to the House and thank him for taking the Adjournment matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In designating Foynes as a local, rather than a commercial port the Government have effectively downgraded its status and this will seriously inhibit its development. I call on the Minister for the Marine to immediately reverse this decision. In its operational programme on peripherality, the Government clearly state that the strategy will be to promote investment in commercial rather than in <Col N="1959" /> local ports. In this context the Operational Programme on Peripherality states:</P>
    <P>The strategy for commercial seaports will place particular emphasis on the provision of appropriate port capacity and quality port infrastructure, strategically located in relation to the main internal transport arteries.</P>
    <P>The strategy will promote investment in ports which are essential for the efficient and economic movement of export goods and the import of raw materials for manufacturing. In this context, the following commercial ports have been selected by the Irish Government for priority investment: Dublin port, Rosslare Harbour, Waterford and Cork ports.</P>
    <P>Foynes is not selected by the Irish Government for priority investment. This is a big disappointment and I ask the Minister to reverse this decision. The report goes on:</P>
    <P>The development of these key ports is designed to ensure that the services and facilities available to Irish exporters are upgraded so that they do not suffer any further competitive disadvantages in relation to their European counterparts, particularly in the areas of access transport.</P>
    <P>Again, Foynes is excluded from this. They are excluded from being &ldquo;upgraded so that the do not suffer any further competitive disadvantage&rdquo;. That infers that Foynes will suffer further competitive disadvantage in relation to its European counterparts. The report also states that in order to improve the efficiency of these key ports it will be part of the development strategy to discourage the tendency towards the fragmentation of routes and services. I do not accept that to go to ports other than those mentioned, including Foynes, will lead to fragmentation of routes and services. Foynes should <Col N="1960" /> develop in unity with the ports which are designated commercial ports. The report also states that it is designed to encourage and assist identified key ports to handle all natural traffic arising and attract shipping operators into the key ports, not the local ports. The report goes on:</P>
    <P>The strategy will seek to reduce the effects of Ireland's peripherality in the period to 1993 by enabling key ports to handle extra shipping and to discharge lo/lo, ro/ro and dry bulk modes more efficiently, safely and speedily through the provision of new and improved handling equipment and extra berthage and docking facilities. It is planned that improved berthing and handling facilities will increase throughput in the period to 1993 at least.</P>
    <P>There are plans for 600,000 units on ro/ro, 150,000 TEUs on lo/lo, and on bulk which Foynes is very interested in, one million tonnes to the commercial seaports. The report states:</P>
    <P>The increase in the ro/ro trade will be located mainly at the ports of Dublin and Rosslare. For lo/lo trade the principal developments will be the ports of Dublin and Waterford, with the port of Cork handling the major increase in the bulk trade.</P>
    <P>Foynes Port is competitive and should receive and develop sufficiently to handle that. In the report Foynes is designated as a local port. In regard to local port strategy the report states:</P>
    <P>The strategy for local ports will be to ensure that appropriate port capacity and infrastructure are available on a regional basis not as a natural port but on a regional basis. Investment in local ports will be primarily influenced by the ability of those ports to contribute to regional economic development.</P>
    <P>Foynes has a much broader role than just contributing to regional economic development. It draws its business from as far north as Donegal, as far east as <Col N="1961" /> Dundalk and from the whole west coast. Again, I quote from the report:</P>
    <P>The target will be to increase the freight capacity of local ports by over 250,000 tonnes by 1993 and, through the provision of new quay space and mooring dolphins, to increase ship handling capacity at the key local ports of Drogheda, Dundalk, Foynes, Galway and Kinsale.</P>
    <P>That is a total of 250,000 tonnes between those five ports, 50,000 tonnes on average. At the moment Foynes handles 1.1175 million tonnes and 50,000 tonnes of an expansion is a Mickey Mouse development in the context of the development plans at Foynes. It is tantamount to turning it into a marina for yachts. The report states that the improvement in access to key local ports is aimed at opening up the hinterland of those ports to further industrial development. This is acceptable, but Foynes is not just for industrial development and would see itself as more than that. The report also states that the improvement in inter-regional port links will bring benefits in the development of sea distribution links and reduce reliance on roads in the movement of heavy goods. Will the Minister look again at the position with regard to Foynes and designate it as a commercial port, to allow the facility to develop in the way it has develped over the past 20 years?</P>
    <P>I will give a brief history to the Foynes port. In 1890 the Commissioners of Public Works made an order transferring the property in Foynes to the Foynes Harbour Trustees who were established under the same order. In 1932 a further order was introduced and passed by the Oireachtas. In 1946 legislation was passed to make further and better provisions in relation to membership of harbour authorities and in relation to the management, control, operation and development of their harbours. It also provided for the charging of rates to such harbour authorities and made provision <Col N="1962" /> in relation to pilotage authorities and other matters. Foynes has developed more rapidly than the other two harbours on the estuary and the progress at Foynes far exceeded the development of any port in the country over the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>Works which have been carried out over the past 25 years included expansion to jetties costing £4.7 million. A new roadway was constructed in 1976 and extended in 1981 and a further roadway was constructed in 1990 at a cost of £600 million. Thirty-six acres of land have been reclaimed, serviced and developed. A further 90 acres of agricultural land adjoining the harbour was purchased and partially developed. This was done at a cost of £1.8 million. Two cranes were purchased in 1979 and 1980 and conveyors were installed at the 1936 and 1968 jetties to meet the demands of bulk handling at a cost of £215,000. The port has also arranged for the facility of a 15-tonne crane capable of handling 600 tonnes per hour at a cost of £800,000.</P>
    <P>The trustees have erected 60,000 square feet of modern warehousing at a cost of £750,000. Most of the harbour lands, roadways, quays and so on are served with fresh and industrial water installation by the harbour. Electricity, a modern weighbridge and navigation lights have been constructed and erected. Dredging was carried out in 1981 and 1990 to cater for vessels from 20,000 tonnes deadweight to 35,000 tonnes deadweight at a cost of £1.7 million. The surplus for the harbour was £2.6 million in the past 25 years. That is an improvement on the past six years. Loans from commercial institutions, local loans advanced institutions and local loans advanced over 25 years amounted to £3.6 million. Funds obtained from the State totalled £792,983; £221,000 coming from the European Structural Funds and just £571,000 from the State in an investment of something like £20 million. The number employed by the port itself, the port users, ship agents and stevedores is around 300. On a permanent basis the <Col N="1963" /> numbers employed in 1961 was approximately 25 persons.</P>
    <P>As a result of the developments which have taken place and the employment which has been generated, the port of Foynes plays a major part in the welfare of the region mid-west, the south and the west regions. It plays a significant role in the agricultural industry and it now provides the required facilities for the importation of all types of animal feed, molasses and fertilisers and substantial quantities of meat, sugar, cereals and ores are exported through the port.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the revenue payable by port users to the State, on imports mainly, amounts to £20 million per annum. As a result of a recent survey of all the employers in the harbour, it is estimated that a figure of £1.7 million per annum is paid to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of PAYE and PRSI.</P>
    <P>Foynes situated as it is, is not a congested port. There is a small village there and the port users can gain access easily. It has that advantage over its fellow ports. Labour relations have been excellent in the port and that has attracted business to it, in contrast to many of its competitors both in Ireland and abroad. My case is that the investment plan of £19 million which is underway should not be inhibited by Government policy and by EC policy to grade the port as a local rather than a commercial port. I earnestly ask the Minister and his Department to re-examine the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West</i>): I thank Senator Neville for bringing this matter to my attention and indeed I compliment him on the contribution he has made to the success of Foynes port in which he and I have a keen interest. I hope he and I will further its progress in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would put the record straight in so <Col N="1964" /> far as the motion is concerned. The Operational Programme on Peripherality Provides that harbour authorities, irrespective of their size or location, can receive grant aid of up to 50 per cent of their approved project costs. The Foynes project, involving the erection of mooring dolphins to facilitate the handling of bulk liquid cargoes, and the acquisition of a crane, is proceeding satisfactorily. The mooring dolphins have been installed and the first tanker has already discharged its cargo using the new facility which is very successful. The crane should be installed early in 1992.</P>
    <P>The principal objectives of the Government's commercial harbours policy in the medium term, which are being implemented through the operational programme on peripherality are to offset the effects of Ireland's peripheral location so that our exporters and importers do not suffer any further competitive disadvantage in relation to their European counterparts, and to ensure that Ireland has sufficient port facilities to meet the anticipated increase in trade expected following the completion of the Single Market in 1992.</P>
    <P>In determining the investment programme for seaports the Government decided that the major priority must be to ensure that there is appropriate port capacity and quality port infrastructure strategically located in relation to the main internal transport arteries. More specifically the investment programme for ports has been determined on the basis of two overriding considerations as follows: investment in ports which are essential for the efficient and economic movement of export goods and the import of raw material for manufacturing; essential preservation and development works at certain ports so that they can retain their existing capacity and employment and satisfy regional needs.</P>
    <P>These objectives are being pursued <Col N="1965" /> principally through the Operational Programme on Peripherality which is providing for investment in commercial ports of approximately £69 million in the years 1989-93. The operational programme is divided into two sub-programmes: The first, the peripherality sub-programme, is aimed at the larger commercial seaports and is to contribute to investments to offset the impact of Ireland's peripheral location. In conjunction with the EC Commission the Government have selected the key seaports of Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Rosslare for inclusion in this sub-programme. Not alone were the Government involved but the EC Commission was also involved in the selection of the key sea ports.</P>
    <P>The second, the sub-regional development sub-programme, is aimed at key regional seaports and though it is not of the same importance to offsetting the effects of peripherality, is of significance to the development of industry and tourism at sub-regional or local level.</P>
    <P>The strategy for ports included in the sub-regional development sub-programme ensure that appropriate port capacity and infrastructure are available on a regional basis. Investment in local ports will be primarily influenced by the ability of those ports to contribute to regional economic development. The target will be to increase the freight capacity of local ports by over 250,000 tonnes by 1993 and, through the provision of new quay space and mooring dolphins, to increase ship handling capacity at the key local ports of Drogheda, Dundalk, Foynes, Galway, Kinsale, Limerick and New Ross. Foynes is well able to take its place by areas with a greater population. The improvement in access to key local ports is aimed at opening up those ports' hintherlands to further industrial development. The improvement in inter-regional port links will bring benefits in the development of sea distribution links and reduce reliance on road traffic in the movement of heavy goods. The dry bulk trade will benefit <Col N="1966" /> from the proposed developments particularly for imports of animal feed.</P>
    <P>Local ports have an important role to play in the economic development of the regions and in retaining existing port-related employment in these areas. The Government have encouraged the development of key ports at sub-regional locations to cater for local industry and agriculture and promote sub-regional economic development. The growth of ports of such as Foynes illustrates this policy. Foynes and other local ports are set to continue expanding their trade and facilities in future years.</P>
    <P>I would stress that in early discussions with the EC Commission it became clear that it would be very difficult to justify the inclusion of ports located on the western seaboard in the peripherality sub-programme, which is primarily designated to reduce the effects of Ireland's peripheral location <i>vis-á-vis</i> its European trading partners.</P>
    <P>I have noted the points made by Senator Neville. However, it remains the case that the Foynes Harbour Trustees have a substantial project in the operational programme on peripherality. Financing this project is stretching the trustee's resources to the limit. The Senator will appreciate that the Operational programme on peripherality requires that harbour authorities fund up to 50 per cent of a project's total cost. The Foynes Harbour Trustees would have the greatest difficulty in undertaking either additional projects or a larger project.</P>
    <P>I should mention at this stage that a fundamental review of the regulatory framework of Irish commercial harbours is being carried out with a view to making the operation of these ports more efficient and effective. The objective of the review group is to update the policy and legislation pertaining to commercial harbours and pilotage. I will be happy to convey the views the Senator has expressed to the review group for consideration and I will ensure that these views will be borne in mind when the <Col N="1967" /> next programme for Structural Funds is being drawn up.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that Foynes is now the third biggest port in Ireland, why was it not graded as a commercial seaport?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> There are a number of reasons, including the fact that the Government and the EC in <Col N="1968" /> particular designated these ports. Secondly, as I have just outlined in my contribution, I doubt if Foynes would be able to stretch its resources to meet 50 per cent of the major costs that are involved in the other ports.</P>
