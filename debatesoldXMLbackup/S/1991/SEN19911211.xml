      <P>I have notice from Seanator Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to make provision for the disposal of clinical waste from hospitals which will not involve on-site incineration.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to alleviate the delays in the Land Registry and to make a statement on the future effeciency of the registry.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to outline the present position of the extension of the DART to Greystones, County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Costello, Neville and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Costello's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Neville and Ross may give notice another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>It is proposed today to take Item No. 2 Milk, (Regulation of Supply) (No. 2) Bill, 1991, Second Stage, to be completed by 6 p.m. There will be a sos from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. From 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. we will take the Independent motion, No. 58. At 8 p.m. we will take Item No. 3&mdash;the Order in draft in respect of the Regional Fisheries Boards (Postponement of Elections) Order, 1991.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he would arrange for statements in this House before Christmas on the outcome of the Maastricht Summit. I know we gave two days last week to a discussion on developments in the EC but we cannot beat our breasts and say we gave too much time to it as this is perhaps the most important European Summit meeting that has taken place since we joined the EC many years ago. Perhaps the Leader of the House could arrange with the Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; I accept the Taoiseach is a very busy man with many demands on him &mdash; for a statement reporting to this House on the outcome of the summit and a response by the leaders of the various groups. I appreciate that another lengthy debate probably would not be possible logistically this side of Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I also ask the Leader of the House if he could arrange to bring to a conclusion early in the New Year the debate on Seanad reform? On this side we will be prepared to come back two days earlier to give time to a most important topic. There is a danger that the whole issue of Seanad reform which concerns all of us in this House will be used as filler material when Ministers are not available or when we are waiting for Bills from the Dáil or whatever. I would like to see it spot-lighted, given its own scheduling and that we would complete the debate and decide where we will bring the issues to from there, whether to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or a special committee. We can decide ourselves as to how we will handle the most important issues that have come up. I request that <Col N="1499" /> at least two days is given to that debate early in the New Year to conclude it.</P>
    <P>May I also ask the Leader of the House whether all Stages or just Second Stage of the Criminal Damages Bill is envisaged to be scheduled for tomorrow. On this side we will only accept taking Second Stage, because this is a most important piece of legislation and we would hate to find any effort to rush through Committee and Report Stages all in the one day. To be meaningful, when dealing with legislation we should wait until Second Stage is completed before contemplating amendments for Committee and Report Stages. It makes nonsense of the role of the Seanad, and indeed the role of the Oireachtas, to rush all Stages through. I would like confirmation from the Leader that we will take only Second Stage tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a number of issues to raise. We had a very full debate last week on Maastricht and I disagree somewhat with the request made by the main Opposition party. What we need now is for the Minister to come back to this House and to report on what happened in Maastricht. There should then be a full debate on it. This is far more involved than something we can deal with by way of statements. We need a full debate on the outcome. We know very little about it except what has been reported in newspapers over the past few days. It is critically important that we now tease it out and see exactly where we are going and assess the implications. I would disagree somewhat with Senator Doyle, although I presume she was making the proposal on the basis that that perhaps was the best available. I think it is far too important to allow it to be reduced to statements. We need a full debate on where we are now and putting on the record what our Government have achieved there. There is no other way of receiving this information except trying to glean information from the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I take it that the Leader of the House intends putting a guillotine on the Milk Bill at 6 p.m. or that he would hope <Col N="1500" /> to put it to a vote at 6 p.m.? I notice from the nod by the Government Whip that he does not intend doing that, so that question is answered.</P>
    <P>On the question of a programme of legislation, I have asked again for an outline of the programme of legislation which will be dealt with by this House between now and the Christmas recess. I think we should have that now. The Leader should indicate to us on which days of Christmas week he intends that we should sit. There is only Monday and Tuesday, because it would be unacceptable to sit on Christmas Day. We should be careful about that. I am not sure why my colleagues are laughing. I presume it is the holiday spirit.</P>

      <P>They took you seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had no indication when the Appropriation Bill, which has to be discussed before Christmas, will be dealt with. It normally takes at least a full day to discuss that Bill, even in the truncated form we have dealt with it over the past number of years when we come back to it in January. In any event this House needs a certain amount of time to deal with it and this year, with the mid-year changes in the different Departments, it is something that will require more discussion.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Leader of the House when it is envisaged that the B &amp; I Bill will be dealt with in this House? My understanding is that the Government are required to have this dealt with before the Christmas recess. In the light of this fist in the face of the workers and management of B &amp; I, we should have adequate discussion of the Bill here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, may I ask the Leader of the House if he has any intention of allowing this House to debate the disgraceful and disastrous proposals of Government about the non-implementation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, which we discussed in this House less than a month ago to words of sweet wisdom and full support from the Fianna Fáil benches. I would now ask <Col N="1501" /> that the Leader of the House indicate to us that his party will stand firm on the commitments solemnly entered into in all the different areas of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and insist that they are put into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I support the calls for a debate or statements on the Maastricht Summit, which would be useful and desirable. Secondly, can I seek an assurance from the Leader of the House that he is not going to guillotine Second Stage debate on the Milk (Regulation of Supply) Bill, 1991, this afternoon? May I also ask the Leader of the House if he has any further information in relation to the use of strychnine and its ban in this country since I raised this matter with him last week?</P>
      <P>Finally, may I again ask the Leader of the House if he would be prepared to make time available for a debate or for statements on the present situation in Teagasc which seems now to be facing destruction? Certainly, it seems as if the institute at Grange is going to be converted into one of those country clubs where wealthy gentlemen play golf on weekday afternoons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the recent statements made by the Aer Lingus pilot's association and by Board Fáilte about the status and the possible overflying of Shannon Airport, I wish to ask the Leader of the House to have in the very near future a full debate in this House in order to let the people in the mid-west region know exactly where they stand. There are many conflicting reports and people in the mid-west region would like a full debate in the House. I would also like to ask the Leader of the House if he would consider bringing the Minister for Energy to this House to let us know exactly about the recommissioning of the Tarbert power station, units one and two, and when those units will come back into operation. Could he emphasise to the Minister and to the ESB that when employment is being created it will be taken locally from the north Kerry region where it is badly needed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>We have debated many important issues in this House but I think the single most important issue facing this country is unemployment and I would like to ask the Leader of the House to have a full-scale debate on that subject. It is the cause of so many of our problems in the country today that it is worthy of consideration by us.</P>
      <P>I would also like to support the call by Senator Upton for a debate on Teagasc. From what I hear in recent days it is now clear that the Government are about to destroy Teagasc by stealth. Most of the centres for research are about to be closed; this week the decision is to be made, or at least the initial discussion on the decision. This is the arm of research and development for our agriculture. We are being told day in and day out that we must diversify and cut costs, but to do that we need research and development. Therefore, I would like to ask the Leader if we could have a debate on this most important issue in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to express to the Minister with responsibility for Sport or whoever is the relevant authority the grave concern of this House at the stupid decision of the GAA authorities to ban a unique occasion at the RDS which was to take place next Sunday, at the fact that an organisation which has contributed so much to the youth and the general life of this country should have &mdash; I have to say it &mdash; a certain number of morons with their heads buried deeply in the sand making decisions like that. It is important that I express the concern I have that an association that should be doing so much to encourage the co-operation of young people in all facts of Irish life should make a stupid and appalling decision like that. As a lifetime member of the GAA and a former player of the GAA I am absolutely ashamed and appalled at the decision they have taken. It is putting back the unification of this country in all its facets, the bringing together of our young people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Leader of the House to bring the matter to the attention of the Minister with responsibility for Sport.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Kiely in relation to the status of Shannon Airport and ask the Leader to request the Minister to reaffirm the Government's commitment to the status of Shannon in view of the recent onslaught by the chief executive of Board Fáilte and by the airline pilots' Association. Shannon as an international airport is of vital importance to the nation, and if we are serious about regional development we have to ensure that the status of Shannon remains intact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Statements on the Role of the Seanad, on the Order Paper, may I ask the Leader if the decision was taken by this House that we would specifically exclude the Minister from coming along to hear those debates thereby limiting ourselves to trivial internal housekeeping changes where what is needed is a fundamental reform of this House? Would it be possible, even at this late stage, to have the Minister here? Our motion No. 53 would require changes in legislation which would necessitate the presence of the Minister here. Could that be done when we get around again to discussing the role of the Seanad?</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Raftery's request for a debate on unemployment, our motion for tonight, No. 58, which states in its final paragraph &ldquo;for the benefit of the Irish people&rdquo; will include a contribution to the whole problem of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to advise the Leader and Members that I share the concerns expressed across the floor about the future of Teagasc and its research centres. It is worth pointing out that these are management proposals and they have to go through several stages before they are implemented. However, it would be <Col N="1504" /> useful if we had a debate on these matters here. I would certainly take the view that the £1.5 million which was spent on Grange was money well invested in the beef industry and it reaps a benefit many times more than that. From that point of view I would like to have that debate.</P>
      <P>I would also share the view that it would be useful to have a report on the Maastricht Summit. The Minister for Agriculture and Food reported earlier in the year when we debated agriculture. While I am not sure that we need statements, a report would be very useful. We might be able to establish when the United Kingdom decides that it will join the Community, after all.</P>
      <P>The final question to the Leader is if he could advise us as to what his plans are to take the later Stages of the Milk (Regulation of Supply) Bill? When we have completed Second Stage, what are his plans for the other Stages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader his intentions in relation to the Criminal Damages Bill tomorrow? Second Stage and Committee Stage should not be taken on the same day and we should establish that as policy for all future legislation that comes before this House.</P>
      <P>I would like to echo the sentiments of Senator McKenna in relation to the GAA. I suggest that the Leader of the House would indicate to the Minister with responsibility for Sport the view expressed publicly &mdash; and it is certainly a view I would share &mdash; that it was an absolutely backwards decision of the GAA to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is out of order. I have informed Senator McKenna of the fact that he was not conforming with the requirements of the Order of Business. I must say the same to Senator Costello.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the House can do nothing about it. I suggest to the Senator that he would put a question to the Leader rather than some of the questions that have been put to him which were really asking him to deliver messages to other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I will rephrase my request. I ask the Leader of the House if he will consider taking up with the Minister with responsibility for Sport the concerns expressed in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in relation to the attitude to the GAA on this matter.</P>
      <P>The most important issue facing us at present is unemployment. We should have an urgent debate on that matter, as Senator Raftery said. Perhaps we could phrase it along the more positive lines suggested by Senator Harte in the past &mdash; that it be a debate on employment rather than unemployment because we should be directing our attention towards that aspect.</P>
      <P>The Minister should come in to this House immediately in order to report on the events which took place in Maastricht over the past couple of days. It is essential that we have a debate on this immediately. I would prefer if we had a full-scale debate first thing in the New Year after there has been time to reflect on it and to evaluate the implications, particularly the implications of the British derogation in relation to the Social Charter and social policy at the present time. That may have very far-reaching implications for us. We should deal with that at a fairly early stage, but I would suggest that it would be better that a full-scale debate would take place in the New Year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, will the Leader of the House allow a debate to take place in relation to the situation in Carysfort? That has been going on for a considerable length of time. All sorts of allegations have been <Col N="1506" /> made in the other House, and publicly, in relation to the use of public funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to ask a question because it is related to the other issue. The amount of moneys expended on the provision of sporting facilities in this country will have to be co-ordinated in the future. The GAA, the Rugby Football Union, the NACA, the BLE &mdash; everybody will have to get involved. I ask the Leader of the House to have a comprehensive discussion in this House on the provision of sporting facilities. It was stated here today that the GAA have their heads in the sand on this occasion &mdash; and I agree they have their heads in the sand &mdash; but are not the only sporting organisation in this country about whom that comment could be made. We have to get into the modern age. We must <Col N="1508" /> provide the necessary comprehensive facilities. There is no point in pointing the finger on this occasion at the GAA. I could point my finger at the IFRU and the FAI.</P>

      <P>The manner in which the Senator has approached this matter indicates clearly that he is out of order. Quite candidly, I must remind Members that a number of weeks ago there was criticism over the length of time spent on the Order of Business. I have not witnessed much co-operation here today in trying to minimise that amount of time to get to the other serious business of legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When will we have a full scale debate on the Irish banking system, not just on the report of the Ombudsman for credit institutions because that would be far too limited? What we need to know is why the banks deal so badly with small business. I will not venture into the GAA area.</P>

      <P>There is almost a double negative involved there. The Chair is telling me not to do what I was not going to do anyway. That could be taken as positive affirmation that I could do it.</P>
      <P>The other issue that was raised with some vigour is in relation to Teagasc. Do the Government propose to appoint a new Minister of State for science and technology?

    <P>I support Senator Raftery's request for a debate on unemployment. It is the biggest, most invisible and under-discussed problem in society. All of us in politics, in the media and every where else are, by definition, not unemployed. It does not impinge directly on anybody who is in a position to inform opinion with the result that it is left off the agenda.

Has the Leader of the House had an opportunity to read the Allowances to Members Acts, 1938 to 1983, and the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act?

This will be extremely complex legislation. Despite the Minister for Justice's point that he would introduce the Bill as soon as possible, I would not want to see it rushed through. I ask the Leader of the House to ensure that it is initiated here so that the debate will be worthwhile. We do not even know the definition of &ldquo;the family home&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We were told we would get the long promised Green Paper on Education before Christmas as it was published and ready since September. How soon can we expect it? In relation to what other Senators have said regarding the status of Shannon, we need a commitment from the Minister because there are so many conflicting rumours, statements and woolly thinking that nobody knows quite what is happening. We do not want to hear about things happening during the Christmas recess when we may not be as vigilant as we should be. I would like the Minister to clarify that he is retaining the status of Shannon.</P>

      <P>There are four questions I would like to ask. The first is in relation to Teagasc, the organisation which deals with research and advice on the agricultural front. We know that agriculture has had major difficulties in recent times and that highlights the need for an in-depth investigation into the work of Teagasc and the need for it to be in good shape. Could we have a debate on Teagasc to ensure that we have a dynamic agriculture in the future? What is the position with regard to the status of Shannon? Like other Senators I am confused about policy in relation to it and I would like if the Leader could establish, by way of a debate in this House or otherwise, what exactly is the position with regard to the status of Shannon. My understanding from Government statements and from the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications is that the status will be left unchanged. Those in the mid-west and the south west&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A number of Senators, including Senator Doyle, asked for statements in the House on the Maastricht Summit and I will endeavour to arrange that for next week. Senators Doyle, Hederman and others asked about continuing the Seanad reform debate. The intention is to continue with that but we will not have time for it before we break for Christmas. We will come back to it in the new session. The original proposal, despite what was felt by other Senators, is that initially the report will come to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges who will take it from there. The setting up of a committee is a matter for them.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle also asked about a debate, as did others, on the Criminal Damages Bill and the proposal is that we take Second Stage tomorrow to conclude at 4 p.m.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole asked for a debate on the Maastricht talks and asked what Bill had to be concluded before the end of this session. He also asked about the Milk (Regulation of Supply) (No. 2) Bill. We propose to debate it until 6 p.m. and if it is not concluded we will deal with it next week. We will not conclude Second Stage this evening if there are sufficient speakers. He also asked for a debate on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> I have no proposal for such a debate.</P>
      <P>The B &amp; I Line Bill, the Industrial Development (Amendment) Bill and the Appropriation Bill will be taken next week. The intention is to pass the Bill as we are obliged to do and to have one speaker from each side. We can come back as we have done in other years to debate the Bill in January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of speakers asked for a <Col N="1517" /> debate on Teagasc. I have no plans for that before Christmas. In regard to that and other matters raised by Senators, there is provision in Standing Orders for matters to be raised on the Adjournment, in Private Members' time and under Standing Order 29. The debate on the Appropriation Bill has been described in the past as an anything goes debate and unemployment, the banking system and many other issues could be raised then.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton asked about Teagasc and he also referred to the ban in the use of strychnine. The position in regard to the strychnine ban at the moment is that two draft orders were submitted to the EC Commission in September 1991. The orders, when introduced, will prohibit the use of strychnine for agricultural purposes and the storage, supply or sale of strychnine. The first will be signed by the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the second by the Minister for Health. The EC Commission has three months in which to notify other member states and to make a decision. This three month period will expire on 17 December 1991 following which a Commission decision will be made. We do not anticipate any difficulty in this area. In the meantime, the Department of Justice have been requested by phone, and in writing, to instruct the gardaí to refrain from issuing permits for the supply of strychnine to farmers.</P>
    <P>The five main importers of strychnine have been notified of the impending plan and have been requested to stop imports. When the orders are completed the farmers, through the local authorities and health boards, through pharmacies operating in the health board areas, will be asked to hand over unused supplies of strychnine.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton asked about Teagasc and I have replied to that; this would be appropriate for mention on the Appropriation Bill or in the other ways I have mentioned. I will bring to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Brennan, the concern of a number of Senators in relation to the stop-over at Shannon. I will bring to the attention of the Minister <Col N="1518" /> for Energy Deputy Kiely's concern regarding Tarbert station.</P>
    <P>Senator McKenna's point was not appropriate to the Order of Business. I noted Senator Dardis' comments on Teagasc. He asked about the Milk (Regulation of Supply) (No. 2) Bill, and, as I said, we will not finish it before Christmas. We will start it this afternoon and if we conclude Second Stage by 6 o'clock, that will be all right, but if not, we will continue it some other day.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello raised matters which were not appropriate to the Order of Business. Senator Lanigan asked for a debate on the funding of sporting groups. That is something we can think about in the New Year; it might well be an appropriate subject for a debate. He asked about the horse breeding industry. We had a major discussion on the Kilannin report. This and the greyhound industry are issues we can discuss in the New Year.</P>
    <P>Senators Neville and others asked about the Family Home Protection Bill. I understand that the Minister has indicated legislation is forthcoming and the draftsmen are working on it. Senator Brendan Ryan touched on matters which I indicated are appropriate to the Appropriation Bill or Private Members' Time. He looked for an open ended debate on unemployment. We can consider this in the new session.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Foighil referred to the Regional Fisheries Boards Order which we will take from 8 o'clock this evening. We should conclude that before 10 o'clock.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the dissolution of the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards and for their replacement by a new National Milk Agency. Before discussing the Bill I would like to set out in general terms the process which has now culminated in the Bill being placed before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards were established in 1936 and 1937, respectively, under the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Act, 1936, in order to ensure an adequate supply of liquid milk all the year round in the country's two big urban centres of population while guaranteeing a minimum price to producers and an acceptable price to consumers. Prior to 1936, producer milk prices had fallen below cost of production, causing a shortage of milk during the winter months. The milk boards system provides for a production district from which farmers supply milk <Col N="1520" /> and a sales district where processors and distibutors have to have a registered premises from which to supply milk to the consumer.</P>
    <P>In the case of Cork, the production and sales districts are the same, comprising the area within a four mile radius of Cork city centre. In Dublin, the sale district is the county of Dublin plus the urban centre of Bray, while the production district comprises most of the province of Leinster.</P>
    <P>Under the milk boards legislation, milk for liquid consumption in the Dublin and Cork sale areas had to be supplied under contract between the producer and purchaser and could be obtained only from milk producers registered with the District Milk Board and producing milk within the production district. The boards did, however, have power to licence registered processors and distributors to bring milk into a sale area from outside the production area during time of scarcity. The legislation also enabled the Minister for Agriculture and Food, with Government approval, to make statutory orders setting out the minimum producer price which must be paid to registered suppliers in Dublin and Cork by the registered wholesalers and retailers in the sale areas.</P>
    <P>While the board system formally applied only to the Cork and Dublin areas, it constituted a model for the arrangements which applied in other areas. The system worked well over the years and, despite the exaggerated seasonality pattern which obtains in Ireland, it ensured an adequate supply of good quality milk for the liquid market throughout the year. It was generally regarded as having been a major contributory factor in Ireland's high level of milk consumption.</P>
    <P>However, following complaints made by some dairies outside the board areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Nicely put.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I must declare an interest here. In 1985, I operated a dairy in West Cork and considered it quite unfair that I was outside the paid district milk board <Col N="1521" /> area. In the nature of things, I made representations to the Department of Agriculture to have this anomaly resolved and they looked into it and have been looking into it ever since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>So this is the Minister's Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that, six years later, having gone to Europe and back with this matter, I am now introducing this legislation to create a degree of fairness for milk producers and processors and, I hope, a more reasonable price for consumers. Producers in any part of Ireland can now be registered and supply milk to dairies and consumers in any part of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what any good Minister would do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Senator Honan. However, following complaints made by some dairies outside the board areas, the Commission of the European Communities formally notified the Department of Agriculture and Food that the boards were contrary to Community law and would have to be wound up. The Commission indicated that by maintaining an arrangement confining free access to the Cork and Dublin liquid milk market to registered producers processors and distributors located in the regions concerned, by subjecting the marketing of liquid milk of other origin to a board licensing scheme and by maintaining an arrangement imposing a minimum producer price for liquid milk, Ireland had failed to comply with obligations incumbent upon it under the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products and Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of advice from the Attorney General, it was clear that the outcome of this case, if the Commission were to bring Ireland to the European Court of Justice, would be unlikely to be favourable. At the same time, it is crucially important that the liquid milk <Col N="1522" /> market in Ireland should not be left without some regulatory system because of the risk that, with the seasonality pattern which exists here, a free-for-all system could leave the market short of liquid milk in the winter months as had happened previously in some areas outside Cork and Dublin. Therefore, I instructed my Department to consult with the EC Commission with a view to arriving at alternative arrangements which would provide for the orderly arrangement of the liquid milk market in the interests of both producers and consumers and which would be in accordance with EC law. The central provision of the Bill now before the House is the result of this lengthy process of consultations with the Commission.</P>
    <P>Both the central provisions of the Bill and the more detailed provisions have also been the subject of consultation with the various sides of the liquid milk industry. All sides of the industry are committed to the establishment of the agency and I am satisfied that the agency, which will be financed entirely by the industry itself through a statutory levy on milk sales, will ensure the orderly development of the liquid milk market in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The production, processing, marketing and distribution of milk for direct human consumption is vital to the continuance of a strong and healthy dairying sector in Ireland. The liquid milk industry provides a stable outlet for about 10 per cent of our total milk production with high employment levels and good returns for producers. There are at present 4,300 milk suppliers supplying 42 liquid plants with milk with a retail value of some £260 million per year. There are about 5,000 workers employed in collection, processing, packaging and distribution. Unlike most of Europe, liquid milk continues to be an essential part of the diet in Ireland. While <i>per capita</i> consumption has declined from a peak of 211 litres in 1984 to its present level of 176 litres per annum, Ireland still remains one of the largest milk drinking countries in the world, ranking third to Finland and Iceland.</P>
    <P>The existing milk boards in addition to <Col N="1523" /> their statutory functions of regulating the supply and price of milk in the Dublin and Cork districts also operate a number of ancillary services to encourage the production and quality of milk in their areas. The Cork board has a total of nine permanent full-time staff carrying out its regulatory function and providing artificial insemination and milk recording services throughout its area. The Dublin board in addition to its regulatory function operates a broader range of ancillary services, namely, a cattle progeny testing service, milk quality and mastitis control services, etc., in addition to A.I. and milk recording services, and has a total of 117 permanent full-time staff.</P>
    <P>The boards ancillary businesses have declined over the last few years and, consequently, their financial position is deteriorating. If the boards ancillary services are to remain viable &mdash; under whatever future arrangements may apply &mdash; a rationalisation programme will be needed. It is my intention that the maximum number of jobs will be maintained and the best means of ensuring this has been under consideration for some time. Representatives of the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of Finance have been discussing this matter with trade union officials and staff. These discussions are ongoing and a further meeting with the trade unions and staff will be held shortly. A package designed to achieve 50 redundancies on a voluntary basis is under preparation and will shortly be presented.</P>
    <P>Senators will note that section 3 of the Bill provides that the orders dissolving the boards shall come into effect on the date of establishment of the new agency. Senators will also note under section 2 of the Bill that the agency will not be established until such time as the Minister makes an order to that effect. It is my expectation that the position regarding future employment for the board's staff will be settled before the establishment of the agency. I realise that this is the most contentious part of the Bill. Discussions and negotiations are ongoing <Col N="1524" /> and further meetings will be held in order to resolve this matter.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is the standard definitions section and requires no specific comment.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the establishment by order of the Minister for Agriculture and Food of the National Milk Agency to regulate the supply of Milk for liquid consumption. The agency is to be composed of persons nominated by producer, processor, distributor, retail and consumer interests and a chairman, who will be independent of these interests, will be appointed by the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>The basic purpose of the new agency is to ensure the making available to the consumer at a reasonable price of a quality product on an all-year-round basis and, in the process, to ensure the continued high level of consumption <i>per capita</i> in this country to the benefit of the farmer, the dairies and the trade. It will be necessary to have representatives of all these interests on the board of the agency in order to achieve this aim.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the dissolution of the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards by order of the Minister for Agriculture and Food and for matters consequential on the making of the dissolution orders. The consequential matters will include aspects relating to the ending of supply and price regulation of milk in the districts of Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>Section 4 prohibits the sale and purchase in the State of milk for liquid consumption except where the milk has been purchased from a registered producer under a registered contract or from a registered processor who has, in turn, purchased the milk from a registered producer under the registered contract and which has been heat treated by a registered processor in accordance with the Milk and Dairies Acts. The section provides for penalties for contravention of the provisions. The section also provides for certain exemptions from the prohibition.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 4 is to bring all milk of Irish origin destined for the <Col N="1525" /> consumer under the registration system to be operated by the new agency. The freedom of registered processors (dairies) to dispose of their milk for human consumption in any part of the State, provided they meet certain conditions, is implicit in this provision. It is necessary, however, to make an exception to these requirements in certain instances &mdash; where the Minister for Health by order authorises the sale of such milk in special circumstances, for example, the authorisation of the sale of raw milk in a remote or island part of the country; where in times of shortage the Minister for Agriculture and Food allows a creamery supply milk to the liquid market or where milk is used by the producer for home consumption. No restrictions under this legislation apply to milk legally imported into the State.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the conditions for the registration of contracts by the agency. The section provides that the contract period must be for a minimum of 12 months; that the contract specifies that the untreated milk supplied by the producer will meet the quality standards set down by the agency; that the contract provides for all year round supply by the producer of untreated milk with a specified minimum percentage of the producer's production being supplied during the winter months or for supply during the winter months only; that the contract, in the opinion of the agency, provides adequate compensation to the producer for untreated milk supplied under the contract throughout the year, in particular for milk supplied in the winter months. The section also provides for the continued registration of the contract to be dependent on the submission annually of a supplement to the contract which must satisfy the agency that adequate compensation will be offered to the producer for the supply of milk during the winter months.</P>
    <P>The three substantial concerns of the contract &mdash; milk of appropriate quality, all year round supply and adequate compensation for the producer &mdash; are interlinked. Given the grass-based, summer <Col N="1526" /> intensive pattern of Irish milk production, the quality and continuity of supply especially during the winter months cannot be guaranteed except under a regulatory system offering security of demand and adequacy of compensation to the producer for the extra costs involved in winter milk production.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of a provision in the legislation setting down a minimum compensatory price as such to the producer has been ruled out by the EC Commission. The agency will, however, be empowered to refuse to register contracts which do not involve price levels sufficient in its view to compensate producers for all year period production, in particular to compensate for the extra costs of winter milk production. The mechanism is a level of compensation to the producer below which the agency will refuse to register the contract. Also the continued registration of the contract will be dependent on the submission annually of a supplement to the contract which must satisfy the agency that adequate compensation will be offered to the producer for the supply of milk during the winter months.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that the agency shall maintain a register of contracts, a register of producers and a register of processors and requires no specific comment.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the payment of a levy by milk processors to the agency. The section provides that the rate of levy and the accounting period will be set down by order of the Minister for Agriculture and Food. The section also provides for future adjustments in the rate of levy. In the event of non-payment of the levy the section provides for the issue of certificates of indebtedness in the matter, and for the cancellation of the registration of any processor who fails to make, or falsifies, a return connected with the requirements of this section and for necessary penalties for such failure or falsification. This levy will be the means of financing the agency.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 provide for the keeping of records by registered producers and processors, their obligation to produce these records to the inspector <Col N="1527" /> and the making of returns to the agency. The maintenance of correct records by registered producers and registered processors and effective access to these on the part of the agency with a view to verifying that all milk reaching the consumer has validly come through the registered producer/processor contract system and that the producer has been properly compensated, will be crucial to the success of the new regulatory system.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the publication of contents of registers and other matters. Section 11 makes provision for a change of registration on death or transfer of business. Section 12 provides for the alteration or cancellation of registration by the agency and the reason for so doing. Section 13 deals with provisions in relation to the use of registers in evidence. Section 14 specifies the powers of inspection and examination available to persons authorised by the agency to carry out such functions. Section 15 prohibits the disclosure of information by members and officers of the Agency and provides for penalties for such disclosure. Section 16 provides that the agency shall keep, maintain and manage a fund into which all moneys received by the agency under this Bill shall be paid and from which all payments arising under the Bill shall be made. This section also provides the agency with borrowing powers.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides that the agency keep appropriate accounts, books and records and submit an annual audited statement of accounts and an annual report of its proceedings and the report is to be laid by the Minister before each House of the Oireachtas. These requirements and the requirement to provide the Minister with such information, statistics and returns as he may request will allow appropriate supervision of the agency's activities.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides that any producer or processor may appeal any decision of the agency acting in discharge of its functions under this legislation to an officer of the Minister in the first instance and to the courts in the second instance.</P>
    <P>Section 19 allows the Minister to make <Col N="1528" /> regulations in relation to matters covered by the Bill and requires that such requirements are laid before each House of the Oireachtas. Such regulations may be annulled by a resolution passed by either House within a period of 21 sitting days after the regulations are laid before it. This is a standard section.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides for the repeal of the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Acts, 1936 to 1967. These repeals will take effect on the date of establishment of the National Milk Agency. It is of course desirable that the date of the dissolution of the milk boards and the setting up of the agency be concurrent, so that the functions of the agency would take effect simultaneously with the cessation of the functions of the milk boards.</P>
    <P>Section 21 is a standard provision relating to the expenses of the Minister for Agriculture and Food under the Act. Section 22 contains the Short Title.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 1 of the Schedule provides for matters governing the position of the part-time chairman of the agency, his appointment, allowances, expenses and the temporary incapacity. As already indicated the chairman will be independent of the interests represented on the agency and will be appointed by the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs 2 to 10 of the Schedule provide for matters relating to the ordinary members of the agency. Representatives of liquid milk producers have expressed a strong preference for the appointment of producer members by an election process. Members representing other interests on the agency board will be appointed by the Minister for Agriculture and Food on the nomination of the appropriate industry and trade bodies. Accordingly, while all ordinary members will hold office for three years, the producer members will be elected every three years and the other ordinary members will be appointed every three years by the Minister on the nomination of the respective interests. However, the first set of ordinary members &mdash; of whichever category &mdash; will be appointed by the Minister on the nomination of all the respective groups. <Col N="1529" /> These paragraphs also provide for the method of election, term of office, resignation and disqualification, filling of casual vacancies, temporary substitution and allowances for expenses.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 11 of the Schedule provides that the agency shall appoint a chief executive and such other staff as the agency considers necessary for the due performance of its functions. Such officers shall be employed on such terms and conditions and shall perform such duties as the agency directs. The staff shall be paid such remuneration and allowances as the Minister for Agriculture and Food, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, appoints. The section also provides that the agency may purchase, lease or otherwise acquire such offices as it considers necessary for the performance of its functions and may sell, lease or otherwise dispose of part or all of such office or premises.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 12 of the Schedule provides for the preparation and submission to the Minister for Agriculture and Food of a superannuation scheme or schemes for the permanent whole-time staff of the agency which will fix the time and condition of retirement for such persons; it also provides that the agency may submit an amending scheme or schemes; that any scheme submitted is subject to the approval of the Ministers for Agriculture and Food and Finance; that, if any dispute arises as to the claim of any person to, or the amount of, any allowance payable under this provision, this claim will be submitted to the Minister for Agriculture and Food, who shall refer it to the Minister for Finance whose decision shall be final.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 13 of the Schedule provides for the procedure governing the activities and meetings of the agency. Paragraph 14 of the schedule requires the agency to provide itself with a seal and sets down certain procedures regarding such seal.</P>
    <P>Senators will understand that I have had to speak at some length on the Bill. It was necessary to explain the background and need for changes in some detail. I am sure Senators will respond in a positive manner. I will deal with any specific <Col N="1530" /> points raised in my reply to the debate. I would like to thank the Government Chief Whip, the Cathaoirleach and all Members of the House for taking this legislation in the Seanad. It was originally ordered for the Dáil but as their agenda was crowded before the Christmas recess, I requested that it be taken in the Seanad. I believe it is good to introduce legislation in the Seanad where I have found thorough examination and good, objective public debate. I am glad this legislation was introduced in the Seanad and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming here and for initiating this Bill in this House. It is appropriate, as Senator Doyle said, that the Minister Deputy Walsh, should introduce this Bill. In his private capacity he was probably the main individual to precipitate the disbandment of the Dublin and Cork Milk Boards. I do not regret the disbandment of these boards; it was a move in the right direction and I welcome this Bill to set up a new milk agency. I am pleased to note that special consideration will be given to existing services provided by the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards &mdash; such as cattle breeding services &mdash; and to their staff. I hope a satisfactory resolution will be arrived at and that staff will be provided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that producers and processors will have to be registered which is right. I suggest that retailers should also be registered since they are part of the chain between production and the consumer. In order to achieve comprehensive coverage and protection for the consumer, it would have been a step in the right direction to have retailers registered. I am puzzled to know in the event of a challenge to the agency to establish an appropriate price to ensure continued supply for the consumer how the agency will decide on an appropriate price. We now know that existing milk producers can have a variation of as much as 30 pence per gallon in their production costs. I could foresee a challenge where someone would try to prove that he or she could <Col N="1531" /> produce milk at less than the price ordained by the agency in order to get a chance to produce milk all year round. This would be more lucrative than seasonal milk production.</P>
    <P>I am glad also to note that this Bill gets the general approval of all farming organisations and processors. I am not sure to what extent retailers expressed approval or disapproval of the Bill. The Minister outlined the background to it. We had legislation going back as far as 1936 to regulate the supply and price of liquid milk on the home market. The Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Act, 1936, ensured year round supply of liquid milk as the Minister said. In recent years, because of European Community legislation, it became apparent that existing milk boards would have to go. This legislation is the outcome.</P>
    <P>The main features of the new National Milk Agency will be, first, that all dairies and liquid milk producers must be registered with the agency. I would like to see retailers also registered. Secondly, registration with the agency will require producers to meet specified technical standards and to have a written contract with a registered dairy guaranteeing all-year round supply. In addition, all such contracts will have to be registered with the agency.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the agency will be empowered to monitor the terms of the contracts to ensure that they do not contain provisions which jeopardise the all-year round supply of liquid milk. In particular, the agency will be empowered to refuse to register contracts which do not include a milk price sufficient to meet the costs of winter milk production. I feel we will have some disputes about this issue in years ahead. Lastly, the agency will be, rightly, empowered to withdraw registration from producers or dairies who do not observe the terms of the contracts.</P>
    <P>The liquid milk market in the public is worth about £260 million per annum. Ireland has the highest level of milk consumption in the European Community and the second highest in Europe &mdash; with Finland significantly higher. I want to say <Col N="1532" /> something about that later. Annual <i>per capita</i> consumption was put at 170 litres but if we make allowances for visitors, etc. it is probably nearer to 150 litres.</P>
    <P>Total liquid milk sales in 1990 amounted to 490 million litres. Sales reached their peak in 1984 and have declined consistently since then. While factors such as an ageing population and so on may have something to do with it, I feel there may be other factors involved. It would be a pity if our levels of consumption dropped to those of some European countries, for instance, Italy or Spain. That would be bad for the consumers, the processors and the retailers but especially for the producers.</P>
    <P>Whole milk, natural or standardised fat level sales account for approximately 90 per cent of total Irish liquid milk sales. This is out of line with sales in other countries. In the Netherlands low fat or skimmed milk consumption now amounts to over two-thirds of the liquid market. Taking the European Community liquid market as a unit, the low fat milk consumption figure is now higher than the consumption figure for whole milk. Implications arise out of that development for butter fat; we already have huge EC surpluses of butter fat and it now seems that consumers of liquid milk are showing a preference for low fat milk thereby sending more butter fat on to the market.</P>
    <P>Based on the CSO Household Budget Survey the average milk bill is about 9 per cent of total expenditure on food. I was surprised it was so high but that is what the CSO figure shows. For the average household of 3.5 persons the estimated weekly cost of milk was £6 which is, incidentally, double the amount paid for bread. With regard to distribution, we have had some fun in that area recently and I will be surprised if we do not have more in the near future. The real objective of the multiples &mdash; particularly Dunnes Stores &mdash; was to gain market share and we are probably now witnessing the beginning of an inevitable and determined campaign by supermarkets to capture a much higher share. If the producers and bottlers are disappointed <Col N="1533" /> with this development they have only themselves to blame &mdash; particularly the processors.</P>
    <P>The history of the situation is that processors gave a discount of at least 30 per cent to the multiples in order to gain market share. Then, having been making what I would describe as exorbitant profits, Dunnes Stores in their wisdom decided to drop the price of liquid milk by nine pence per litre. The immediate reaction of the processors was to deny liquid milk to Dunnes Stores. In effect, they were foolishly trying to force Dunnes Stores to continue making exorbitant profits.</P>
    <P>The consumer was surely entitled to milk at a reasonable price. Why should milk processors give a 30 per cent discount plus three months credit plus cold cabinets in the supermarkets to the big retailers? Why should they give those terms to multiples and not to poor people who were getting up at 5 a.m. to do door-to-door milk deliveries or to small shopkeepers? The producers' actions enabled multiples to continue making exorbitant profits which, on the basis of my calculations, must have been of the order of £20 million per year.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that milk retailing will expand in supermarkets and shops, with fewer door-to-door deliveries. Certain people say that the trend will reduce milk consumption but I am not sure of this. I have conflicting figures here from the National Prices Commission Report 1979, AFT Report 1984 and Market Research Sources. Some of these figures indicate that the percentage of door-to-door deliveries is down as low as 41 per cent. There are other findings of 51 per cent and 55 per cent for door-to-door delivery percentages but the trend in this and in every other country is for an increasing quantity of liquid milk to be distributed by the retail trade.</P>
    <P>It is usually contended that a doorstep delivery network is essential to keep up consumption levels, particularly for high milk consumption countries such as Ireland, Britain and some others. I have difficulty reconciling that argument with <Col N="1534" /> the figure I gave earlier of Finland having the highest level of milk consumption in Europe. The Finns have had no milk delivery service for quite a long time. It is 31 years since I first observed that in Helsinki. Nevertheless, their level of consumption is significantly higher than ours. In the US, where over 95 per cent of sales are through retail outlets, milk consumption has increased in recent times. The overall decline in consumption per head in Denmark over the past seven years has been about the same as for Ireland despite the switch in Denmark to an exclusive retail system. I cannot therefore, accept that reducing the proportion of milk delivered to the door will result in a decline in milk consumption. There is a feeling that it will do so but there is no evidence.</P>
    <P>The big retailers can get credit terms and do not really have to handle the milk at all. The processor delivers it and fills the cold cabinets. The customer picks it up, takes it to the check-out and pays for it on the nail. The retailer pays for it three months later. As I see it, the trend will be for more of the milk to go through the retail outlets and less in door-to-door deliveries. However, there will be some people who, for one reason or another will want to buy milk in the small corner shop or have it delivered to their door. These people must be catered for as they may be old or infirm.</P>
    <P>The Minister who is involved may be uneasy about my conclusions in relation to the price of milk. The margin between what the consumer pays and what the producer gets is difficult to explain. It is difficult to calculate what the producer gets because of variation at different times of the year and different quantities but I estimate an average of £1.05 per gallon. It is a very simple process, as the Minister knows, to pasteurise milk, put it into containers and deliver it to the shop. The consumer pays roughly £2.50 per gallon. I find it difficult to see how pasteurisation and retailing can command £1.50 per gallon whereas production by the farmer commands only £1.05 per gallon.</P>
    <P>The retail price of milk in Ireland was <Col N="1535" /> decontrolled with effect from 1 December 1988, four years after the UK Government had deregulated milk prices. At present the only price regulation is at producer level, which will continue under the new agency. There have been price changes between 1985 and 1991. The price per litre of milk in Ireland has gone up from 40p to 52.8p and a little higher in some places; in other words a 32 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>One might draw a number of conclusions from these price changes. First the combined mark-up by dairies, distributors and retailers has increased by 8.5p a litre since 1985. Part of this increase can be justifiably attributed to the abolition of the consumer subsidy which was paid directly to pasteurisers. However, no more than 4p a litre can be justified to cover the loss of subsidy receipts, which leaves an increased mark-up of 4.5p a litre at present. The figures show that the increased mark-up, after allowing for the subsidy withdrawal in 1990, was 8p a litre on average over the 1985 level.</P>
    <P>Secondly increased cost of processing and distribution during the period would require an increased mark-up of 4p a litre, assuming the mark-up of 20p a litre in 1985 was justified. Thirdly, distribution costs associated with doorstep deliveries are much higher and probably amount to 20 per cent of the retail price. The price difference in England between doorstep deliveries and supermarkets is up to 11p sterling per litre. Therefore, it could be argued that in Ireland, an excess margin of 10p a litre is being taken by retailers, amounting to over £20 million nationally for a full year. I believe that needs to be examined because some of them &mdash; including the gentleman who tried to drop the price of milk and got rapped on the knuckles &mdash; are making an exhorbitant profit.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It is long overdue. I am grateful to the Minister for playing his part, in his private capacity, in undermining the existing legislation. I am delighted that producers in any part of the country will be eligible now, provided <Col N="1536" /> they meet the criteria, to supply milk to processors for the liquid milk trade. I believe more of the milk will be sold through retail outlets and the cost of a delivering to the door will increase. The price difference between the retail outlet and door-to-door delivery will increase. It is an inevitable process that will hurt some people but it would be against all logic and the laws of economics to force the sector who can operate more cheaply to charge more and thereby penalise the consumers. On the basis of the evidence I have seen from elsewhere, I do not and cannot accept that getting rid of or cutting down the amount of door-to-door deliveries will result in the tragedy of a huge drop in consumption as the processors suggest. There is no evidence to support their view. The country with the highest consumption of milk in the world is Finland where they have not had a door-to-door delivery for a long time. Although 95 per cent of the milk in the United States is sold through big multiple retail outlets, they are increasing their consumption of milk. Denmark has ceased to have door-to-door deliveries and their decline in consumption is no greater than ours. The processors behaved very foolishly when they decided to withdraw supplies to a retailer who, in his generosity, decided to give good value for money to the consumer.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill to the House, congratulate the Minister, Deputy Walsh, on ploughing a lone furrow at times, initiating this Bill in the good old days and bringing it before the House today. It is very important that he is introducing this Bill in the Seanad because, more than anybody else, he knows what is involved having been connected with the industry even before he went into politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the provisions of the Bill have been the subject of consultations between the various bodies involved in the liquid milk industry and that there has been agreement from all sides and also with the EC Commission. It was obvious that something like this <Col N="1537" /> would have to happen once the continuation of the Dublin and Cork Milk Boards was found to be in contravention of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>It is important that agreement has been reached between the various sides involved in the liquid milk industry. What they are doing is for the betterment of the industry. It is important that suppliers, processors and the other people involved, should be registered. I agree with Senator Raftery that retailers should also be registered. It is important that the whole chain should be registered to ensure we have a better agency and a better industry for the benefit of everybody involved.</P>
    <P>While there is general agreement in the industry, the one area of contention involves the employees of the now defunct board. I hope that before the new board is established the employees' future will be taken care of. I understand their concern when no provision is being made for their jobs or futures. Fifty or 100 people cannot be thrown on the scrap heap; they must be looked after. A solution would be to include a provision in this Bill to transfer all the staff of the Dublin and Cork Boards to employment with the new milk agency, and to second them to the private company. Alternatively, they could be offered voluntary redundancy or redeployment in the public service. That could be done because a precedent was set in the case of An Foras Forbartha in 1988. That is the only area of contention. I would like the Minister to devote some time to resolving that problem with the existing staff. If he does, he can start this new agency on a sound footing.</P>
    <P>Over the years the liquid milk industry has developed. Even in remote rural areas, there is daily delivery to householders one would not have imagined to be interested in buying liquid milk. They are now getting their milk delivered every day. It is important that we have good quality milk. That can be ensured by means of a proper register, which is the task of this new agency. I hope it will provide better quality milk and that the industry will develop and prosper over <Col N="1538" /> the years. In that way it will be better for all of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I also welcome his initiative in putting this legislation before us. It is a necessary measure as the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards were governed by legislation which is no longer acceptable within the EC framework. However, that does not take from the very acceptable and comprehensive way in which the Bill deals with this subject because in the past only Cork and Dublin were governed but now the entire country is covered. The establishment of the milk agency on a national basis as distinct from having two boards is a forward move. Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards were run cohesively but, at the same time, they were separate entities.</P>
      <P>We would be failing in our duty if we did not acknowledge the great service the Dublin and Cork Milk Boards provided for the people they served. In the Leinster area, the Dublin Milk Board and, in the Southern area, the Cork Milk Board, served the people very well. Not alone did they guarantee milk supplies for the cities but they did great work providing an artificial insemination service, keeping milk records, and so on. We must pay tribute to those who have acted on the boards, their chairmen and chief executives. The present chairman-cum-chief executive has performed very well in the last ten or 15 years when he was appointed to that office. This Bill stipulates that, in future, there will be a separate chairman and chief executive. This new approach has much to commend it. The chairman will henceforth work on a part-time basis. Up to now, one person held the post of chairman and chief executive in a full-time capacity. I would like to pay tribute to the excellent input of the present incumbent, for the giant role he has played in recent years. This Bill provides an opportunity for liquid milk producers throughout the country from Donegal to Wexford, from Monaghan to Kerry and in the areas in between to have a guaranteed milk price all year round. This is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1539" /> While 44 years of excellent work by the Dublin and Cork Milk Boards have passed, we are now in a new era and we must make certain we develop along the right lines. We have a very high consumption <i>per capita</i> of milk, the third highest in Europe, after Finland and Norway. Another important factor is that we have more livestock than people in this country, which shows how agriculturally based we are and how important is this industry. Any aspect of it, be it liquid milk or whatever, requires and deserves attention.</P>
    <P>Various assets have been built up arising from the 1936 legislation which set up the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards. These are now matters for disposal or for placing to the best advantage by the Minister, the new chairman and the new board. The Minister has indicated that the directors representing the producers will be elected by the producers; but I gather from the Minister's remarks that in the first instance the board will be exclusively appointed by the Minister from persons nominated from the various organisations. Am I right in that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a good way to go about it because, having elections when the machinery is not in place, might not be the best thing to do. This is a forward move to get the new board off the ground. The various interests at producer, processor, retail and consumer levels will all put forward nominations to the Minister for consideration and these people will be appointed to the board and it is right and proper that the Minister should have the final say in their ratification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many ancillary matters in relation to liquid milk which I believe are very important. One that has been very effectively carried out by the present Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards is that of milk recording. Now that quality is more important than quantity, it is vital that we have milk recording and research in this area that will enable farmers to <Col N="1540" /> produce precisely what the market wants. We are severely restricted through quotas, in the amount we can produce for a market, but in the context of quality, I believe we have a long road to go before we produce fat and protein levels up to the standard of our competitors.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the magnificent work that has been done in the milk recording service area. There is no point producing massive supplies of a product that is not required.</P>
    <P>I would like to dwell for a moment on consumer taste and interests as they apply to milk and milk products because the presentation of liquid milk is a very important factor. It will dictate the level of consumption. We must carry out research into what the housewife and the consumer want, whether in Dublin, Limerick, Cork or Sligo, and, in the case of the agricultural products we export, what is wanted in the markets of London, Berlin or elsewhere. In other words, we must find out precisely what the consumer's taste is, what the consumer is looking for and we must produce to that taste and to that requirement. Too often in the past we have produced vast amounts of products, but, with very effective selling mechanisms at home and abroad, we have forcibly disposed of our products through very ingenious marketing techniques. Frankly, this is not the way to operate on an ongoing basis. We must go out first and discover what is required.</P>
    <P>This would not be a major point in the context of liquid milk in this island but it would be a factor, in principle, because the presentation of the product and its capacity to hold its quality is very important. I got cartons of milk delivered to the door which were found wanting. Surprisingly, this product can go off in a very short time. Emphasis must be placed on quality and making sure that we produce only the very best. We must start by producing good milk with a high protein content and all the other vital and desirable ingredients, and then have it correctly processed and marketed.</P>
    <P>I agree totally with the way the board is to be made up. I am also glad to know <Col N="1541" /> that this organisation will be self-financing by means of a levy which will be imposed on the producers. For that reason very little Exchequer help will be required and I understand it will be a nominal amount. That is a very healthy situation. It shows that the business can stand on its own. It is a good headline showing that businesses do become viable in their own right and that agencies of this sort do not need to be propped up.</P>
    <P>There is also employment involved in this area. This is very welcome because every additional job is important to us nowadays. As we proceed, hopefully more and more jobs will emanate from this arena. I would like to think that this new National Milk Agency will diversify in the future and look at other areas where they could have an input. Lack of diversification and alternatives has been one of our biggest failures in recent years. We have tended to stay on one path and not deviate from it. That has been a retrograde move and has not enhanced our position.</P>
    <P>It is very expensive to produce milk for liquid consumption at a certain time of the year, especially when we consider that our winter lasts for at least four months. For that reason it is only fair that farmers should be adequately compensated to produce a sufficient supply of high quality milk. I could go on about the various aspects of the Bill but I do not propose to do so because it is unnecessary to repeat what has already been said.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister and all concerned with its introduction. However, I would like an indication from the Minister that at some time in the future the National Milk Agency might be used as a vehicle to deal with other matters; we should keep an open mind on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I acknowledge that this legislation is close to his heart and is something in which he has a personal interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the legislation and realise it <Col N="1542" /> is necessary. To some extent it has been imposed on us by decisions made in the European Community. In that context it underlines one matter which is worth referring to. During the past week there has been much talk about sovereignty and the fact that national parliaments would become virtually redundant if many powers were devolved to the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council in Brussels. This legislation underlines the fact that the national Parliament has a very important function within the European context. I am very much in favour of the famous &ldquo;F&rdquo; word &mdash;not the one Mr. Mitterrand used&mdash;but the concept of federalism within Europe, that even within the context of greater unity and greater federalism there will still be an important role for the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>We must accept that a commodity so necessary to every day living must have a degree of regulation and control. Of course, it is the extent of the control and regulation which is in question.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the purpose of the Bill and I agree wholeheartedly with his sentiments that the basic purpose of the agency is to ensure making available to the consumer at a reasonable price a quality product all year round and, in the process, to ensure the continued high level of consumption, <i>per capita</i>, to the benefit of the farmer, the dairies and the trade. He also said it will be necessary to have representatives of all these interests on the board of the agency in order to achieve this aim. That is a concise and accurate summary of what this legislation attempts to achieve. However, I have grave concerns about the security of the employees in the milk boards and I will deal with that later.</P>
    <P>The original legislation has served us well. It provided us with a degree of stability, quality and supply necessary to keep the urban population supplied with milk. However, as we are aware, under Community law it was found to be invalid and in 1988 the Commission informed us that a new national milk agency was required. The time taken to introduce this legislation could be criticised, but I <Col N="1543" /> welcome the fact that this Bill has been initiated in the Seanad. This is the second piece of legislation in my time to have been initiated in this House, the other being the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.</P>
    <P>Society owes a debt to liquid milk producers. I come from a constituency where there are a substantial number of liquid milk producers. Over the years they have set a headline for other farmers to provide the product quality to which the consumer is entitled. There is a great deal of talk nowadays about providing quality goods which will sell in Europe and about providing food of a high standard that will sell on the domestic and European markets. At a time when there was very little talk about quality, our liquid milk was of a consistently high standard with which the consumer could be happy. They set an important headline for producers of other agricultural commodities &mdash;they were prepared to accept the substantial discipline involved in producing this quality product.</P>
    <P>It is certainly not easy to milk cows in the middle of the winter and those who can remember 20 years ago will recall the hardship faced by farmers when milking cows. We must pay tribute to them for their resilience and commitment over so many years and as far as I am aware, there was never any major hiccup in terms of milk supply, even when the weather was very inclement. People who provide that type of service and produce a high quality product should be rewarded.</P>
    <P>Our liquid milk consumption which has been put at 143 litres per head of population per annum is the highest in the Community and, as Senator Raftery said, only Finland, which is outside the Community, has a higher consumption. Of course, there are historical reasons for our high consumption but it is also because over the years liquid milk producers consistently supplied a high quality product and we should record our gratitude to them.</P>
    <P>It is also important that there be competition within the industry on the processing and supply sides to ensure that <Col N="1544" /> the consumer gets an adequate product at the right price while securing a year round supply; it is important that supply be secured on a year round basis. There have been some difficulties in that regard in recent years. Some figures I have seen indicate there was a 9 per cent fall in the supply of milk over the past ten months. Frequently, in debates on agriculture in this House we have highlighted the problem of seasonality in the supply of milk and beef, which is becoming more and more serious. The fact that in the past we relied so heavily on intervention has been a contributory factor.</P>
    <P>The seasonality aspect may be dealt with to some extent under the Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals but, obviously, much more serious side-effects to the Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals with which we have dealt in this House. We should be more aware of the seasonality problem. Again, this underlines the need to adequately reward those who produce winter milk to ensure that the supply is regular and that over the winter months the consumer gets adequate milk supplies. I welcome the fact that the Bill states a specified minimum percentage of the producers production must be supplied during winter months and that the contract must satisfy the agency that adequate compensation will be offered to the producer for supply of milk during this time. One could argue that, by inference, there is no additional benefit to those who supply milk during the summer months compared to those supplying milk used in the manufacturing process. It is a much more onerous task to produce milk of a high quality for the liquid market than for manufacturing. Therefore, it could be argued that those who supply liquid milk over the summer months might get additional payment over and above that given to those who supply manufacturing milk. At one time farmers who supplied liquid milk were considered the elite and possibly had the highest incomes but they deserved them. However, the gap between them and those supplying milk for manufacturing <Col N="1545" /> purposes has closed considerably in recent years.</P>
    <P>That brings me to a point I wish to make about Teagasc. Now more than ever, we must realise the necessity for an adequate research and advisory back-up service so that farmers can provide the quality, not just in liquid milk, but in other products that will enable them to survive, especially in the light of the rough days ahead as a result of the Common Agricultural Policy reform. Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the research and back-up service required by liquid milk producers and other farmers is maintained so that they can face the future with some confidence.</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business I referred to the research centre in Grange. In my view, the cost of that research centre has been recovered many times in the value of the products of Irish farms. There may be a perception abroad that that money is not money well spent but I would reject that perception; it is some of the best spent money in the country. Over the years it has been of immense benefit not just to farmers but nationally and it would be an appalling reflection on our lack of vision if research stations of the recognised international stature of Grange were to close.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to the acquisition of assets and in that regard I am concerned about the station at Enfield. As far as I am aware, there are more than 100 bulls there and a large number of animals undergoing performance tests. I have heard it said by visitors to the station it is one of the best in Europe and I have no reason to question that. Some alarm bells rang for me when the Minister said that the ancillary businesses have declined over the past few years and, consequentally, their financial position is deteriorating. If the board's ancillary services are to remain viable under whatever future arrangements may apply a rationalisation programme will be needed. However, the Minister said it is his intention that the maximum number of jobs will be maintained. It is important that facilities of that type, which provide such an essential back-up service to the <Col N="1546" /> whole milk board enterprise should be retained. They can be operated commercially. However, I have some reservations about the private foreign suppliers of bovine semen. Unless there is competition to keep them under control we might have some early Holstein Friesians coming into the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">

      <P>Do not tell me that the Senator is getting a left wing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>In some respects I might surprise Senator Upton as to whether I am left or right.</P>
      <P>Disease regulations and what will happen to milk from herds which have been infected by tuberculosis does not come within the scope of the Bill, but nevertheless it is a worry. The Bill will not only regulate the supply of milk around Dublin and Cork but will also regulate it in other areas where liquid milk is being supplied and that is welcome. In the past there has possibly been a tendency to take milk out of the manufacturing pool and divert it into liquid production and farmers have not been rewarded for that.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not deal with the importation of milk from Northern Ireland and I would like to hear the Minister's views on that. To what extent can that be regulated, or is it within the scope of the Bill to regulate it? We have already discussed the matter of the premium which will be decided by the agency and whether suppliers of summer milk to the liquid market should get some premium over suppliers of milk for manufacturing purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dunnes Stores matter has already been referred to by at least one speaker and I do not intend to go into it in any detail other than to say it is important there is competition in the market. That is not to say Mr. Dunne should have a free hand. The implication of that would have been that the door-to-door supply, which is part of our traditional supply system, would have disappeared and further down the line the competition, which was represented as being present, might not have been there at the end of <Col N="1547" /> the day when all the others had folded up their tents and gone away.</P>
    <P>In relation to staff, which is one of my main worries about the Bill, the Minister said he expected the position regarding the future employment of the board staff to be settled before the establishment of the agency. I hope that will be the case because there are 140 employees involved. What is the position in regard to these people who have served the board so well over such a long number of years? Senator Hourigan referred to the excellent work of the chairman and board members but the people who are really the heroes in all this are the staff of the Dublin and Cork boards and it is essential that their employment prospects are protected. Their present status, as Members will be aware, is that of State employees, as determined by the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, amended in 1969. There is an incentive for everybody to be part of the State service, to have the security of employment which that entails and those people are within their rights to expect that an arrangement will be made to secure those rights which they had when they entered the service and which they expected would continue. I have been told that the agency testers have been informed there will be no jobs for them from 1 January. I do not know how that can happen as the agency will not be in place by 1 January, at least I do not see any prospect of that. Even if the agency is in place by then it is unacceptable that they should be told that.</P>
    <P>What will be the position in relation to pension entitlements? It is essential that we protect those people who have served the boards so well for many years and have shown commitment to the industry, to farming and to the country generally. Their position should be protected. Certain solutions have been put forward by way of amendment but I will have to see the details of the amendment before deciding how I will vote on it.</P>

      <P>There is talk of voluntary redundancies and so on. However, the welfare of public servants and their families should be considered.</P>
      <P>I have no preference as to who should be represented on the board although it is important that the broad spectrum of consumer, processor and producer be represented. In relation to the levy and how much that will be, section 7 provides for payment of the levy by the milk processors. In the nature of things, if processors have a charge against them they tend to find a way of passing it on to the producers. Will the Minister say what that levy might be? That may be difficult to answer but perhaps he could give us some idea. However, my main reservation is about the staff members.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is necessary and I hope it has a speedy passage through both Houses so that we can establish the agency and proceed from there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always a pleasure to see the Minister, Deputy Walsh, in the House. As I have said on a number of occasions, he is one of the few people who knows a great deal about agriculture and the dairy industry. For that reason it is very pleasant to see him here again.</P>
      <P>As was said at the outset, this Bill was introduced as a result of a decision by the European Court which made some of the functions of the Dublin and Cork milk supply boards illegal in the context of European legislation. Those boards have been in existence for many years; they date back to the thirties. At present there are approximately 130 people employed in the two organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals before us deal specifically with the functions of those boards in regard to the regulation of milk supplies. Of course, the boards' functions &mdash; particularly those of the Dublin Milk Board &mdash; are much wider than that. They <Col N="1549" /> provide a range of services including progeny testing, an AI service, a mastitis control service and so on.</P>
    <P>I understand that in 1990 the Dublin Milk Supply Board had a shortfall of £100,000 and it is predicted it will lose a considerable amount of money again this year. I also understand the boards collect a levy of approximately £300,000. It appears the supply regulation function of the board is sufficient to employ five to seven people. That, of course, means that the positions of approximately 120 people are not covered under the Bill. What will happen to them? What will happen to those who provide an AI service, a milk recording service, a progeny testing service or to those involved in mastitis prevention and control? In addition, what will happen to the property of the board? I understand they have premises in Bluebell worth £600,000 and a 450 acre farm in Enfield on which there are a number of stud bulls and where a number of people are employed.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, the Bill is silent in relation to the welfare of those people who have served the board very well, as Senator Dardis said and who have built up a valuable service for the farming community. I worry in particular about their future and welfare having regard to some of the possibilities contained in this legislation. There are a number of unstated possibilities in the Bill; a number of things can happen but are not specified. The Bill is silent on the rights of those workers. For example, there is no mention in the Bill of an automatic transfer for them to any position in the State service. The Government seem to ignore the rights of the 120 people who will not figure in the functioning of the new agency; in other words, those who have provided this valuable ancillary service over the last number of years.</P>
    <P>I was alarmed to hear the Minister mention out of the blue that a package designed to achieve 50 redundancies on a voluntary basis is being prepared and will be presented shortly. I am glad the Minister has come clean in this regard and that, at least, we got that information today. I have a letter dated 13 November <Col N="1550" /> in response to representations from SIPTU on behalf of those people which states that no formal response was ever made to this document but that following numerous inquiries by officers of the ICTU it was established that a decision had been made not to continue those negotiations. I am glad that voluntary redundancy is being offered and I hope that &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; means &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo;. When one discovers that discussions are breaking down in a unilateral fashion one certainly begins to wonder about the potential interpretations of &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo;. There are other letters in this regard but we cannot get any written proposals from the Department of what they have in mind for our members who are, understandably, worried. I am not surprised they are worried and concerned.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the implications of this type of behaviour for the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> I will remind the House of one or two paragraphs in that document. It states that there will be no privatisation in the public service but matters which are excluded from this Bill leave open the possibility of privatisation. It also states there will be no compulsory redundancy in the public service. That is encouraging and I sincerely hope that those provisions will hold, given the talk which is now widespread about renegotiation and restructuring of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> These matters are of grave concern to me and to my party and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and, I have no doubt, to the 120 people and their families who have given a tremendous service to the farming industry over the years.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise a number of points. The first relates to information which is contained in a letter which talks in terms of a proposed buyer with a link to &ldquo;a top American breeding organisation&rdquo; who is somehow going to be involved in this business and in the restructuring of these jobs. I would like more information on this matter, if the Minister has it. What is involved here? Terms such as &ldquo;top&rdquo; irritate me. What <Col N="1551" /> do they mean? In the name of goodness, what would a top American breeding company be doing coming into this type of situation? One begins to wonder about the meaning of language and whether terms such as &ldquo;top&rdquo; have lost all meaning. Indeed, one also begins to wonder about terms such as &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; and whether they, too, are beginning to lose their meaning.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the explanatory memorandum and specifically that part of it which deals with section 3. This states:</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the dissolution of the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards by order of the Minister for Agriculture and Food and for matters consequential on the making of the dissolution orders.</P>
    <P>Whoever wrote that would seem to me to have mastered the art of the understatement. It certainly seems to be someone with a capacity to be tremendously economical with facts and with information. It seems to me that the consequences of making the dissolution order will be to put quite a number of people on the dole. That is a possibility which now exists and it is something that greatly worries me. People who are now in that position, who are at risk and are worried, deserve a bit better than statements such as &ldquo;matters consequential on the making of the dissolution orders&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The least that would be expected is that those responsible would come clean, particularly when you have to bear in mind that all this happens in a context where the union cannot get a formal statement of position from the Department of Agriculture and Food and where shortly after this letter was written the relevant legislation was published. These are matters which &mdash; I repeat &mdash; are of great concern and certainly I would like to see the Minister and the Department of Agriculture and Food being a good deal more frank about the possibilities and about what is in mind in relation to this situation.</P>
    <P>Moving on to some of the details of the Bill itself and leaving aside the concerns <Col N="1552" /> in relation to the welfare of these 120 people, most of the other matters in the Bill are fairly straightforward and I do not have any great criticisms of them. I am happy enough to see that producers, processors, consumers and distributors will be represented on the board. I am also pleased that there will be a registration process in relation to milk produced. I think that is desirable and can only help to maintain standards.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that the Bill has a capacity and a facility for the setting of standards. That is desirable in relation to the attempts to improve milk quality and so on. I do not have any problem about producers having to pay a levy for the service. That is acceptable enough. It is part of what is happening anyway in the agricultural world these days. These type of services sooner or later provide a valuable contribution to the welfare of the whole agricultural industry and that, of course, is ultimately to the benefit of the farming community.</P>
    <P>In relation to the appointment of the chairman, I notice that it is at the pleasure of the Minister, and it would be useful to know what pleases the Minister and when he becomes displeased and decides to get rid of the chairman. The Bill talks in terms of appropriate numbers, which to me could mean anything from one to 1,001.</P>
    <P>Some speakers, particularly Senator Raftery, referred to milk consumption and the effects that the abandonment of a door to door delivery service would have on the consumption of milk. Senator Raftery discussed the matter at length. I am not an expert on the role and significance of door to door milk deliveries in relation to the amount of milk which is consumed. What I can say is that quite a number of people in this city make their living from selling milk door to door and they provide a valuable service. I would not like to see that service abandoned. I would be quite worried that it may be abandoned and, indeed, destroyed if the market is let rip allowing agencies such as Dunnes Stores to come in, look for market share, reduce the price, blow these people out of the water <Col N="1553" /> and then come back and sort things out when they have got rid of them.</P>
    <P>A number of people saw fit to talk about the role of milk in the diet. This topic is close to my heart. In one of my earlier existences I used to be calculating these kinds of things. It was great fun, but of little significance. One of the things I discovered at that time was that milk is a very good source of nutrients. Indeed, if you look at the cost of the nutrients which are supplied in milk &mdash; if you cost it out per milligram of calcium and so on &mdash; it works out cheaply when compared to most other sources of nutrients in differing foods. Milk has a lot to commend it. It plays a very central role in the diet. I would be concerned at the idea of a sudden reduction in consumption of milk. That would create some nutritional risks and problems which would be very undesirable. There are problems in relation to total amounts of fat and so on, but that is for another day.</P>
    <P>I repeat my concern about what is going to become of the workers, the people who are involved in the provision of the AI, progeny testing and various other ancillary services. Section 2 of the Bill says:</P>
    <P>There shall be a body known as the National Milk Agency to regulate the supply of milk for liquid consumption in accordance with the provisions of this Act.</P>
    <P>That would seem to me to exclude the new agency from providing these ancillary services, which again raises the question of what is going to become of the workers and why the Department of Agriculture and Food refuse to come clean in relation to this matter. There have been a whole series of people who have been concerned about the rights of the workers. Indeed, Minister O'Kennedy has been writing to Minister O'Rourke in response to representations. I presume she wrote to him, although that does not necessarily follow. I would like to see provision made to protect the people who work in this organisation in the same way as provision was made by an earlier Government to <Col N="1554" /> protect the people who worked in the predecessor of Telecom Éireann and An Post. The rights and welfare of those workers was very carefully and very well protected when the companies moved from being State organisations to being commercial organisations. I would hope that would be done and I would earnestly request the Minister to consider that possibility and to take action to see that that happens.</P>
    <P>I wonder why it has taken from the judgment of 1988 until now to introduce this Bill. I wonder also why there is this swift move, apparently out of nowhere, coinciding with the abandonment of negotiations. I wonder if it is some kind of negotiating ploy which is being used by the Department of Agriculture and Food to frighten the people who work in that organisation. I would be very concerned at the statements made by Senator Dardis when he spoke in terms of some of the people who are working in Enfield being given to understand that there would be no work for them on 2 January when they resume after Christmas. I would be very concerned about and opposed to that type of attitude being used as a negotiating ploy.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a final point about the role of the former Minister for Agriculture and Food in relation to this matter. All the key decisions in relation to this were taken by the former Minister for Agriculture and Food. That Minister is now the Minister for Labour. Certainly, if the position, policies and attitudes he adopted in relation to this matter, his refusal to come clean and to spell out what he intended for the workers, is going to be his attitude, I would think that his appointment as Minister for Labour should give the trade union movement the shivers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to comment briefly on this important legislation. I take this opportunity to thank the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, for initiating the Bill in this House. As Senators are aware, it was initially prepared in Dáil form and we certainly <Col N="1555" /> appreciate the fact that it is now with us for Second and subsequent Stages.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for the dissolution of the milk board system and the establishment of the National Milk Agency. The Minister in his contribution this evening outlined the historical background to the foundation of the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards and went on to explain to us the problems the Government encountered with the Commission of the European Communities, who notified the Department that the boards were contrary to Community law and would have to wound up. The Commission indicated that Ireland had failed to comply with obligations incumbent on it under the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products in Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome. I do not want to go into the substance of the legislation in great detail; other Senators are doing so. However, it is a very welcome and necessary Bill. The bone of contention, obviously, is the staff and I would like to make some observations on that.</P>
      <P>We have had similar legislation in this House in the past where we had amalgamations, takeovers and staff transferred to the new companies in different ways and staff were rightly worried about their status and so on. The same applies here. In the past we have had the rights of staff preserved in different forms, through redeployment or whatever. At the moment the employees in question enjoy semi-State status. They feel that the services provided by the milk boards should become the responsibility of the new National Milk Agency and that their status, pension rights, job security and so on, would be guaranteed in any new legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am somewhat heartened by the Minister's speech. He makes the point that it is his intention that the maximum number of jobs will be maintained. He further points out that discussions are ongoing and that meetings with trade unions and staff will be held again. He talks about the 50 redundancies on a voluntary basis; I am not sure that that is totally new. I <Col N="1556" /> may be wrong but I did understand that that had been mentioned in the past. I have faith in the Minister that the worries of the staff will be removed before the new agency is set up. I calculate that that will be in mid-February or early March. That is my message to the Minister arising from this important legislation. I hope that when he responds at the conclusion of Second Stage he will be able to tell us that the interests of the staff will be considered in a very positive way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I start at the point Senator Upton almost finished by expressing my concern about this debate being pre-emptive and not helpful from the point of view of the negotiations between the Minister and his Department and the SIPTU representatives of the employees? I would have thought the outstanding matters as to the fate of the 110 or 115 employees who would be considered, I think the expression is surplus to requirements, should have been resolved before a debate in either House on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I extend a personal welcome to the Minister to the House. It is appropriate that it should be he who deals with this legislation; my crib is only with the timing of its introduction. I note that the Minister and other Senators welcomed the initiation of the Bill in the Seanad. At the risk of being accused of being somewhat Machiavellian, might I suggest that there might be a hidden agenda why it came in here as opposed to the Dáil first. It is my understanding that the SIPTU representatives of the employees were given assurances that this Bill would not be introduced to the Dáil until the negotiations were complete. I suppose, perversely, we can argue that it has not been introduced to the Dáil as the negotiations are not complete. I hope that it would be an honour to the Seanad that this important if limited legislation is with us before the Dáil but I am inclined to think it is to stand, albeit technically, on the right side of assurances given to SIPTU representives regarding the future of employees of the two district milk <Col N="1557" /> boards. I hope that it will not be seen as being pre-emptive and cause difficulties for the 120 or so employees who will not be catered for in the new agency.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to explain in detail his plans for the entire staff of the two milk boards following dissolution. This is the only area with which Members of this House have difficulty. That difficulty extends across parties, including the Minister's own party in this House. Members on the Fianna Fáil side have expressed their concern and I can only hope that they will support our amendment which will be put down on Committee Stage to protect the employees.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying &mdash; though I stand to be corrected on this &mdash; that provisions are normally made when a State or semi-State body is being wound up for either voluntary redundancy or full redeployment of the employees. That is an accepted position at this time and is in accordance with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> We can look to recent examples. During the debate on the Environmental Protection Agency in this House we had a new section inserted in the second draft of the Bill which I somewhat facetiously referred to as &ldquo;Joe Rea's panacea&rdquo;. That was the section which ensured that, when Johnstown Castle and/or any other sections that now belong to Teagasc or any other State or semi-State body were to be transferred to the Environmental Protection Agency, not only would plant, machinery, buildings and equipment be transferred but also that almost overnight that staff find themselves working for the Environmental Protection Agency. We discussed at length pension rights, seniority, etc., that would be transferred from one body to the other. There was no difficulty with that.</P>
    <P>I wonder why we do not continue that practice in relation to the agency we are now establishing and ensure that redeployment will be offered within the public service to those civil servants who will be surplus to the requirements of the new agency. The Customs and Excise officials who are now being deemed to be surplus to requirements &mdash; I love that <Col N="1558" /> euphemistic expression &mdash; given 1993, the Single Market, removal of all physical barriers., etc, will be offered redeployment either within the areas or to other Government Departments. All of us can give examples in different areas. Could I assume that there is a reason for the different treatment of these civil servants who have provided an excellent service over the years on these two boards? Could the Minister explain to us why there has been no resolution of the problem as to what future there will be for the employees concerned? It will be accepted, given the stringent guidelines today on productivity and efficiency that in certain areas there is probably over-staffing relative to what might be needed. I would assume that sufficient voluntary redundancies would be found to take up the slack in any area that may be over-staffed. I would like to know the Minister's views on how the balance of the staff will be catered for. I would like assurances from him that in initiating this Bill in the Seanad as distinct from the Dáil there is no hidden agenda and that he will not go back and say to SIPTU: &ldquo;we only promised not to introduce it to the Dáil before the arrangements are made. We did not; it is in the Seanad&rdquo;&mdash; that he hopes by bringing it in here, as other speakers said, they would push negotiations to the point that, hopefully, there will be resolution. Who knows what is in it?</P>
    <P>Could the Minister also refer in his concluding speech how his proposals in relation to terms and conditions for the employees who will find themselves surplus to requirements meet with the conditions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> regarding public service employees? There is a circle to be squared there, and it does not seem to fit very comfortably. Certainly, that would be the opinion of those representing the employees concerned.</P>
    <P>Apart from the lack of resolution to the problem of the employees, I think there is a general welcome for the proposals in this Bill and we have no major criticism of the overall thrust of what we have before us. If I may take a few points <Col N="1559" /> from the Minister's own speech and give them back to him. He refers to the board's ancillary businesses having declined over the last few years. Could I suggest that they were run down, deliberately perhaps, over the last few years with a view to accommodating the point we are now about to arrive at? There would be a precedent for that. Since 1988 the Commission indicated that we were out of order and had to put our House in order legislatively in relation to liquid milk. Could it be that for different reasons some of the ancillary services were let decline, that the normal interest in ongoing investment, research and technology, and even replacement of plant and equipment, if that was an issue, did not happen? I fail to believe that it was a lack of demand for the services provided by the ancillary businesses that caused the decline. I put it to the Minister, in the absence of an explanation, that this insidious decline was allowed to happen by the Department to justify some of the decisions that may now be made. I hope I am reading the situation incorrectly, but I have seen it happen before in other State and semi-State sectors where situations have been allowed to evolve and then justify the closing of certain sectors on the basis of a decline.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the price. I have some difficulty, as did my colleague, Senator Raftery, understanding how a fair price might be arrived at and what justification one would have for defending that in the interest of a challenge from a certain producer, who could not produce economically, perhaps at the price that will be arrived at.</P>
    <P>I also note with interest the change in the name of this Bill. This is the Milk (Regulation of Supply) (No. 2) Bill as distinct from the Bill we are now scrapping &mdash; the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Bill. I know why the Minister had to drop &ldquo;Price&rdquo;; it would not sit comfortably with our EC colleagues, particularly in the Commission, but effectively we will be controlling the price for producers &mdash; and with some justification, as the Minister explained. I wonder if by <Col N="1560" /> just dropping the word &ldquo;Price&rdquo; he will stay on the right side of the Commission. Effectively, he is still controlling the price, albeit with some justification in terms of production costs, but what agreements, under the table or otherwise, or what hidden agenda have there been in these discussions with his European colleagues to allow him to effectively continue to control the price, which would seem totally at variance with the marketing philosophy in Europe at the moment? Deregulation, not only at the retail end but also the production end, would appear to be the wish across the board in terms of the Community market in general.</P>
    <P>I would not like to see the lack of control at the production end, and I accept what the Minister said as having a sound foundation. But I am not sure how we will get away with it unless he has a word in the ear of some of his colleagues in Brussels or elsewhere, saying we are all right. We are not calling it price control, but effectively it will be price control. Could the Minister explain how this has come about and how we will not be open to challenge perhaps by some other farmers who do not agree with the price level per gallon that will be fixed for the producers? As has been said by other speakers, there is up to 30p variance in the production costs of a gallon of milk at the moment. The smaller milk producers will not be as economic as the large producers. I know that over the years liquid milk suppliers tend to be the larger end of the milk suppliers, and they have good supplies of milk at this stage. Indeed, my father and grandfather were suppliers of liquid milk to the Dublin District Board. I will not say I have much knowledge of this, because I have forgotten anything I did know &mdash; it is going back a few years &mdash; but I have an interest and I acknowledge the tremendous work done&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1561" /> Questions have been asked, and we await with interest the Minister's reply, as to the present status of what has been referred to as a super breeding project. This project apparently was planned between American breed services and progressive genetics. It was earmarked for the Enfield AI station, but where will it end up? I presume in the private sector. Can the Minister give us an indication where it will end up? It was earmarked for Enfield but we are told by press reports that it has since been transferred to Denmark because of the delay in resolving the future of the milk board and the establisment of this agency. Maybe the Minister could enlighten us: at exactly what stage are negotiations in relation to that project? What are the implications for the assets and the transfer of assets to the new agency? If we are told that the redundancy costs &mdash; which were included as liabilities of the milk boards &mdash; exceed assets, is that a true assessment? What exactly will be the balance sheet at the end of the day?</P>
    <P>There is also an interesting expression in the Bill, section 3, which states:</P>
    <P>...specified assets of the abolished board shall stand transferred to the Agency or to a person specified in the order as being engaged in providing services to farmers either in a former production district or otherwise;</P>
    <P>I have no ideological objection to privatisation, which effectively is what the Minister is suggesting may happen, but let us call it that. Let us be up front about what the Minister's plans are and let him tell us exactly which parts of the ancillary services should be privatised. Which parts would stand on their own? Which parts would be better privatised, if any? Let us come clean. I understand there are several parties interested in the Enfield AI station at the moment. At what stage are negotiations in that area? We need to know and the employees need to know. Is it likely to be transferred or purchased by the private sector as a going concern? Will the employees be transferred with it? The same question could be put in regard to all the other <Col N="1562" /> ancillary services. Are there negotiations going on at present in relation to any of the other operations of the boards that could, will or might end up in the private sector? Would that be in their best interests and in the best interest of the farmers from the point of view of receiving a good, efficient and competitive service?</P>
    <P>Any hidden agenda should be put on the table now and we should discuss it very frankly because, apart from the importance to farmers of the structures we are discussing here and the importance to the consumer in terms of having a regular 12 months of the year quality supply of milk, we also have the employees to consider. We have the consumer, the farmer and the employees and we need all the cards on the table. At the moment this is not happening.</P>
    <P>Teagasc has been mentioned. Where are the dairy farmers, particularly our good commercial dairy farmers of the future going if we do not have a proper research and development team backing up the work? Even the Agricultural Commissioner, Ray MacSharry, when he addressed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities last Friday pointed to the importance of agricultural research as the basis of Irish agriculture in years to come. Perhaps the Minister would have a word in the ear of Joe Rea and ask him what he is at. Is it all a ploy to put political pressure on the Minister for Agriculture and Food to give him more money? I suggest it might be histrionics. Joe Rea expects to get a response in the form of extra funding.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food is an agricultural scientist. He is a Doctor of Horticulture and I would expect him to be sensitive in dealing with the area of scientific research in agriculture. I appeal to him to look at the ploy and threat to close a centre such as Grange, and centres throughout the country, such as Belclare and even in Clonroche in my own county of Wexford. I consider it a ploy to extract more money from the Minister and to use sensitive constituencies to extract that money. That is <Col N="1563" /> not acceptable as far as I am concerned. I would like the Minister to bring that message from us here today.</P>
    <P>Agricultural research and scientific research for the dairy farmer of the future is essential if we are to be at the head of the posse rather than piggy-backing on research and development in other countries. We should be leading in this area as we have always managed to do. I hope nothing will be done to change that.</P>
    <P>How will reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and further restriction in production affect the seasonality issue which has dogged us in the industry for years? I know it has been an even bigger difficulty for the manufacture of milk. Right through, it has been a problem to have an adequate even supply of quality milk for 12 months of the year. If the choice is between winter milk and grass-based milk, with the restricted quotas in many areas farmers will go for the grass-based. Why should they put themselves to the extra difficulty, with little advantage, of producing milk in the winter months if their quota can be completed by using the grass-based season?</P>
    <P>In relation to the employees, as they are civil servants they only pay PRSI at the Civil Service rate which does not entitle them to unemployment benefit. If we do not resolve the matter either by having sufficient voluntary redundancies or redeploy those who are surplus to requirements, there will be major problems for those who are &ldquo;let go&rdquo;. That matter should also be recognised. I should have mentioned it when I was referring to the employees earlier on. I want to put it firmly on the record that their position is not like anyone else who has full PRSI payments and full social insurance cover. They are not entitled to unemployment benefit and they would have no future and no regular income if they were not absorbed into the public service in another area.</P>
    <P>The health debate has affected the consumption of milk. It has nearly gone the full circle at this stage in that the value of milk as an all round food is coming to the fore again. For a long time, the <Col N="1564" /> animal fat debate curbed the consumption of milk even though we still, as my colleagues have said, have the second highest consumption of milk in the Community. If we could get away from analysing milk on the basis of the yellow fat content and turn completely towards the protein content, it would be an excellent day's work. Some progress has been made in this area. Maybe the Minister could indicate to the House whether that will become a reality in the future. It would take the emphasis away from a fat basis to a protein basis.</P>
    <P>In Wexford, even though we are rather removed from Cork and Dublin, we have many suppliers to the Dublin District Board and an excellent quality product. We also have suppliers to Snowcream in Waterford. They closed Snowcream in Wexford amid furore some months ago. I was to the fore in criticising Waterford Foods for the closure of a viable, efficient operation in Wexford town. We have a new milk on our shop shelves in Wexford, Wexford Creamery milk, which is carving out a very nice niche in the market in Wexford. We have an excellent product from a small dairy, Slaneyside Dairies, a couple of miles from where I live.</P>
    <P>The point I am trying to make is that we need rationalisation in terms of milk collection and supply to the different outlets, whether it is liquid milk or manufactured milk. There are lorries from certain co-ops and creameries passing lorries going in the other direction to other creameries. There are lorries going to the Dublin District Milk Board passing milk lorries that are going down to Waterford with milk. This adds enormously to costs. At the end of the day, the consumer or the housewife has to bear the extra costs involved.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to know whether the Minister has any plans or whether it would be worth trying to rationalise this area of milk production and delivery which is making no sense at all economically. We need competition. We have about four kinds of milk on the shelves in Wexford and I welcome that. Ultimately, the housewife will make the decision as to what is the best quality product. <Col N="1565" /> Interestingly &mdash; and I suppose we cannot get into it at the moment &mdash; accusations of price fixing in terms of the litre on the supermarket and shop shelves are being dealt with effectively. Given the enormous difference in the price to the producer, particularly liquid milk at approximately £1 a gallon, which becomes £2.50 per gallon on a per litre basis, about 53 pence per litre to the consumer we need an explanation as to how there can be a 150 per cent increase in the value at the time the poor beleaguered housewife has to purchase her few litres of milk per day. That seems to make no sense particularly as the mark-up seems to have increased by over 8 per cent in the past few years. I know there are various expensive processes in between, but I cannot accept that the £1 or £1.05 per gallon the liquid milk producer gets could become £2.50 for the consumer. I cannot accept that the cost of the intermediary process justifies that mark-up. I would like to know the Minister's views on that and whether he feels that is a reasonable mark-up or if there is price fixing and the housewife is not getting the benefit she should, given the importance of the price of milk in her weekly household budget.</P>
    <P>I have no particular difficulties with the Bill. I welcome it. It will bring an even greater order to the liquid milk system. Having dropped the word &ldquo;price&rdquo; from the Title of this Bill I should like to hear how the Minister can be so confident that we will be able to effectively fix the price to the producer. The Minister will put it in nicer language than that and term it more delicately but, effectively, we will be fixing the price to the producer as was the case heretofore. How can he square that with the Community view? I support the need for that but I would be worried lest it be open to a challenge because of the different costs of production from the different farmers depending on their input.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming here today. I would like an assurance that we are not being pre-emptive or causing problems in relation to the ongoing negotiations with SIPTU in relation to the <Col N="1566" /> future of the employees. Is that the reason the Bill was brought to the Seanad rather than to the Dáil? Could we have an assurance that the problems of the employees will be resolved before the enactment of this Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to spend much time speaking on this Bill. When this Bill was introduced I was very surprised to hear people from Leinster discussing it; I had not heard very much about it. The AI service in Kilkenny is covered from Munster which is unusual because Tipperary organises the AI service in Kilkenny and Kilkenny is the only county in Leinster not under the aegis of the ancillary board of Dublin and Cork Milk Boards.</P>
      <P>The Minister is the epitome of the poacher turned gamekeeper. The first time I knew there was a monopoly in the supply of liquid milk to Cork city was when the dairy in West Cork with which the Minister was involved tried to supply liquid milk to Cork city. That fight was seen as an attempt to break a monopoly and was welcomed by many. This Bill would not be before us if the Minister had not started that fight.</P>
      <P>I never knew there was a difference between liquid milk and any other milk until lately. I am not too sure why the word &ldquo;liquid&rdquo; is used in the legislation because all milk is liquid. Consumer milk is milk in bottles as distinct from milk that is used for the production of cheese, casein or whatever. Milk is liquid so the word &ldquo;liquid&rdquo; should be deleted. Commercial milk or consumer milk may be a better way of describing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to change the 1936 Bill. There was a problem in the cities in those days because people could not get a supply of milk at a specific time. Things have changed dramatically in this area. The production of milk has changed. What happened here in 1936 and 1937 is happening in Russia today. In Russia an enormous level of milk is produced but they do not have the capacity to deliver it to the centres of population. In Ireland in 1936-37 the <Col N="1567" /> problem was not with the production of milk but with distribution.</P>
    <P>I was on a farm outside Moscow not too long ago and there were 700 people looking after 900 cows. This farm was 24 miles from Moscow and they still could not get that milk into Moscow because they were unable to refrigerate it.</P>
    <P>The biggest competitive area is the dairy sector and it is also an area of major profit. There is more profit to be made from packaging and selling milk in liquid form than there is producing casein or cheese, too much of which is produced. I have no doubt that without any legislation there is not a single housewife who could not be supplied with milk at a competitive price because there are so many people competing for the various markets.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the result of EC legislation on competition but it must take into account the staff of the various bodies involved. In this instance, the Government created the monopoly and now they have to get rid of it and produce market based sales in the supply of liquid milk. Unfortuntely, there is no mention in the Bill of what will happen to the staff. There is a suggestion that six of the staff would be re-employed and that there would be voluntary redundancies, otherwise they are not mentioned. These people have been working as State employees for a number of years and now it is suggested that there should be voluntary redundancies and some of the others might be employed by the new National Milk Agency. This is not good enough. People who have given loyal service for many years should be given the opportunity to take redundancy or be redeployed within the Civil Service. There is no doubt but that there should be areas within the agricultural commercial sector where they could be employed.</P>
    <P>Not alone are the employees of the milk boards involved but so are those who work in ancillary sectors. About 140 people have been working in AI stations, the cattle progeny testing service, milk quality and mastitis control services, and milk recording services and, according to <Col N="1568" /> the Minister, 117 full-time staff. What concerns me about the ancillary workers is that the majority of them have over 30 years service. Who will protect their pension rights or their position in the Civil Service? Why can they not be deployed in the Civil Service? In the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>&mdash; I presume this was thrown in by the progressive genetics groups who, as far as I know, are a group of former directors or members of the Dublin Milk Board who want to take over the AI services but if these services were not profitable they would have no interest in them &mdash; they said there was a planned breeding project between ABS in the United States and progressive genetics and that it was earmarked for Enfield. That project has now gone to Sweden.</P>

Anybody who is worried about this should ask who are the directors who are the people who want to set up progressive genetics service because I suggest they may be very closely involved with those who were on the Dublin Milk Board and farmers who have a direct connection with the board that is being disbanded.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the ancillary businesses have declined over the last few years. I wonder about the AI and cattle progeny testing services. How could there be a decline in this business over the past number of years? It is a viable business; therefore, why should they not be retained? The Minister said a rationalisation programme will be needed. That may be so, but when we are talking of people with a minimum of 30 or 40 years' service in the Civil Service we must accept that there are not a huge number of jobs involved nor will there be a huge debt to the State if they are redeployed. We should consider their position very carefully before this Bill goes through both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 provides that the order dissolving the board shall come into effect <Col N="1569" /> on the date of the establishment of the new agency. I hope that the date will be deferred for as long as possible; there is no need to rush into setting up this agency because the EC said we have to do so. We accept this has to be done. In some EC regulations there are derogations up to ten years and the Minister should not bring in the order until the ancillary staffs position is carefully worked out and they get their dues for the service they have given to the agricultural industry over the past 30 years.</P>
    <P>The Bill is necessary. It was nonsense to think there was control of the supply of liquid milk by two boards in Dublin and Cork. In future, anybody who can guarantee that their source of supply is up to standard in terms of quality and their ability to supply on a 12 months basis, will be able to supply in these two areas. This might open up avenues for people who were not able to supply before. There was a dichotomy between the operation of the cartel in Dublin and Cork, what the consumer wanted and what is necessary within the Community.</P>
    <P>Offering voluntary redundancy will not solve the problems for the employees. They are covered by the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> as they are in the public service. In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> there is a provision that there should be no compulsory redundancies. Suppose somebody does not want to take voluntary redundancy under the new Bill, what will happen? Will they be sacked? Will they be transferred to a private company? That cannot happen. The national agency is different from the old agencies. There has to be continuity of employment for those working on these boards and on the ancillary boards. If they want to take voluntary redundancy that is all right but we must ensure that their pensions are covered. There should be no suggestion that because of EC regulations State employees should be thrown out without getting what they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>The Bill will create an atmosphere of better competition in Dublin and Cork but the staff of both the Dublin and Cork <Col N="1570" /> Milk Boards and the ancillary units involved will have to be looked after when the Bill is passed.</P>

      <P>The phrase &ldquo;progressive genetics&rdquo; used by Senator Lanigan is of no significance but has a sinister ring to it. Even though it applies to cows, it gives me the creeps. The implications are far from pleasant; it is not a very pleasant phrase.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. I must take issue with Senator Doyle. Even at my most paranoid &mdash; all of us in politics have a touch of it &mdash; I do not think there was a Machiavellian intent in moving the Bill from the Dáil to here. I am certain that, for a variety of reasons, it was moved here because the Minister was a Member of this House and has considerable sympathy with the view that both Houses of the Oireachtas should be used to the maximum extent to ensure the most efficient debate and passage of legislation.</P>
      <P>I am glad to speak on this Bill for a number of reasons. First, it is always a surprise to hear people with a large urban base talk about agriculture. The reverse is that the farm organisations have always felt free to preach and expound at length about the virtues or otherwise of organised workers, the trade union movement and the public service generally. Some form of a dialogue would help us.</P>
      <P>I will leave it to the experts to debate the ins and outs of the dairy industry. The first thing to remind ourselves of is that this arose out of what amounted to price fixing by a limited number of suppliers.</P>

      <P>Before we commence debate I wish to announce a correction to the text of <Col N="1571" /> motion No. 58 as printed on the Order Paper. The words &ldquo;UN Charter&rdquo; in the first line should read &ldquo;Council of Europe Charter.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to sign and ratify the UN Charter on local self-government so that:</P>
      <P>(i) power resides with the people where it rightfully belongs, and</P>
      <P>(ii) decisions are taken by the tier of government nearest to the people,</P>
      <P>which would ensure that the Structural Funds allocated to Ireland are maximised and put to their most effective use as determined locally, for the benefit of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>We should have had a full debate on the reform of local government when we debated the 1991 Local Government Bill in the Seanad. Few hours were allocated for that debate and, unfortunately, a guillotine was placed on this extremely important issue. However, the timing now is not inappropriate as the Taoiseach and his team have just returned from Maastricht where, I am sure, they got the best possible deal for Ireland. It is important to emphasise at this stage that our response to what they secured at the summit will be vital. The Taoiseach reported satisfactory progress at the summit. In themselves, the changes imminent in 1992 and at Maastricht will not solve anything. They are opportunities and all will depend on how we grasp them. It is not just a question of getting a good whack of the enlarged Structural Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we gained independence in 1921 we were among the better off people in Europe. Now, sadly, we are among the worst off financially. Why is it that Ireland has been less successful than other small European democracies in developing its social and economic resources? Since we joined the EC in 1973 much of our indigenous industry has <Col N="1572" /> been wiped out. Expensive inducements to foreign industrialists have allowed us to survice, or just about. This policy of inducing industrialists into the country was a flawed policy, and belatedly we saw that.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, when speaking in this House a few days ago on the Maastricht debate pointed out that we had a number of economic and social problems, namely unacceptably high unemployment, high emigration levels and an under-developed infrastructure. During my contribution to that debate I pointed out that this summing up by the Minister was confirmed in the NESC report on Ireland in Europe. I do not intend to repeat what I said on that occasion but the NESC report confirms that poor performance.</P>
    <P>In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday, Paul Gillespie mentioned that NESC had initiated a comparative study by a Norwegian social scientist which was expected to highlight several institutional and sociological barriers to development in Ireland, namely, prevailing forms of corporatism and clientism in our political system. Most stable societies are liberal, always changing and rightly so. However, it appears that one generation can quickly forget the principles on which that society was founded and start a calamitous slide. In our case the shining vision of Parnell and the founders of this State has been reduced to squalor by the contemporary scandals, all too well known to everybody here.</P>
    <P>What, I ask, is the problem? I believe, and in this I am supported by many thinking people who have addressed this problem, that the difficulty lies in the centralised nature of our society. We inherited that from the British; a colonial government never thinks the locals can do anything right. After the foundation of the State, in spite of laudable sentiments about self-reliance, the trend to centralism continued. Between 1923 and 1925, three quarters of local authorities in this country were wiped out, bringing the number down from 460 to a meagre 120.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1573" /> Professor Joe Lee in his <i>History of Ireland</i> said:</P>
    <P>In 1921 the higher civil servants of the Free State misguidedly associated corruption and incompetence with local government and as far as politically possible centralised administrative authority in Dublin.</P>
    <P>This trend continued inexorably so that by the early sixties we had one of the tightest controls on local government of any country in Europe. The problems arising from that were recognised as early as the forties. The Commission on Vocational Organisation sought wider participation in decision-making and pressed hard for its introduction. The problem is now recognised all over Ireland. I am very much aware through my contacts with other local authorities of the frustration they feel at this centralism, where everything is focused on Dublin and is located in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Councillor Michael McGreal of Roscommon County Council in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 25 May 1991 said:</P>
    <P>We have the most centralised Government in the EC. We are also amongst the poorest members. The connection is obvious. If there is no place for initiative and resourcefulness, how could it be otherwise? Democracy is about self-government. Totalitarianism, communism and dictatorship advocate central power and gratuitous devolution. It is now more important than ever that we fight for truly European local community structure if we are to progress in the European Community.</P>
    <P>The consequences of centralism have been fully demonstrated in the Eastern European countries and in the USSR, where the more centralism, the less progress.</P>
    <P>If we compare Ireland and other western European democracies we find that in relation to our resources our apparatus of Government in size and complexity is in the big league, while our overall comparative performance lags behind. Tom Barrington speaks of the relative <Col N="1574" /> size of the Irish Government being one of the largest in the OECD. I will quote liberally from Tom Barrington and I would like to remind the Minister that Tom Barrington was appointed chairman of the advisory expert committee by his Government, so I presume the Minister has confidence in his opinion.</P>
    <P>In no other western European country, not even in the United Kingdom, is local democracy treated with so much contempt as in this country. In few countries is central bureaucracy so arrogant or so incompetent as here and sadly I believe that the Department of Finance is at the heart of this scandal. There are scant returns from relatively vast capital budget expenditure. There has been a series of deficits on current budgets since 1972 with consequential huge borrowing at home and abroad and a paralysis on taxation reform. It is amusing to note as an aside that the regional development organisation which did such an important job in this country was abolished by the Minister; the excuse given was to save travelling expenses. This would be funny if it were not so sad.</P>
    <P>Ireland is three times as centralised as the western European norm. It is accepted elsewhere that big Government is a reality in the modern world but it is tempered by vigorous democracy and wide citizen participation, which is not the case in Ireland. S. Pollard in a United Nations economic study says: &ldquo;We have, incomparably, the worst record since 1921 of any economy except the British&rdquo;. Centralism is wasteful of public resources and, in this country, got bigger and bigger until finally it burst.</P>
    <P>Having recognised the reality we must seek explanations not excuses. We have an exceptionally dedicated and talented Civil Service but they operate under a rigid administration which is undoubtedly damaging to decision making. Barrington sees it as &ldquo;the congestion of central Government&rdquo;. The Civil Service is bogged down with detail and minutiae to such an extent that they lose sight of the big picture. This fact was brought home to me many years ago in the west of Ireland. We have a cottage near <Col N="1575" /> Roundstone in a group water scheme and we were most anxious that water come to our area. I saw local people put a great deal of work into the project and local engineers from Galway County Council came out on innumerable occasions, modified the plan and come up with what was accepted as a satisfactory solution. The inspector from Dublin then came down to tell the locals how they should be doing this. He knows better, of course; as a superior being from Dublin, he must know better. I have given this example here before but it is so appropriate that I would like to give it again in case the Minister has not heard it.</P>
    <P>In my early days on the city council it was decided unanimously to abolish the no smoking regulation. The following month a member lit up a cigarette which was drawn to the attention of the Lord Mayor. After a little kefuffle at the top table between the city manager and the Lord Mayor we were told rather sheepishly by one of the unfortunate officials that the no smoking rule could not be implemented because the Minister had not yet sanctioned it. We cannot even introduce a no smoking regulation in our chamber without the sanction of our Minister. That makes the situation clear.</P>
    <P>Again and again on the Adjournment debate, we hear Members bring up details which should not take up the time of a busy Minister. It may be the sewerage in Greystones which Senator Ross brought up or the cycle way around St. Stephen's Green which I brought up last evening and on that occasion the Minister, Deputy Calleary, berated me in good spirit for my sudden parish pump enthusiasm. The point he missed was that I should not have to bring that subject in here nor should he have to waste his precious time dealing with something which could be well dealt with by a local or other appropriate authority.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance are endlessly overseeing how their money is spent; &ldquo;big brother&rdquo; in Dublin gives the all important approval to the tiniest projects. Is it any wonder that local authorities behave irresponsibly on <Col N="1576" /> occasions? How can they learn responsibility when they are not given any? This intense centralisation leads to intense bureaucratisation which leads in turn to muddle, fragmentation at the periphery, divided and overlapping responsibility, to waste and inefficiency and frustration of spontaneous local development.</P>
    <P>Central Government is bogged down in administrative detail and tasks whose solution properly demands local insight into a local problem. This paralyses the Government's ability and initiative to solve the major task with which they should be concerned, co-ordination, modifying legislation and solving problems regarding economic policy, strategic planning, etc.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that the fundamental cause of our national failure is centralisation, now a discredited system. We have reached a stage of democratic dictatorship. It sounds like a contradiction but it sums up our position very well.</P>
    <P>Now I come to what should be done. First, we must acknowledge that the system has become arthritic; arteriosclerosis has set in. I am not prepared to accept that Irish people are thick or any less talented than people in other European countries. We are an extremely talented people which is borne out by their performance abroad when, sadly they are obliged to emigrate. We need to decentralise and I hope the Minister will not confine himself to relocation. Relocating a Government Department to Athlone or Ballina is not decentralisation.</P>
    <P>I have not used the word &ldquo;devolution&rdquo; which I do not like. It presumes that power resides at the top and then gratuitously devolves downwards. We must remember that power belongs to the people and they cede it up to the local authority, to the UDC in turn to the county council who cede it to the National Parliament and to the Minister who in turn is now going to cede it to the Parliament in Europe.</P>
    <P>What must be done? Central Government must let go of the apron strings. They must stop imagining decentralisation as cumbersome and inefficient <Col N="1577" /> and cease blaming councillors for not doing what they are not permitted to do. We must need start to mobilise individual abilities. We need to get away from the rights without responsibilities syndrome, the idea that society can get something for nothing such as low taxes and abundant welfare payments. If people were involved more in Government they would come to understand that the cake is limited and must be carefully and fairly cut up. The only way to restrain people's natural desire for more is to create awareness of the limitations involved. We must encourage local authorities to grow up and place more confidence in their capacity to act responsibly. We must bring Government close to the people because that is the only way to guarantee democracy.</P>
    <P>When I was elected to the City Council in 1974 I found I had been elected to the second largest local authority in Ireland. I was somewhat daunted by the task of looking after the needs and concerns of such a large number of people and I realised frankly that I could not do the job if I were to deal with each problem on an individual basis. So what did I do? I had been instrumental in setting up many community and residents' associations in my area. I took out a map of the area and where such associations did not exist I encouraged people to form them. Gradually my local authority area was covered by community and residents' associations and I dealt through them. If somebody contacted me with a specific problem I would ask them if they had been to their local association for help.</P>
    <P>That strategy had two results. I propped up the local associations' confidence in their ability to solve problems and gave them experience. It also released me to do what I considered more meaningful and important work on behalf of my constituents. Significantly, it brought representatives of different associations together. They learned that a problem from one area could not be shoved into the next area, such as redirecting traffic from one road, where it was causing a problem, to another. They had to sit down together to see how <Col N="1578" /> the problem could be solved to the benefit of all. I suggest that the Minister recommend that procedure to his Department.</P>
    <P>We must accept the importance of local government as opposed to central Government. The Taoiseach spoke recently in the Dáil about the need for consensus in Europe, and the need to provide an effective voice for people at EC level. Why should the Taoiseach tell that to Europe? We want some of that here at home, some of what the Taoiseach says he wants for members of the European Community. We can learn a great deal from the way policy is made through a coming together of public and private sectors not only at national but at local level.</P>
    <P>We need consistency regarding social and economic targets among Government, trade unions and many other organisations with common objectives regarding the way forward, a kind of a virtuous circle of agreed policies. If the same locally based creativity was brought to bear on economic and social issues that is evident in many community activities &mdash; amateur dramatics, tidy towns competitions, local sport and so on &mdash; we would make great progress. The problem is that there is no opportunity for popular input, no forum with teeth, no mechanism for constructive criticism so that people can shout stop if they do not like something. The thrust of powers is all in the wrong direction.</P>
    <P>We can learn a great deal from Europe, and I am sure the Minister is already familiar with the charter itself. It is not a radical document but simple straightforward reforms are required in this country if we sign it. I have a table here of 14 European countries showing the functions of local authorities in each. The most successful large country in Europe is Germany and 31 functions in Germany are carried out by local authorities. In Switzerland, the most successful small country, 30 functions were carried out by local authorities. The average is 25.6 functions over 14 countries. What is the number of functions carried out in <Col N="1579" /> Ireland by local authorities? Ten, and that tells us a lot.</P>
    <P>We need to value the partnership between community and statutory bodies. I want to convince the Minister that we must make changes. I am not going to speak about the financing of local authorities or go into details which have been gone into over and over again since 1971. What we need is to change our attitude, our philosophy. We need to redistribute power away from the centre, to delegate, then the Government and the Ministers will be released and the Minister will find his job, I believe, more creative and more exciting because he could be involved in strategic planning. Able civil servants would be able to do the same instead of breathing down the necks of the local authorities. We need to look at the underlying causes not advance band aid responses to symptoms.</P>
    <P>Subsidiarity is a great word but we never put it into practice by making local representatives and local authorities responsible and accountable. There is general agreement that we need reform which is extraordinary. I would like the Minister to address this in his reply. Every political party in the Dáil and Seanad, Muintir na Tíre, the Chambers of Commerce and the Municipal Authorities Association, agreed that we must bring about change and reform. We have had White Papers and Green Papers. It started in 1971, with a White Paper or perhaps a Green Paper and a good response from the IPA but nothing changed. In 1985 we had a Local Government Bill which changed nothing. In 1991 another Local Government Act was passed here; little happened. I appreciate that we abolished the <i>ultra vires</i> rule which would benefit local authorities if they had resources and other important issues like town twinning, civic receptions and how much the chairman would be paid were also settled, but nothing really happened. Section 50 put an onus on the local authority to publish an annual report. No fundamental change occurred.</P>
    <P>I am disturbed that the Minister is not <Col N="1580" /> prepared to sign the charter which would indicate his bona fides and would lead on possibly to the implementation of the necessary legislation and to ratification of the charter. All the Minister is prepared to do is to keep the charter under review. Nothing has happened because the politicians and officials in central Government see local government as a threat to themselves. They do not want any change. The present arrangements regarding local government suit those who control the levers of power. It is in the interest of all governments, not only the Minister's Government to maintain the <i>status quo.</i> The tiny bureaucracies of the national parties join forces with the vast bureaucracy of the central administration all with a vested interest in the <i>status quo.</i></P>
    <P>The root problem is the attitude of the power brokers in Leinster House who thrive on the centralisation of power, on the principle, doubtless that the more power one has, the more clout one has at one's disposal for the system of clientism and the &ldquo;favours bank&rdquo; operating in this country. Our acquiesence has been ensured, our silence has been bought and all constructive criticism and creative thinking has been stifled by a system of handouts, grants, the disposal of social service funds and the distribution of lottery funds. All these moneys are seen as gifts from the Government. If one is good one gets one's gift or goodies. With decentralisation, local representatives might get their hands on some of the purse strings and that would not do.</P>
    <P>We have reached a situation where the ideology and dogma of political parties is placed ahead of the interests of the people through worn out political divisions that no longer make sense. I believe Irish politicians are now held in as low esteem as those in Moscow, and that is fairly low. I saw a quote recently: &ldquo;The cause of the wealth of nations is most of all creative mind, invention, discovery, personal and associative enterprise and the free institutions that support it.&rdquo; If we were to introduce the centralisation I have spoken about we would release the dynamic that is so vital <Col N="1581" /> for this country. We would encourage a spirit of individual initiative and enterprise which would flower. We would awaken the latent resourcefulness of our people. Ideas, skills and energy would flow to regenerate the community. Economic regeneration, jobs and employment would surely follow.</P>
    <P>The local authorities could be the source of new ideas, creativity and potential. They would take opportunities for positive action. The profits and benefits would be enormous and over spending and waste would be reduced. We should not tell people what to do. We should help them to do what they themselves want to do, on the basis that commitment, not authority, achieves results. If we believe in people and give them confidence and enthusiasm, their motivation will be unstoppable. I believe that our manifold problems can be solved, but only by a united community effort.</P>
    <P>I will conclude with a quote from Baron Crespo, President of the European Parliament. He said: &ldquo;Either our citizens are in a position to benefit from European integrity or else they will all be its victims&rdquo;. If we introduce measures such as those I have outlined, we can face the future with confidence not fear, with hope not despair. I believe we can solve our problems.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hederman has said, quite rightly, that we are the most centralised country in the EC. I suspect we are the most centralised in the whole of Europe. Not even the post-Stalinist emerging democracies, in their transition stages, have anything like our centralisation. In terms of size the nearest country to us in the EC is Denmark and in the past ten years Denmark has transferred 70 per cent of what used to be the functions of central Government to regional and local authorities. Let us remember what T. J. Barrington said about the offensively named &ldquo;regions&rdquo; the Government <Col N="1582" /> created, out of a hat, for the European Social and Structural Funds. He called them &ldquo;offensive squiggles on the map of Ireland with no integrity and no unity&rdquo;. At one stage County Kerry was divided between two different regions &mdash; an exercise in idiocy that denies the identity of one of the most identity-conscious counties.</P>
    <P>The idiocies of central Government are endless. There is a daft idea according to which a city manager, chief executive officer of the vocational education committee or chief executive officer of a health board must get the permission of the Minister before he can do any of an endless list of things. Somebody who is paid, perhaps, £35,000 or £40,000 a year has to get the permission of the Minister. The &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; may turn out to be a junior official in a Department who is paid a fraction of what the chief executive officer is paid, has a fraction of the training, qualifications and experience. He may take out a bureaucratic manual which says, according to regulation X, it is right, or according to regulation Y it is wrong. The idea that the Minister looks at every single one of the endless list of things that require his approval is rubbish.</P>
    <P>There is a bureaucratic mess in the heart of Ireland. In the city I live in the Office of Public Works have been responsible for the offensive desecration of a whole side of a beautiful street. They have been utterly unresponsive to the plans of the city and have planted an ugly Government office block in the middle of Sullivan's Quay. Our national broadcasting organisation cannot yet have a decent studio outside of the centre, not through its own fault. We have concentrated too much power and authority in inward-looking, bureaucratic Stalinism that masquerades as central Government in this State.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine gave permission for sand to be taken from a beach 140 miles away in the west of Connemara without even looking at it or consulting anybody locally. They decided, in an office in Dublin, what could be done in Connemara. They knew <Col N="1583" /> best. The then Minister for Finance brought EC officials to visit Cork to look at his pet projects without as much as the courtesy of a visit to the local government body because he knew that local authorities did not count. He knew where real authority lay. The dissolution of the corporations of Cork, Limerick and Waterford is imminent because of a deficit in the fundamental right of local authorities to fund themselves. We have an endless list of extraordinarily dimwitted plans, procedures and processes. We have an obsession with centralised power.</P>
    <P>This discussion is very welcome because, as Senator Hederman says, this charter is no revolutionary document. It is innocuous in terms of what one would believe local authorities should do. It contains nothing threatening the constitutional <i>status quo</i> or the powers of central Government. It is a reasonable, probably conservative, document about the nature of local democracy, but it is significant that no Irish Government will even sign it, not to mention ratify it, because they are afraid of democracy. The issue is that something as innocuous as this could frighten people. That is because we live in a society that is secretive, centralised and hierarchical, where the State, the Church, most of our trade unions and many of our sporting organisations are secretive, centralised and hierarchical. The essence of every powerful institution in the State is centralisation, secrecy and hierarchical authority which presumes that the person or the authority at the centre knows better than anybody else. It is the classic tyrany of experts.</P>
    <P>That is why we have no freedom of information in this State, why trade unions operate in secret. All centralised authority in this state operates to preserve the hierarchical authority and is sceptical of democracy. If you talk to people about local democracy they will say: &ldquo;How can ordinary people understand that?&rdquo;. Ordinary people understand the harshest realities of life: bringing up a family, buying a house and <Col N="1584" /> making all those things work, somehow, there is said to be a great complex array of difficult things that ordinary people could not understand. They understand very well and know they are being squeezed out and have no role. That is the objective of the centralised hierarchical authority.</P>
    <P>We live in a tyranny of so-called experts, with the presumption that there is a body of knowledge at the centre, better than the body of knowledge available locally, or to communities. Any expert who can not explain what he means to ordinary people is a sham. The real expert is the one who can make sense to anyone. If any fellow tangles you up in gobbledegook, tell him to get lost. One of the great tyrannies of this country is the belief that, in Government Departments, there are experts who know better than the people on the ground.</P>
    <P>There were two inquiries into whether the engineering authorities in Cork were right about a down-river crossing, the presumption being that someone in the Department of the Environment would know better. They would have a different view, but the presumption that up the hierarchical ladder you find better experts is nonsense. There is no guarantee of it, there is no reason why it should be so. They are all civil engineers with the same qualifications and experience. It is a myth to justify the concentration of authority at the centre. Stalin understood perfectly that centralisation confers all power on those at the top. It does not, as the Soviet people have discovered, confer all wisdom &mdash; quite the opposite. We are rapidly discovering the same thing ourselves.</P>
    <P>We are effectively in a tyrany which does not exist by accident. It exists because a sinister force at the centre of our society &mdash; the Department of Finance &mdash; all through their history have stifled initiative and imagination and drawn all power to themselves. They keep that position. I invite Members to read Joe Lee's book or Ronan Fanning's history of the Department of Finance. In their external manifestations, that Department produce the antithesis of their own <Col N="1585" /> position. They want to take power away from the State. But, in the area of the State, they take more and more to themselves. That is the crux of it.</P>
    <P>At the centre of our society lies a disbelief in democracy, and in the quality and power of ordinary people. The centralised system is perpetuated because it guarantees the ascendancy of those who support hierarchical, secretive, centralised authority. Under it, the country, as Senator Hederman said, is the collapsing. They want it because, like everybody else, they want power and like all those in power, they want power which is not accountable. The more layers of bureaucracy and so-called centralised power are built up, the more diffuse authority becomes. At the top are the Minister and his senior officials who can dispense largesse but, when something goes wrong, you never know whose fault it is. You never know who did it or why it was done because all the information is suppressed.</P>
    <P>A ridiculous situation arose in the Supreme Court last July where central Government tried to tell the courts they could not see documents about a serious issue because these were privileged. They even wished to keep the courts out of their coterie of secrecy, privacy and centralised authority. That is the extent of the centralising bug in this country. Among other things it has destroyed local initiative.</P>
    <P>Cork Corporation cannot put a yellow line on a street to restrict parking, without the permission of the Minister. That is absolutely ridiculous. To pedestrianise a street, they need the permission of both the Minister and the Garda Commissioner. The list is endless and none of these powers will be surrendered for reasons of rationale, policy making or something else. The truth is that the Minister will never see any of these proposals. If he did, he would be swamped under piles of paper.</P>

      <P>He may well be but, in any event he could not do all these things. <Col N="1586" /> A junior official who, perhaps, does not know where Cork is, will decide such things. Dublin is as much a victim of centralisation as Cork. It is not a question of geographical location: it is a question of the location of the centre of power. The problem is not one of organisation or of administration but of power. Power, as Senator Hederman quite rightly said, is the preserve of the people, not of bureaucrats, politicians, Government Ministers or anybody else. Power belongs to the people. We exercise what limited power we have under their conditions, when they let us and to the extent they allow. We do not devolve power to them; they devolve some of their power to us and we are frightened of handing it back. We are so frightened of local initiative and local enterprise that we go off on tangents about taxation and so on. The crux of the issue is power, who has it, who exercises it and how accountable that power is.</P>
      <P>If we want to encourage popular participation we must, first, decentralise not civil servants but authority and decision making to the people. Second, we must ensure maximum accountability by introducing the most radical freedom of information legislation in Europe.</P>

    <P>The principle of openness in Government can only operate in a system of decentralised power. In Denmark 70 per cent of power has been devolved. We could work not just up to that figure but beyond it. Very little other than the raising of centralised taxation, foreign affairs and a few other things could not be done better locally than as at present nationally. People should also be encouraged to participate by letting them know what is being done in their name. Let me remind this House that in the last six months the Minister of State with responsibility for the environment, refused to <Col N="1587" /> make it obligatory to implement an EC Directive on Freedom of Information on the Environment. She said she could not make it compulsory. Why could it not be made compulsory to let the people know something they are entitled to know? Because it threatened the power at the centre and would hand power back to the people in an area of considerable importance. It is all about who has power and who should have it. It is time we gave it back to the people from whom central Government stole it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to come to the Seanad this evening to respond to the motion put down by Senator Hederman and other Senators concerning the European Charter of Local Self-Government. Indeed, I thank Senators for raising this matter because it gives me the chance, not only to outline the position on the charter but also to review a number of important issues in relation to local government, including progress on local government reform. Having said that, however, I do not consider that the motion itself is well founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make it clear at the outset that the Government have been well aware of this charter and have kept the question of signing it under review. The charter contains provisions which touch on many different aspects of local government, such as, its basic rights and <Col N="1588" /> powers, structures, staff, elected members, finance and administration. These are all matters which are at present being dealt with as part of the Government's programme of local government reform. This has to be our priority. I believe that our position in relation to the Charter of Local Self-Government is one that should properly be considered when we have further advanced the local government reform programme.</P>
    <P>I will return in a few moments to the key question of local government reform, but first I would like to touch briefly on the charter itself.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted the European Charter of Local Self-Government in the form of a convention in June 1985. The convention was opened for signature on 15 October 1985 and came into force on 1 September 1988; it has been signed by 18 countries and ratified by 15 countries. The charter is a fairly detailed and technical document. There would not be time to give a full account of its contents here tonight, but I would just like to mention some of its main features.</P>
    <P>The Charter of Local Self-Government is the first legal statement at international level of standards and safeguards for local government. It includes provisions relating to the constitutional and legal basis for local self-government. It defines the nature and scope of local government and local authority powers. Further articles deal with the boundaries of local authorities, their administrative structures and staff and conditions for the holding of local elective office. There are provisions dealing with the supervision of local authority activities and their financial resources. Other provisions include the right of local authorities to co-operate and form associations and the protection of local self-government by the right of recourse to a legal remedy.</P>
    <P>I should point out that conventions of this type are not, strictly speaking, legal acts of the Council of Europe itself but own their existence to the voluntary consent of member states. However, a convention has a binding nature with regard to those states which ratify it. It is a <Col N="1589" /> matter for each member state to decide whether to be a party to the charter but it is possible to exclude a limited number of articles from applying, while still adopting the charter.</P>
    <P>I think every Member of this House will agree when I say that the decision to ratify any international treaty or convention is a major step. The Government would be failing in their duty to the people if they did not carefully weigh up all the factors before binding the State to such a document.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from what I have said that the charter contains very important provisions. It deals with matters that are basic to our present local government system. Many of these are matters that also come within the scope of the Government's programme for local government reform. Therefore, we should, as I have said, look at the position in relation to the charter as the local government reform programme becomes more advanced. In saying this I am not in any way trying to avoid the issue of whether we should sign the charter. On the contrary, I believe local government reform must be the priority.</P>
    <P>The charter is an important document. The idea of signing it may well have merit but that will be a matter for the Government to decide when the time is right. I would not want to prejudge that decision, but there are two points I would like to make at this stage. First the aims of the local government reform programme are very much in line with the thinking behind the charter as well as the letter of its provisions, as I understand it. Second, while it may be seen as desirable to adopt the charter, what matters most as far as local government in Ireland is concerned is what the Government are doing to modernise, strengthen and improve the local government system.</P>
    <P>The Government are taking action which will bring major benefits to local government in Ireland. I will not ask Senators just to take my word for that. Senators who are members of either the Association of Municipal Authorities or the General Council of County Councils will know that those bodies have stated <Col N="1590" /> that the Local Government Act, 1991, contains many things that they had asked for over the years. Let me briefly remind the House of some of the major lasting benefits which the reform programme will bring to local government in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The key aims of the local government reform programme are to strengthen local democracy, to enhance the role of local authorities and to improve the system of local government. Local authorities must be accountable to their communities and be able to respond to their problems and needs. They must be in a position to encourage and support local action to improve their areas. The reform programme also aims to increase efficiency and gear the local government system to modern day needs. Local authorities must be able to deliver the services which the people need and they must give value for money in so doing.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that local authorities will be able to meet these objectives, important reforms are being put in place in the structures, powers, functions, status, procedures and operations of local authorities. The Government's commitment to the role of local government and to local government reform is clearly shown by the fact that a major element of reform legislation &mdash; the Local Government Act, 1991 &mdash; has already been enacted. This Act deals with many of the issues to which I have just referred.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Members of Seanad Éireann are aware of the importance of the Local Government Act, 1991, but I am not so sure that the importance of the Act has been fully grasped in all quarters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be useful, therefore, while we are dealing with an international convention on local government, to reflect on some of the very important changes that are being brought about in our local government system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1991 Act provides for measures, such as the loosening of the old <i>ultra vires</i><Col N="1591" /> rule, devolution of functions to local level and doing away with unnecessary controls or procedures in relation to local authorities. It also provides for much needed updating of important areas of local government law such as boundary changes and the committee system. The Act deals with important aspects of local government structures. it provides for reform of local government in Dublin and also for a regional tier to promote co-ordination in public services. The position of the county or city as the main unit of local government has, of course, been confirmed. Various provisions of the 1991 Act will enable the local authority to play a greater role in relation to local communities and in various civic activities.</P>
    <P>The Act will also help to ensure that the position of the elected members of local authorities is improved by, for example, statutory recognition of their policy making role, power to add to their reserved functions by order and provision for various improvements in their status and conditions.</P>
    <P>The few passing references I have made to some heading of the Act probably do not do justice to the extent and depth of its provisions, but even these few brief references should show that the local government system is undergoing a major process of change and renewal. It is important, therefore, that a proposal such as the adoption of the charter should be considered as part of this process.</P>
    <P>An important feature of the Local Government Act, 1991, is that it provides for reform on an on-going basis. This is important because reform cannot be brought about in a single action. It can only be done on a phased basis and in an orderly way. For this reason the timing of any decision in relation to the charter must be influenced by the development of the reform programme. The possibility of adopting the charter must be considered in the light of progress with the reform programme. This is not to say that a decision on the matter is being put on the long finger. The level of priority which the Government have given to the <Col N="1592" /> reform programme is shown by the fact that the 1991 Act was introduced within a very short time scale. Already over two-thirds of the provisions of the Act have been brought into force and work is in hands with a view to having remaining provisions brought into effect as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Government have indicated their intentions in relation to various aspects of the reform programme which have still to be implemented or decided. The recent review of the Programme for Government, for example, gave a commitment in regard to examination on the question of devolution of functions by Government Departments to local authorities taking into account the relevant proposals in the Barrington report. This is, of course, a key aspect of the reform programme.</P>
    <P>The review also indicated the intention that decisions in relation to proposals for sub-county local government structures would be taken by the Government before the end of this year. Decisions on matters such as these will be relevant to the question of adopting the Charter of Local Self-Government.</P>
    <P>If we wanted just to make some kind of gesture or to grab a bit of publicity, maybe we could sign the convention straightaway, but that would be to ignore the fact that it is a very detailed and complex document. To decide our position on the matter before many important areas of the reform programme are finalised would not be desirable &mdash; it would be getting our priorities a bit mixed up.</P>
    <P>As Senator will be aware, the adoption of the charter was recommended in the Barrington report on local government reform. the reason given for this was &ldquo;to underpin the role envisaged for local government as a partner in the overall system of government&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the proposers of this motion have done so because they feel it would be in the interests of local government to adopt the charter. I must point out that the Government also have the interests of local government at heart. That is why they have set out on a major <Col N="1593" /> programme of reform which has a higher priority.</P>
    <P>I must also point out that the role of local government is not dependent on signing this charter. The role of local government in Ireland is defined in a large body of law which has been built up over the years and decades. During the past four and three quarter years those powers and functions have been increased in many ways. In addition to the Local Government Act, 1991, I could mention, for example, legislation in the areas of air pollution, water pollution, housing, roads, planning, urban renewal, derelict sites and electoral matters. Furthe Bills are proposed in relation to waste and road traffic.</P>
    <P>New types of roles have also been given to local authorities. I can give examples in two areas in which I have a special interest &mdash; housing and urban renewal. The plan for social housing, which was announced earlier this year, brings a new approach to dealing with housing needs. A most important aspect of the plan is the fact that all the schemes are devolved to the local authorities from the start. That is yet another example of the confidence and trust which the Government place in local authorities. It gives further proof of the Government's commitment to the role of local government.</P>
    <P>In the case of the urban renewal scheme, local authorities had to take on a new type of role in helping to generate private sector investment for good of their areas. Some authorities have been more successful than others, but the fact that over £1 billion worth of investment has been created and many rundown areas in our towns have been brought back to life shows what local authorities can do.</P>
    <P>The local government reform programme will help to put local authorities in a better position to play new roles and meet new challenges. Local authorities will, as I have already said, be better able to respond to the needs of their communities and to play a full part in the development of their areas.</P>
    <P>This House need have no doubts about the role of local government or about the <Col N="1594" /> fact that the Government see the local authorities as partners in working for economic and social progress. It should also be clear to the House that the wellbeing of local government in Ireland does not depend on the signing of a convention, no matter how good that document may be.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with one other point before I finish. The motion before the House refers to maximising the Structural Funds allocated to Ireland and putting those funds to their most effective use. The Community support framework provided for a minimum of £2.8 billion in Structural Fund assistance to Ireland over the period 1989-93. Ireland is generally considered by the other member states to have negotiated an extremely high proportion of the total Structural Funds available and it is difficult to envisage how delegation of negotiating powers to a lower tier of Government could have resulted in even higher levels of assistance being secured.</P>
    <P>As far as local authorities are concerned, total Structural Fund aid of £508 million has been provided over the period 1980-93 to support State investment in roads and water and sanitary services. This amounts to EC aid of over £100 million a year for projects carried out by local authorities throughout the country for the benefit of all, including, of course, local communities.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that the position in relation to the charter will be kept under review as the reform programme develops. It may well be that in the light off the further progress being made with the reforms the Government will decide that it is desirable to adopt the charter. If so, well and good, but in the meantime the local authorities will be getting on with the job and we will be pressing ahead with the necessary reforms to ensure that they will be able to continue to do a good job on behalf of their communities.</P>
    <P>I have had a long association with local authorities throughout the country and up to the recent election, i was a member of a local authority. Even before we brought the 1991 reform Bill into the House, members of local authorities <Col N="1595" /> knew, as did members of Dublin Corporation, that they could redraft their expenditure estimates. I do not know whether the Senator is aware of that, but I want to assure Senator Hederman that that is the position.</P>
    <P>There are only so much funds available for any project. Whether it comes from central funds or from own resources, that is a matter for the authority. if any local authority want to raise funds from their own resources it is open to them to do so. I know that local authorities over the years have taken all the easy options, but when times got hard they were very quick to come back and ask the Government of the day for money. They would ask the minister of the day to give the money for a project, but that is not the kernel of the issue. The kernel is that the money must be provided, whether it comes from central funds or from their own resources. At the end of the day the taxpayer has to pay. That is the bottom line.</P>
    <P>I hate anyone standing up here, being hypocritical and talking about providing a service. They must spell out for me &mdash; and I asked this of my own councillors back home &mdash; if there is a better way of dealing with the estimate. Our estimate in Offaly County Council went through unanimously without amendment. As far as I and my party were concerned &mdash; and we are a minority there &mdash; if anybody disagreed with us we wanted them to tell us where the money was to come from. Local authority members today have many powers but, generally speaking, they take the easy option. They do not want to have the unpleasant task of putting extra expenditure on their own areas. That is their prerogative. I accept that it is the prerogative of every local authority to decide their priorities and to decide their expenditure, but if they come to the Minister for the Environment seeking more funds they must spell out for me where this money is coming from, because the Department have only one budget. The money is not there and I am not prepared to go down that road.</P>

      <P>Senator Hederman and Senator Ryan, the proposers of this motion, are calling on the Government to sign and ratify the Council of Europe Charter of Local Self-Government. They are perfectly entitled to make such a proposal. The charter contains much that is praiseworthy. For example, it is designed to protect and strengthen local autonomy. This is a very desirable ambition. Where I mainly find fault with the proposers of this motion is that they seem to be suggesting that the system of local government in Ireland is somewhat inferior and that by adopting this charter major benefits will suddenly result for our local authorities and local communities. This is not the case. It is right and proper that we take a European wide view of things. the matters under consideration this week at the Maastricht Summit should serve to bring home to us the fact that our future lies in a wider European context. However, I can say without fear of contradiction that our local authorities can stand comparison with their counterparts throughout Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Charter of Local Self-Government. It is the first <Col N="1597" /> legal statement at international level of standards and safeguards for local government. It includes a provision relating to a constitution on a legal basis for local self-government. It defines the nature and scope of local government and local authority powers. Further articles deal with the boundaries of local authorities, their administrative structures and staff conditions for the holding of local elective office. There are provisions dealing with the supervision of local authority activities and their financial resources. Other provisions include the right of local authorities to co-operate and form associations and the protection of local self-government by the right of recourse to a legal remedy.</P>
    <P>Most Members of this House will agree that our local authorities have on the whole served us well over the years. Consider the essential services they provide, throughout the country, such as water and sanitation, and the wide range of amenities, like swimming pools, libraries and parks. Their contribution to economic and social development is enormous. Without the infrastructure which local authorities provide progress would be impossible. I hate to think what conditions would be like without the efforts made by local authorities over the years to meet people's housing needs. In recent times the local authorities have shown that they are capable of taking on new challenges, such as the protection of the environment and other functions referred to by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is a reference in the motion to Structural Funds. I am a bit lost as to what connection there is between the EC Structural Funds and the possible adoption of a Council of Europe charter. The Minister has dealt very fully with the question of the Structural Funds and left the House in no doubt as to the success we have achieved both in maximising the level of funding and putting it to the best possible use. There seems to be an implication in the motion that unless the Council of Europe charter is adopted, <Col N="1598" /> our local government system will be neglected. Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made it quite clear that the Government are fully committed to local government and that the proof of this is to be found in the action which they are taking to strengthen and develop the local government system. Nowhere is that commitment better personified than in the case of Deputy Connolly as Minister. He has always shown himself in this House and elsewhere to be a true friend of local government. I would like to compliment him for the manner in which he has dealt with this issue and for the very full account he has given to this House of the measures being taken by the Government in relation to local government.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be seen as knocking the Charter of Local Self-Government, far from it, but many of its provisions correspond with the best features of our local government system. However, the key point, as stated by the Minister of State, is that the priority at this stage is to press ahead with the urgent job of local government reform which the Government have undertaken. The Minister has indicated in his speech that the Government are taking action which will bring major benefits to local government in Ireland. The key aims of the local government reform programme are to strengthen local democracy, to enhance the role of local authorities and to improve the system of local government. Local authorities must be accountable to their communities and be able to respond to their problems and needs. They must be in a position to encourage and support local action to improve their areas. The reform programme also aims to increase efficiency and gear the local government system to modern day needs. Local authorities must be able to deliver the services which the people need and they must give value for money in doing so.</P>

      <P>Before I deliver my speech proper in supporting Senator Hederman's motion, I have to respond to the Minister's provocative and passionate address, but I will not respond in such a passionate way. I would like to put on the record that our local authority, Limerick County Council, passed their estimates, but the group who passed the estimates were Fine Gael-Progressive Democrats and the group who opposed were Fianna Fáil. When we did not get the minimal 3 per cent we expected in line with inflation in the rates support grant from the Department we had to go back again and look for another £310,000. I will run through the list of cuts to the community that the opposition members proposed because we wished to be constructive &mdash; cutting back members' expenses, increasing water rates, increasing the refuse tag, removing rent anomalies, but with a slight increase, abolishing our public lighting programme which means that there will not be a single light put up in 1991-92 by Limerick County Council. The sacrifices were made by the members, who had to sell the unpalatable to an already starved electorate. The Minister mentioned some councils going back to the Department of the Environment looking for more money, but our council were constructive and the reaction, the negative vibes and the running to the newspapers stating that Fine Gael were doing this, that and the other came from the Fianna Fáil group. To my mind, this was deplorable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are talking about in this motion is the principle of subsidiarity. This phrase, like the Eurospeak we have day in, day out, is something which everybody holds dear, but obviously it is not being implemented. The principle of subsidiarity is the bedrock of European economic policy. At the last council meeting of public representatives in the Fine Gael group, this charter was adopted and a motion sent to the Minister asking him to have it signed. Likewise last month in Limerick County Council I again proposed that the council would write to the Minister asking that this document, which Senator Ryan says is <Col N="1600" /> not revolutionary &mdash; it is innovative but not revolutionary &mdash; be signed. The motion was also adopted by Limerick County Council and the County Secretary was asked to get in touch with all other local authorities in the country to ask them to put pressure on the Minister to sign this document.</P>
    <P>It is interesting, and rather ironic I suppose, that at a time when Maastricht has taken place and when economic and social cohesion was on the agenda that here we are not committed to the objectives outlined in this European Charter of Local Self-Government, which is absolutely in tune with what the Taoiseach went to Maastricht to discuss. We are one of the very few, if not the only country, which has not signed or committed itself to it.</P>
    <P>It is important to look at the preamble to this, because it sharpens our focus to what the charter states and we will see the inadequacies of the local government system in this country. If I were saying this before the Local Government Act, 1991, I would not be as pessimistic, but this Act has already gone through. Granted not all the reforms are implemented, but the Act and preamble to this document do not knit, there is no integration.</P>
    <P>The preamble states:</P>
    <P>Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity between its members (This was obviously discussed in Maastricht yesterday) for the purpose of safeguarding and realising the ideals and principles which are their common heritage; considering that one of the methods by which this aim is to be achieved is through agreements in the administrative field; considering that the local authorities are one of the main foundations of any democratic regime; (and we really have to accept that) considering that the right of citizens to participate in the conduct of public affairs is one of the democratic principles that are shared by all member States of the Council of Europe; (I will go back to that again: <Col N="1601" /> the right of citizens to participate, certainly not at local authority level) convinced that the existence of local authorities with real responsibilities can provide an administration which is both effective and close to the citizen.</P>
    <P>No wonder the Minister says we have to look at this over and over again and be cautious, because I am sure he is agreeing with me that local authorities have no real responsibilities. Therefore, we cannot even accept the preamble here.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are as effective as they can be within the restraints of little finance and limited powers, but they are certainly close to the citizen, close to public representatives, but not consumer friendly or user friendly when it comes to access for the ordinary Mary or Jack on the street. The preamble continues:</P>
    <P>Aware that the safeguarding and reinforcement of local government in the different European countries is an important contribution to the construction of a Europe based on the principles of democracy and the decentralisation of power; (We could have many discussions, debates and motions in relation to the lack of decentralisation.) Asserting that this entails the existence of local authorities endowed with democratically constituted decision-making bodies and possessing a wide degree of autonomy with regard to their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I could go on and on, but every single key word there is a word that certainly is not synonymous with local authorities and their effectiveness or their powers.</P>
    <P>What we are really saying is that we would be ashamed if we signed it because we would not be fulfilling any of the requirements. Take the first section in relation to the Constitution: &ldquo;The principle of local self-government should be recognised in domestic legislation and, where practicable, in the Constitution&rdquo;. The only reference in the Constitution that I could find in relation to the fact that we even exist is that four local authorities would have the right to nominate a presidential candidate. That is all in relation <Col N="1602" /> to local authorities and our Constitution. It is no wonder we do not have power when we are not even acknowledged in our Constitution and no wonder the Government are lethargic in relation to signing this.</P>
    <P>As I read on and on I found I was getting more and more depressed. When I inquired from the Department of the Environment in relation to this motion 12 months ago I was told: there is a reason for it, but do not worry because it really relates to local government reform and when the Local Government Reform Bill is passed and becomes and Act there will be no problem because after that we will go ahead and sign this. That was the sort of idea given but that is totally in contradiction with what the Minister has told us here: that we must tread warily. I ask the Minister how long, how far have we to tread and how wary must we be, because the document is a very pleasant one, quite user friendly and quite a democratic document. I see nothing in the document to be alarmed about, not even to the point of idealism. It is basic, it is practical and it is in line with what we have been asked in relation to an integrated Europe and regional policy. I do not know what the hubbub is about. I think it could be signed tomorrow morning but I suppose we would have to implement it and the Government are very slow to implement what is being looked for there.</P>
    <P>Nothing has changed in relation to the Local Government Act. I would implore the Minister of State to ask the newly appointed Minister for the Environment to get immediately to task to do something about having regional authorities in place as quickly as possible, because there is no doubt about it in relation to the 1993-1998 funds from Europe. Bruce Millan was in Limerick not so very long ago and he stated quite honestly that he was concerned the regions were missing out considerably in this country when we did not have access to funding from Europe. He more or less implied that if we did not get our act together some directive would come from Brussels stating in relation to the next tranche of <Col N="1603" /> Euro-funding that there might be a nice little turning of the screw in relation to ourselves, that we would have to have regional authorities in place to be able to get our direct funding. That is occupying the minds of everybody in this country at this moment.</P>

      <P>Again, we had a German MEP over who spoke in the Jean Monnet Theatre in the University of Limerick. He was quite an elderly gentleman, a man of great experience. He asked, quite honestly, in an excellent address: what is wrong with Ireland that it seems just to turn a blind eye to regional authorities having the power of direct access to Brussels for funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of the subregional review, I would have to say that that regional review, which was set up to monitor funds and how they are spent, has an extremely competent and expert grouping of people on it. It is not as if you are throwing all these millions into regions and that they have not a clue or a notion as to what projects would be best served by the input of funding. You have county managers and city managers, you have public representatives, you have representatives of farming organisations, you have representatives of employers, you have representatives of trade unions, you have the integrated force of people at ground level who know absolutely what is needed in the mid-west. We do not have to ask individuals from various Departments, who are also on the sub-regional review and who feel quite pained at having to answer our questions. After all, they are only the arm of the Minister and all they can say at the end of the day is that this is what the Minister says. I know that their hearts are with us, but they know themselves that the proper way for having any distribution of funding is to put it back into the regions. For instance, in the mid-west region we had to bring up that we found it was extraordinary that we had a bit of <Col N="1604" /> Kerry and that the other bit of Kerry was in another region. How do you have a proper tourism policy for a county where one part is in one region and another part is in another region? There must be flexibility. It took the sub-regional review committee and local authority members to point out how ridiculous this is.</P>
    <P>We have sub-regional review committees which close the door after the horse has bolted. They monitor the funds but they do not have any say as to where the funding should go. That is what we are talking about when we are talking about the principle of subsidiarity and giving citizens a voice. Communities are far more alert now than they were ten or 20 years ago. They are given programmes and understand the concept of self-help. They raise their own funds. However, at the end of the day, this is just tossed aside because the attitude adopted is that the individual and the local authority do not matter as the Government know best and the Minister for Finance will direct as he sees fit.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann approved the terms of the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Regional Fisheries Boards (Postponement of Elections) Order, 1991</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Seanad Éireann on 7 November, 1991.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Nonnan, Limerick West) Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Nonnan, Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Nonnan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> The effect of the draft order referred to in the motion before the House is to postpone elections to the regional fisheries boards until 1992. These elections were due to be help in 1991 in accordance with section 12 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, which provides for elections to be held every fifth year. The last elections were held in December 1986. The elections, however, became inextricably liked to the implementation of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1991, which came into operation recently and <Col N="1606" /> it was not possible to conduct the elections in the current year within the time available.</P>
      <P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1991, as Members of the House are no doubt aware, provides for the establishment of fisheries co-operatives societies to raise and disburse for the public benefit funds for the development of trout and coarse fisheries to replace the licensing arrangements instituted under the 1987 Act. The Act also provides that the election of the management committees of the co-ops and the ballot by co-ops members on the requirement to hold a share certificate to angle for trout or coarse fish shall be held at the same time as the regional board elections.</P>
      <P>Election of members of regional fisheries boards are conducted in accordance with regulations under section 12 of the 1980 Act. These regulations stipulate the arrangements under which candidates may be nominated and postal ballots conducted. This process requires six to eight weeks.</P>
      <P>The Elections to Regional Fisheries Boards Regulations, 1981, (S.I. No. 361 of 1981) were made prior to the first elections to elect board members in December 1981. Some minor amendments were made to these regulations prior to the 1986 elections by the Elections of Regional Fisheries Boards (Amendment) Regulations, 1986, (S.I. No. 352 of 1986). The regulations need to be amended prior to the next board elections. Amendments are necessary to take account of the effect of the Fisheries (Amendment) (No. 2) 1987, and the recent 1991 Act.</P>
      <P>It is also necessary to amend the Fisheries Regions Order, 1980, which <i>inter alia</i>, specifies the area and name of each region, the number of members for each board, the classes of electorate for elections to boards and the number of members to be elected to each board by each class of electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments both to the regulations and the Fisheries Regions Order need to be made before the electoral process begins. In addition, it is necessary to establish the angling development <Col N="1607" /> societies, introduce rules including procedures for the conduct of elections and ballots and appoint trustees to manage them pending the election of the management committee.</P>
    <P>There was undue delay in the passage of the Bill when the Opposition parties refused to agree to take a simple Seanad amendment in the Dáil before the summer recess. The amendment was finally passed by the Dáil on 23 October 1991. This long delay rendered it impossible to implement the organisational and administrative arrangements necessary to conduct the elections this year.</P>
    <P>Of particular concern to all those involved, including the angling organisations and the regional fisheries boards, was the fact that the trout angling season for 1991 was over by the time the Dáil had passed the Bill and consequently the potential for selling share certificates for the current year was very limited. This situation would mean that with the regional board elections due in December 1991 the electorate, for the purpose of electing management committees voting on the share certificate requirement and electing representatives to the regional fisheries boards, would be very limited. All the interested parties, including the angling organisations and the fisheries boards, are agreed that the postponement of the elections to the regional boards and consequently the election and ballots of the co-ops for one year is necessary to allow adequate time for the co-ops to be properly established and to give anglers ample opportunity to purchase share certificates.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the Minister for the Marine reluctantly came to the conclusion that the best course of action was for me to make an order under section 15 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, postponing the elections for one year. That section, however, specifies that such an order shall not be made by the Minister until a resolution approving of the draft of the order has been passed by the Seanad. The motion before the House provides for this and I, accordingly, commend it for the approval of Senators.</P>

      <P>Is dócha go bhfuil sé sonrach go bhfuilimid sa Teach seo arís ag plé le hAcht iascaigh atá leasaithe ón mbliain seo caite. Ní mór a rá freisin go raibh gá leis an leasú seo ionas go bhfeádfadh na daoine a bhí páirteach i ngnó na hiascaireachta dul ar aghaidh leis. Dúirt mé é sa Teach seo cheana, nuair a bhí an Bille ag dual tríd, go raibh an rud uilig a bhí i gceist sa Bhille bunaithe ar phrionsabal nach bhfuil inoibrithe de bharr nach bhfuil an fhealsúnacht i gceart i leith bunú comharchumainn. Chonaic mé go raibh go leor deacrachtaí ann. D'fhéadfadh Aire Rialtais nó Aire Stáit ar bith teacht isteach anseo agus a rá go raibh sé ag dul ag bunú comharchumainn timpeall na tíre agus gurb eisean amháin a bheadh ag leagadh síos na rialacha do na comharchumainn sin agus gach rud eile a bhainfeadh leo. Sin é go díreach atá ráite sa Bhille.</P>
      <P>Dá mbeadh an tAire i mbun gnótha i gceart agus dá mbeadh sé ag comhlíonadh a chuid dualgaisí mar a bhí ordaithe sa Bhille ní cóir go mbeimis sa Teach seo. Cuid den rud a bhí le déanamh de réir an Bhille ná go mbeadh daoine tofa ar na boird seo, agus mar a dúirt an tAire Stáit ar ball beag, tá sé cúig bliana ó bhí siad ann cheana. Bhí sé mar chuid bunúsach den reachtaíocht go mbeadh vóta ag chuile dhuine a bheadh cláraithe sa chomharchumann agus go mbeadh an vóta sin á chaitheamh acu le go bhféadfaí daoine a thoghadh ar na boird iascaigh réigiúnacha timpeall na tíre. Deirtear linn gurb é an Freasúra faoi ndear muid a bheith anseo anocht, gurb é an Freasúra a chuir in aghaidh leasú beag simplí a bhí os comhair an tSeanaid an bhliain seo caite, agus nár éirigh leis an Dáil é a chur tríd go dtí 23 Deireadh Fómhair. Mar gheall air sin deirtear go raibh am curtha amú agus fad mór ama imithe ó cuireadh an Bille tríd go dtí go raibh deis ag na comharchumainn seo éirí den talamh agus rud éigin a dhéanamh. Bhí sé i gceist ansin go mbeadh an oiread sin comharchumann timpeall na tíre le go bhféadfaí seo a dhéanamh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leagadh síos sa Bille gurb é Aire na Mara féin a bheadh freagrach as chuile <Col N="1609" /> shórt a chur in ord le go ndéanfaí cinnte de go mbeadh an Bille seo, a bhí imithe tríd an Dáil agus an Seanad, bunaithe i gceart nó &ldquo;properly established&rdquo; mar atá ráite ag an Aire Stáit anseo inniu. Tá sé fánach ar go leor bealaí do Aire Stáit teacht isteach anseo agus a chur i leith an Fhreasúra gurb iad a chuir moill leis seo. Níl aon dabht i m'intinnse nó in intinn go leor daoine eile, nach n-oibreoidh na comharchumainn iascaigh seo. Go bunúsach ní oibreoidh siad mar nach bhfuil siad bunaithe ar phrionsabal ceart. Tá rialacha chomharchumainn na n-iascairí faoin Bhille seo chomh mór sin as alt agus chomh mór sin imithe ó bhun-phrionsabail an chomharchumannachais nach bhféadfadh siad a bheith go maith. Níl aon dóchas agam go n-eireoidh leo. I dtuairim go leor daoine, bhí an Bille atá anois imithe tríd an Dáil agus an Seanad lochtach, go mórmhór ó thaobh bunu na gcomharchumann de agus ó thaobh úinéarachta de. Níl aon úinéaracht ag na hiascairí ar na lochanna ach san am céanna tá siad i bhfeighil na lochanna ó thús deireadh de réir an Achta atá i bhfeidhm ag an bpointe seo.</P>
    <P>Nach aisteach an rud é, sular shaighneáil an tUachtarán an Bille seo go b'éigean di fios a chur ar Chomhairle an Stáit lena dtuairim sin a fháil. Is é an toradh a bhí air sin ná gur chinn an tUachtarán é a shaighneáil. B'fhéidir go ndéarfadh daoine go gcaithfeadh go raibh an Bille seo cruinn agus ceart anois nuair a bhí Uachtarán na tíre sásta é a shaighneáil agus gan é a chur go dtí an Chúirt Uachtarach le go bhfaighfí amach an raibh sé de réir dlí nó dé réir an Bhunreachta nó nach raibh. Tá a fhios agam an fáth nach ndearna an tUachtarán é a shaighneáil ar dtús. Tá mé cinnte go raibh dabht aici féin faoi cé chomh maith nó cé chomh dona nó cé chomh lag is a bhí an Bille. Rinne sí rud ciallmhar, dar liomsa, ag deireadh an lae agus é a shaighneáil, mar dá ndéanfadh sí a mhalairt agus amach anseo dá bhfaighfí amach go raibh run éigin mí-cheart nó mí-chontráilte leis an mBille ní fhéadfaí é a thógaint ar ais agus é a cheistiú níos mó. D'fhág sí an bearna ann sa chaoi go bhféadfadh saoránach ar bith an tAcht seo a thabhairt go dtí na <Col N="1610" /> cúirteanna ar ball agus suas go dtí an Chúirt Uachtarach lena fháil amach an raibh sé de réir Bunreachta nó nach raibh. Sin an fáth nár shaighneáil sí an Bille agus i mó thuairimse ba mhaith an run é nár shaighneáil sí é.</P>

Mura ndéanfaí é sin ní bheadh aon deis go deo na ndeor arís an Bille seo a bhréagnú nó a lochtú nó a fháil amach an raibh aon rud mí-cheart leis nó nach raibh.</P>
      <P>Tá sé aisteach go bhfuil na toghcháin curtha siar bliain eile. Ní féidir leis na toghcháin a bheith ann nuair nach bhfuil na comharchumainn bunaithe, nuair nach bhfuil duine údarásach ann le insint dúinn go bhfuil na comharchumainn bunaithe, agus nuair atá sé cinnte chomh maith ceanann céanna nach mbeimid in ann dul ar aghaidh amach anseo leis an reachtaíocht. D'iarr an tAire ar Bhord Réigiúnach Iascaigh an Iarthair, mar shampla, agus ar Bhord Réigiúnach Iascaigh an Oirthir, animneacha a chur ar fáil dó. Ní dhearna siad é. Cén fáth? Mar nach bhfuil tada déanta ag an Aire lena chinntiú go bhfuil an tAcht á fheidhmniú. Dá mbeadh an tAcht mar a ritheadh tríd an Oireachtas á fheidhmiú bheadh seans éigin ann go gcuirfí na comharchumainn seo i mbun oibre. Fós féin, déanadh anchuid deifir nuair a chuaigh na Billí seo tríd an Teach seo le go bhféadfadh siad a bheith ceart don séasúr atá caite.</P>
      <P>Cad tá déanta ag an Aire Ó shin chun féachaint chuige go mbeadh comharchumainn sa chás seo cláraithe, a n-ainmneacha in ord, na teastais bronnta agus gach rud in eagar? Ní féidir gníomhú mar go bhfuil uimhir mhór iascairí ag cur in aghaidh phrionsabal an Achta sa mhéid is go dtugtar cumhacht ann do Aire comharchumann a bhunadh. Ní féidir le Aire comharchumann a bhunadh; is é an daonlathas a dhéanfaidh é sin, ní an mórlathas.</P>

Ní raibh aon airgead acu agus bhí gach cosúlacht ann nach mairfeadh siad. Béigean do bhord an iarthair breis is £100,000 a chaitheamh tar éis na timpiste i mBallycotton i gContae Chorcaí, chun culaithe slándála agus traenáil slándála a chur ar fáil. Níor cheap na boird seo go mbeadh an oiread sin airgid le caitheamh acu agus anois ag deireadh na bliana, níl pingin fágtha acu.</P>
    <P>Tá sé furasta toghcháin a chur siar mar atá i gceist anseo. Ní mór na toghcháin a chur siar ní de bharr cur isteach ón Fhreasúra ach toisc nár éirigh leis an Aire na rudaí a chur sé roimhe san Acht a thabhairt i gcrích. Tá súil agam, an <Col N="1612" /> samhradh seo chugainn, go ngcomhlíonfaidh an tAire a dhualgaisí, go gcuirfear na comharchumainn ar bun, más féidir é agus go mbeidh rudaí ina cheart.</P>
