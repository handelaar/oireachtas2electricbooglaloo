      <P>I have notice from Senator Dardis that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to investigate the circumstances which caused the contamination of the water supply in Naas, County Kildare, and the need to review the response of the relevant authorities to the incident, with a view to minimising the risk to public health in the future.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Jackman of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to notify local authorities immediately of their rate support grants to facilitate local authorities in collecting their estimates.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to take immediate action to resolve the serious courts dispute involving 274 clerical staff.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Kennedy of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="538" /> The need for the Minister for Justice to intervene in the industrial dispute affecting the courts which is having a crippling effect on court procedures, probate, Land Registry and other significant legal matters.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Dardis, Jackman, Neville and Kennedy as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Dardis' matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Jackman, Neville and Kennedy may give notice another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, we will certainly co-operate in trying to get all Stages through but I do not want a guillotine motion here this morning. Given the extraordinary respect and deference which the Taoiseach is now showing to the Members of this House, perhaps the Leader of the House might be able to arrange for a Bill to begin in this House, given, as I said, the enhanced status which this House suddenly enjoys at the present time.</P>

      <P>I would like to plead with the Leader of the House to have a debate on the Maastricht Summit. Seemingly they have not got time in the other House to discuss it. The decisions that will be arrived at that summit, as I said here last week, will reflect not only this generation but generations to come. We should be given an opportunity to express the views of the people through the representatives in this House since they are not doing it in the other House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would not like to see a guillotine on the Sea Pollution Bill. We should be able to get through the business in the day but without any time <Col N="539" /> limit put on it. I welcome the fact that at last we have got the Register of the Members of the Oireachtas Interests Bill as the first item on the agenda after the Christmas recess. That is very timely and appropriate in terms of what has been happening recently.</P>
      <P>I echo the call made by Senator Tom Raftery to have a full debate on the Maastricht Summit in this House because it is so important in relation to the events that are taking place leading to January 1993.</P>
      <P>I still deplore the fact that we have not had an opportunity to discuss the very important events that are taking place outside this House and that have been discussed in the Lower House for the last four weeks. In particular I would ask the Leader of the House to give us an opportunity of discussing the correctness of press briefings by the Government press spokesperson, seeing that the Progressive Democrats had to disassociate themselves from remarks made by the Government Press Secretary.</P>

      <P>I would like to echo what my colleague, Senator Raftery, said and ask the Leader of the House if he would eleborate on his plans for a debate on the Common Agricultural Policy and on the forthcoming Maastricht Summit. This matter has been the subject of great debate within our group over the last number of weeks and I am confident that the Leader of the House will respond sympathetically to Senator Raftery's call which Senator Costello and I support.</P>
      <P>I would also ask the Leader of the House whether there are any implications for the continuing broadcasting of the proceedings of this House or any threat to same as a result of the proceedings currently in the High Court concerning Windmill Lane.</P>

      <P>This morning I received in the post a copy of the Local Government (Reform) Bill. Today, 7 November, as we approach the end of the year and are looking to our estimates for local authorities for 1992, I believe the Leader of the House should bear in mind the urgency of advising us of the amounts of money that will be allocated this year. It is our right. The people have a right to a viable local authority system and the local <Col N="542" /> authorities are in a state of chaos at present. Would the Leader of the House advise the Minister that the block grants are vital for the viability of next year's programmes, if we are to have any? Would he also ensure that, as soon as possible, all local authorities are advised of moneys about to be allocated for programmes in the coming year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with the calls to the Leader of the House in relation to European affairs and the Maastricht Summit. I would ask him to try to find time for a debate on that matter either before the summit or immediately after it because I believe it will have profound implications for Ireland. We are facing fundamental changes in our relationship with the Community and in the way we operate our own Parliament. From that point of view this is something we are going to have to give every consideration to.</P>
      <P>Many Senators will be aware that yesterday, at the Irish Council of the European Movement, there was a detectable shift in attitudes to neutrality in particular. I realise that that is not a matter for the summit but if there are profound changes of that nature taking place, it would be appropriate for this House to consider them and I would ask the Leader to take that into account.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter I would like to draw to his attention, and perhaps he would communicate our concerns to the Minister for Justice about it. I am speaking about the current dispute in the courts. According to the information I have people who are wards of court &mdash; people who are incapacitated in many ways, sometimes mentally and physically are not being paid the money due to them because of that dispute. It has always been the practice that people who are disadvantaged would not have to suffer because of industrial action but these people are suffering. I would ask the Leader of the House to bring that view to the Minister for Justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to the calls to the Leader of the <Col N="543" /> House for a general debate on the present political situation. This House is eminently suitable for such a debate, and perhaps we would give it the time and attention in not quite so polarised an arena as in the other House and maybe tease out many of the problems and concerns being spoken of to us by the electorate at large. May I also ask the Leader to consider a debate on the Maastricht Summit? This is the House most suitable for that type of debate and I am afraid we are going to have a major job awakening the public to the importance of the upcoming referendum &mdash; as far as I am concerned the successful outcome of that referendum &mdash; and let us start the debate in Seanad Éireann. Let us encourage others, through the media, to get in on the debate so that the people who have many problems will come down the road with us and appreciate what is at stake. It is most important that this Chamber has a good profound debate and let us start the process now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to second that and support the call for a debate on the Maastricht Summit. The debate has been started by the Irish Council of the European Movement and it had a major debate on subjects leading up to yesterday. However, I think we are approaching what is probably one of the most important issues to face the Irish nation in 2,000 years. We need to have this debate. This is very important and I ask the Leader to give us that debate as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Raftery's call for an early debate on EC reform, before the summit. It will not be much use if the House does not have an input before the Taoiseach and the Ministers attend the summit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Leader if he can fit in a debate on the famine in a number of African countries. It would be appropriate to have such a debate before the Christmas break. The unfortunate populations in a number of countries are not getting the aid the free world should be <Col N="544" /> giving them because of the political situation in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. I hope the House will be given an opportunity to call the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the plight of millions of people on the African continent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was listening to the radio on the way here this morning and I heard the national lottery are providing the organisers of the Pavarotti concert at the Point Depot with £250,000. It is rather strange that we have social organisations &mdash; the Rape Crisis Centre comes to mind &mdash; that are going out of business for want of money. If the national lottery must give £250,000 to some organisation, it would be better to give it to a social organisation like the Rape Crisis Centre. I would like the Cathaoirleach to pass on that suggestion. I am not sure who is in charge of the national lottery at present; it appears to be the Department of the Environment. I think they should look at it. People who want to go to see Pavarotti can afford to pay for their tickets. This should be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would again request the Leader of the House to arrange for a debate on the proposed increase of 40 per cent on car hire rates for next season. If this happens, it will have a devastating effect on the future of tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say to Senator Manning that at all times Senator Wright and I will continue to seek to have Bills initiated in this House. Senator Raftery and others asked about the Maastricht Summit next month and the European scene. I have given a commitment that as soon as a White Paper is produced we will have a debate in this House. I made it clear yesterday&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be after the summit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but the whole area of EC policy pre-1992 will be considered in the White Paper that will be produced soon. As soon as we have it we can certainly have a debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="545" /> Senator Costello and others asked about the current political situation. I indicated yesterday the Whips would meet on this matter and see what can be done to have a debate arranged over the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney asked about Windmill Lane, and rightly so because we are all watching this matter with interest. It is, a Chathaoirligh, as you have said, <i>sub judice</i> and I would prefer not to comment on it except to say we have a particular interest in it and we are watching the matter with concern.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan asked about the rates support grant. I have indicated to the appropriate Minister the concern of local authorities throughout Ireland to know the position as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis asked again about the courts dispute. Senator Lydon and others spoke about the summit and other EC matters and Senator McDonald asked for a debate on famine in Africa. I have no proposals for such a debate at this time. Senator Bohan referred to the national lottery and I share his views on that. Senator Foley asked for a debate on tourism; I will continue to investigate this matter to see if it can be arranged as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Sea Pollution Bill, 1990: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to say a few words about the Title of the Bill and the reasons we have been debating it for so long. I thank the Leader of this House for giving us the time and the flexibility to give this Bill the sort of treatment it deserves. I do not think it is unrelated to the fact that there is not a great deal of legislation coming to this House. Despite the fact that this is an important Bill, symbolically, the fact that we are being given so much time to debate it is a reflection on this House, that there is no legislation coming to it and that the main <Col N="546" /> action in both the other House and this House is all going on offstage. Unfortunately the legislative programme which has been promised between now and Christmas is extremely flimsy and we are not expected to get any major Bills as far as I can see before then. That is a great pity and is something I hope will be sorted out in the context of the internal problems of another party between now and next week.</P>
      <P>The Sea Pollution Bill, 1990 is being given some sort of prominence really because we have nothing else to discuss. One of the problems about the Sea Pollution Bill is that whereas it has a very grandiose title it is not at all what it pretends to be. It is misnamed. While everybody in this House has welcomed the introduction of this Bill its contents are minimal. It is not a Sea Pollution Bill in any comprehensive sense at all. We have a habit in this House of giving Bills titles which are highly misleading because sooner or later the Government of the day are going to say: &ldquo;On the environment we introduce the following Bills...&rdquo; and this is one of those Bills they will claim to have introduced and the title, which is misleading, will suggest a concern for the environment which is not conveyed by the details of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, a very good Bill, before the House last year which was really a Bill about controlling pollution. We now have this Bill which really is a Bill which ratifies a few treaties. This Bill does not prevent pollution of our seas in any meaningful way; it does so only in a very minor way. This Bill is notable not for what is in it but, like so many other Bills, for what is not in it. It is the omissions rather than the inclusions which are so noticeable about this Bill because it really only ratifies conventions and protocols that were introduced and agreed by various countries as far back as 1973. There are no new initiatives in this Bill. There is no particular national Irish agenda in this Bill. There is nothing in it that does anything specifically for the Irish Sea or the Atlantic coast. I find it extraordinary <Col N="547" />&mdash; and there was no answer in the Minister's introductory speech &mdash; that it has taken so long for us to ratify the MARPOL agreement because it was as far back as 1973 that the first of these measures was introduced.</P>
    <P>For some extraordinary reason we are apparently, and the Minister can correct me, the last nation in Europe to ratify the MARPOL agreement and the protocols. I would like to know the reason. What has delayed the introduction of this Bill and was no pressure put on us by other nations in the EC to ratify these conventions? It is extraordinary the lack of priority which the Government have given to this Bill, the lack of concern and urgency. It is now 18 years since the protocols were agreed. It is also very odd that this Bill was introduced in the Dáil in July 1990 and we get it over a year later in this House. There was apparently no urgency about this Bill in the first place and there was absolutely no urgency about it after it was introduced in the Dáil itself.</P>
    <P>What is noticeable about the Bill is that it deals almost exclusively with pollution of the sea from ships at sea. What it does not deal with is other pollution of the sea which is far more harmful. The amount of pollution of the sea that can come from ships is obviously very limited, although damaging, but the Government missed an opportunity to tackle the main problem, the pollution of the sea which is far more damaging, which is mentioned in the Minister's speech but not in the Bill. The Bill is simply a standard type Bill which has passed through many EC countries but it is a missed opportunity. We did not take the opportunity to look at the pollution of the sea by nuclear waste, by plastics, or by sewage and we did not consider the damage caused by river pollution. We considered the problem of the pollution of the sea by sewage discharged by ships at sea but not the main problem of sewage discharged from the land. It is all very well for the Minister to say in his opening speech that we must also remember our relatively unpolluted <Col N="548" /> waters attract foreign tourists to this country. There is a major and a very regrettable concession in those two words &ldquo;relatively unpolluted&rdquo;. Some years ago we could have said with pride that our seas and waters were unpolluted, but we now have to content ourselves with &ldquo;relatively unpolluted&rdquo; because some of our waters have become disgracefully polluted due to neglect.</P>
    <P>Some areas are much worse than others; the Atlantic coast is not as badly polluted as the Irish Sea. We cannot hold our head up in Europe any longer and say we have clean waters when the Irish Sea is heavily polluted by radiation and sewage, and our rivers are polluted by effluent and plastic.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal specifically with pollution of the sea by plastic because it is a notable and regrettable omission from this Bill. The Minister said in his opening speech that he intends to introduce regulations to deal with plastic pollution. He does not say what those regulations will be. He said that in framing regulations under the Sea Pollution Bill to cover Annex 5 the disposal of plastics at sea would be prohibited. I would like to know what those regulations will be.</P>
    <P>Many Members of this House have continually made pleas on successive legislation that assurances not be accepted as inbuilt parts of legislation. We should not accept that regulations which would not be debated by the House should slip into our legislation and be accepted by this House. With the best will in the world, and I do not question the Minister's integrity or intentions, it means that important legislation becomes enacted by regulations which have not been examined by the House. This is what is going to happen on the plastics issue and on other issues where the Minister is permitted to make regulations.</P>
    <P>It is an established fact of marine life that plastic is one of the most damaging substances present in sea water. According to the most recent figures issued by, I think, the United Nations, 5.5 million containers of plastic are thrown or find their way into the sea each day. In an <Col N="549" /> experiment carried out in Iceland, whales were taken in to see how badly they had been affected by sea pollution. It was found that 8 per cent of those whales had plastic in their guts. The sea is being polluted by plastic thrown from ships and coming from other sources in an increasingly horrendous way.</P>
    <P>Much of the sewage discharged into the sea is disposed of first in plastic containers. As the Minister knows plastic is a particularly dangerous pollutant as it is virtually indestructable. Many other pollutants are eroded by the chemicals and contents of sea water but plastic is durable, resistant and virtually immune to decay. It is one of the most damaging elements that can be ejected into the sea and I hope the Minister will completely and utterly probihit it in his regulations.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also be thinking of making regulations not just about plastic from ships which seems to be his intention in this particular Bill but regarding plastic emitted from land into the sea. That is a very serious problem and is being overlooked by this Bill which makes a minor attack on one aspect of sea pollution only.</P>
    <P>I want to deal also with the sensitive area of pollution by fishermen. We must acknowledge that many fishermen are guilty of pollution however unpopular the finding. Plastic dumped in the sea by fishing boats finds its way not only into the sea but into fish and onto beaches. Regulations must be drawn up to control the discharge of pollutants by fishermen, who must be allowed to make a good livelihood but who must be discouraged from abandoning their equipment and dumping plastic in the sea with adverse effect on marine life. Miles and miles of abandoned fishing nets lie off the Irish and European coasts and these are extraordinarily damaging to sea life and their disposal should be regulated.</P>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Minister what attitude the Government took in Europe last month, on 28 October, when there was a move in the European Commission to ban large drift nets of more than 2.5 kilometres in length. The result of this move was that, unexpectedly, <Col N="550" /> large drift nets of over 2.5 kilometres in length were banned by the European Community but many environmental groups indicated that Ireland was opposed to this particular banning. I could not discover and the Minister may be able to tell me Ireland's position in this matter because it was anticipated that Ireland and perhaps the UK and France, would oppose the banning of drift nets of over 2.5 kilometres. It seems to me that 2.5 kilometres is an awfully long drift net and the permitted size should be reduced even further if we are seriously concerned about the environment and about sea pollution. The damage these nets could do is quite mind boggling.</P>
    <P>Every year, worldwide, hundreds of thousands of dolphins, sea birds, turtles, swordfish and even whales fall victim to these vast strong finemesh nets. Greenpeace organised a very effective campaign to have drift nets over a certain length banned, and I have here a document from Greenpeace urging this Government and other European Governments to support such a banning and citing an incident which took place on the m.v. <i>Sirius.</i> This year Greenpeace produced a report on the destructive impact of French driftnet fisheries in the North Atlantic recording the contents of the catch in just 12 nets. Together with 2,089 tuna, the deadly drift nets had trapped five dolphins, 130 sharks, four swordfish, 82 pomfret, 34 jellyfish, 11 squid and 23 unidentified fish. Animals and fish unintentionally caught accounted for nearly a fifth of the entire catch. These driftnets are not only causing physical damage to the marine environment but are killing significant amounts of marine life unjustifiably.</P>
    <P>The sea is being polluted to an indefensible extent and fishermen are acting in a very cavalier manner as they take in their own catches.</P>
    <P>It is important to know whether Ireland supported Greenpeace on this or whether we voted against a progressive environmental measure to preserve marine life and prevent pollution of the sea. It would be appropriate to consider smaller permitted length for drift nets in <Col N="551" /> the Atlantic and to implement it. That would be a test of our commitment to the environment because, regrettably, we frequently depend on the international community, whether on the United Nations where the MARPOL Treaty originated or on the EC, to take environmental initiatives and we support them because we have very little option and then claim credit for environmental concern. We take little initiative ourselves on these matters and we have neglected to protect the seas under our control.</P>
    <P>I have here a glossy and very beautiful book produced by who else but the Department of the Environment. This book is basically a propaganda organ saying what a wonderful job the Department of the Environment have done, featuring some beautiful photographs and claiming credit for the Sea Pollution Bill, 1990, for which they have no right to claim credit because it is a ratification of an international treaty and not an initiative taken by the Government. It says in claiming credit for that: &ldquo;the Sea Pollution Bill, 1990, now before the Dáil will enable Ireland to accede to the MARPOL Convention&rdquo;&mdash; big deal &mdash; and &ldquo;empower the Minister for the Marine to make regulations governing the provision of reception facilities at ports and harbours for the discharge of oily residues and other substances.&rdquo; That is one point. &ldquo;Harbour authorities have been advised by the Department of the Marine that facilities must be installed for receiving ships' waste in all ports in advance of enactment of the proposed legislation.&rdquo; That is all it says or can say because there is not a great deal in this Bill for which the Department of the Environment can claim any credit. As it says, it is simply acceding to the MARPOL Convention and piggy backing on that Convention to claim credit for the Sea Pollution Bill here. They can claim credit for the name of the Bill which is named in such a way as to reflect well on the Government and award credit where it is not due.</P>
    <P>I would like to look in particular at the sewage situation. As a new member of a <Col N="552" /> local authority I am finding out a lot, about sewage, mainly. As it may not be a particularly attractive proposition to find out about sewage, I am glad to see three Government Senators here when the action is off stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a lot of it around this House during the last few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals only with the sewage boats dump in the sea and does not consider the appalling sewage situation around some of our coasts. It has been self-congratulatory in so many aspects and while the Government benches preside smugly over a Sea Pollution Bill I would ask Senator Mooney to visit my constitutency with me to see the disgraceful sewage situation there. When I was elected to the local authority I was appalled to find an indefensible quantity of sewage in the beautiful area of Greystones, County Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not as lovely as lovely Leitrim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not as lovely as lovely Leitrim because Leitrim is protected from pollution partly because so few people live there. The sewage situation in Greystones is quite dreadful because many housing estates have been built without proper planning and the provision of sanitary services. In a beautiful old village with a lovely coastline, the south beach and the harbour are polluted by raw sewage and, if you walk on the south boach, you will find &ldquo;no swimming&rdquo; signs and solids along the beach and floating in the sea. Not too many years ago young and old could bathe on that beautiful beach. That is a very simple example of the destruction that can be done to one of the most beautiful areas in Ireland by bad planning and by neglect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not justifiable for the Government to come before this House with a Bill of this sort which has been delayed for 18 years and call it a Sea Pollution Bill when they are conniving to neglect the sewage situation in Greystones where young <Col N="553" /> people are unable to bathe or picnic or enjoy natural facilities which had been their right for so long. It is even more depressing having talked to the Department of the Marine this morning on this issue to find that the programme for improving sewage disposal in the Greystones area has been put back. For many years to come, despite EC requirements, despite signing conventions, despite our breast beating about the environment, there are going to be raw solids floating around the harbour and the south beach in Greystones. Not the Minister, the Government or the county council care.</P>
    <P>I make one plea on this issue. I ask the Minister for the Marine, in Cabinet and out of Cabinet, to make representations to the Ministers responsible, and particularly to the Minister for the Environment, not to allow housing estates to be built or houses to be constructed in the absence of adequate sanitary facilities. It should not be permissible for people to build houses wherever they like in a sprawling mass without the necessary facilities. It is no good saying that the sea will absorb effluent; it is unacceptable now that the sea be polluted in order to facilitate the building of houses. We need better planning especially in coastal areas. There have been improvements in Dublin Bay; there is now a greater awareness of sea pollution possibilities in certain areas and by some local authorities but in other areas, particularly coasting onto the Irish Sea the situation is quite disgraceful; it has been neglected and needs immediate corrective action.</P>
    <P>The area of nuclear disposal has been well covered by other speakers and it is another very obvious omission to this Bill. It is ironic to introduce a Bill about sea pollution here while Sellafield continues to emit radiation and to pollute our waters. I thought the Minister might have said something about this in his opening speech because the worst form of pollution in the Irish Sea comes from Sellafield in the form of radioactivity. It is a drop in the ocean, to use a pun, for us to condemn what is happening at sea, to implement international protocols and <Col N="554" /> conventions about sewage in the sea, to prevent small or large ships from dropping their garbage at sea when we continue to tolerate the massive radioactive pollution ejected into the Irish Sea at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the attitude of successive Governments to the Sellafield operations which remain the most horrific and indefensible actions by a friendly Government. We tolerate this and there seems to be an attitude among many politicians that while Sellafield is to be condemned there is nothing we can do about it. I do not believe that. Continued pressure on the Brisih Government would reduce or put an end to the pollution consequences of Sellafield. The Irish Sea, as we all know, is possibly the most radioactive sea in the world as a result of Sellafield; this fact also is omitted from the Bill. We need to push far more strongly for a treaty on nuclear waste and to ask why vessels carrying nuclear waste are exempt from the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The answer to that question will be: &ldquo;It is not in the convention so we cannot put it in ourselves&rdquo;, but we could certainly make rules for our own territorial waters. It is strange that while this measure was being processed over the last 18 years it was not thought worthwhile to introduce a Bill to regulate the activity of visiting ships in our own territorial waters. While implementing the provisions of the MARPOL treaty we could have introduced a Bill of our own to regulate the behaviour of foreign ships in our territorial waters.</P>
    <P>It is not reasonable that vessels carrying nuclear waste should be exempt from inspection or from survey by our naval forces, small as they are. It does not make sense that warships should also be exempt because they, along with vessels carrying nuclear waste, are potentially the most environmentally dangerous.</P>
    <P>Like many other speakers, I have reservations about the possibilities of enforcing this Bill. I am not sure how many naval patrol vessels we have at the moment but in proportion to the number of ships that travel through our waters the <Col N="555" /> number is minute. Perhaps the Minister could give an indication of how he intends to police this Bill because it is quite specifically about inspectors, surveyors and enforcement. With what will he enforce the Bill? Are we going to depend on our limited naval resources or are we also going to use air patrols to inspect and survey shipping in our waters? It seems that those who wish to break these regulations and who travel our waters unchallenged and uninspected will be able to do so without danger of being brought to book by our policing methods. We do not have the resources to implement this Bill as it stands at the moment.</P>
    <P>While the specific provisions of this Bill are very welcome, it is unfortunately so limited that it does not tackle the real problems of pollution at sea. The Bill sets out to achieve the minimum; it leaves out warships presumably because of pressure from our more powerful neighbours, and it leaves out nuclear waste and radioactivity also, presumably for the same reason. It exempts sea pollution which originates on land which is, or course, where nearly all sea pollution comes from. I am afraid that at this stage this Bill is almost irrelevant to the current situation because we are now in 1991 and this process started in 1973.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. Ireland has done very little over the years to make any inroads into the reduction of maritime pollution. I agree with Senator Ross that this legislation, as in so many other instances of environmental legislation or action by our Government, has been forced on us by outside bodies. I have been heartened by the extent to which our membership of the European Community has forced us to take the environment more seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might say to Senator Ross who has been on a local authority for only some months now, that if he had spent the past ten years on a local authority rather than in the Seanad he might have achieved a great deal more. He might also have learned something which I have learned <Col N="556" /> in 17 years on a local authority. Local authorities and people generally are way ahead of the Government, Ministers and civil servants when it comes to pollution problems whether it be pollution of our rivers or seas or as Senator Ross mentioned, from sewage. Perhaps Senator Ó Foighil will agree with this view.</P>
    <P>What is important is not to put pressure on the Government &mdash; which is what ultimately happens &mdash; but to try to stimulate people into realising the important role that they, individually, can play in the protection of our environment. Instead of shrugging their shoulders and asking what they can do because the Government do not care about the environment, people can become aware of their own potential. Sadly it is only when the Government and the political parties see there are votes in the environment issue that they will take action. We have seen a classic example to that with the election of one TD from the Green Party. Environmentalists were heartened by this success, and brought moral pressure to bear on the Government to do something about the environment.</P>
    <P>Unlike Senator Ross, I do not wish to chastise the Minister, the Department or anybody else for doing this. At least they are doing something, although it is not enough. I do not mind how much credit the Minister takes for it. I believe that if the Minister feels he is getting the credit, it will stimulate him to do more. I am very happy to commend the Minister, the Department and officials for what they have done.</P>
    <P>The reason it has taken 17 or 18 years for this country to ratify the MARPOL Treaty is that the Department of the Marine, like so many other Departments are involving themselves in totally unnecessary matters. The tragedy of this country is that we cannot decentralise and give local authorities and other groups more responsibility. Departments busy themselves with every parish pump activity. They very efficiently and competently scrutinise every detail that has already been prepared by the local authority, regarding water schemes for <Col N="557" /> example. The Department have to oversee everything.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of a local authority for 17 years and I am sure other members of local authorities will agree that if we were given some responsibility we might behave responsibly. Members of local authorities are no different from anybody else. How many members of Government and Ministers &mdash; started out as members of local authorities? &mdash; I must do a survey on the question. I do not know whether the Minister, in his illustrious career, was a member of a local authority, but most Ministers were. Why do they, as soon as they become Ministers and have influence, automatically assume that local authorities are incapable of doing anything efficiently or responsibly?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I am straying from the point but I am simply asking why it has taken the Department 17 years to ratify this MARPOL Treaty. Sometimes, in the Seanad, we get bogged down with details and we do not look at the basic problems. I believe that one of the reasons for the delay is the situation I have outlined. I beg the Minister to consider those points and to offload the burden of work. If he were to ask a civil servant in his Department, if he has enough or too much work, any civil servant would say he was overloaded with work. My sympathies are with the officials. I wish them to be in a position where they could have a more effective, constructive, worthwhile and fulfilling job. I assure the Minister that the local authorities are very capable of looking after these issues if they are given the opportunity. Of course, having been treated like children for so long, they will not grow up overnight; it will take a few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Ireland have nothing to be proud of in our attitude to sea pollution. We have breached the EC Environmental <Col N="558" /> Directives on bathing water quality regularly. I do not think our record in that area is anything to be proud of. Ireland as an island, with such a heavy emphasis on tourism, must stress the importance of our coasts. Many people are attracted to this country because it is an island country. The heavy concentration of tourist activity from which we derive our tourist revenue is along our coasts.</P>
    <P>I have the privilege of owning a house on the west coast, where I go on holiday as often as I can. We have a very beautiful beach near our cottage. I am constantly amazed at the amount and variety of the debris that comes ashore. Every time we go down for more than a night or two we gather up a band of people with bags and sweep across the beach. It is not a very large beach, we could not do it otherwise. I believe that if it were cleaned once a week one would probably be able to gather up all this debris. Most of the debris is plastic with an occasional glass bottle. I agree with the comments of the previous speaker with regard to the control of plastics. We should be doing more to alert people to the dangers to our environment from plastics. We could do a great deal of recycling.</P>
    <P>We have been fortunate on the west coast in Roundstone, not to have had serious oil pollution. We have all seen on our television screens the devastating effects of oil spillages on birds. We have also seen seals dying and dead seals being washed up on beaches. These scenes are very alarming and distressing but because of mass communication, people have access to this information. It has helped the educational aspect which is extremely important. We must get across the message that the earth's resources are limited. We cannot continue the crazy attitudes to consumption we have in the western world and the attitude that the environment is there to be used and abused as we think fit.</P>
    <P>The general attitude still prevalent in this country that environmentalists impede progress is most damaging and must be discouraged. We must try to get every sector of society, such as fishermen, boating people and people in industry to <Col N="559" /> understand their role and what they have to gain. They do not have to be very altruistic to understand the damage it can do to them if the environment is ruined.</P>
    <P>Dumping at sea shows an extraordinarily primitive attitude. Somebody mentioned to me not so long ago there was a time when there were notices on buses saying a person may be fined for spitting on the buses. I have never seen anybody spitting on a bus. The attitude has changed. It is the same with regard to dumping at sea. I am sure that in 50 years time people will look back in wonder at the practice of using the seas to dump all this squalor, and using them to clean out oil tanks. The more we highlight this matter the more we can bring it home to people that throwing garbage into the sea is something which should not be done.</P>
    <P>In certain parts of the country people go out into bogs and dump their garbage. Perhaps they will not pay charges to the local authority. That is an attitude which everybody would now deplore. Attitudes to the way we use the seas must also change. We need to see the economic advantages in having clean seas. Fishing and the sale of shellfish are an important part of our economy as is tourism.</P>
    <P>I hope we will soon consider the prospect of wave power. Some tentative steps have been taken in this area but I imagine that should they be successful it would be very important that there should not be a great deal of plastics and garbage in the tide because it would interfere with the project.</P>
    <P>The recreational aspects of our waterways is important. A survey was done by An Foras Forbartha a few years ago which found that 35 per cent of people wanted to go to the coast for a holiday or a weekend. Bathing, fishing, sailing, wind surfing, scuba diving are very important and Bord Fáilte tell us we must try to develop such activity holidays as we do not have enough sunshine to allow people just to sun bathe.</P>
    <P>The aesthetic value of the seas is very important. Anyone who has been a member of the Dublin local authority <Col N="560" /> has a strong interest in and concern for Dublin Bay. My local authority takes a great deal of care over it. We are fortunate in Dublin that we have never had a major oil spill. A small oil spill would be disastrous because of the extent of the sand flats and the beaches. We are very vulnerable. The possibilities for recreation such as swimming at the Bull Island, and at Dollymount are seriously reduced, as they are in other parts of the bay, by the pollution, litter and plastics. It does not all come from the sea. Sadly, some of it comes from people who use the beach.</P>
    <P>I share the concern of other Senators with regard to the enforcement of this Bill. I hope it will be taken seriously. I would ask the Minister to give us some assurances as to how it will be policed. I would like to know what the role of the local authorities will be and whether they will be given the resources they require. This Bill is not going to be easy to enforce. When one sees other Bills which are relatively easy to enforce, and where the enforcement has been disastrous, it does not inspire one with a great deal of hope.</P>
    <P>I regret that the question of nuclear waste and radiation from Sellafield is not dealt with in the Bill. Dublin Corporation have taken a very active part in endeavouring to bring pressure on the authorities but we have not had the support we would have liked from the Government. The people who are nearest the problem are the most concerned about it. That is why I urge the Minister to involve people on the ground. It is not possible for the Government to do everything and perhaps they could devolve some of the duties to people and groups who would be competent and well able to cope with them.</P>
    <P>I hope the local authorities will be given the resources they need to implement this Bill. They will have a role to play in the provision of harbour facilities outlined in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> I would like to express my thanks <Col N="561" /> to the Senators for their contributions and for the welcome they expressed for the Bill. I wish to record my appreciation also of the concern of Senators for the protection of the marine environment as evidenced by their detailed and constructive contributions to this debate.</P>
      <P>Sustainable development, if not survival itself, depends on our making significant advances in our management of the environment. The marine environment, which is two-thirds of the earth's surface, cannot continue to absorb pollution in the quantities up to now. Sea pollution can only be tackled by concerted international action on many fronts, including the elimination of dumping of wastes at sea and from land-based sources, which has been outlined by many Senators. Before answering the many detailed points made by Senators, I would like to refer to some other initiatives, national and international, in the marine environment sphere, to outline the context in which this Bill fits.</P>
      <P>Following on the report of the Review Group on Air-Sea Rescue Services, the Doherty report, Slánú, the Irish Marine Emergency Service was established within my Department in May of this year. The service is responsible for the operational aspects of all types of marine emergency, including sea and coastal pollution, shipwreck and search and rescue. A director has been appointed and a chief-of-operations will be appointed shortly. The integration of the coastal radio stations at Valentia and Malin Head, the marine rescue co-ordination centre at Shannon, the cliff and coastal rescue service and marine radio engineers into the service is proceeding. A Marine Emergency Advisory Group composed of high ranking officials of the main land based and maritime emergency services, has also beem established. This group will assemble as a task force during a major marine emergency and will advise me and Slánú on the most appropriate response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Pollution Operations Group of my Department which has to date successfully handled the on-scene direction and control of the more recent major <Col N="562" /> marine incidents off our coasts has, more aptly I think, been renamed the Marine Pollution Response Team and has been brought under the direction of Slánú. My colleague, Minister for the Marine and several Senators have complimented the group on their handling of various incidents and for their unflinching dedication over long hours for prolonged periods in containing oil spillages, and in preventing or minimising damage to our growing aquaculture and our flourishing sea fishing industries.</P>
    <P>Negotiations between the UK Department of Transport and my Department on the formalisation of a bilateral agreement on co-operation and assistance in dealing with pollution incidents and maritime casualties in the Irish Sea are now at an advanced stage. High on my priority list is accession to the International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Co-operation and Response adopted by the International Maritime Organisation last year. The purpose of this treaty is to increase the capacity of the countries to deal with major pollution incidents through the sharing of information, expertise and equipment.</P>
    <P>The disposal of waste by dumping at sea is regulated by way of licensing under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981. This Act gives effect to two important conventions, namely, the Oslo Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Ships and Aircrafts and the London Dumping Convention. The dumping of industrial wastes at sea will be prohibited from 31 December 1995 while the dumping of sewage sludge at sea will be prohibited from 31 December 1998. The only other substance of any significance being dumped at sea by Ireland is dredge spoil from harbour development and maintenance operations. Surveys of approved dump sites for dredge spoil have shown the spoil as causing no harm to the marine environment.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Senator raised that matter. Nevertheless, in accordance with our obligations under <Col N="563" /> the Oslo Convention, we must now undertake more detailed analysis and monitoring of the sediments being dumped. That matter was raised by many Senators and I am glad to say that we are now looking into this area. This is important that we do so.</P>
      <P>My Department are drafting a Bill to give effect to the International Convention on Salvage, 1989. Ireland signed this treaty, subject to ratification, in June 1990. The convention is a major innovation in international law. It provides for the skill and efforts of salvors, in preventing or minimising damage to the environment, to be stated explicitly as one of the criteria to be taken into account in fixing salvage awards.</P>
      <P>It moves away from the no cure, no pay principle by providing for a refund of salvor's expenses on salvage operations in respect of a vessel which threatened damage to the environment even if the operations are unsuccessful in the sense of salving the vessel or its cargo. It provides a special compensation regime under which a salvor may obtain up to twice his expenses if he has, in fact, prevented or minimised damage to the environment, even if he was unsuccessful in salving property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, when enacted, will also strengthen the law on removal of wrecks, which constitute a blight on the marine environment or are hazards. The general improvement of the aquatic environment particularly of the enclosed and semi-enclosed seas, e.g. the North Sea or the Irish Sea, is one of the priorities of the EC's Programme of Action on the Environment, 1987-92. Ireland is actively participating in negotiations on the granting of financial support to projects directly related to protection of the environment in certain coastal areas and coastal waters and to the administrative and technical flanking measures essential to their implementation. Projects relating to coastal erosion, pollution from ships, reduction of nutrient inputs are currently being earmarked for funding. In 1990 and 1991 the Fisheries Research Centre attached to my Department received <Col N="564" /> financial support for a project entitled &ldquo;Establishment of a database for trend monitoring of nutrients in the Irish Sea&rdquo;. That project has proceeded very satisfactorily and will be completed before the end of this month. The last few years have seen quite a number of initiatives being taken in the area of control and prevention of marine and coastal pollution.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with some of the specific points raised by Senators. Senator Upton criticised the restrictive nature of this Bill. The Bill should not be seen in isolation. It deals with the deliberate or accidental release of oil and other harmful substances from ships, by enabling the Minister for the Marine to give effect to the MARPOL Convention and to the Intervention Convention. Other conventions deal with dumping at sea. In particular, the London Dumping Convention deals with the dumping at sea of radioactive wastes or other radioactive matter.</P>
    <P>Many Senators criticised the exemption of warships or any state-owned ship used for purposes other than commercial purposes. This exemption is part of the MARPOL and Intervention Conventions. Not only that, it is a generally accepted principle of international law that states are immune from proceedings in foreign jurisdictions and state-owned ships are equally immune. Under Article 29.3 of the Constitution, Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in its relations with other states.</P>
    <P>If we were to extend the provisions of this Bill to foreign warships and state-owned ships, we would be contravening a generally recognised principle of international law. Foreign countries would most likely refuse to submit to the jurisdiction of our courts. Even if they did, our courts might dismiss such action as contrary to the aforementioned Article 29.3 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I should point out, however, that each party to the MARPOL Convention shall ensure by the adoption of appropriate measures not impairing the operations <Col N="565" /> or operational capabilities of such state-owend ships owned or operated by it, that such ships act in a manner consistent, so far as is reasonable and practicable, with the MARPOL Convention.</P>
    <P>Senators Ó Foighil, Jackman and Costello questioned the expertise of the Garda Síochána to act as inspectors under this Bill. I should point out that gardaí and Naval officers may not be empowered to carry out duties in respect of survey, inspection or tests of ships, equipment and fittings under section 17. It is considered appropriate to empower gardaí and Naval officers to act where no more qualified inspector is available, for example, to board a ship, inspect documents and take statements. Otherwise evidence of an offence may not be obtained before a ship leaves the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan raised the issue of jurisdiction with particular reference to Rockall. The Bill before the House applies in the State including the territorial seas &mdash; out to 12 nautical miles. In addition, sections 26 and 27 empower the Minister to take measures outside the territorial waters of the State following a maritime casualty if there is grave and imminent danger of major harmful consequences through pollution to the coastline or to related interests.</P>
    <P>The issue of Rockall falls to be considered in the context of the International Convention on the Law of the Sea, which is not dealt with in this Bill. Nothing in this Bill in any way limits or diminishes our claims in that context.</P>
    <P>Senators Jackman and O'Donovan referred to the costs of intervening in shipping casualties to prevent or minimize pollution damage or to clean up afterwards. It is an internationally accepted principle that the polluter pays. In the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> incident, court proceedings are in train for the recovery of costs. For obvious reasons I cannot comment further. In the case of the <i>Tribulus</i> all costs incurred were recouped within one month. The costs of the <i>Captaine Pleven II</i> have not yet been fully compiled but are expected to be fully recouped. The use of my Department's <Col N="566" /> helicopter in the <i>Atlantis Sky</i> incident will be paid for.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman questioned the availability of expertise in ship construction to my Department. There are 11 marine surveyors in my Department from a variety of disciplines, including naval architects, marine engineers and master mariners. It is hoped to recruit more to deal with the additional work that will arise from the enforcement of regulations under this Act and safety regulations. I am satisfied that the marine surveyors are sufficiently qualified and experienced to deal with the tasks arising from this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy and others emphasised the polluter pays principle. This principle is one of the corner-stones of the legislation. Section 12 (3) provides for fees for the use of waste reception facilities at ports and section 42 provides for offenders to pay the costs incurred by public authorities in the investigation, detection and prosecution of the offence.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle asked about the Civil Liability Convention, 1984. That convention has not come into force because sufficient countries have not ratified it. It is unlikely to come into force in the foreseeable future. We are in the process of ratifying the 1969 convention and the 1971 convention.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The regulations under the MARPOL Treaty Annex V, are subject to review from time to time by the International Maritime Organisation. It is easier to give effect to amendments agreed by way of secondary rather than primary legislation. However, I am sure the Senator will have the opportunity to see the terms of the regulations relating to plastics as they will be laid before the House in due course.</P>
      <P>The question of pollution by sewage was raised by the same Senator. This is a matter for the Department of the Environment. The Government are committed to halting all discharges of raw sewage by the year 2000. The Department of the Environment deal with sea pollution from land and land-based sources. Dumping of sewage sludge at sea is regulated by the Dumping At Sea Act, 1981. Disposal of sewage sludge at sea is due to cease by 1998.</P>
      <P>Vessels carrying nuclear wastes are not exempt. Only State owned non-commercial ships are exempt. Senator Ross raised the question of policing. Policing will be carried out on land, sea and air using port State control, fishery patrol vessels and maritime patrol aircraft.</P>
      <P>Senator Hederman asked why introduction of this legislation has taken so long. As I have already stated, priority was given to implementing the provisions of the Safety of Life at Sea Convention, 1974. Drafting of the Bill proved far more complex then we had originally anticipated. It is important when a Bill comes before a House that everything is in order and that no mistakes are made.</P>
      <P>The Senator also referred to greater powers for local authorities. That does not arise under this Bill. The Local Government Reform Act, 1991, envisages greater devolution of responsibility to local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), line 12, after &ldquo;a&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;suitably qualified&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is to highlight the critical importance of the inspector in this legislation. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that we prevent pollution at sea but unless we have a very strong and qualified inspectorate all the good intentions in the Bill are at nought. Unless we can be sure that the person in whom the powers to inspect shipping are vested is <Col N="569" /> capable of fulfilling that duty in an efficient and expert fashion then we might as well throw our hat at it.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to try to tighten up not so much the powers but the qualifications of the inspectorate. There are four groups from which inspectors can be drawn: the surveyor of ships, a person appointed by warrant under section 20 which would be a special appointment by the Minister, an officer holding a rank in the Defence Forces and a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The person most likely to be available is a member of the Garda Síochána. The powers of inspection would largely devolve to that individual simply because gardaí are to be found in every corner of the country. The Minister said he does not envisage that a member of the Garda Síochána would carry out a survey under section 3 but rather would board ships and look at documents and statements before ships leave port or when they come into port. That may be the intention but in practice I fear it will be the Garda who will deal with the vast majority of cases and it is very important to ensure that they are suitably qualified. In other words, specific training should be given so that members of the Garda Síochána know what they are loooking for.</P>
    <P>A member of the Garda Síochána is trained in Templemore for two years and the whole direction of his or her duties is in relation to dealing with criminal law and with people on the street, not with ships at sea. I do not know if the Minister has any intention of consulting with his colleague in the Department of Justice to include an element of training that would deal with inspection of ships at sea or in ports.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to see how any member of the Garda Síochána can usefully inspect documents on board a ship. How will they know what is contained in the documents? There is very specific language used in cargo documents. How will a member of the Garda Síochána determine for example, if a ship is carrying a cargo of nuclear waste? What expertise will they have to determine <Col N="570" /> whether that noxious substance is in the hold of a ship?</P>
    <P>I am dissatisfied with the simple description given of what is required by a member of the Garda Síochána, particularly in view of the proximity of Sellafield and the lack of legal restrictions on shipping in relation to nuclear waste and nuclear reprocessing fuel. I would be very much concerned that we have expert people involved in the inspection. We must strengthen the powers and qualifications of the inspectors. The Minister is performing no useful function when he confers powers of inspection on a member of the Garda Síochána. They might just as well be conferred on a member of the public as there would be as much likelihood of their being able to fulfil properly the functions and duties of inspectors.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom foclaíocht na forála a athrú go &ldquo;holding suitable marine qualifications&rdquo;. Tá sé fíorthábhachtach go mbeadh pé duine a bheadh ag plé leis an mBille seo cáilithe le freastal ar chuile ghné den Bhille. Dúirt an tAire go raibh ard-teicneolaíocht ag baint leis an mBille agus gurb é sin ceann de na fáthanna go raibh moill air; is é sin go raibh orthu a chinntiú go raibh an fhoclaíocht i gceart agus go mbeadh chuile shórt a bheadh ráite ansin in ann seasamh in aon chúirt dlí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Feictear domsa go bhfuil an sainmhíniú ar chumhacht an chigire an lag i gcuid (d) den bhfo-alt sin &mdash; is é sin go mbeadh an surveyor cáilithe go maith, go dtuigfeadh sé cúrsaí suirbhéireachta bád agus go mbeadh sé in ann dul ar bord báid am ar bith agus na rudaí éagsúla atá le déanamh ag suirbhéir a dhéanamh. Thuigfinn go mbeadh fear a bheadh ceapaithe ag an Aire faoi alt 20 den Bhille seo ceapaithe go speisialta leis seo a dheanamh, agus go dtuigfeadh sé céard a bheadh ar bun aige, chomh maith leis an bhfear as an Arm. Nuair a thagann tú go dtí fo-alt (d) ansin níl ráite ann ach ball de na Garda Síochána. Tá fhios againn go léir céard le haghaidh Garda Síochána. Go bunúsach sé an dualgas atá aige ná an tsíocháin a choinneáil ar an dtalamh, ar an áit a <Col N="571" /> bhfuil sé ag obair, bíodh sé i mBaile Átha Cliath, amuigh faoin dtuath, nó fiú amháin i gcalafort beag thiar i gConamara nó ó thuaidh nó ó dheas. Tá sé oilte go speisialta leis an tsíocháin agus an dlí a choinneáil ar an dtalamh. Ach níor casadh riamh ormsa fós aon gharda síochána a bheadh in ann dul ar bord loinge agus na dualgais mhóra atá air a chomhlíonadh.</P>
    <P>Bíodh fhios againn go bhfuil dualgais an-mhór ann &mdash; is é sin go mbeadh cead aige long a ghabháil &mdash;&ldquo;to detain&rdquo;, mar a deirtear sa Bhille. Ní amháin go mbeadh cead aige é a ghabháil, ach go mbeadh air dul ar bord agus mar atá ráite sa reachtaíocht, go mbeadh na dualgais nó na cumhachtaí móra atá ag cigire aige. Dúirt an tAire ar ball nach mbeadh air na rudaí seo a dhéanamh. Cén fáth, mar sin, go bhfuil sé mar chuid den Bhille? Tá sé ina chigire nó níl sé in a chigire. Tá Garda Síochána freagrach, de réir an ailt seo, mar chigire. Muna bhfuil le déanamh aige ach dul ar bord agus a chinntiú go bhfuil an tsíocháin nó an dlí á choinneáil agus go mbeadh tacaíocht le fáil ag fear éigin a bheadh ag dul ar bord mar chigire, ghlacfainn leis sin, agus thuigfinn é sin. Ach sa Bhille seo d'fhéadfadh cigire a bheith ina gharda nó d'fhéadfadh garda síochána a bheith ina chigire. Bheadh an stádas agus an chumhacht chéanna ag an bhfear sin is a bheadh ag surveyor a bheadh ag dul ar bord nó ag fear a bheadh ceapaithe go speisialta ag an Aire faoi alt 20 le dul ar bord.</P>
    <P>Abair, mar shampla, nach mbeadh surveyor le fáil ar chósta Chonamara nó ar chósta an deiscirt nó áit ar bith agus nach mbeadh an tAire in ann fear a cheapadh mar chigire ar an bpointe boise. De réir an Bhille seo is cigire é an garda síochána cois chuain sa chás sin. Agus más cigire é tá cead ag aon gharda sin feidhmiú mar chigire faoin mBille seo, agus na dualgais mhóra throma aige mar atá léirithe in alt 21. Ní thuigim é sin nó níl mé in ann teacht ar réiteach go bhfuil gá leis sin nó go bhféadfadh an chumhacht sin a bheith aige faoin Bhille. Tá cead aige dul ar bord aon loing nó aon bháid a bhaineann leis an stát seo agus cigireacht iomlán a <Col N="572" /> dhéanamh ar an mbád sin faoi chuile shórt atá ar bord &mdash; ó thaobh innealra dhe, ó thaobh an chaoi a bhfuil sé feistithe amach, agus mar sin de. Bheadh cead aige doiciméid a scrúdú agus iarraidh ar chuile dhuine a bheadh i gceannas an bháid sin na doiciméid chuí a chur ar fáil dó.</P>
    <P>Cén bealach a d'fhéadfadh garda síochána doiciméid a bhainfeadh le riaradh loing mhóir nó báid bhig a scrúdú? Ní leor a rá nach mbeadh air seo a dhéanamh. Tá sé mar chuid den Bhille gurb é an chiall atá le cigire ná ball den gharda síochána. Tá an chumhacht seo á tabhairt againn dó.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh, tá cumhacht amháin a bheadh sé in ann a dhéanamh go maith. Is é sin, mar atá ráite i bhfo-alt (c), go dtabharfadh an fear ar bord a ainm agus a sheoladh dó. Sin an chéad cheist a chuireann aon gharda síochána ar fhear nó ar bhean ar bith nuair a stopann sé iad ar an mbóthar nó nuair a bhíonn rud éigin á scrúdú aige &mdash;&ldquo;cén t-ainm atá ort agus cén seoladh atá agat?&rdquo; Agus scríobhtar síos ins an leabhar é. Glacaim leis go mbeadh sé cáilithe go maith chun sin a dhéanamh, ach ní ghlacaim leis go mbeadh sé in ann doiciméid a bhaineann le long mhór nó le long bheag nó bád de chineál ar bith a scrúdú faoin Bhille seo. Deirtear sa Bhille go mbeadh cead aige an long a ghabháil, ach ní thuiginn conas a bheadh an mion-eolas aige nó an mionstaidéar déanta aige chun é sin a chur i gcrích i gceart de réir an Bhille. Más Bille é seo go bhfuil feidhm le bheith air ní mór go bhféadfaimís a rá go huile is go hiomlán gur féidir an tAcht a níomhú.</P>
    <P>Tá an dá fhocal móra Béarla, &ldquo;shall&rdquo; agus &ldquo;may&rdquo;, luaite go forleathan sa Bhille seo. Tá an-deacracht agamsa leis sin agus baineann sé le go leor Billí a théann tríd an Dáil agus an Seanad, ach beimid á phlé sin ar ball. Mar gheall ar an sainmhíniú ar &ldquo;chigire&rdquo;, ní féidir liom glacadh leis an bhfo-alt, agus tá mé ag iarraigh míniú i bhfad níos iomláine a fháil ón Aire.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom go n-inseodh an tAire dom cad iad an dualgais a bheadh ar gharda síochána sa chás seo. Má tá na dualgais seo le bheith aige is beag é na <Col N="573" /> focail &ldquo;holding suitable marine qualifications&rdquo; a chur isteach. Tá mé cinnte go bhféadfadh sin a bheith mar chuid den chlár nuair a bhíonn gardaí á dtraenáil sa depot i dTeampall Mór nó áit ar bith eile. Níl aon fáth nach dtabharfaí traenáil speisialta mar chuid dá chúrsa do gach garda sa chaoi go mbeadh sé in ann dul ar bord agus na cáilithe mara aige le cúnamh a thabhairt don stát. Mura ndéanfear é sin níl aon éifeacht a rá sa Bhille go mbeadh cumhacht chigire ag garda síochána nach bhfuil cáilíochtaí de chineál ar bith aige len é a dhéanamh. Táim ag moladh go ndéanfaí an leasú dá réir sin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> I feel the Senators are losing the detail of this section. When a qualified garda is required, a garda with the necessary qualifications may not be available. This could happen if it were necessary to act promptly and a garda was needed to board a ship and question its crew or to detain a ship if there is reasonable cause to believe it caused or may cause pollution. The garda's function specifically is to detain the vessel within the jurisdiction until such time as fully qualified personnel are available. No particular marine qualifications would be necessary for the garda to carry out such a function. As I have already stated, if one had to wait for a suitably qualified garda or a garda with the necessary marine qualifications, a suspect ship could have left the jurisdiction and the whole purpose of this legislation would be defeated.</P>
      <P>Members of the Garda are not empowered to carry out duties in respect of survey, inspection or test of ships under section 17. These functions are reserved for surveyors of ships and inspectors appointed by warrant under section 20 of the Act who would be suitably qualified. For those reasons, and indeed for the practical reasons. I have just outlined &mdash; and it is sheer practicality in this case &mdash; I cannot accept those amendments and I am opposed to them. I can see the point outlined by the Senators but in practice it cannot or will not work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has contradicted what he said originally. He said in his reply on Second Stage that the function of the Garda would not be to carry out surveys but that they would have the function to board ships, to inspect documents and statements when a ship might be in port or before a ship leaves port. Now he is saying that their function would be to detain a ship until such time as a qualified person comes along. Do the Garda Síochána have the function to inspect? Is it a function to detain or a function to inspect? He has given us two different replies. If the garda has a function to inspect, as this legislation certainly defines and we must go on what the legislation says, he is one of the four inspectors. The unfortunate thing, however, is that we do not define the powers of inspection of each inspector and there is nothing in sections 17, 18, 19 or 20, Part III. Therefore, all we can do is take the Minister's word and I must say I regret that his word has differed on the two occasions he has addressed us on the matter. I am not sure what the powers of the Garda are to be and I fear that my worries will be justified, that the member of the Garda Síochána is the handiest person to call to the scene, and what will happen in practice is that calling in the person most readily available will be the norm in terms of inspection rather than the official or the expert envisaged in section 20.</P>
      <P>It would be too easy to pull the wool over the eyes of an ordinary member of the Garda, and that is not casting any aspersion on the Garda Síochána but they would have no qualifications in the highly technical area of ships, documents and ships cargo's. I am not happy that the Minister has given us a satisfactory response and I am particularly concerned that there is no attempt to define what powers the member of the Garda Síochána will have under this legislation. I believe that we will end up with an inspectorate which is simply not qualified to do the job the legislation envisages.</P>

Más mar sin é, ba chóir go mbeadh sin mínithe sa Bhille. Tá ceithre cinéalacha cigirí ansin agus tá an chumacht ag aon cheann den ceathrar acu dul agus na dualgais atá ar chigire a chur i bhfeidhm. Ní rud uafásach teicniúil ag deireadh an lae dul isteach le cigireacht a dhéanamh ar bord loinge má tá cúig nó sé nó seacht rud le déanamh aige. Cén fáth nach mbeadh seo mar chuid de thraenáil aon gharda síochána, is cuma cé hé, i dTeampall Mór? Tá an-díomá ormsa go bhfuil gardaí síochána luaite sa Bhille seo gan aon traenáil acu an chumhacht atá acu sa Bhille a usáid i gceart.</P>
      <P>Dúirt an tAire go mb'fhéidir nach mbeadh garda le fáil ag am ar bith. Tá mé cinnte de rud amháin, go mbeadh garda le fáil i bhfad níos sciobtha na suirbhéir, nó duine a cheapfaí faoi alt 20. Tá siad i ngach paróiste, nó bhí siad go dtí gur cuireadh deireadh leo i go leor áiteanna faoin tuath. Ach tá garda síochána le feiceáil i chuile chuid den tír. Níl mé a rá go gcaithfeadh céim dhlí a bheith ag an ngarda nó céim loingseoireachta ach, mar chuid dá chúrsa traenála go ndéanfaí an staidéar cuí, go mbeadh na rialacha ar eolas aige agus é i mbun a ghairme &mdash; bheadh sé seo úsáideach in áit ar bith sa tír.</P>
      <P>Má tá garda síochána molta, de réir an Bhille seo, mar chigire, ba chóir go mbeadh sé ráite go soiléir cad iad na dualgais a bheadh air. Ní hamhlaidh an scéal agus tá faitíos orm nach mbeidh an Bille seo á fheidhmiú i gceart mar nach bhfuil an sainmhíniú ceart tugtha ar an obair agus ar dhualgais an gharda síochána.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Senators are missing the main point. The main point, in my view, is that it is important that the ship is retained within the jurisdiction. That is the sole purpose and function of the gardaí &mdash; to detain the vessel within the jurisdiction until a suitably qualified person, such as a ship's <Col N="576" /> surveyor or somebody determined by the Minister, is available. One of the functions, among many others, of the garda is to detain the ship. I am not contradicting myself. If Senator Costello reads my Second Stage speech he will see there is no contradiction at all. We must have fully qualified personnel to inspect the ship. The amendment refers to suitably qualified people and the other amendment refers to holding a suitable marine qualification. Again the Senator, in his amendment has not outlined what &ldquo;suitable qualification&rdquo; or &ldquo;suitably qualified&rdquo; refers to. It is not possible for me to accept this amendment for the reasons I have just outlined. I want to repeat that it is important that the vessel is retained within the jurisdiction of the State if we have evidence that the ship has caused pollution or will cause pollution.</P>

A &ldquo;suitably qualified&rdquo; person is a person who has the qualifications to carry out the intentions of this Bill. The purpose of this Bill is to implement the international protocol that was agreed, the MARPOL International Convention. That is what this legislation does and a suitably qualified person is a person who has the necessary qualifications to ensure that he or she can fulfil the proper functions of the inspectorate as outlined in the Bill. I do not think that needs to be defined any further because it is already defined in the context of the Bill.</P>

The important thing is that the ship is detained within the jurisdiction of the State. The Senator must identify &ldquo;suitably qualified&rdquo; personnel. It is not described in the amendment. Senator Ó Foighil said gardaí should be trained to acquire that qualification. That is a specific qualification, it is a special qualification. I do not think our gardaí can be expected to be fully qualified not alone in this specific area but in many other special areas as well. Unless their qualifications are defined, I have no doubt that the courts can and will challenge the qualification held by the gardaí.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 7, subsection (1), lines 30 <Col N="579" /> and 31, after &ldquo;submersibles,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;fish farms, having a recognised ship classification&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Tá deacrachtaí agam maidir le fo-alt (3) anseo, agus an sainmhíniú atá tugtha ar an bhfocal &ldquo;ship&rdquo; anseo. Níl mé a rá go bhfuil mo thaithí chomh mór nó chomh maith leis an taithí atá ag an Seanadóir Fitzgerald, atá os mo chomhair amach anseo, ach tá eolas beag éigin agam ar an bhfarraige. Tá deacrachtaí agam freisin le roinnt mhaith rudaí eile sa reachtaíocht seo mar nach bhfuil sé i nGaeilge, ach is scéal eile é sin agus níl mé ag dul a chur am an tSeanaid amú ag déanamh argóinte faoi sin.</P>
    <P>Deirtear anseo, &ldquo;a ship means a vessel of any type whatsoever operating in the marine environment&rdquo;. Anois, sin an chéad rud. Ciallaíonn sé árthach nó soitheach &mdash; soitheach an focal atá anseo, vessel, agus mar is eol dúinne agus don Seanadóir Fitzgerald, tugtar soitheach freisin ar bhád nó long sa Ghaeilge. Ach tugtar é sin i gcomhthéacs loinge, soitheach ar bith atá ag obair nó ag taisteal ar an bhfarraige. Tar éis na habairte sin, leanann sé ar aghaidh agus tá roinnt ainmeacha ar rudaí éagsúla go bhféadfaí long nó ship a thabhairt orthu in a measc siúd hydrofoil boats. Ghlacfainn leis sin; níl aon deacracht agam leis an bhfocal sin &mdash; tá rangú nó classification aige mar hydrofoil. Níl tada agam in aghaidh aircushioned vehicles ach an oiread, agus glacaim le submersibles mar longa faoin bhfarraige, nó báid faoi thuinn, submarines. Tá chuile shórt mar sin i gceist leis an gcineál sin míniúcháin. Ansin tá tagairt do shoitheach nó craft ar bith a bhíonn ag snámh ar an bhfarraige, ar nós ardán nó floating platforms, mar atá luaite anseo, agus tá mé ag glacadh leis go bhfuil sé ag caint faoi, b'fhéidir, na rigí ola sin atá amuigh ar an bhfarraige. Ciallaíonn sé sin gach rud atá ar an bhfarraige, atá sna longa sin agus atá, mar a déarfá, mar chuid de chomhdhéanamh loinge.</P>
    <P>Is é an fáth go bhfuil deacracht agam ná go bhfuil leasú istigh agam anseo in a bhfuil mé ag tagairt do &ldquo;fish farms having <Col N="580" /> a recognised ship classification&rdquo;. Tá eolas agam ar an gcineál sin obair fharraige; go deimhin, bhí baint agam le comhlacht a raibh ceann de na feirmeacha éisc seo ar an bhfarraige acu agus is trua liom a rá nár éirigh linn ceal dhóthain infheistíocht airgid. Ach, é sin ráite, ba mhaith liom go dtabharfadh an tAire suntas don méid atá á rá agam, mar an tuiscint atá agamsa ar ship nó bád ná soitheach a bhfuil cláraithe nó registered ag an Stát. Ní féidir é a chlárú mura bhfuil rangú nó aicmiú &mdash; classifications &mdash; déanta ar an soitheach sin.</P>
    <P>In alt 10 (3), tagraítear do &ldquo;regulations under this section may relate to ships generally or to any class of ship&rdquo;. Tá an focal &ldquo;rangú&rdquo; tugtha isteach aige, is é sin &ldquo;classification.&rdquo; Arís, deir alt a 14: &ldquo;The Minister may by regulations require the owner or the master of the ship, or ship of a prescribed class,&rdquo; is é sin, é a rangú nó a aicmiú, classification a dhéanamh, ar aon soitheach atá ar an bhfarraige, bíodh sé ina long chogaidh, ina bhád faoi thuinn, ina long lasta, ina long phaisinéirí nó ina long phléisiúir &mdash; tá aicmiú déanta ar gach ceann acu. Tá sé ráite sa Bhille go mbeidh rangú déanta ar an gcineál soithigh a bheidh ar an bhfarraige, agus is ceart go mbeadh sé sin ann.</P>
    <P>In alt a 16, deirtear, &ldquo;sections 14 and 15 shall apply in relation to a ship and the owner of a ship registered in a country. Is é an chiall, atá mise ag baint as sin uilig ná, mura bhfuil rangú déanta air, níl aon éifeacht ag an mBille seo i leith soithigh ar bith ar an bhfarraige, a dtabharfaí long air. Tá an rud ceanna ráite in alt 23 (5):</P>
    <P>The Minister may by regulations provide, in respect of ships generally or ships of any prescribed class,</P>
    <P>Dúirt mé cheana, nuair a tionscnaíodh an Bille seo sa Teach, go n-árdóinn ceist rangú soithigh ar a ndéantar feirmeoireacht éisc. Dúirt mé ansin go raibh mé den tuairim go raibh easpa sa sainmhíniú atá tugtha sa Bhille ar bhád nó ar long. Níl aon tagairt sa sainmhíniú do bhád nó do long ar a mbeadh feirmeoireacht éisc ar bun. Deirtear go minic gur údar truaillithe iad na báid seo ach ní ghlacaim leis seo. Táim sásta go bhfuil rialacha dochta <Col N="581" /> i bhfeidhm ag Roinn na Mara chun truailliú mara a sheachaint í gcás feirmeacha éisc agus go gcoimeádtar súil ghéar orthu.</P>
    <P>Cúpla bliain ó shín chuir muintir Chonamara a gcuid imní in iúil don Roinn maidir le baol ó thubaistí mara mura gcoiméadfaí smacht ceart ar fheirmeacha éisc. Ba mhaith liom a chinntiú anseo go bhfuil an smacht sin i bhfeidhm agus nach bhfuil truailliú ag tarlú dá mbarr.</P>

      <P>Labhair an Seanadóir Hederman ar maidin mar gheall ar thruailliú farraige. Is cuimhin liom í amuigh ar Inis Oírr, sna hOileáin Arainn, agus fad a bhí sí ag breathnú ar áilleacht na háite d'fhiafraigh sí díom cá raibh an fheirm éisc a ba chúis le truailliú an cheantair. Thaispeáin mé di í, amuigh ar an bhfarraige agus is é a dúirt sí ná nárbh fheirm éisc a bhí ann ach bád nó long. Táim go moladh an leasaithe seo mar faoi láthair níl aon éifeacht ag an reachtaíocht seo i leith soithí den chinéal <Col N="582" /> sin, bíodh go ndeireann an Bille, &ldquo;ship means a vessel of any type whatsoever. Ní mór go mbeadh rangú sa Bhille chun gach cineál báid a chuimsiú ann.</P>
      <P>Is bád é an soitheach seo ach níl an Stát ag tabhairt aitheantais dó mar bhád agus mar sin ní thagann se faoi scóp an Bhille. Deirtear sa leabhar seo atá agam: &ldquo;On the basis of analysis and model tests, Veritec, which is the Veritas Offshore Technology and Services Company in Norway, reviewed and discussed the conceptual design of sea-going fish farms. The Norwegian classification society decided that these farms could be operated within the Ship Class Notation of + I A I Bar Experimental.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Bhí an Noruaidh sásta aicmiú nó rangú a dhéanamh ar an gcínéal seo báid agus ainm a thabhairt air. Nuair tugadh an bád sin isteach in uiscí na tíre seo, d'áitigh mé féin agus daoine eile ar Roinn na Mara go dtabharfaí an aicmiú chéanna don bhád sa tír seo agus a bhí aige sa Noruaidh agus sa tSualainn. Dúradh linn nach bhféadfaí long nó bád a thabhairt ar a leithéid de shoitheach.</P>
      <P>Tar éis go bhfuil tagairt arís agus arís eile sa Bhille seo do rangú agus aicmiú báid deir Roinn na Mara nach féidir an fheirm éisc seo a aicmiú mar bhád. Mura féidir, ní fheicim conas is féidir é a chuimsiú faoin mBille seo. Le cruthú do na Comhaltaí gur bád é, léim píosa eile as an leabhar. The boat was assembled in a dry dockyard. Construction work was surveyed on a daily basis by the local DNV office to ensure that the requirements for the class were met. Bhí coinníolacha ann sa Noruaidh chun an bád seo a rangú agus cén fath nach mbeadh? The overall length of this boat is 126.5 metres. Tá sé chomh fada le Paírc an Chrócaigh agus beagnach chomh leathan leis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nílimid ag caint faoi bhad ramhaíochta anseo; is long atá i gceist. The vessel is equipped as a boat with generators, a hull, machinery rooms, well-appointed accommodation including bunks, galleys, mess and lastly, offices. Like a ship it will need to be docked after ten years and every summer the hull will need to be inspected by divers. Is é an pointe atá á <Col N="583" /> dhéanamh agam i leith truailliú farraige ná go bhfuil na mílte líotair ola ar stóráil ar an long sin agus tonnaí éisc bheo. Tá leithris agus gach áis eile air a bheadh ar ghnáth long agus tá baol ann go dtruailleofaí an fharraige maguaird dá mbeadh timpist ar an long.</P>
    <P>Deirtear &ldquo;any vessel of any type whatsoever&rdquo; sa Bhille ach de réir Roinn na Mara ní &ldquo;vessel&rdquo; é seo ar chor ar bith. Ní mór rangú a dhéanamh ar aon rud ar an bhfarraige atá faoi cheannas na Roinne. Tá na focail &ldquo;classification&rdquo; agus &ldquo;registration&rdquo; ráite arís agus arís eile sa Bhille ach ní féidir an long seo a chlárú nó a aicmiú. Locht í seo ar an mBille maidir le sainmhíniú bád.</P>
    <P>Tá rialacha dochta ann i gcás feirmeacha éisc in aice tíre lena chinntiú nach dtruaillíonn siad an talamh nó an fharraige ach sa chás seo ní gnáth fheirm éisc atá anseo ach long le hinnill, ola, agus daoine ina gcónaí air. Long dá leithéid seo a bhí i gcuan na Gaillimhe &mdash; níl sí ann anois, tá sé imithe go dtí an Fhrainc nó an Spáinn &mdash; d'fhéadfadh sí teacht isteach arís. Is mór an chontúirt é go mbeadh a leithéid de bhád nó de long ann agus gan cumhacht ag údáráis faoi théarmaí an Bhille seo. Ní bheadh cead ag cigirí dul ar bord nuair nach bhfuil sé aicmithe.</P>
    <P>Molaim don Aire glacadh leis an leasú mar chúnamh don Bhille iomlán. Dúirt duine i gConamara liom nár chóir dom an cheist a ardú ar eagla go dtarraingeodh sé cigirí anuas ar an áit a chreidfeadh go raibh truailliú ag tarlú cheana féin. Ach dúirt mé leis gur chóir go mbeadh rialacha i bhfeidhm i gcás gach aon bhád agus is chuige sin atáim ag moladh an leasaithe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Ní aontaím leis an leasú seo ná leis an méid atá ráite ag an Seanadóir Ó Foighil. Tá sé sásta go bhfuil gach rud cuí clúdaithe sa Bhille.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not support Senator O Foighil's amendment to insert &ldquo;fish farms, having a recognised ship classification&rdquo; because it would constitute a duplication. The definition of &ldquo;ship&rdquo; clearly states &ldquo;floating craft and fixed or floating platforms <Col N="584" /> and includes fixtures, fittings and equipment.&rdquo; I assume that this would cover fish farms and also all platforms and fixtures in oil and gas fields. I am satisfied there is no need whatsoever for this amendment to include fish farms because they are adequately covered under the term &ldquo;floating platforms.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that fish farms should be covered because they are a source of pollution of various kinds but I share the view of Senator Fitzgerald and I assume that that is the reply the Minister will give. When the Minister defines a ship as a vessel of any type whatsoever operating in the marine environment including hydrofoil boats and so on and floating craft and fixed or floating platforms it seems that the definition, to the ordinary mind, is sufficiently wide to include fish farms. The debate was useful and Senator Ó Foighil has done the House a service by clearly specifying and indicating that people are concerned about the pollution created by fish farms. It would have been no harm to specify &ldquo;fish farm&rdquo; in the Bill because it would have indicated our concern and perhaps for that reason the Minister might graciously be prepared to include the phrase.</P>
      <P>The Governments amendments have been tabled so the question of recommitting the Bill to the Dáil will not create a difficulty and the addition of that phrase might help to indicate to the industry the priority awarded by this House to the question of fish farming. I am satisfied that fish farms could be deemed to be included in the definition given in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ó Foighil on this amendment. If I felt the Minister's definition of &ldquo;ship&rdquo; would embrace fish farm barges as we know them or cage barges I would have no fears at all but, as of now, we do not register or classify these cage barges. Under normal ships classification I understand they will escape the rigours of this Bill when it becomes law and this is the difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> We have not devised a special classification to register fish farming barges. The definition would appear to cover any type of vessel on the seas but if any type of ship means a registered ship or a classified ship we need clarification on this point from the Minister. The only type of craft on our seas that is not, to my knowledge, at this time classified are fish farming platforms and fish farming barges, and until they are classified in the marine classification system they will escape the rigours of this Bill if and when it becomes law. We need clarification from the Minister that the will either include in the classification system fish farm barges or cage barges and platforms which will then come within the meaning of &ldquo;ship&rdquo; as here defined, or that he will specifically include them here, apart from the registered ships generally included under this definition as a ship. I hope I make myself clear.</P>
    <P>We all want to see the rigours of this Bill applied to fish farming barges or cage barges. We would hate to think that fish farms under a technicality, because they are not classified or registered anywhere, would slip out of the net of the Bill. That needs clarification from the Minister.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I share the concern of the Senators. I should like to read the relevant part of the Bill where it says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;ship&rdquo; means a vessel of any type whatsoever operating in the marine environment and includes hydrofoil boats, air-cushion vehicles, submersibles, floating craft and fixed or floating platforms and includes fixtures, fittings and equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The specific specialised structures which the Senators who have expressed their concern have in mind would be comprehended, in any event, in the definition of &ldquo;ship&rdquo; as given in the Bill. I am also advised that if I were to accept the Senator's amendment it would narrow the definition of the ship to exclude all fish farms without a recognised ship classification. The definition of &ldquo;ship&rdquo; in this Bill is wider than in the Merchant <Col N="586" /> Shipping Acts which govern other regulations in shipping.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Foighil also mentioned the general prohibition of pollutants referred to in section 10. This would apply to the structure which the Senator has in mind, even if it is not registered or does not hold ship classification. I am satisfied that the concerns of Senators are fully covered in that section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Pól Ó Foighil</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá cuid den mhíniú sin glactha agam. Céard atá i gceist leis an bhfocal &ldquo;ship&rdquo;? Dár liomsa, ní mór do Roinn na Mara glacadh leis go bhfuil rangú ann do gach &ldquo;ship&rdquo;&mdash; báid iascaigh, báid mhara, long, etc. Níl an bád nó an fheirm éisc a ndearna mé tagairt dó roimhe seo rangaithe agus nuair nach bhfuil, ní thagann sé faoi rialacha na Roinne. D'áitigh mé ar an Roinn &ldquo;long&rdquo; a thabhairt ar an bhfeirm éisc seo agus má thagann sé faoin sainmhiniú atá tugtha sa Bhille seo ar &ldquo;ship&rdquo; cén fáth nach n-aithníonn Roinn na Mara mar long í faoi láthair? Sin í mo dheacracht.</P>
      <P>Luaigh an tAire morán cineálacha báid ach dhiúltaigh Roinn na Mara an bád nó an long seo a aicmiú mar long. Conas mar sin ar féidir é a reimniú faoin mBille seo? Bheimís sásta dá ndearbhódh an Roinn gur long de chineál a ghabhann le feirmeoireacht éisc atá anseo againn agus d'fhéadfaí é a chlárú dá réir sin. Ach níor tharla sín go fóill.</P>

He is by the proposal of his amendment, confining and narrowing the definition of &ldquo;ship&rdquo; to exclude all fish farms without a recognised ship classification. Of course a ship is a ship, I agree with that but the amendment would narrow the definition. I want to have a wider definition and I want to have that definition covered, in this <Col N="587" /> instance, by regulation which would apply under section 10 of this Bill. What I have included in this Bill fully and totally satisfies the Senator's demands in this amendment.</P>

      <P>Tá an tAire ag cur rud i mo leith nach bhfuilim in ann a fhreagairt. Nílim ag iarraidh an sainmhíniú a chúngú ach é a leathnú amach. Chomh maith lena bhfuil sa Bhille, tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire &ldquo;a recognised ship classification&rdquo; a chur isteach freisin. Is trua nach dtuigeann an tAire mo loighic, mar tá sé an-simplí. Ciallaíonn &ldquo;long&rdquo; árthach nó soitheach agus aontóidh an tAire liom go gcaithfidh gach long réimniú a bheith aici, is cuma an bád faoi thoinn, long chogaidh nó long iascaigh atá i gceist. Tá aicmiú déanta ar gach chineál loinge a luaigh an tAire ansin ionas go dtagann siad faoin mBille seo ach dhiúltaigh an tAire an bád a thagair mé dó a aicmiú. Gan aicmiú ó Roinn na Mara, ní féidir an long a réimniú agus gan réimniú níl aon neart ag an mBille seo ina leith. Má deirtear liom nach bhfuil sé sin loighiciúil, tá rud éigin bunúsach mí-cheart leis an mBille. D'fhiafraigh mé den Aire an gcaithfeadh rangú a bheith ag long faoin mBille seo? Má fhreagraíonn sé go gcaithfidh rangú a bheith aici, deirim leis nach bhfuil an Bille seo ceart.</P>

      <P>My concern is to have confirmation from the Minister that this would be a correct interpretation of what is in the Bill: that all fish farming, registered or unregistered, classified, or unclassified, comes strictly within the ambit of the Sea Pollution Bill. If that is so, would the Minister consider putting down an amendment of his own, if he is not prepared to take the amendment in the name of Senator Ó Foighil, to demand the definition of &ldquo;ship&rdquo; to read as follows &ldquo;a vessel of any type whatsoever operating in the marine environment and includes hydrofoil boats, air-cushion vehicles, submersibles, floating craft, fixed or floating platforms and all fish farming and includes fixtures, fittings and equipment.&rdquo; Why not include those <Col N="588" /> words in the section or would the Minister suggest another wording if he is not prepared to accept this.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Senator's concern and that of her colleague is already met in this section. There seems to be confusion with regard to the classification of ships. The ship classification system governs ships capable of navigation only. This Bill governs floating structures not capable of navigation. There is no problem with regard to the Senators' concern. I and my officials in the Department would be as much concerned with regard to this problem as Senators are but it is already covered in the Bill and I do not see any purpose in amending the Bill either by way of accepting an amendment from the Senator or putting down an amendment of my own. It is already covered and I am satisfied it covers all problems that may arise in the future.</P>

      <P>I would like to raise another point on this section; it concerns the definition of an &ldquo;owner&rdquo;. The Minister may recall that I mentioned on Second Stage the major difficulties that arose at the time of processing the cases in the <i>Amoco Cadiz</i> disaster some time ago. Much responsibility was evaded because of legal wrangling over the definition of owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was discovered in relation to the <Col N="589" /><i>Amoco Cadiz</i> at the time that there was a parent company to which the owning company belonged. There was also an operating company, subsidiary to the owning company. This operating company chartered the <i>Amoco Cadiz</i> to another company. There were, therefore, four layers of ownership in one degree or another. The only people who became wealthy in all of this, to my recollection, were the legal people who had a most dreadful job to discover who was actually responsible for the damages caused at the time.</P>
    <P>I would like confirmation from the Minister that this definition of owner will be tight enough to ensure that no one avoids or evades their responsibility through a legal loophole. This has adversely affected much legislation in relation to the sea and shipping and maritime affairs over the years. I do not see any difference in the definition of owner, from, for example, the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill, 1987 which I considered totally inadequate. The International Maritime Organisation has expressed concerns about the evasion or avoiding of responsibility through technical legal loopholes in the defiition of those with ultimate responsibility.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;owner&rdquo;, in relation to a ship, means the person registered as the owner of the ship, the person who owns the ship, and in the case of a ship which is owned by a state (including the State) and is operated by a person who in that state is registered as a ship's operator; &ldquo;owner&rdquo; means the person registered as such operator;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to indicate that I propose to oppose this section vigorously. I understand the Minister suggested that it is not legally possible for us to drop this section because we have no mechanism for bringing warships to court. I dismiss that. I do not believe it to be the case and neither do any of the environmental organisations who have briefed me. In fact, they are all unanimous in saying that the exclusion of warships, contemplated in this section, makes a farce of the entire Bill. On Second Stage I indicated that, from time to time, up to one-fifth of the nuclear arsenal in the United States is floating around in the Irish Sea. We worry about fish farms but they are a comparatively mild form of pollution. The excrement of fish may be noisome, it may be damaging to the environment but it is not half so damaging as the risk of a nuclear accident underwater.</P>
      <P>I have here a briefing document from Earthwatch and this is what they say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his speech introducing the Bill [in the Dáil] attempts to justify section 4 by reference to the MARPOL and Intervention Conventions and the Oil Pollution at Sea Act of 1956. It is true that MARPOL itself explicitly exempts warships (Article 3 (3)), and only half-heartedly addresses this problem by placing an <Col N="591" /> obligation on Contracting Parties to see that their own warships act in a manner consistent with MARPOL, and even then only provided this does not impair the operations or operational capacities of such ships. However, this is simply a glaring deficiency within the MARPOL convention and one which the Government should seek to remedy within the International Maritime Organisation at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>As an independent and still, despite the efforts of Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, a theoretically neutral country we should be using our participation in Conventions like MARPOL to broaden a coalition against nuclear weapons, instead of kowtowing and being a lickspittle to the hawks in the international community and tolerating this invasion of our seas by highly dangerous, lethal craft. I think I am correct in saying Dublin has declared itself a nuclear free zone. Perhaps my distinguished colleague Adlerperson Carmencita Hederman can confirm this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet we have nuclear-powered warships and ships containing nuclear warheads coming right into the centre of the city of Dublin, the greatest population concentration in the entire island. The Minister is not doing anything about it because we are acting as a lickspittle to &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; in the United States. To continue my quotation from the Earthwatch document:</P>
      <P>Furthermore, there is nothing in MARPOL to prevent Contracting Parties applying many of the controls envisaged in the Bill to foreign warships, as an additional measure strengthening their national legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the Minister is, not deliberately I am sure, misleading the House, <Col N="592" /> when he maintains there is a legal contradiction. There is no such contradiction. There is nothing to prevent us as an independent Republic amplifying and strengthening our own legislation. The fact that MARPOL is defective does not mean that we must follow its defects. We should do something positive.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister, what are our priorities. Do we give a higher priority to playing host to American warships containing nuclear bombs than to the protection of our civilian population? It seems to me that by putting section 4 into the Bill we are saying it is more important for us to kowtow to the nuclear powers than to protect our citizens. Exempting warships from the provisions of the entire Bill is completely unimaginative. Perhaps there are specific problems for specific warships. If so, let us have it out in the open. Let the Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Justice or the Department of the Marine, deal with it on a case by case procedure. In that way, if anybody wants warships to be exempted let them come upfront; let the Irish people know what is going on in the seas surrounding this country. Let the United States Government or the British Government make the case that for strategic or tactical reasons they must have an exemption. We should not give them a blank cheque as this Bill does.</P>
    <P>It is the height of irony that a neutral, non-nuclear country goes out of its way to sacrifice the rights of its citizens. I believe this pathetic evasion of responsibility was entered into as a result of international diplomatic pressure. Can the Minister confirm this? Are there external forces operating here?</P>
    <P>We have gone through this in a number of previous Bills. We looked at the question of the American Government's policy of refusing either to confirm or deny that they have a nuclear arsenal on board their ships. We know, as a matter of fact, that nuclear warheads are quite frequently introduced into the waters of this country and right into the heart of the capital city of Dublin but we choose <Col N="593" /> to turn a blind eye to it because we are lickspittling the American Government.</P>
    <P>I firmly oppose this section. I call upon any Members of this House committed to a non-nuclear policy for this country and to neutrality to show where they stand on this issue by voting with me against this dangerous, unnecessary and slavish exemption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite wrong that this exemption should be given. I was not at all impressed by the Minister's statement that it is an accepted principle of international law. It seems to me, as Senator Norris said, that it is up to us to decide what we want to do. Would it not be nice, for a change, for lovely, green Ireland to give a lead in an environmental matter?</P>
      <P>Earlier, a Senator held up the <i>Environmental Action Programme</i> to show how well the Minister, the Government and everybody were doing. We all know it was a nice glossy magazine, designated to impress but why do we not give a lead, when we have the opportunity? I am not at all impressed that other countries are not doing this when I see what other countries have done in the area of environmental pollution. That great country, Germany, has polluted its industrial cities. In its woods trees are dying rapidly because of pollution. The water is polluted; everything there is polluted. Why should we follow the example of such countries? Ireland has a reputation it badly needs to affirm, of being environmentally friendly, but we are slipping back very rapidly. We were once recognised as a &ldquo;green&rdquo; country, but no longer. Pollution is pollution and whether it comes from a warship or from any other kind of ship makes no difference whatsoever. If we take pollution seriously, what would come from warships is far more dangerous than any of the other types mentioned in this Bill. Let us, if necessary, give a lead and not just go along with the accepted principle, in international circles.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Subsection (1) covers Article 3 (3) of the <Col N="594" /> MARPOL and Article 1 (2) of the Intervention Convention, which exempt naval vessels and vessels used by the government of any country for non-commercial purposes. This exemption is a standard feature of international maritime conventions. Indeed, contrary to what Senator Norris said, it is included in the MARPOL Convention which it states that:</P>
      <P>The present Convention shall not apply to any warship, naval auxiliary or other ship owned or operated by a State and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service. However, each Party shall ensure by the adoption of appropriate measures not impairing the operations or operational capabilities of such ships owned or operated by it, that such ships act in a manner consistent, as far as is reasonable and practicable, with the present Convention.</P>
      <P>Article 1 (2) of the Intervention Convention states:</P>
      <P>However, no measures shall be taken under the present Convention against any warship or other ship owned or operated by a State and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a general rule of international law warships and State-owned ships are immune from proceedings in a foreign court. Senators should be aware of this. Foreign naval vessels are entitled under international law to traverse the territorial waters of another state in exercise of the right of innocent passage. Should the Oireachtas seek to apply the provisions of this Bill to foreign warships it would be contrary to the general rules of international law. We are subject to international law like any other country. There is no possibility of a foreign state permitting its warships to submit to the jurisdiction of the Irish courts. Any attempt by the Irish State to enforce the provisions of this Bill against a foreign <Col N="595" /> warship is likely to be resisted, to provoke an international incident and ultimately is likely to be unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>We are not living and cannot live in splendid isolation. Moreover, Article 29.3 of the Constitution states: &ldquo;Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in its relations with other States&rdquo;. Therefore, it is possible that the bringing of proceedings against a foreign warship in the Irish courts may be judged unconstitutional, being contrary to the generally recognised principles of international law.</P>
    <P>I referred to Article 3 (3) of the MARPOL Convention. Irish naval vessels are not bound by the Bill but, having said that, my Department are now taking up with the Department of Defence the question of naval vessels setting a good example and following the objectives of the Convention. I have no doubt that the Naval Services will do so and Senators need have no worries on that score.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides for where the application of any provision of the Bill, when enacted, to a particular class of ship would be unreasonable or impracticable and enables the Minister, by regulation, to exempt such ships if he is satisfied that such an exemption would not result in an increased risk of pollution. An example of where the strict application of the MARPOL regulation might be considered unreasonable or impracticable is the requirement to fit a sewage treatment plant to all ships certified to carry more than ten persons. Nuclear ships carrying nuclear waste are not exempt under this section.</P>

I acknowledge it exempts warships and I said that. I also said that is no reason for us to follow the defective example of MARPOL. I do not accept that it conflicts with international law. If it did this country should be lobbying for a change in international practice.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to explain how it is that New Zealand prohibits the passage of nuclear warships through its territorial waters. I have yet to see an Irish Government attempt anything as courageous as that and I would like to see us doing it. It might not perhaps be so convenient for our masters in other countries who are dictating the policy of this island in that matter. It might be a little inconvenient or uncomfortable to have a little David standing up to the Goliaths of this globe but it would be important that we do that.</P>
      <P>I quote further from Earthwatch:</P>
      <P>This clause &mdash; Article 3 (3) of MARPOL &mdash; was clearly inserted at the behest of the more hawkish military powers and has no place in Irish legislation. Nor is it required to be there for us to comply with MARPOL.</P>
      <P>This is the official position of Earthwatch. I would like the Minister to reconsider what he is saying in the light of the risks to which the Irish people could easily be exposed as a result of a melt down in a nuclear reactor, for example, in a submarine.</P>

      <P>That is incorrect. The Minister spoke about innocent passage. He is the biggest innocent in this House if he is unaware of the proven fact that ships carrying nuclear warheads are routinely in the port of Dublin. The Minister may not live in Dublin. I do not know where he lives but I assume he is on the same planet as I am on. I am a citizen of Dublin and I greatly resent, as do the vast majority of the citizens of Dublin, the risk which I am exposed by the Government's policy. It is not sufficient for us to accept the American policy of neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear warheads on these vessels. It is a proven fact that warships carrying these instruments of mass destruction do arrive here.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister give a definition of &ldquo;innocent passage&rdquo;. Is a ship carrying a primed nuclear warhead at the disposal of the executive of another State innocent passage? How innocent is that passage? If it is potentially lethal and could cause considerable destruction, long term pollution in the Irish Sea or in a port, how innocent does the Minister imagine that passage to be? What does the term &ldquo;innocent passage&rdquo; mean? I can tell you what it means to the ordinary citizen and I do no think it means what the Minister is calmly trying to lull the House into assuming that it means. Is &ldquo;innocent passage&rdquo; just the travelliing through our waters of any vessel belonging to one of our allies?</P>

Suppose the captain of a warship decided to discharge a considerable cargo of oil or chemicals into the sea, what would the Minister and his Government do about it? Would they just say: &ldquo;Thank you very much, that was very innocent of you. We are Irish people and we will not live in splendid isolation; we are delighted to be polluted by you, please call back and do the same next week.&rdquo; What would the Government do about it? What powers have they got? What would be their attitude?</P>

It is aspirational and does not have any impact on the situation. We should address that in this Bill. It is pathetic.</P>
      <P>I said on Second Stage and I repeat that the reason this Bill is so empty is given away in the explanatory memorandum. It says the main purpose of the Bill is (i) to ratify the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973; (ii) to accede to the Protocol of 1978 ... (iii) to accede to the Protocol relating to Intervention ... These are the three reasons. That is a fascinating insight into the Government's psychology. The only reason we have a Bill to control pollution in the sea is because 16 years after the event we are catching up with the minimum of international legislation. It is not acceptable for the Minister to say we have to do it because it is in MARPOL. I have stated that I believe MARPOL is defective and I am supported in this view by a number of environmental organisations. MARPOL is weak in this respect but that does not mean we have to be similarly weak.</P>

I understand that it may not always be practicable for us to intercept or arrest a warship but we should seek with the fullest vigour to ensure that they do not pollute our seas. Warships are among the principal traffic in our seas. The Minister is exempting a considerable class of ship. That is dangerous.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I am opposed to these amendments. I think the effect would be to deprive the Minister of his discretionary role in deciding the content of the regulations to be made by him under the Bill when enacted. There are a number of sections which are enabling sections which enable the Minister to make the necessary regulations. The use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo; would not, as may be perceived, impose a time limit on the introduction of regulations. The content of the regulations to be made by the Minister will be determined by him on the basis of what is necessary in the Irish context to ensure full compliance with an enforcement of the MARPOL convention. Amendment No. 5 would have the effect of requiring the Minister to prescribe exemptions to regulations prohibiting the discharge of oil or other substances even if no exemptions were justified.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I am opposed to this amendment. The Senator's amendment, if accepted, would subvert the entire Bill. The amendment would enable harbour authorities to opt out of their responsibilities to provide reception facilities for ships' effluent. Without reception facilities ships would discharge their effluent into the sea. The Bill enables harbour authorities to make reasonable charges and impose reasonable conditions in respect of the use of facilities. Properly managed, there is no reason why such facilities should not be self-financing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I pursue this with the Minister? For many years, since local <Col N="607" /> authorities have no longer been financially autonomous, they have been depending on block grants from central Governments of all political hues. The grants have been inadequate over the years and are decreasing in real terms. If we are going to heap an extra financial responsibility on to our maritime local authorities without providing the financial resources for them to comply with it we are almost asking the impossible. As we speak, local authorities are begging the Government to indicate what the block grant will be for next year alone. They do not even know what moneys they will get for what are already their areas of responsibility. This Bill, if enacted, will increase the financial burden and the financial requirements of these local authorities if they comply with it as they must.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate if the resources necessary for the initial capital works that will be necessary to provide, for example, the disposal facilities, inspection facilities and so on will be recoupable from his Department. I accept the point that they can charge for services but it will take 20, 30 or 40 years worth of charges to repay the capital outlay that will be necessary initially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For local authorities there is a serious imposition if the Minister does not provide the financial resources and, perhaps, also staff resources. There will be the necessity to retrain staff members if they have to be appointed harbour masters in the local authority harbours which this Bill requires. I come from a maritime county and we have five or six local authority harbours in that county. We also have the only Iarnród Éireann harbour that is referred to in the Bill, Rosslare Harbour. I am seriously concerned about the local authorities' ability to have trained harbour masters at all ports and to provide the initial capital to put in the facilities that this Bill requires. I ask the Minister to recognise this and the reality of the financial position of maritime local <Col N="608" /> authorities and to provide the necessary resources as this amendment effectively points up.</P>

I am referring to port authorities and not local authorities. I have no doubt that port authorities can make this facility self financing. There is not all that much capital cost involved &mdash; very little indeed &mdash; and it can be self-financing.</P>

      <P>In the case of a harbour under the control of a local authority, the local authority concerned;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is to those harbours under the control of the maritime local authorities that my remarks are directed. There is no harbour authority in Kilmore Quay. There is no harbour authority in Courtown Harbour. There is no harbour authority in Duncannon Harbour. Wexford County Council will now be the harbour authority and the harbour master, as required by this Bill, will be an appointee of that local authority. Wexford County Council &mdash; and I know I speak for all the maritime county councils &mdash; cannot afford to put in the disposal facilities in all the harbours. I am sure we have a dozen small harbours on our coast but I am picking out the five or six big ones where there might be ships of any size docking. Certainly if every harbour in a maritime county has to have its own harbour authority structure and <Col N="609" /> a harbour master appointed, staff and financial resources will have to be provided by the Minister for the local authority concerned.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> A harbour authority and a harbour master would not necessarily be appointed for the purpose of the amendment we are referring to. If they were being appointed they would, of course, assume the responsibility of implementing this section. This section refers generally to the bigger ports of Cork, Dublin, Limerick and so on. In relation to the smaller ports referred to by the Senator the local authorities will be the harbour authorities in those cases. The facilities that would have to be provided for taking in the sewage would have to be provided locally and would be provided by the local authority but, as I said, the amount would be so insignificant that it would be self-financing. We are not talking about big money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This section applies to any harbour in this State and I read the first and second lines of section 12 (1). Given what the Minister has just said, do I take it that every harbour in this State does not have to be provided with the facilities, for small or large amounts of the discharge of oil and noxious substances, garbage, etc? My concern at the moment is the local authority harbours because they cannot finance what they have to do at the moment, let alone taken on an extra burden. If every harbour in the State has to have these facilities, the local authorities will need help in financing them. The capital initially will have to be provided. It will be paid back over the years through charges but you could be 20 years before some of the smaller harbours could recoup sufficient in charges to repay the initial outlay. The second question is, will each harbour in the State have its own harbour master designated by the local authority or will one maritime county have a master who will serve <Col N="610" /> six or seven harbours along the coast, as we have in Wexford? We have many harbours but only six or seven that would be of any account.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> In reply to the second part of the question, not necessarily for the purpose of this section. It will be a matter for the local authority or somebody else to set up a harbour authority and appoint a harbour master if the occasion arises. What I am saying is that it will depend solely on the amount of traffic in any particular harbour and the size of the facility that will have to be provided and basically will be self-financing. If the local authority is in charge of a harbour, say, as County Wexford, the capital outlay will be very small indeed. It may be almost nil because there may be no traffic in those harbours for this type of business.</P>

If a boat docks in one of the small harbours around our coast and the local authority have not provided the facilities for discharging garbage, sewage, waste oil, etc. at that particular harbour because it is small, could the master or skipper of a ship feel he has reasonably complied with the section Senator Norris referred to and discharge into the sea because the facilities had not been provided by a local authority as they did not expect the amount of business to be such as to justify the facilities?</P>

I would like to point out there is no Fine Gael name to the amendment on the list of amendments here today for a very good reason. Having viewed and read the debate in the other House and the response and having discussed the matter with our colleagues there we felt that the amendment was not appropriate.

It is not sufficient to react from the heart; we must balance that with clear concepts when we get onto this very difficult subject of nuclear warheads, nuclear waste, radioactive discharges etc. That amendment does not have the support of the Fine Gael Party although we have our own concerns in this area.</P>
      <P>I would like to echo the last part of what Senator Norris said concerning the treatment of visiting warships in our waters here and the fact that none of us knows quite what is happening or how they are being handled. May I ask the Minister under what legislation in the Department of Foreign Affairs he is acting or has discretion to act to refuse right of entry to ships?</P>

The consequences of these nuclear accidents which on some occasions resulted in the loss of the submarine or the sinking of a ship have been determined.

      <P>I have serious concerns about the powers being conferred in relation to the detention of ships under this section. My concerns could not be allayed by a three or four line amendment and hence no amendment has been tabled. I have no difficulty with any powers conferred on the State or any officer of the State to detain ships in criminal cases; I am concerned about detention of ships in civil cases and what appears to me to be a usurpation of the power of the Admiralty Marshall. I also think this section is in breach of the 1969 civil liability convention which I assume we must adhere to as we ratified it in the Oil Pollution Act four years ago. I would like a full explanation from the Minister as to how an inspector or a harbour master who can be any garda, qualified or otherwise as we determined at length before lunch, can now detain a ship without a <i>prima facie</i> case, or without resorting to a court order for a ship's arrest and still remain within the powers of the <Col N="616" /> Admiralty Marshall. The power of detention is detailed in several subsections of section 24. Given that all ships have to carry compulsory insurance &mdash; we have conventions to cover all of that &mdash; what will be the need to detain a ship that has caused problems if its insurances cover is adequate? I would like the Minister to explain how he feels we comply with the civil liability convention.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> This section authorises an inspector or harbour master in the harbour area under his control to stop and detain a ship which has caused or may cause pollution in the territorial waters of the State. A ship may be released if it has ceased to be a cause of pollution or a serious threat to living marine resources. A ship may also be released to effect repairs at the nearest repair yard if the master of the ship undertakes to have defects remedied at that yard and puts forward security to cover the cost of carrying out any necessary alterations or remedy any pollution damage which may be caused on the voyage to the yard. Article 5.3 of the MARPOL Convention provides for granting permission to proceed to the nearest appropriate repair yard.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle also asked about the inspector or harbour master. Section 24 (1) enables an inspector or harbour master to stop and detain a ship if he has reason to believe that it has caused or may cause pollution. The power of detention is given to an inspector in section 22 (2) but only where he is satisfied that the ship or its equipment does not comply with its MARPOL certificate or is so defective as not to be fit to put to sea without being a threat of pollution. This subsection allows an inspector or harbour master to detain a ship for the purpose of inspecting the ship, examining its records and, if necessary, examining witnesses. This is detention on suspicion of committing a criminal offence. It is not an arrest on foot of civil action.</P>

      <P>I still have concerns about a point I raised on Second Stage. Section 36 is the amendment of the continental Shelf Act. May we have an indication from the Minister as to where the functions of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, soon to become an Act, the Marine Institute Act and now this legislation overlap. I am talking particularly about responsibility for the environment of our estuaries and of the Continental Shelf area. When I spoke to the Environmental Protection Agency Bill there was major confusion between it and the Marine Institute Bill as to who had responsibility for our waters. Now this Bill purports to take on board responsibilities in the same area for environmental problems such as dredging harbours. May I ask the Minister to clarify to the House who is responsible for the marine environment in our estuaries? The position of local authorities might also be clarified since they have responsibility down to the high water mark, if I understand correctly. Problems could arise in the environment of an estuary that would emanate from a local authority area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed legislation is confusing. Will the Minister outline the exact responsibilities under this Bill to protect our environment and our estuaries, a very important aspect? What are the responsibilities under the Environmental <Col N="618" /> Protection Agency Bill and the Marine Institute Bill and where does ones responsibility begin and the other end?</P>

This power is considered contrary to the spirit of this Bill.

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and I ask him to investigate the circumstances leading to the contamination of the public water supply in Naas, County Kildare, and to acknowledge the need to review the response of the relevant authorities to that incident with a view to minimising the risk to public health in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious from the Minister's attendance here that he attaches importance to this matter because I realise that other pressing matters exist which demand his attention. We must sympathise with many people in Naas who suffered as a result of this incident. Large numbers of people were directly affected by sewage contamination of the water supply; it was reported in the press that up to 3,000 people in the town were affected. Schools and schooling were disrupted and there were significant effects <Col N="621" /> on the commercial life of the town, on pubs and restaurants, etc.</P>
    <P>It is important to sympathise with those who became ill as a result of this incident and I am sure the Minister would share that view. By any standards it was a very serious incident. The question arises as to how it happened in the first place, how the relevant authorities responded to the situation and if their response was adequate. What can be done in future to prevent a recurrence in Naas or in any other town of such an incident? There are lessons to be learned here which could be applied universally.</P>
    <P>There is no great need on my part to catalogue the events. I am sure the Minister is already well aware of what took place. It all began on 7 October last and has already received widespread press coverage. The county engineer, Mr. Carrick, in communication with the county manager reporting on the contamination problem at Sunday's Well in Naas, said that first complaints were received on Monday, 7 October that the water supply was smelling and was not satisfactory. Further complaints were received on Tuesday, 8 October and the supply was switched off at approximately 11.30 a.m. on that day to enable investigations to take place and an alternative supply from the regional scheme was switched on.</P>
    <P>The sad sequence of events has been well documented. Sunday's Well was used as a principal water supply until about 30 years ago when a switch was made to the Blessington Lakes and about 40 per cent of the town's water supply came from Sunday's Well at the time of the incident.</P>
    <P>Why was it decided to switch back to Sunday's Well? Was it a question of cost saving? Why was that done in the knowledge that sewage lines lay adjacent to this water supply? The decision must have been ill-advised given the amount of housing development in that area. Even if there were good grounds for making the decision to have Sunday's <Col N="622" /> Well supply part of Naas's water, how could any planning authority permit a sewer adjacent to a town's water supply? Have deficiencies in our planning system allowed that situation to arise? That is a serious question. This well &mdash; as I am sure most wells are &mdash; is in a depression and it is susceptible to contamination from surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>There appear also to have been deficiencies in the construction of the sewer. In the county engineer's report it is stated that when surrounding sewer manhole covers were checked it was discovered that a blockage had occurred in a line which ran near the well. The report goes on to say that when the blockage was cleared up the inspection of the manhole indicated that seepage could have occurred through the walls of the manhole into the surrounding ground. That is the background to the incident.</P>
    <P>We come now to what happened after the incident took place &mdash; the response of the authorities involved, which were Naas UDC, Kildare County Council, the Eastern Health Board and the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the 1986 guidelines from the Department of the Environment for emergency planning to protect water sources were first fully implemented and, second, in the light of this occurrence, that those guidelines are adequate? I realise that they cover a number of points and their intention is to protect water resources and the drinking water supply. Do they, as a result of this incident, now need to be reviewed? Were they adequate in the first place?</P>
    <P>The local authority response was to send communications around to houses; advertisements were placed in the paper together with frequent information on news bulletins on CKR Radio. On 8 and 10 October people in Naas were advised to boil their water, a reasonable precaution. Subsequently they were asked to boil their water for no less than ten minutes. My information is that some <Col N="623" /> houses were omitted when this information leaflet was distributed which indicates defects in the response mechanisms for incidents such as this.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, on 17 October the Eastern Health Board advised people in Naas whose children had not been immunised against polio &mdash; there would not have been many in this category &mdash; to obtain such immunisation. People were already frightened and concerned about this matter and this directive frightened them further. Were there sound reasons for issuing that directive, although I take the point that it is wiser to anticipate disaster than try to rectify it when it happens?</P>
    <P>Later, people were advised to clean out their tanks, which is a possibility for tall people like the Minister, for fit people or younger people but there are elderly people who would have great difficulty in carrying out that directive and assistance should have been provided to them.</P>
    <P>When the water supply was eventually declared safe again there were widespread concerns and a lack of confidence in the local authority. I, and other public representatives, were asked by people in Naas to approach the county manager to ensure that water tankers being used to supply fresh water would stay on the road for the approaching bank holiday weekend. The county manager did accede to those requests and the water tankers remained available.</P>
    <P>I have gone through the 1989 legislation on water pollution to see if anything in it might impinge upon this situation but I cannot find anything relevant to it. The Bill seems to focus on the responsibilities of the individual and of groups to the State but excludes the reciprocal responsibilities of local authorities. There is the same onus on a local authority as on an individual or group to ensure that a water supply is not polluted. What recourse have the people of Naas after this incident. Their rights are not covered by the local government legislation. The minimum that might be <Col N="624" /> done for these people would be to waive water charges for the coming year. If people get a service they should have to pay for it, but if what they get amounts to a non-service and has endangered their health, it is unreasonable to ask them to continue to pay for it. I believe that if they are asked to pay they are very likely to say that they will not. I see serious problems arising here.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to ask the people in Naas to pay the service charges. I understand that, under the estimates, the water charges in Naas come to £190,000, a significant amount of money. In the event of those charges not being collected the local authority would need to be compensated. The level of confidence of the people in their local authority is so low that they are very unlikely to see any reason they should pay these charges.</P>
    <P>The people of Naas are entitled to assurances that the infected water supply remains disconnected, that it will no longer be used to supply any water to Naas and that the situation will continue to be monitored. Since viruses like hepatitis take time to incubate, a monitoring system must continue for some time. There would then be follow-up checks of the water supply to ensure it is of drinkable quality and not a risk to public health. In relation to confidence in the local authority there is widespread suspicion, however with founded or ill-founded, that all the facts have not been revealed. More positive information must be given to the population.</P>
    <P>One person in the medical field in Naas told me today that the problem had not gone away, but it had been alieviated. There is a distinction. I would ask the Minister to institute some form of inquiry &mdash; it should be a public inquiry &mdash; and all the information that derives from such an inquiry should be made available to the public. There are lessons to be learned from this unfortunate incident and other communities could benefit from the results of such an inquiry. The <Col N="625" /> priority must be to protect the health and welfare of the people of Naas. They must be confident that their water supply is of the highest quality, that it is drinkable, and that it is not a risk to health. We must move to restore their confidence in the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Senator Dardis's grave concern at this most serious pollution incident. When its lessons have been fully assessed, I will be taking all necessary steps to impress on local authorities the need for consistent monitoring of water supplies, especially where water sources are located in sensitive areas.</P>
      <P>As soon as my Department became aware of the scale of the problem in Naas, a senior engineer from my Department visited the area to get a first hand account of its extent and the measures taken by the local authority to remedy the problem. In addition, a detailed report was sought from the council on the incident. I have been assured by the council that immediate steps were taken to alleviate and remedy the situation. The council's first and most important priority, in response to this incident, was to deal with the serious pollution of existing supplies and secure the provision of an alternative water supply to the area. Following daily consultations with council engineers and the chief medical officer the water supply in Naas was officially declared safe on 25 October 1991. This announcement was made by the council following consistent analysis reports which showed no contamination. My Department continually monitored the situation on a daily basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of a pure and wholesome supply of water is a statutory responsibility of individual local authorities as set out in The Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878. In 1988, regulations were made by my Department governing the quality of water which set minimum quality standards for all water supplied throughout the public or private supply schemes, either for human consumption and/or for <Col N="626" /> use in food production. These standards represent the final quality check on drinking water at the point it is made available to the consumer.</P>
    <P>The first comprehensive report on the quality of drinking water in Ireland was completed and published very recently by my Department. This national report which relates to 1989 confirms the good quality of our drinking water. It also points out quality problems which still exist. Water as we all know is a valuable asset. However, it is also very vulnerable and for this reason we must do all that is necessary to protect it. The report recommends useful measures that can be taken to fulfil this objective. Better reporting and information arrangements are a stimulus to increase efforts to improve water quality. I have initiated the first ever comprehensive report on Irish drinking water quality and I am committed to this in future years also.</P>
    <P>In 1986 my Department advised all sanitary authorities of the need to protect water resources and issued comprehensive guidelines in dealing with emergencies. The purpose of this was to remind authorities of their statutory responsibilities and also ensure that procedures were put in place at local level to deal with any eventuality or emergency that might arise. In cases where resources or supplies were threatened, the authorities were advised to take a number of immediate steps which include shut-off water intakes where necessary; the issuing of early and regular updating of notifications to users and public at large and to appropriate agencies, of the hazard and what action is required of them; consultation with chief medical officer and arranging for samples to be analysed; and arrangements for alternative supplies. I understand that the council's immediate response on becoming aware of the contamination of the water supply was to decommission the Sunday's Well source of the supply.</P>
    <P>I should add that this source of supply had been regularly monitored and the <Col N="627" /> results prior to the incident showed that the water quality was suitable for human consumption</P>
    <P>I have asked the council for a comprehensive report on all stages of the incident. As I have stated I will be impressing the lessons learned on all sanitary authorities.</P>
    <P>The council, having dealt with the contamination incident, are now carrying out an intensive and in depth examination of the cause of the incident. This exercise commenced immediately following the restoration of normal supplies. I have <Col N="628" /> also asked the local authority for a comprehensive report on this. I look forward to receiving it.</P>
