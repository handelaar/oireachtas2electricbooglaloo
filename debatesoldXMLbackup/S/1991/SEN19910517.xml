      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. A man from the west is always welcome here, however I am afraid I cannot give the same categoric and absolute welcome to the legislation he brings to the House. I am sure he has heard that before so he will not be surprised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says the Bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation to come before this House in recent years. There is no great humility in that statement, but time will tell if it is. It should be one of the most important pieces of legislation to come before this House because we have been waiting so long for the reform of local government. In the Fianna Fáil manifesto of 1985 there was a commitment to local government reform and the Minister has had four years in Government to ensure that that commitment was honoured. The Bill should have been introduced in a more coherent way. One would have expected a more generous timespan. It has been introduced in the last few days in order to meet the local elections deadline and if it is not passed by 17 May it will not be in <Col N="2190" /> place for the forthcoming local elections. That is not the way to go about introducing major legislation. This last minute timing is to be deplored. Effectively we have a guillotine on the debate and we have no choice but to rush it through without a proper opportunity to tease it out and explore its implications. This has enormous implications. The debate in this House ran from 6 p.m. yesterday until midnight and today it will conclude at 8 p.m. which is not enough time to tease out this very important Bill to any degree.</P>
    <P>The Minister said reform and modernisation of the local government system has been one of the Government's highest priorities. It may very well have been, but this legislation has come into this House at such short notice that there is no sign of that. The Minister went on to say that this is also a task of considerable depth and complexity. Naturally we would have liked to have had the opportunity of addressing in equal depth what he proposes. He said, &ldquo;We need only reflect briefly on the range of services, the extent of resources and the volume of employment involved in the local government sector to appreciate that any change in the system must be prudently formulated and implemented with the utmost care and thoroughness.&rdquo; I agree whole heartedly and that is why I must deplore so strongly the manner in which this Bill is going through this House, particularly at such short notice.</P>
    <P>To put the Bill into context brings us back to the original Local Government Act, 1898. That was a major development. Local councils were established so that local people could, for the first time, have an input into Government and this meant Irish people could have a direct input into Government. It is strange that we have not had a reform of local government legislation for over 90 years. It is a sort of a <i>déja vu</i> situation &mdash; so much of our major legislation goes back to the beginning of this century or to the previous century and was formulated in different times, under a different jurisdiction &mdash; and we bring with us all that heavy handed colonial baggage that was <Col N="2191" /> established for a more bureaucratic system with a more bureaucratic Civil Service and a totally different ethos. I find it unacceptable that if I should look for a copy of the Local Government Act, 1898, the only way I can get it is to apply to Her Majesty's Government in Britain or in Northern Ireland because that Act is not published here. That is the position so far as other legislation is concerned. Our country is governed by some legislation that was introduced by those who governed us, but we still have not seen fit to reformulate the legislation in keeping with the character and ethos of our own country. Perhaps we might move towards very substantial law reform in this and a number of other areas.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said there have been changes in the functions of local authorities and developments have taken place over the years in this area. From time to time new areas have been covered, others have been neglected or have been allowed to fall away. The one thing that is common throughout is that there has been no substantial development in terms of organisation or structural developments in this area. The powers of local authorities have been eroded and nothing has been put in their place. City and county managers have taken over many of the essential functions of local authorities. This took place prior to the war, during the thirties and forties. As a result the power is no longer devolved to the people who have been elected by the public but rests with the managers. Therefore, it is bureaucratic power rather than a true democratic power.</P>
    <P>The second major area where the powers of local authorities have been eroded is in financing. This more than anything else has emasculated local authorities in recent years. This was the direct consequence of the 1977 election when the Fianna Fáil Party swept home with a 20 seat majority on their promise to abolish local rates. They acknowledged that this would take away the funding of local authorities but said they would put in place substantial Exchequer funding <Col N="2192" /> which would equal what was taken away. This was a wonderful promise but it was never implemented in practice &mdash; local funding was taken from local authorities but no central Government funding was put in its place. Without funding from the Exchequer local authorities were not able to fulfil the range of functions they had exercised prior to 1977. This is evident from what has been happening in recent times. While the Governments of the early eighties, particularly the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government, managed to provide funding from the Exchequer, this funding has not been forthcoming since 1987. As a result local authorities have been starved of funding for the essential services they are duty bound to provide to the community.</P>
    <P>The Government's housing policy has been bankrupt. In 1986, prior to Fianna Fáil coming into power, 1,556 houses were built in Dublin. In 1987 this was reduced to 460; in 1988 it was further reduced to 159 and in 1989 only six local authority houses were built in Dublin. How can anyone imagine from those statistics that the local authorities are providing a housing service? The local authorities are very anxious to provide housing but the necessary funding to do this is not forthcoming from the Government. In the space of four years the actual Government allocation for public housing fell from £250 million in 1985 to £21 million in 1989. This is certainly not the way to do business in terms of providing local authority housing. The level of maintenance carried out by local authorities is at an all time low. I see evidence of this every day in flat complexes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to remind Senator Costello that while reasonable latitude can be allowed he has tended to wander quite a distance from the contents of the Local Government Bill, 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I must insist that I am keeping to the point. I am talking about the functions of local authorities and why there is need for reform.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Housing is essential. Maintenance is another essential area which must be financed by local authorities. We cannot allow the stock of local authority houses built in this city to be run down. We have now reached the stage where necessary repairs are not being carried out because local authorities do not have the personnel to do this work or the resources to provide the equipment. As a result the existing housing stock is falling into disrepair.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to libraries, another essential service provided by the local authorities. Because of the a lack of staff libraries are being closed earlier during weekdays and are not opened at all at weekends. This service is of greater necessity now to people. For example, as a teacher I am aware of the tremendous amount of project work involved in the new junior certificate. Teachers are sending pupils to libraries to research projects. However, the necessary materials for this work are not being put in place in libraries. This area needs to be developed but, unfortunately, the opposite is happening.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the emergency services. If there is a fire at evening time or during the night, if a gas main bursts or there is flooding, there is no one in City Hall to answer an emergency call. Playgrounds have been closed down in the city centre and public amenities generally are at a very low ebb because of a lack of financing for local authorities. While the local authority in Dublin have plans to introduce major reforms such as road widening, road building, etc, and have purchased property over a long period of time, very often they are unable to implement these plans due to a lack of funding. As a result the local authority are a slum landlord. Unfortunately, the Derelict Sites Bill did not address this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to section 4 motions, the scandal of the century. Much of the Dublin area, particularly the green areas <Col N="2194" /> on the outskirts of the city, have been turned into a wasteland of unregulated and environmentally dangerous developments. I think we all agree on the need for root and branch reform of local government. By this I mean reform of the structures, organisation and means of resourcing local authorities so that there can be an underpinning of finance. If there is no root and branch reform we will be talking about something which will never be delivered. We must ensure that it is the local authorities, who are elected by the people and who represent their local communities, and not the Minister who are in charge of local government.</P>
    <P>We must also ensure that we do not have an anomalous system of double taxation. At present people in Cork are being jailed because of their opposition to water charges while there are no such charges in Dublin city. This means we have a two-tier system where one tier is regarded as more unjust than the other. We need to have a standard system so that people will have respect for the manner in which local authorities are elected, administered and financed.</P>
    <P>The Minister is seeking consensus on this Bill. Of course, this is the proper way of going about it. We need to have consensus on major reforming legislation. Unfortunately, some of the problems in this area were created by the Minister's party as a result of the steps they took in the late seventies. Therefore, there is a particular onus on the Minister to ensure that reform is introduced in this area. My party are aware of the need to have as much consensus as possible on the Bill. However, it will be very difficult to get consensus on the Bill because of the manner in which it has been introduced.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made throughout the debate that this is an enabling Bill. The Bill provides a framework, but it will not implement reform. There is no reference to finance and the structures which will be put in place. Therefore, we are only talking about one-third of the major reforms required. The Minister in his speech said: &ldquo;The first <Col N="2195" /> requirement is to get the structures, systems, functions and operations of local authorities right. To attempt any financial adjustments in advance of this would quite simply be a case of putting the cart before the horse&rdquo;. I could not possibly agree with that. It is a load of rubbish. There is no question of putting the cart before the horse. The introduction of the legislation and the provision of the finance should be done in tandem. One does not first put in place legislation that may or may not be followed by other legislation and not talk about finance because it will be dealt with later. That is not the way to proceed. Further legislation may or may not be forthcoming; the Government may not even be in power. Judging by recent developments one never knows what will happen. The proper and responsible way to proceed is to ensure that every structural change introduced, every new function given to local authorities is underpinned with the necessary finances to implement it.</P>
    <P>The Minister says this is not a financial provisions measure. Why not? How can the Minister put it that way and expect reasonable people and seasoned legislators in this House to accept his word on it? Resources must be provided for in the legislation. Without the finance the legislation is powerless. Power is given through the resources. If the plans are not funded, if there is no provision for staff in the plans then the plans are not capable of being implemented.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas has seen fit to enact several important pieces of legislation conferring significant powers and responsibilities on local authorities. There have been, or are currently in preparation Bills dealing with air pollution, water pollution, housing, roads, planning, urban renewal and derelict sites, and regulations made to give effect to various EC directives have also added considerably to local functions.</P>
    <P>There is a problem about all of these. We discussed the Derelict Sites Bill, and no <Col N="2196" /> money and no extra staff were put in place. We are discussing the Environmental Agency Bill and we have the same problems there. The major problem we have focussed on is that new agencies do not get the resources. That is the fatal flaw and that is the problem in relation to this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is £8 million put in place to implement the provisions of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not one provision in the 52 sections of this Bill under which one penny will be made available to implement its proposals. I would be delighted to hear the Minister's response to that. He cannot but accept that there will be a degree of scepticism abroad when that is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 deal with the devolution of power. It seems that that is very much a mirage rather than a reality. It is imaginary that the powers and functions of the local authorities are going to be devolved, as it is put very finely in the opening lines in section 5 (1) which states that a local authority may represent the interests of the local community in such a manner as it thinks appropriate. The function of the local authority is to represent the interests of the local community, but Members should note the wording &mdash;&ldquo;a local authority may represent&rdquo;. Surely it should be that a local authority must represent the interests of the local community. Is that not their only function? They do not have a discretion, or should not have a discretion in the matter. That is the reason we have the expensive business of electing councillors to local authorities, that we set up a structure, that we have buildings, committee meetings, expenses, chairpeople, mayors and the whole paraphernalia. Local authorities should represent the community, but in the Bill it is left as a discretionary matter. I hope the Minister will accept an amendment to that provision. No duty or liability is imposed on a local authority in any of the sections following. All the provisions carry the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;; that the local <Col N="2197" /> authority, subject to the provisions of a section, may do this or may do that.</P>
    <P>The Minister used many fine words and eloquent phrases when he spoke of the need to democratise, to transfer power to the people, but immediately he is introducing a discretionary provision and does not impose an obligation or a liability.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the legislation is very much hamstrung by the fact that in all of these areas, as well as leaving it as loose as that, the Minister is entitled to come back and may order what he will in relation to these functions supposedly being devolved to the local authority. There will be a second tier of imposition under which the local authority can be hamstrung by the Minister or, indeed, by the Government. According to section 6 the Minister has to get the consent of the Minister for Finance. The provision of finance should be part and parcel of the legislation but now we have the Minister for Finance as a further broker in this matter. The Minister for the Environment may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, prescribe matters in respect of which a local authority shall not exercise the powers conferred by this section.</P>
    <P>The section states:</P>
    <P>A local authority shall not, by virtue of this section, undertake or provide assistance for the undertaking of any activity that would prejudice or duplicate activity arising from the performance of a statutory function by any person in the functional area of the authority or that would, having regard to the activities or proposed activities of that person in relation to the area, involve wasteful or unnecessary expenditure by the local authority.</P>
    <P>Surely it is the function of the local authority to decide what is important in terms of functional development in their area? Does that provision mean that the Minister, or the Minister for Finance, can decide if a proposed development of an industrial nature, of a tourism nature, or any nature is the best value for the <Col N="2198" /> community? Surely the powers should rest with the local authority. That is what they are there for and that is what we mean by devolving power to local authorities. Otherwise the Minister is saying one thing and doing another. The Minister cannot expect us to come in like sheep to this House and give a stamp of approval, an imprimatur, to legislation that is so constrictive and open to being used in a way that is contrary to what the Minister said in his introductory speech.</P>
    <P>Section 7 states:</P>
    <P>...a local authority, in performing the functions conferred on it by or under this or any other enactment shall have regard to&mdash;</P>
    <P>Therefore everything a local authority may decide to do is subject to those conditions. What is the first condition? Subsection (1) (a) states: &ldquo;the resources, wherever originating, that are available or likely to be available to it for the purpose of such performance...&rdquo; Subsection (1) (e) refers to the policies and objectives of the Government or any Minister of the Government in so far as they may affect or relate to its functions. Surely the policies and objectives of the Government are not matters that should tie down a local authority. The Government may have all sorts of objectives, but a local authority has the objective of providing for and representing their local community. If they are to be bound by what any Government or Minister has as an objective at a particular time, does this mean that they will have to write to the Minister for Justice and say: &ldquo;We were thinking about doing some work in relation to building a swimming pool, a sewerage system or something of that nature and the approval of the Minister for Justice has to be received because we do not know what the Minister for Justice thinks about it&rdquo;? These are unnecessary curtailments on the exercise of the local authorities' function.</P>
    <P>While the Minister specified the general framework in the functions, he did not take on board the report of the Advisory Expert Committee which specified in <Col N="2199" /> greater detail the areas that the local authority should address and what functions would be devolved to the local authority. These were: individual housing grants, group water schemes, driver testing, foreshore licences, non-national heritage parks, controls for safety at work, aspects of education, health, social welfare, tourism, transport and traffic, police and courts, consumer protection and social employment schemes. The report recommended that these be transferred in stages from central Government to local government. The Minister makes a general reference to areas that maybe the function of a local authority &mdash; social, economic, environmental, recreational, cultural, community and general development &mdash; but he does not specify in any great detail. That type of detail would contribute to ensuring that local authorities operate more coherently. Interpretation within that context may vary enormously from area to area.</P>
    <P>Let me talk about education, for example. The Vocational Education Committee are neither very standardised nor very representational; there are no parents nor teachers represented on the VECs and the VECs vary enormously from one county to another. For example, in Sligo there is a VEC representing only a single vocational school. In the other area, the secondary sector there is no element of local authority because traditionally that was developed by the nuns, priests and brothers. Now the brothers have almost gone from the system, the nuns are in short supply and so are the priests. We are left with individual stand alone schools throughout the country with good, representative boards of management, teachers, parents and trusty representatives, but they are not co-ordinated; there is no structure to coordinate them. They are standing alone, in isolation, little islands, and as this decade goes by the situation will worsen. Is this not an area that a local authority could address? It has been addressed in practically every other country in the world, but there is no provision for an extension of local authority co-ordination <Col N="2200" /> or structural involvement in the functions specified here. That needs careful consideration now when changes are being considered. I ask the Minister to examine this area. It may not be possible to do anything about it under this legislation &mdash; although proper to it &mdash; but it could be taken account of in the preparation of the promised Bills.</P>
    <P>We spoke yesterday about the prisons, the Garda and the courts. Is there any reason these could not be brought under the control of the local authority? The system at present is very badly administered and perhaps if these functions were devolved to the local authority an improvement would be effected.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil election manifesto said in relation to local authorities that Fianna Fáil would ensure that each local authority would gain the maximum benefit from EC regional funding and would introduce procedures whereby local authorities could make direct applications for regional funding and receive such funds directly from the Community. As the Minister knows, the opposite position was adopted by the Government. When the EC offered funding it was not accepted because it was to be made available in the context of being administered by the local communities and that was not acceptable to the Government. This is the contradition between what is proposed here and the reality. The proposal is in vague terms and really there is no desire to implement local authority reform.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in their election manifesto, stated that they would raise the annual housing output to 30,000 including 6,000 local authority houses per year; that the 50,000 unemployed building workers and their families and the 35,000 families waiting for homes could look with confidence to Fianna Fáil to meet their needs. I am afraid the figures I quoted in relation to local authority housing are a sad reflection on that declaration when only about 200 houses are to be built this year in the entire country. Approximately 25,000 people throughout the country are on the housing list and this is the Government's response. Where is the provision in this <Col N="2201" /> new Bill to ensure that local authorities have the powers and the funding to build new houses?</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil election manifesto stated that Fianna Fáil viewed with concern the rapid deterioration of the county road system which represents 80 per cent of the public road network, that a special five year programme to assist local authorities to deal with the problem would be drawn up for the maintenance of county roads and that Fianna Fáil believed that the preservation of the investment of over 60 years in county roads was essential.</P>
    <P>What can we say about that? All we have to do is read the newspapers day in and day out to see that those promises and the promises the Minister has made since are buried in the potholes.</P>

      <P>These were some of the promises and we are seeing what the delivery has been. I want to underline the dire need to ensure that local authorities can fulfil the functions for which they are established. They can do that only if the funding is put there to underpin them.</P>
      <P>The advisory committee made a number of recommendations. I would like to see them incorporated in the Bill, for example, Ireland should ratify the European Charter of Local Self-Government. Why has that not been implemented? Is there some fear of having an international charter ratified in Ireland? If constitutional recognition were given to local government then there would be an implied responsibility to ensure that they were properly resourced and that local elections would not be capable of being postponed except in an emergency. The local elections have been postponed for a year to allow the introduction of this legislation which is very much a damp squib. We had expected substantial legislation because of the postponement. I would like to quote the view of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce regarding the resourcing of this legislation:</P>
      <P>Adequate resources of local authorities are essential if they are to become engines of economic development. At present local authorities are under-resourced and this places an undue burden on the commercial rate is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Section 12 provides that the Minister may by order do this, that and the other in relation to county boundaries and the number of personnel who may sit on a local authority. I would have thought the time was right to ensure that an independent commission would be established to divide the local authority <Col N="2204" /> areas and to decide on the number of members who should represent any local authority. I would have thought that existing legislation should not continue to preserve those powers but that we should be talking about dispensing with those powers; providing for a High Court judge and an independent commission to deal with it.</P>
      <P>The promise in the Bill to reorganise Dublin is contingent on the reorganisation report being made to the Minister &mdash; the county council may draw up the plans. Section 24 (1) states:</P>
      <P>When the reorganisation report has been submitted to the Minister, he may, having considered it, direct that another report be jointly prepared by any one or more of the area managers in respect of or taking account of specified matters.</P>
      <P>In relation to preparing for the establishment of the proposed councils by the Minister the work may be done by the council but the Minister will inspect it and he may order another report. Even that extra stage is so restricted by ministerial prerogative that nobody ever knows if we will ever reach it. Section 24 (2) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister, having considered the reorganisation report and any reports under this section may, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, by regulations make such provision as appears to him to be necessary or expedient for the purposes of or to give full effect to or to facilitate &mdash;</P>
      <P>In this legislation there are no guarantees, restructuring is promised and financing is promised but there is so much ministerial red tape and possible regulations, subject to finance, subject to the Minister for the Environment, that we do not know whether we are coming or going. One could speak for hours on this Bill but I will not speak for much longer. There is a great deal of sound and fury in the Bill and in the Minister's speech.

      <P>The reason it is so necessary to have local government reform is because of what happened in 1977. This Bill is not the big bang the Minister suggested when he said it was one of the most important items of legislation to come before the House in recent years. It should have been the most important legislation but my fear is that it is a very small whimper. Because of the lack of resources, the limitation on the devolution of powers and the whole question of how the local authorities will operate, we may find ourselves with less local power so that the whole purpose of the Bill to devolve the power to the local authorities will be frustrated. It is a shame that all the time has been spent in preparing this legislation and at the very last minute it comes before us. It is as though there was a great need to rush it through. We will find that nothing will happen as a result.</P>

      <P>Unlike Senator Costello, who has never in his life sat in a council chamber, I speak with 24 years of experience and I am proud to do so. In my 24 years as a member of Athlone UDC and Westmeath County Council reform of local government has been discussed on numerous occasions as being a matter of importance for the whole local government system. It is very important for our villages, our towns, our cities, our communities and our residents associations. If one looked at the range of services in a county council annual estimate, one would see clearly the extent of the resources and the volume of employment in the whole local government system. In my own county of Westmeath there is a staff of approximately 450 who have good, secure employment. This is a very <Col N="2206" /> important aspect of the whole local government system.</P>
      <P>Local government touches the lives of all our citizens in the areas of housing, roads, planning, water, sewerage, swimming pools, libraries, car parks, municipal playgrounds, open spaces and so on; the list is endless. We must give local government reorganisation systems a top priority. Other Ministers and other Governments talked about it but this Minister and this Government have taken positive action and have introduced this legislation. The Minister likes to call it phase one of what will be an ongoing exercise for meaningful reform.</P>
      <P>During my time as a member of the UDC and Westmeath County Council many changes have taken place and many new activities have been taken on board by the various county councils, urban councils and local authorities. Going back a number of years we had a Minister known as the Minister for Local Government but that title has changed and he is now Minister for the Environment. We now talk about environment matters as if they have been part and parcel of the scene for a long time. That is not the case because it has only been in the last ten or 12 years, or thereabouts, that environment matters have surfaced as being important. We have to think about the water we drink and the air we breathe. We have legislation on air and water pollution and so on. Environment matters have become enormously important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other side of the coin, responsibility for the health services has been removed from local authorities, for good reason. Health services are vital to this nation. I can recall my early days on the council going through the estimates for the county hospital in Mullingar and for the district hospital in Athlone. Responsibility for hospitals now lies with the eight health boards. Responsibility for the maintenance of courthouses has also been taken from local authorities. I cannot understand Senator Costello's rationale in this regard. For years local authority members of all parties have been asking what the maintenance of <Col N="2207" /> courthouses had to do with local authorities. Why should the ratepayers of Westmeath, Sligo, Dublin or wherever, have to pay for what is a Department of Justice function, the maintenance of courthouses? This Minister has now made a decision to take responsibility for this area from local authorities; about time. I cannot understand why Senator Costello is trying, even at this late stage, to have that decision reversed. It baffles me but it highlights the Senator's ignorance of the local government system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone who looks at all the local government legislation introduced over the past number of years will see they have had a major impact on our lives. Extra powers have been given to the local authorities in the areas of urban renewal, water pollution, planning, derelict sites and so on. The list is endless. Huge changes have taken place in the whole area of local government. Local authorities are doing an effective job and are working well. Reform is needed but not because the local authorities are doing a bad job. They are providing a huge range of services and they play a valuable social and community role which at the same time greatly enhancing the quality of our lives. It is a fact of life that we take the services provided by local authorities for granted. People never stop to think where the water in the taps comes from. They never stop to think of all the facilities and services provided by local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The infrastructure essential to economic development is provided by the local authority in many cases. They help to improve the economy and create jobs. They have contributed greatly providing land for development. Were it not for local authorities many industrial estates would not have been built and many thousands of jobs would not have been created. Local authorities have helped <Col N="2208" /> in a very positive and practical way by providing land and helping to build industrial estates. Most authorities now have their own county development team who play a role providing jobs.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello seemed to suggest, as did other Senators, that to hand over millions of pounds is the answer to all our problems. Many people argue that more finance would be needed for local government reform and somewhere along the line money will be provided but local authorities should be given an opportunity to acquire their own resources. The Minister is handling this matter the right way. You have to put down a foundation, or improve your foundation as in this case, before you start to build. The first requirement surely must be to get the structures, functions and operations of the local authorities right. To concentrate on the finances at this stage would be wrong. As I said, you must first put down a proper foundation for the structures, functions and so on and move on from there.</P>
    <P>The Government have indicated that this process has started. They have asked councils to streamline their estimates, which they are doing, they want to ensure the restoration of finances, at local and national level, in a more disciplined way, and again there is evidence that this is happening not just in local authorities but in health boards. We want better value for money. With the reorganisation of structures and the proper operation of local authorities, money can be saved.</P>
    <P>There is no simple formula for complete local government reform. The Minister has indicated that complete reform would take a lot of time, dialogue, energy and effort. At the end of the day the local authority must have the capacity to promote the best interests and development of their own area. Local government must clearly be made relevant and close to the people. Community participation in the work of local authorities must be fostered and encouraged at every opportunity. Local government more than any Government Department relates most closely to the daily lives of our people. The Minister <Col N="2209" /> has indicated that additional legislation will be needed to complete the reform programme and I accept that. It will take time. Obviously we must wait for the results of the fiscal study, the consolidation and modernisation of the general code of local government law and the setting up of local government structures at sub-county level. I certainly welcome these proposals.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that all the reports confirm that the county borough will continue to be the primary unit of local government. Eight regional authorities will be established, and I have no difficulty with that. I am a member of a health board comprising three counties: Offaly, Laois and Longford. We get on well as a team and the system works very well. We work with other counties and they help us. There is no reason that this system cannot be set up in the area of local government. I know the regional authorities will be different from the health boards because they will not have a budget of their own, but nonetheless the need for regional structures becomes apparent when one considers the range of services which are organised regionally.</P>
    <P>Recently a major development in Athlone was completed, including the provision of a relief road and a bridge, at a cost of £37 million, and both West-meath County Council and Roscommon County Council were involved. There was a good co-operative spirit and both councils worked well as a team. We now have an excellent example of what many people would say is the finest engineering feat in the country in recent years. I was interested to hear Senator Ó Foighil say a fortnight ago that we should not have spent money on this road but that we should have used it to fill potholes. I do not accept that for a moment. That bridge and that road in Athlone will be very beneficial to the industries of Roscommon, to his own county of Galway and possibly, to a lesser extent, Mayo. It now takes only six minutes to go through Athlone where previously on a wet Friday or Saturday afternoon it would have taken an hour or more. Surely this <Col N="2210" /> is beneficial to the people and the industries of County Galway. He should remember this. It is more important to them than it is to me, a citizen of Athlone. Regional structures can be important. I gave the example of what two counties can do by acting together and getting important work done well. I note and indeed regret that Ministers and Ministers of State will be excluded from membership of local authorities. Many Ministers of State will be sorry about this, because they have always been totally committed to and had a great love for the local government system.</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides for the establishment of an independent boundary advisory committee to review local authority boundaries and also, I understand, local electoral boundaries or other local government matters that might be referred to them. This is very important and I support that.</P>
    <P>The role and the status of the elected members of local authorities is basic to the democratic system of local government. The Minister touched on this and suggested that the powers of the elected members are, in law, founded primarily on the concept of reserved functions. The Minister then went on to talk about the exclusive prerogatives of elected members as distinct from the executive functions exercised by the county managers. I share the Minister's view that councillors have a lot of power. The Minister talked about all the extra powers available to him and he specified a considerable number of important powers and functions that are being reserved to the elected members. Section 5 refers to representational functions of local authorities. Section 6 refers to activities to promote the interests of local communities. Section 29 refers to decisions in relation to the alterations of boundaries and the establishment of committees, which is very important. The local authorities are comprised of responsible people who will know where and when a committee should be established, and they will act wisely. I have no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>Section 41 (2) provides a new general <Col N="2211" /> power for the Minister to declare official reserved functions by order. That is very important. The explanatory memorandum states that section 41 gives statutory recognition to the general policy-making role of local authority members and empowers the Minister to declare by order that specified additional functions of local authorities will be reserved functions for the purposes of the City and County Management Acts.</P>
    <P>Local county councillors and local public representatives generally, are the unpaid servants of local communities. They do not object to that. By seeking election that is exactly what they seek to be. During my time in the local authority the role of county councillors, the town commissioners and urban councillors has changed. The problems of roads, housing, health and other issues like that preoccupied the minds of councillors and representations came fast and furious in those areas. In recent years there have been different types of problems, so that one would almost need to be a social worker, or a local ombudsman, as many of them are to deal with so many different problems. The reserved functions already tend to correspond with the policy making aspects of the Bill and there are specific powers to impose various requirements on the manager.</P>
    <P>The Minister touched on the fact that the policy-making role of members not being spelt out clearly and succinctly in law has caused the role and status of the elected members to be understated. I agree totally with that. From time to time the elected members have given away some of their powers and many of them are not sufficiently aware of the full extent of the powers vested in them. I hope this Bill will help to further educate members as to their powers.</P>
    <P>Section 42 provides for the payment of an allowance for reasonable expenses to the chairman of a local authority. The decision to pay an allowance will be a reserved function and the chairman is deemed to include the mayor or lord mayor. I agree with this. There is a view held that elected members should be <Col N="2212" /> paid. I was a councillor for 14 years before I became a Senator, but I disagree with this view. To pay an elected councillor could be the start of the destruction of the local democratic system as we know it. If we eliminate the voluntary role of the elected member of a local authority, we destroy the system. That must not be allowed happen. The voluntary role must never be diminished and it would be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;very serious for local democracy if that happened. That does not mean our members should not be allowed travel to conferences, seminars and so on. I totally and passionately believe that they are entitled to that. Expenses paid to elected members have often been criticised, but the elected members are as much a board of directors as the board of directors of a company. The expenses paid to councillors is usually less than one quarter of 1 per cent of the total budget for the county. It is a miniscule amount, yet the media are forever trying to make a mountain out of a molehill as far as expenses are concerned. If members of the council go on a seminar or to a conference in Ireland, the UK or elsewhere, I say why not? It is no longer a story for the national or local papers. Officials travel to these seminars and there is never a word about it. They are entitled to go, and they are entitled to be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, as local authority members, pride ourselves in spelling out our business to the nation, to the world. We invite the press to our meetings and they report as they like. The local press might find it very hard to fill their columns but for the county councils, urban councils, town commissioners and borough councils. They have given them a lot of stories over the years. Yet, the papers are all too willing to unfairly criticise us when anything goes wrong. Councils and their <Col N="2213" /> business are open and democratic, and long may they be that way. I passionately believe councillors are entitled to expenses but the system should not be abused. If it is abused by a small number of councillors, it is something I would not condone.</P>
    <P>This Bill is phase 1 of an ongoing process. I regret very much that all the other parties did not take part in this exercise. We have been talking about local government reform for so long and they had an opportunity to have an input into this Bill. That they did not do so is regrettable. The Bill will enable the implementation of various reforms on an ongoing basis and it will provide for immediate implementation of some measures. The Bill constitutes the initial legislative segment of the local government reform programme. I look forward to seeing further legislation which will be required to bring it to completion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the idea of reform of local government but I must express regret that the debate on this legislation is a little restricted. This kind of legislation should really have been introduced in this Chamber because it is ideally suited to take a long and steady look at the kind of local administration and local government which would be desirable. Senator Fallon said that he spent 24 odd years a member of a local authority. I served for 34 interesting and fruitful years in seeing the infrastructures and the facilities in my own county built up from the fifties to a few years ago. Unfortunately local authorities have gone sharply into decline because of being starved of cash by the Department of the Environment. This stems from the Fianna Fáil Government election programme in 1977 when as part of stroke politics for the general election that year, they decided to drop the rating system and car taxation without putting anything in their place.</P>

      <P>In retrospect that was a mistake and it gives me no pleasure to <Col N="2214" /> go back to its roots; I hope we will not have a recurrence of that problem because it has been very frustrating. When a member of a local authority makes a representation to the secretary or manager of an engineering department, he or she gets a sterotype reply to the effect that because of cutbacks, finance is not available to provide the service in question or to carry out repairs.</P>
      <P>Does the introduction of this Bill herald an end to that glib answer, the great excuse that local authority officials have used for the past five or six years? Have we come to the end of this charade? Can we administer local services, serve the local communities and build up the infrastructures and the services especially to facilitate the evolvement of industry and commerce? We must do that to survive and to maintain, after 1 January 1993, an atmosphere of open competition.</P>
      <P>I regret that we do not have time to go into detail on this very important legislation, the reform of local government, or perhaps more aptly, local administration, because for a long number of years we have not had genuine local government in the counties. Most of the worthwhile functions and inputs have been hijacked by management and by the administration, which is a pity, because the Minister must surely be aware from his long experience that local knowledge and input are important. I hope that the Minister will provide the necessary facilities for members of local authorities to make a genuine input to infrastructural development in relation to savings and other matters. It is frustrating to be a member of a local authority or any other body and to have a feeling that the time one spends in concentrating on the problems or the development of an area is not appreciated. There must be a response and I hope that there will be greater respect for members of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fallon said he was not in favour of paying members of local authorities and I concur with that view. When I first became a member of Laois County Council in the mid-fifties the travel expenses amounted to 19s 6d per meeting <Col N="2215" /> and after 30 years that has gone up to £21 or £22 for seven hours. It is not over generous, nevertheless a small percentage of the community is prepared to serve. It is quite clear that the central coffers do not have the wherewithal to pay for the services, we must be prepared to share the care. There must be a sufficient number of people within every community prepared to share voluntarily the care, and to have a perception of the kind of society and environment in which we would like to live and to pass their philosopy on to the next generation, which is also important.</P>
    <P>Through this Bill I hope the Minister will spearhead an era as far as local administration is concerned, in which councillors will be expected to have a greater input, in which their local knowledge will be utilised and in which the wishes and the experience of members of local authorities will be utilised so that the councils will be given an opportunity to identify their priorities for development or improvement. The administration now take it on themselves and sometimes reinforce their own views by saying the Department of the Environment insist on A, B and C and that there is no use looking for sanction for a project. That is wrong because individual members opt voluntarily to serve on local authorities as councillors, and their views should be respected; we must accept that since they live in the community they are most sensitive to the demands and the aspirations of that community. We must be conscious of their needs if we are to survive and to progress in an environment which will change next January.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, that there is no section dealing in this comprehensive legislation with the financing of local authorities. Since the change in the financing in 1977 nothing significant has replaced them. We were promised that the service charges which were the main issue in fighting the last local elections would be abolished although in my county they have been increased each year. On the other hand the greatest segment of the population, <Col N="2216" /> in the greater Dublin area, are not asked to pay service charges; there is inequality there.</P>
    <P>The local authority of which I am a member only had sufficient finance last year to build six rural cottages and they are finding it difficult to ensure that roads, particularly county roads, are passable. On the other hand, one gets the impression as they drive through the city and county of Dublin that they have money for everything, including the planting of trees. We cannot afford to buy a shovel of gravel or sand to fill a pothole let alone plant a tree.</P>
    <P>People are not treated equally when finance is being made available. I am also of the view that rural local authorities are being neglected and abandoned. We are not in a position to build houses as the vote for housing has been almost done away with. As I said, we are also finding it difficult to maintain the roads to ensure they are passable. I hope the Minister will give the House an assurance that the cutbacks have come to an end and that we can look forward to making progress from now on.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that under this Bill the Minister would have entrusted greater responsibilities to local authorities. I am of the view that public representatives must be prepared to accept extra powers and responsibilities and, above all else, they must be prepared to say no. That has been one of the deficiencies of the system down through the years.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 4 motions I have only signed four or five such motions in my career in Laois County Council as I do not believe in them. Section 4 motions should only be used to protect the rights of the public and not to give to some individuals an advantage. Legislation should only be introduced for the common good and in a democracy like ours there should be no question of legislating for an individual. Perhaps many cogent arguments could be made against that view but that is a view I have held for many years. This problem needs to be addressed and we should consider introducing a system to ensure that <Col N="2217" /> members of local authorities who are voluntary agents, are not subjected to pressure from individual or small sections of the community. Local government of necessity must work to the benefit of the population as a whole.</P>
    <P>With regard to the travelling community, we should compliment the Department of the Environment who have made available more money than was called down by any local council for the provision of halting sites and housing. It is a scandal and a matter of regret that there are still over 1,100 travelling families living on the side of the road. I support the provision of halting sites as a first step in moving travelling families towards normal housing. That was a good policy decision. Some people who mean well have adopted an xenophobic attitude and do not want itinerant encampments, halting sites or hard stands near their homes. There is a need to educate people and, as a Christian society, we should tackle this problem and try to resolve it once and for all.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to the plan for social housing which I welcome and note that the local authorities will have an input. I had the pleasure of listening to the Minister when he launched the scheme some months ago. As a person who has devoted considerable time to this issue, I have one reservation. The Department have increased the limit from £20,000 to £22,000 this year, even though I had expected them to increase it to £22,500 last year. The problem, however, is that it costs in excess of £32,500, excluding the cost of the site, to provide a house. Some years ago it would have been quite easy to raise 10 per cent or 20 per cent of the cost of a project such as this but voluntary fund raisers are now finding it extremely difficult to compete with the national lottery, the National Rehabilitation Board and some of the other better and well organised fund raisers.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister bears this in mind when preparing the Estimates because some of the health boards are not in a position to offer capitation grants. It is unfair, therefore, to expect voluntary <Col N="2218" /> organisations to collect substantial sums of money to cover the acquisition costs as well as the cost of maintenance work on an ongoing basis. There is a duty on every person who claims to be Irish and Christian to share the burden.</P>
    <P>I subscribe to the Minister's policy on voluntary housing, but with one reservation. Leaving housing for the disadvantaged or disabled aside, it is going too far to expect the local community to raise funds for ordinary housing. I think the Minister is being too optimistic and believe that we will find it very difficult to provide adequate housing if we have to depend on voluntary bodies to raise finance. There is an increasing demand for housing. As I said, unfortunately, we had only sufficient funding to build six rural cottages last year. Furthermore, due to the cutbacks the number of our road staff has been reduced from 300 to fewer than 100.</P>
    <P>Section 5 contains some reforms but I hope the Minister will explain the principle on which the section is based. Can we expect to receive extra funds to carry out the activities envisaged? Subsection (2) (c) states that local authorities may &ldquo;promote, organise or assist the carrying out of research, surveys or studies with respect to the local community&rdquo; to seek to promote, organise or assist in carrying out research, surveys or studies with respect to the local community.</P>
    <P>Last year we had a problem with a dump. In our estimates for the previous year we provided about £7,000 for surveys and consultants' fees. At the end of the year the council had spent over £100,000 on consultants' fees on this one problem; and it was not solved. I would like to ask the Minister if there will be an extra allocation to implement the very desirable projects a local authority could do, on the advice of an active and imaginative development officer within the scope of sections 5 and 6. Will there be a special allocation to facilitate that, or is it just an enabling provision for local authorities to follow up themselves?</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister a question in relation to section 40. We have <Col N="2219" /> set up an <i>ad hoc</i> committee with members from counties Kilkenny, Carlow and Laois to deal specifically with mining. We have never discussed anything other than coal mining and trying to revive the coal mining industry. Nevertheless there is scope for greater expansion. From reading this Bill it would appear that the Minister envisages only two authorities cooperating, perhaps an urban council and a county council in the same administrative area. The occasional large development and complicated planning application call for the professional and scientific expertise that one would not need to have readily available on a county council. From that point of view, it would be of tremendous advantage to have an arrangement to co-operate. I compliment the Minister on section 40. I do not know what exactly the Minister envisages. I am not altogether in support of regionalisation. I do not think regional bodies are doing anything that the ordinary councils are not capable of doing. In my experience the nearer the ordinary individual is to the decision makers the better chance he has of getting a good hearing. For many years we have had joint burial boards, joint drainage boards and the mining committee. Can we now set up permanent boards? The existing boards, I presume, will stay but can we set up a board specifically to deal with mining and planning applications, and what great effect will it have on the administration? I must admit there has always been very close co-operation on the committee between councillors and the management especially where there are joint problems. Will the Minister deal with that issue in his reply?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister propose to issue the regulations or will it be necessary for a council to ask that regulations be issued to enable them proceed under some of those sections? What will be the <i>modus operandi</i>?</P>
    <P>I am in favour of section 42. It would appear the Minister is going to set the scale of remuneration for the council chairman or the mayors. That may not be a bad thing but again, I do not see <Col N="2220" /> autonomy being devolved to the local authorities because they must act under ministerial directions. According to section 51 (6), the Minister will publish the travelling expenses of members.</P>

      <P>I am glad of that. I do not think it is of great interest other than the press are inclined to describe our attendance at public conferences as junkets. There should be greater participation by local authority members. I would like local authority members divided into subcommittees and members concentrating on specialising on particular sectors of administration. It is always useful to look over the hedge into the neighbouring county and see how the administration are dealing with such mundane problems as the management and control of central dumps. There is always a difference between the administration and management of one place and another. It is good to be able to pick up a good idea and pass it on.</P>
      <P>Since the last local government Bill we have seen the demise of the county committees of agriculture, the General Council of Committees of Agriculture and, indeed, the demise of the county health advisory committees. They were a loss. We need a very active local administrative structure if counties are to progress and maintain the services for the people in their area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is something like the curate's egg; good and bad. There are points in the Bill that I am not clear about perhaps because I have not had the opportunity of hearing the Minister's explanation. I look forward to hearing his reply on Committee Stage. In my experience what was most in need of reform and improvement from a local democratic point of view has in the main not been tackled. That is a great pity. Local democracy is a delicate <Col N="2221" /> flower; we need to work to ensure it continues to serve the public and the country. There is much in the Bill I hope we will be able to put to good use. The main need of local administration at present is greater financial resources and councillors need to take greater responsibility not just to raise the finance but to spend. If we expect to have the power to spend the money, we must have an input on how to raise the money as well.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill. We have been talking about the need for reform of local government for more than 20 years. However, all we did was talk. Questions were asked at every council meeting about what the Minister was doing in regard to local government reform. In <Col N="2223" /> fairness to the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, when he undertakes to do something he does it, he does not just talk about doing something. As we know, action speaks louder than words. Many people complained about the speedy and efficient way he brought this comprehensive Bill before us. These people are all talk but they do not put forward any proposals. They are like the fellow in the old saying who sheared the pig &mdash; when he finished there was a lot of squealing but no wool. This is what the Opposition have been doing.</P>
    <P>Local democracy has its roots in the local government system. We must have an effective and strong system of local government if local democracy is to flourish. Our present system of local government is outdated and out of tune with modern requirements. This system which was put in place almost 100 years ago, with piecemeal running repairs since, needs a major overhaul, which is what is proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have made local government work in council chambers are under no illusion about the extent of the overhaul needed. Some people with a rather superficial knowledge of the subject have condemned the Bill. They argue that total and comprehensive reform should be introduced in one fell swoop. That would be a major mistake and would mean that we would have to wait for years until the perfect formula was constructed. In reality, this would be a recipe for doing nothing. It is much better to tackle this mammoth task piece by piece. By adopting this pragmatic approach we can build a new system of local government. There is a precedent for adopting such an approach. In 1963 a major piece of pioneering legislation on planning was enacted. It was recognised at the time that amendments would be necessary in the light of experience. However, it is a matter of satisfaction that 30 years later most of that legislation has stood the test of time. As the need arose, that legislation has been amended. If the Government decided in 1963 to wait for all the perfect solutions to planning we would <Col N="2224" /> probably still be waiting in 1991 for planning legislation. Consequently, I support the decision to start now on the rebuilding process of the reform of local government.</P>
    <P>Much reference has been made to finances. This seems to be the issue which is bandied about most. I should like to remind those who complain about the payment of local charges that if we had rates today the average charge per household would be between £800 and £1,000. Yet some people are refusing to pay £30 or £40 per year for a water system, refuse collection service or sewerage system. What would such people do if they had to pay £800 or £1,000 in rates? They should be realistic. The people who are shouting loudest about how local authorities lost their powers when the rates were removed are the very people who refused to put an additional two old pennies in the pound on the rates to help run their counties. It is ridiculous for local authorities to say they want power back and how they should be allowed to raise finances locally when they refuse to impose such charges.</P>
    <P>I was a member of a committee which dealt with local government reform and I am pleased that many of the proposals contained in our submission are reflected in the Bill. I welcome in particular the introduction of the principle of general competence, as the old <i>ultra vires</i> rule was too often a barrier to initiative. I remember a case which involved local councillors who decided they should have their own headed notepaper. The local government auditor asked them which rule gave them the authority to do this. Three months of official time was wasted by councillors going through the Acts and regulations to see if they had the authority to do this because of the threat of a surcharge over a few sheets of notepaper. As far as I know, it was the sensible Minister of the day who put paid to this argument. The stupidity of the rule can be seen from this case where a few sheets of notepaper could not be given to county councillors because it was not provided for in the Act. This new competence provision will enable councillors <Col N="2225" /> to do the things they believe should be done without having to look over their shoulders or worry if a surcharge will be imposed on them or the local government auditor will haul them over the coals for it, thus wasting more time.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in Part IV which will put committees of local authorities on a more formal basis. Those of us who operate the committee system appreciate the fruitful and constructive work which can be achieved by such a system. Under the old <i>ultra vires</i> rule, questions were raised about the general purposes meetings held by councils. As we all know, much beneficial work is done at committee meetings. Since my council set up a committee system we rarely have to attend a public meeting after 1 p.m. any day as all the nitty gritty points we cannot raise at council meetings are thrashed out in confidence at committee meetings. We can get answers from the officials and so get on with the work. This provision will enable us to continue this system without any doubts or worries.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the highly publicised section 4 motions which affect planning control. Despite all the controversy about these motions, the vast majority of councils used their power and discretion in a responsible manner. In some cases differences arose between the elected members on the one hand and the county manager and his staff on the other. However, I am glad to be able to say that decisions made by the county manager did not give rise to any rancour or problems &mdash; we respected each other's powers and views. In Sligo we had a very good system for dealing with section 4 motions long before the Bill was thought of. We had a planning committee at which we discussed planning matters. If there was a problem all the members went out to inspect the site and if there was a unanimous decision that planning permission should be granted, it was not brought up at the meeting. If the manager said he could not agree, then a section 4 motion was put in. If it was a Fianna Fáil man who was interested in getting the planning permission, a Fine Gael member <Col N="2226" /> had to second it and vice versa. There had to be an across-the-board vote. We did allow people to rescind the decision but if there were votes against it, then that was it.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with the Bill. I am pleased also with the section dealing with chairmens' expenses.</P>

      <P>Chairmen of county councils know that when we did go abroad to meet our emigrants and so on, one had to pay for presents and so on out of one's pocket. One had to make the presentation on behalf of one's county, but the county council had nothing to do with it. At least now when a chairman is going abroad he can draw from a fund and bring something with him so that he can represent his county in a proper and fitting manner.</P>
      <P>There is one category I would like to see included for housing, namely, the alcoholics in our society. There are many alcoholics in the 45 to 60 age bracket and they want to apply for ordinary housing but they are unable to do so. I am a nondrinker but I work with these people; they are dear to my heart and I try to help them as much as I can. Many of them live alone and we find it very hard to house them. While we do give them demountable houses and so on it is not the answer. The answer is four concrete walls and a roof over their heads. I know it is something that is dear to the Minister's own heart, too, that nobody would be badly housed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the housing scheme he introduced a while ago. I took a long walk around Cabra the other evening and I was amazed at the way housing has improved since people have bought their own houses. One can see aluminium windows, painted doors, well-kept lawns and so on. Out of about <Col N="2227" /> 48 houses which I passed, there was only one lawn with was not well maintained. All the others were beautifully landscaped. That was not the case a few years ago. I see the same in my own town. The Minister will be remembered as the man who gave people their own homes and he will be remembered for this Bill. It is important legislation. For the first time in many years the Minister is addressing the problem and I know the local authorities will be given the powers they deserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In deference to the fact that this Bill principally affects and is of interest to other Members who wish to have as much time as possible, I will speak very briefly. The Minister will be aware that most of the arguments have already been made in the other Houses and also last night and today in this House.</P>
      <P>I would like to say, in preface, that some extreme views have been taken of this Bill which I do not share. I found it slightly disillusioning to listen to the wireless and hear people who had apparently not made themselves fully acquainted with what the legislation contained making some comments I would regard as a little injudicious. However, I will leave it to more competent people to deal with that because it is important that we get on. I have a couple of amendments down and I hope to be here this afternoon to move them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to address a couple of points. One is the matter of section 4 planning permissions, which I believe are a scandal. I have always believed that. Even if there is only a very small number, the circumstances in which they are moved often give very serious cause for concern. I am embarrassed that so many of them relate to my own area of Dublin. It is a shame. This morning there is a story in <i>The Irish Times.</i> It may not directly apply to section 4 but it is a major rezoning which appears to be irresponsible in terms of the planning impact on the area of Tallaght. I am concerned <Col N="2228" /> about section 4 motions. There are abuses inside councils.</P>
    <P>However, I also have to say that local democracy is extremely important and if the country is to function properly there must be as much authority devolved to local people as possible. It is a very important element in our democracy and must be treated as such. For that reason I am a little concerned about the preponderance of people who are Members of the Oireachtas and local authorities. I say this &mdash; and I will be honest about it &mdash; because I did consider running in one of the Dublin electoral districts. I was approached by a group of people who suggested I would be a good councillor. The issues are ones that are very close to my heart, issues of planning. One can also tackle things such as drug abuse, the preservation of part of our heritage, the motorway proposals which I have opposed in many instances and so on. I thought about it very carefully and I had very good backing. I found it a very attractive proposal. However, on reflection, I believe I have more than sufficient to do by being a lecturer in the University of Dublin and also being a Member of this House, and my first responsibility and my first loyalty is to this House. I came to the conclusion I could not possibly honourably occupy the two positions.</P>
    <P>I am speaking for myself. I do not wish to make comments on other individual cases but it was my conclusion that it would be dishonourable for me to seek election, particularly if I had a good chance of getting in and squeezing out somebody who is occupying himself or herself only at local government level. This is particularly true if somebody is a Member of the Oireachtas and is a member of a local authority in the deep south, or in the far west or in the north of the country, because the travelling involved must be quite a taxing burden on people. I would have to point out that on occasions the business of the House clearly must be affected. For example, we never meet on Mondays, and that is because county council meetings take place on Mondays. It is a pity that the <Col N="2229" /> local tail should wag the dog of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I would have to say honestly I am not completely pure in this regard. I did consider running for a seat. I considered it actively and I think it is a good thing that people who have something to give to their local community should give it through the local authority. One of the other deciding factors was that when my group of advisers looked at the constituencies I would be likely to take they suggested to me that the one in which I live would be less likely to return me than the one in which I was brought up &mdash; Dublin 1 as against Dublin 4. That also caused me to hesitate because I think it is important that as far as possible people should reflect local interests with which they are familiar.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong of me to absorb any more time of the House. I know there are other people who wish to come in who are members of local authorities and will be seeking election this time. Therefore, I will reserve further comments to the general progress of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Sitting here listening to some of the debate this morning, I wondered if I had read the same Bill as these other Members have read.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House, as I see the Bill as giving more power to the Minister, but I do not mean that in a complimentary way. I am amazed at some of the contributions from the Fianna Fáil side of the House particularly. I wonder if some of the people on this side of the House read the Bill. As a serving member of the General Council of County Councils I must been listening to Fianna Fáil councillors over the years calling for reorganisation of local government to give them more power. I cannot find that in this Bill. It is less power for the local authorities and the councillors and more power to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal with the Dublin scene. We have three district committees and the Minister proposes that we will have three committee districts. He is playing around with words. We have Fingal District Committee &mdash; and he now <Col N="2230" /> proposes to call it Fingal Committee District. I do not know what change that is going to bring about. However, he proposes to give a manager to that committee area and the other two. It is not very clear what powers that manager will have but the amount of work he will be able to do is very clear because there is no provision for funding, good, bad or indifferent in the Bill. The Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown local authority area have their own premises but the Bill makes no provision for premises for the Fingal Committee District or the South Dublin Committee District. There is no provision in the Bill to provide them with funding even to set up the committees. I remind the Minister that in 1953, when he may not have been interested in politics, the boundaries in Dublin were changed, causing absolute havoc at official level and it took years to sort that out. I cannot see the changes proposed in this Bill being made in my time because no time is specified and little or no provision is made for its achievement.</P>
    <P>As far as the entire Dublin area is concerned this Bill is a charade, something that obviously was prompted for political reasons and for reasons of power. I am of the opinion that Fianna Fáil did not want a local election this year. The Minister can still postpone the elections for the year. He has that power and I urge him to use it, then to sit down and have a reasonable look at what he is proposing here and come up with a Bill which will provide for worthwhile reorganisation of local authorities throughout the country, particularly in the Dublin area which seems to be the Cinderella of the Department of the Environment. I do not think any Minister for the Environment &mdash; or Local Government in the past &mdash; unless he was a Dublin man understood the Dublin scene, and the present Minister certainly does not understand. With all due respect to him, he may know the west like the back of his hand, but when it comes to Dublin he is creating havoc. Since he has not yet made an order to hold the local elections on 27 June &mdash; he simply announced the date &mdash; he has the power to postpone <Col N="2231" /> them. I would not be surprised if many of the people now contemplating seeking election were to withdraw. If they read this Bill they will not be as enthusiastic as they may have been.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Be that as it may, I would seriously put it to the Minister that he should consider postponing the elections for a further year since he has that power. I cannot see how these three committee districts are to be set up with a county manager who has little or no power to do anything. The great problem in County Dublin is not that we needed a manager, we have three assistant managers operating in the county at the moment. We have one with general responsibility of running the county &mdash; his title is assistant city and county manager who must refer to the city and county manager, and as I read this Bill, that office will continue. There will be three county managers and whether they are called county managers or, as of now, assistant city and county managers makes no difference. They will still have to refer to the city and county manager. I have not read any change in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see the city and county manager as <Col N="2232" /> the overall head in the Dublin area and he will have assistant city and county managers. At the moment he has six: one was recently appointed to fill the vacancy in Dún Laoghaire and we have one in the county and the others have responsibility in planning, housing and so on. There is little change there. I would see this as a change for the worse. At the moment at least we are getting some things done but the picture is not so rosy in the county, as Councillor McDonald said.</P>
    <P>We have planted about 400 trees in County Dublin in the last three years but we felled many thousands of trees in the same period. The county is being &ldquo;detreed&rdquo; which is a great pity and we do not have the money to provide replacements. This is a very sensitive area for me because I am very concerned at the loss of trees in the county. When we held the Presidency of the EC we made great play of being a green Presidency. Had reference been made to what is happening in County Dublin I do not think we would have been so vociferous.</P>
    <P>The three proposed committee districts if set up will be at a disadvantage compared with the committees operating now. What is in existence at present should be allowed to stand until something better can be put in place.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the interim arrangement &mdash; as it has been called &mdash; will operate because as of now we will be electing now members to Dublin County Council on 27 June. According to the Minister, the committees may be set up as soon as possible. &ldquo;As soon as possible&rdquo; means following consultation with unions, having consulted officials, when you have found a premises and a means of funding. Otherwise, what is the point in setting up committee districts if these things cannot be achieved? I appeal to the Minister to put his hand on his heart and have a serious look at the Dublin scene.</P>

      <P>The Minister should have a second look at the Bill and see what mess he will leave behind in the Dublin county area. The extraordinary thing about this Bill is that the city is being left alone. This Bill talks about the reorganisation of local government but the reorganisation that is taking place will be in the county not in the city.</P>
      <P>There is absolutely no mention of funding in the Bill, no mention of how local authorities are to be funded. In relation to funding, I want to give the Minister a few figures I came across recently in the county area. Small businesses and commercial firms in the county are now being squeezed out of business simply because the Dublin County Council do not have the necessary funding from central Government. We have a situation in the county where the Government have given permission to the valuation office to revalue premises on an annual basis. This very week, premises in my area are being revalued for the second time in three years.</P>

      <P>I spoke this morning to a gentleman who operates a small family business. His rates this year are £1,700; next year he will be required to pay £2,800. I do not know what percentage <Col N="2234" /> increase that is but it is an increase of £1,100. That is not the largest increase, some rates have been increased by 400 per cent. I have a list here showing details of rates in one small town in my area. I will give it to the Minister and I will put on the record of the House some of the figures we are talking about. Many of these premises had been valued upwards three years ago and are now being revalued for the second time. The sum for one small premises valued three years ago at £32 will now be increased to £65. Another premises which was valued at £40 three years ago will be increased to £120. A further premises which was valued at £44 is now being increased to £120. If Senator Honan had those increases in Clare she would be complaining. I am now aware of people in Dublin county who have been put of business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate in the £ has been increased this year by 3 per cent but to these people the increase is 90 per cent. Is there any justification for that increase? If some of these businessmen were to take this to the courts, the Government would have a problem on their hands. The sooner it is done the better. The Minister in this House last week gave us a long list of his achievements in his four or four and a half years in office. One of those boasts was that he designated an area in Tallaght to be tax free and this resulted in the building of the Tallaght Town Centre. That is true. He should cross the main street of Tallaght where the dividing line is and see what he has done to the small businesses there where a number of them have now closed down.</P>

      <P>There is one other point I would like to deal with which may not be as hard on the Minister as the last few points. This point has been referred to by a number of speakers, not least by the last speaker, and that is the exclusion of Ministers and Ministers of State from local authorities. I would not be as hard on that rule as the Minister or many colleagues. A valuable contribution can be made by Ministers of State. It may not be appropriate for Ministers to sit on local authorities but they should not be excluded on the day they are selected to <Col N="2236" /> be a Minister because that Government may not last too long.</P>

      <P>The part of the county which that person represents could be denied a good public representative who would not have a part to play if his Government for example, as in the case of the 1981 Government &mdash; lasted for only a brief period. I would ask the Minister to consider allowing a period of, say, six or 12 months to remain on the local authority but not necessarily to attend meetings. Ministers of State should be allowed to remain on local authorities if they so wish; in other words, leave the <i>status quo</i> until a better way is found. My experience is that Ministers of State have a knowledge of what is happening in Government and can make an even more valuable contribution to the local authority than those of us who have never been Ministers or may never be Ministers. On the other hand, it should be a requirement for a Minister to have served on a local authority. That is more important. Many Ministers have never come through the system of politics, in other words they have never served their time in the real politics of this country. Local government should be close to the people, but this Bill does not provide for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is a necessary Bill which lays the foundation for orderly and very much needed development on local authorities. There is an old saying, Members are familiar with, that all politics are local politics. At last we have a Minister prepared to put through a Bill which was very much overdue. Those of us who were elected six years ago to Dublin County Council were told it would be temporary and that we would be sitting on more than one body within six months. Six years later we are still in this interim position. That is a scandal. I am very glad we have a Minister who is prepared to deal with the matter rather than just turn a blind eye to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2237" /> Much of this Bill relates to Dublin County Council. Provisions relating to that body take up almost 25 per cent of the Bill. The Bill is all important because it lays the foundation for the development of local involvement on local authorities. It puts local involvement on a better basis than existed hitherto and leaves the way open for further developments over the coming years. It has sorted out what was very much an inappropriate, complex, difficult, out-of-date series of arrangements. It is a very welcome and necessary Bill.</P>
    <P>There is always conflict between central authority and local control. A lot of lip service has been paid in the past to local involvement. It should be possible under the Bill to much more clearly define the powers of local authorities. Those powers are far greater than some of us on local authorities fully realise. One of the great things the Minister has done is to alter the position as regards <i>ultra vires.</i> That is an absolutely crucial change if there is to be any serious development of local authorities. On that basis alone this Bill justifies its existence.</P>
    <P>I agree with my colleague, Senator Honan, and also with Senator McMahon, in relation to service on local authorities. It would be a sad day if Ministers, Ministers of State and others were appointed to such office without having served some time on a local authority. I say that as a person who was elected to the Seanad without having served on a local authority. I thought I knew a little about grassroots politics, the importance of local issues and the basic fundamentals of politics but the reality is that I knew nothing. It is only when I was elected to a local authority that I began to learn. That is where it all really begins.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree totally with Senator Norris' remarks. It can be very important for a Deputy or a Senator to be a member of a local authority. We talk much about keeping in touch with the people, and the best possible way to do this is to become involved in local government. One is much closer to the people than when one is sitting in either the Dáil or the Seanad. A Minister who has been through the mill of serving on a local authority and dealing with all the crucial issues affecting people is likely to be a better Minister than one who just reads about their proceedings. Effectively one might as well be reading out of a text book. I note with some concern the suggestion that Ministers, and Ministers of State, should not be members of local authorities. It would be a pity if that was the case and I am glad the Minister resisted the temptation to suggest that either Senators or Deputies should not be members of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of criticism, or implied criticism, particularly of Dublin County Council, on the question of section 4 motions. I serve on Dún Laoghaire Corporation and also on Dublin County Council. We are in a fortunate position in some ways in Dún Laoghaire Corporation in that our area is basically a settled, residential one, it is long established. We have introduced only about three section 4 motions in the six years that I have served on Dún Laoghaire Corporation. Had I served on that corporation only I too might have found it easy to criticise Dublin County Council for the number of section 4 motions introduced there, which often run into double figures at any one meeting. Having also served on Dublin County Council &mdash; my name was attached to very few, if any, section 4 motions on the council &mdash; I have great sympathy with my colleagues from the western and northern parts of County Dublin in <Col N="2239" /> relation to section 4 motions. Because this is an area that is so rapidly evolving it is very hard when drawing up development plans to keep up with the realities on the ground. Let us cast our minds back to six years ago when we talked about new satellite towns. There has been a total population change and many other changes since. The Minister has done the right thing in deciding on the one hand to retain the section 4 motions and, on the other hand, to ensure that the decision should be by a large majority of all the members of the council. That is an excellent move and I congratulate the Minister on having the courage and the wisdom to proceed on that basis.</P>
    <P>I am slightly concerned about the figures for the actual district electoral area because &mdash; I hope this will not happen &mdash; a good deal of pressure could be put on the individual councillors in a local area, even though, for the overall good of the country, a measure might be necessary. Let us hope that does not happen. I am a little concerned about the constant propaganda against section 4 motions. It has been a little over done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">

      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very true and we should not forget that. In my closing minutes I will deal with Dublin. I share some of the concerns which Senator McMahon expressed but I would take a different view. He has said that there might not be candidates because of the present situation. I was elected on the basis that I would serve either on Dublin County Council or on Dún Laoghaire Corporation, that I would not serve on both with duplicating meetings. As <Col N="2240" /> Senator McMahon knows, an enormous number of meetings of Dublin County Council duplicate with those of Dún Laoghaire Corporation. One of my colleagues worked it out at an average of 37 hours of meetings per week, which is totally unheard of on most councils. If I thought that problem was going to continue for a further five, six or seven years, I would find it very difficult to go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis has been laid by which the Minister will at long last be able to sort out the problems of Dublin County Council by dividing it, as it should be divided, into a north council, a west council and a council based in Dún Laoghaire. Until that is done the state of affairs in Dublin County Council really verges on scandal. I am glad the Minister has been prepared to face up to that position and deal with it. I look forward to the setting up of three efficient, effective and sensible councils based on the north of the city, the west and Dún Laoghaire. It is high time that was done and it is very necessary.</P>
      <P>I would also agree with Senator McMahon's point in relation to Dublin city and county. It is high time that relationship was appropriately altered. In this Bill the opportunity is there for the Minister to alter it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), line 10, after &ldquo;Government&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(Enabling Provisions)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the intention and the functions of this Bill. If it is accepted, section 1 (1) would read: &ldquo;This Act may be cited as the Local Government (Enabling Provision) Act, 1991&rdquo;. We do not want the public to get the wrong impression, that this Bill is the totality of Government reorganisation in this area. The Minister stated that this is only part of the overall intent which includes financial provisions and a reorganisation of local authority structures which will come about in subsequent legislation so it is, effectively, an enabling provision. Because of the absence, particularly of funding, it is only a framework or a formulation and I should like in this amendment to emphasise that point so that it clarifies, defines and specifies more clearly the intention of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The words proposed for addition to the Long Title and Short Title are unnecessary. This is a Local Government Bill. There have been well over 20 Local Government Acts and the Long Title &ldquo;an Act to amend and extend the law relating to local government&rdquo; describes what this Bill does. I hope the Senator will not press the point because it is not a substantial one. Considerable time has already been spent in the other House dealing with this matter and it was agreed there that it was not a substantial one.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains provisions which are not enabling ones and which have effect directly on the Act, the Short Title is meant to be exactly as it is, short; introducing the words &ldquo;enabling provisions&rdquo; would be a misnomer. It also begs the question why other descriptions should not be added. This is an enabling Bill and confers certain other matters which would require the Title to be as it is now stated. It is totally adequate, and proper and should be agreed by all.</P>

      <P>Further to the Minister's reply to Senator Costello, is it a correct interpretation that the Minister will be in a position to accept some of the amendments tabled this afternoon? There would appear to be logistical difficulties about this if the President must sign this Bill into law before 22 May &mdash; in other words by this weekend &mdash; because any amendments accepted here would mean the Bill going back to the Dáil. Logistically I am not sure how that can fit in. Perhaps the Minister could just expand whether &mdash; apart from amendment No. 1 which we are not supporting &mdash; the principle of amendments is acceptable to him and whether he is in a position to take amendments from this House?</P>

      <P>It is worth pointing out at this stage that a time allocation motion has been agreed to by the House. This means that the Bill must be passed by the House by 8 p.m. this evening.

I am anxious that the House is not abused in any way and that our constitutional role is fully respected. I do not think the Minister is in a position to accept any amendment. You rightly spoke about the need not to waste time but most of us in the House could find better things to do this afternoon. We do not want to act as a rubber stamp no matter how good legislation is. We have been charged with the responsibility under the Constitution to tease it out properly. It is a matter of regret that this House has been brought into disrepute through the use of these tactics.</P>

      <P>The House has not been brought into disrepute. The Minister is not responsible for the decision taken by the House yesterday. The House decided to agree to a particular time allocation motion. It is the House which made the decision. Consequently, the House is responsible for its own actions and that decision must now govern the way in which we do our business for the rest of the day. Let me add further that it is a serious breach of Standing Order of the House to engage in further discussion on the time allocation motion which has been decided upon by <Col N="2245" /> the House. That is what we are doing in effect.</P>

      <P>In page 6, subsection (10), line 6, after &ldquo;days&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(being a day or days not later than twelve months from the date of its enactment)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an important amendment. As it stands, no time provision is included in the Bill for its implementation. It is a serious matter that legislation can be brought into existence without anyone knowing when it will be implemented. Like so many other provisions in the legislation, it will be left to the discretion of the Minister to decide, as he thinks best, when the Bill should come into effect. Section 1 (10) states:</P>
      <P>This Act shall come into operation on such day or days as, by order or orders made by the Minister, may be fixed therefore either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision ...</P>
      <P>This means that certain sections can be implemented without the Bill being implemented in its entirity. No definite timescale is given in the Bill for its implementation. I do not think we should pass legislation without questioning this aspect and ensuring that a defined and determined date is fixed for its implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. The Bill is inadequate and insufficient to meet the needs of local democracy. The implementation date <Col N="2252" /> must be outlined more clearly than it is in section 1 (10). This section needs to be strengthened and I fully support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support Senator Costello's amendment. We have spoken at length on our reservations about the Bill. While some sections of the Bill may be acceptable to us, a timescale should be fixed for its implementation. As we have seen in the case of the Environmental Agency Bill, this Bill and other Bills there seems to be an open ended timescale in regard to their implementation. The Minister should give us a fixed date for the implementation of the Bill. He did not have an opportunity to reply to the points raised by Senators on Second Stage and I ask him to now outline the timescale envisaged for the implementation of the Bill which he will be able to stand over so that those of us who are members of local authorities will know the exact position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support the amendment. It is a reasonable amendment and will not tie up the Minister too greatly. I do not think the words &ldquo;being a day or days not later than twelve months from the date of its enactment&rdquo; would place any great restraint on the Minister. It seems absurd that this Bill is being put through both Houses, particularly the Seanad at such a rapid pace with the clear purpose of enabling the local elections to take place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was simply pointing out that there is a paradox between the sense of urgency on the one hand it is obvious that the Bill has to go through &mdash; and the fact that there is no time limit on the other hand. I should like to place on the record that there is a clear absurdity here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The absurdity would be to allow this amendment to stand. The amendment is unnecessary and would have certain undesirable consequences for the simple reason that if a provision was not commenced with within the timescale suggested in the amendment, it could never commence. It is my intention to move as quickly as possible in regard to many matters immediately after the enactment of the Bill. That would be the case in many areas. There are some specific items that might not be available to be dealt with within the time frame suggested. I would hope to go ahead with electoral matters in Part III.</P>
      <P>In relation to Dublin reorganisation, Part IV, as many as possible of the general provisions will be brought into operation on the commencement of the term of office of the new county councils. There may be some outstanding items because of problems that might arise that would need further consideration. It would be absurd to tie one's hand specifically to one date and then perhaps not be able to bring in the provisions outlined in the Bill which would be of benefit to everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A group will look at some of the changes in the reserved functions. It would be the intention of the legislation to transfer new powers on a continuing basis but that will take some years. There will be a committee sitting to deal with reserved functions. They will have to be teased out and this may run over the commencement date suggested in the amendment. It would be an absurdity <Col N="2254" /> then because one would be taking a decision to negative the good of this legislation. I ask that this amendment be abandoned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>No, we cannot abandon this amendment. It is too important. The point is well made that there has been an inordinate urgency about compelling us to sit here last night until midnight and then putting a time limit on the discussions today. We cannot even get an answer as to whether there are any arrangements made for any amendment if it was passed here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking an explanation as to why we have no terminal date for the implementation of this Bill and at the same time there is a mad rush to ensure that it goes through without giving us the opportunity to properly discuss it. For that reason we have no choice but to press the amendment. It is not sufficient for the Minister to say it will be done as quickly as possible. &ldquo;As quickly as possible&rdquo; and &ldquo;as soon as is practicable&rdquo; are hoary old chestnuts. This is not good enough for a House that is legislating. Legislating means putting through legislation that will be implemented. What is the sense in saying that there is a wide range of areas in the Bill but the Minister does not say when they might be implemented? Why should we have to rush this legislation? What we want is practical, concise legislation and a time scale that is determined. Otherwise we are wasting our time.</P>

      <P>The Senator misses a very fundamental point. That is just a first piece of legislation in a programme of legislation that will be necessary to reform local government. If I was to concede the point the Senator is making we would be working against the interests of local communities and local authority members. For example, committees have been a standard part of local government for many years and we are giving them a statutory basis in this legislation. Subject <Col N="2255" /> to the decision of local authorities, certain committees may not need to be established for up to two years. To deny the right for anything to happen after a 12 month period is anti-reformist.</P>

      <P>On the surface at least the Minister made some reasonable points, in that this is a major reorganisation of local government and there may be a need for further discussion. That is a reasonable point for the Minister to make. On the other hand it is possible that there could be an election within the next year. It is highly likely one will take place within two years or so. Depending on the time scale I would assume that if only certain sections of the Bill are operational by the time of an election, the remaining sections would lapse.</P>

      <P>I see the Minister is shaking his head. I have to accept what he says but I would have assumed that that would be the case. It would certainly pass into a kind of legislative limbo. There is no doubt about that. Presumably an incoming Minister would have the opportunity to tinker with the legislation in whatever way he or she wished.</P>
      <P>The Minister says he is not convinced of the appropriateness or value of this amendment. If he were convinced of the appropriateness of any one of the 143 amendments, would he envisage being in a position to accept such an amendment because of the technical difficulties, for example, of recalling the Dáil? I know there is a terminal date. I am not being argumentative in saying that, but I wonder if there is much point in urging the acceptance of amendments, with whatever force of argument we can, if, for technical reasons, it is highly unlikely or virtually impossible that any of them will be accepted.</P>

It is not a matter for us to consider now.</P>
      <P>I would point out to Senator Norris that legislation does not discontinue just because a Government falls unless it is repealed or otherwise interfered with by legislation. All the provisions of this Act will have an ongoing implementation; some of them will be implemented immediately after the enactment. With regard to the question about the postponement of sub-county structural elections, obviously that is going to have to take place immediately. Then there is the creation of the new councils in the Dublin area which I would like to see expedited immediately after the local elections and which the Senator has been supportive of. There are other elements of the legislation which will continue on an ongoing basis for the benefit of the local authorities they propose to serve. To do anything to negative the possibility of the Minister applying this in an ongoing way would be to act in an anti-reformist way.</P>

It is not a bar on any further enabling legislation in relation to committees and so on. Following on what Senator Norris said in relation to the question of amendments, the Minister was being mischievous, if not misleading, in indicating that he did not know what amendments might or might not be accepted.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has said confirms that what I was seeking to do in the first amendment, that is to describe the Bill as an enabling provision, is right. All the Minister has described are things that may be enabled to take place depending on an order made by the Minister at some time in the future. It is insubstantial. The Minister can now give us a good indication of his intent to accept amendments because I intend to press this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make one response to that because I think it should be put on the record. To seek to confine the implementation of the provisions of this legislation to a specific period of time, whether a month, week or year, is to negative the whole thrust of the reform elements of the legislation, and that is what is being contemplated here now. It is not true to say that this is just enabling legislation. Even the most casual perusal of the Bill by the Senator would have shown that. The questions on the changes in section 4 alone prove the point.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;local community&rsquo; means all persons normally resident in the functional area of a local authority;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to define &ldquo;local community&rdquo;. Specific reference is made to the local community in Part II which deals with the functions of local authorities. A local authority may represent the interests of the local community and there are many ways in which this may take place. It is important that we know precisely how a local community will be defined. In the definitions section no interpretation is given of the local community. This amendment is necessary because it determines how the local authority should relate to the local community and the parameters of the local community. I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>With respect to Senator Costello, this is the most daft amendment ever put down on paper in this House. I am amazed at Senator J. Ryan who had many years of service in local government as he certainly knows what local communities mean. Why does Senator Costello want a definition of local community, the people in the area, in the Bill? If the Senator is elected to a local authority he will then know what the local community means.</P>

      <P>This legislation is for those of us who have not hitherto served on a local authority and for the ordinary public. Let us not think we are the only people who participate and have to understand this legislation. The local authority may represent the interests of the local community. The local community could be defined as less than the area of the local authority and surely Senator Honan would recognise that as a possible definition? There are varied, possible definitions of a local community.</P>
      <P>My local community in Seán McDermott Street might be quite different in terms of definition geographically, structurally or from the viewpoint of population compared to Senator Honan's local community. If we determine the parameters of the local community as being coterminous with the local authority area and that a local community member is a person who normally resides within the functional area of the local authority, we are doing a very good day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be the worst day's work we could do. I considered this matter at some length. Senator Costello made the case for me when he said that there are varied possible definitions of communities and residents. I want the <Col N="2261" /> term &ldquo;local community&rdquo; to take its ordinary, everyday meaning which we all understand it to be. It would be wrong to define it because it would be totally restricted to the finite. The Senator's definition would limit it to the persons normally resident in the particular administrative area to which he has referred. When local authorities get involved in implementing their functions, those functions frequently have an importance to the residents way beyond their administrative area. It was not always intended that an authority's action would be strictly confined to its own residents.</P>
      <P>The decision of an urban district council could have an effect on residents beyond the environs of their own administrative area, and if one was to restrict them in this way it would run contrary to the whole question of local democracy. The local community often crosses even county boundaries at boundary towns. One county should be enabled to take action to benefit what in normal terms is the local community, those people living in the local area. For those reasons I have decided that to define it would be wrong. It would be unduly restrictive and it would be a great mistake to seek to include it here. Those of us who are familiar with the activities of local authorities and the way they implement their functions are aware that very often decisions taken by them cover not just the urban council district and county electoral area but also the next electoral area and very often other counties where county boundaries and towns are adjacent, a position with which some Senators will be familiar. This amendment is anti-local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not responded at all to the point I made. The local authority are the body elected to represent their community and other local authorities are elected to represent other communities. There is provision elsewhere in the Bill for an interchange of activity between local authorities, but each local authority represent their own community. The Bill states this categorically in other sections. In section 5 <Col N="2262" /> (2) &ldquo;A local authority may ... ascertain and communicate to other local authorities and public authorities the views of the local community.&rdquo; How do the local authority know what local community they are to represent? Surely it should be prescribed that their function is to represent the local community that elects them. Section 6 (1) (b) states: &ldquo;For the purposes of this section a measure, activity or thing shall be deemed to promote the interests of the local community if it promotes, directly or indirectly, the social, economic, environmental, recreational, cultural community ...&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is the function of the local authority to represent the community in their area rather than to step into an area where another local authority have been elected. I do not understand what the Minister is saying. A local authority elected within a particular constituency or ward area have a special function and duty to represent that area. This should be prescribed in the Bill. It should state that the local authority shall represent the local community that elects them and the local authority shall have duties and liabilities in relation to the local community that elects them. I cannot understand why the Minister is so vague in this matter and why he is not prepared to accept a definition of a local community. If it is not defined we cannot direct the local authority to represent the people who elect them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to be bureaucracy gone crazy. The Minister has already related some of our experiences in relation to local communities. A local authority <i>per se</i> do not represent just one local community. In a particular local authority area there can be many housing estates and, therefore, many local communities. It would be absolute madness to put in such a tight legal definition of something which varies greatly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the point is not whether the local authority represent the local community &mdash; of course they represent the local community &mdash; but what <Col N="2263" /> is the definition of local community? I support Senator Honan's admirable, commonsense point of view expressed earlier, that you cannot lay down such restrictions by definition as to preclude the authority from exercising their function in the interests of the community as a whole. I will give a concrete example. Kilcullen is divided not in terms of the council &mdash; it is still under the jurisdiction of Kildare County Council &mdash; but it stretches over two Dáil constituencies. The most cohesive unit in rural Ireland is the parish. This area is still a community even though it elects people to two different Dáil constituencies. Therefore, this amendment makes no sense whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to understand the thrust of Senator Costello's point. Obviously, if we were to pursue his attitude to finality it would simply restrict the interchange that is required. Perhaps he has misread the fundamental thrust of this legislation. We are talking here about an openness, not about doing anything restrictive. Is the Senator suggesting that if a town authority were to provide facilities for a community of town residents, those facilities should not be made available to or usuable by people other than the residents of the area which the authority serve? I am saying that if we provide facilities for a local community they should be available to those who work in the community, those who travel into it and those who might come to use the facilities for leisure purposes. To put into legislation the kind of restriction suggested would work contrary to the whole concept of community. I am surprised at the Senator.</P>

I am saying that the local community means all persons normally resident in the functional area of a local authority, in the context of what is represented by the local authority. Section 5 says that a local authority may represent the interests of the local community. That does not prevent other <Col N="2264" /> people availing of the services.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the section most of the amendments have a common thread running through them in relation to the regulations and orders that may be made by the Minister. The purpose of the Bill, as I understand it, and as the Minister indicated in his contribution, is to expand and reform local government, and <Col N="2266" /> devolve authority to the local authority. What we have at present is a highly centralised system which started as a local system but which over the years through the structures that were built up, through the manner in which the financing took place, and through a very tight managerial system became a centralised form of government. In this section the Minister is going beyond that and taking to himself all sorts of powers in relation to regulations, orders and directions.</P>
    <P>These powers can be exercised under this section by the Minister without reference to the Oireachtas. Indeed, where there is reference to referring orders to the Oireachtas, in many cases it is on a negative basis rather than on an affirmative basis, in that the regulation or order is passed into law unless there is an objection within 21 days. On an affirmative basis regulations would be presented to the House, the House would debate them, vote on them and then the orders or regulations would become law. My concern is that we are giving overriding powers to the Minister in relation to this section and that defeats the purpose of this Bill and what the Minister has stated this Bill to be about. The section causes me grievous concern about the way in which, reforms that are intended will be operated. It is for that reason that we are seeking to delete so many of these sections. We are seeking to ensure that where regulations are made under this Bill the Minister must have resort to the House in a positive way.</P>

      <P>These amendments are the first in a series of amendments to section 3. In essence what the Senator is trying to do is to require that every order or regulation to be made under this Bill would first have to be approved in draft by both Houses. I have a simple question to put to this House, do members believe or not in subsidiary legislation? What the Senator is attempting to do is to go back 100 years, and he knows that. The effect of his approach, if applied to legislation generally, would be that every detail in the implementation of this Bill would <Col N="2267" /> come before the Oireachtas. I do not have to say Senators that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if we were to do that we would be in continuous session for 365 days of the year. The Senator knows that. For that reason the details of legislation are left to subsidiary legislation. That is a basic principle in workable legislation, as we understand it, in a modern democracy.</P>
      <P>The case is quite contrary to what the Senator is suggesting. Every regulation made under this Bill will come before the Oireachtas. The more important ones will come by way of draft. All the others, have to be laid before the House by way of regulation and they are subject to annulment within the 21 days. If the Senator had his way, every item of minutiae attached to the implementation of every provision in this legislation &mdash; obviously this is a principle with him &mdash; would have to be cleared by both Houses of the Oireachtas in draft before it becomes a regulation. Now I ask the Senator if he is serious in pursuing this.</P>
      <P>That is the way it was in the last century but I do not think it is the way for a modern democratic parliament to do its business when one considers that Parliament retains absolute control anyway, for primary legislation, and then subsequently, for matters in draft before both Houses. The Senator wants everything to become an Act of Parliament, every minute detail and I doubt if the House will pursue that matter any further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <P>The Minister's reply is fairly credible except when he talks about the Houses sitting 365 days a year. He cannot be really serious talking like that when an important Bill with 54 or 55 sections is being jack-booted through in one hour. Under the same criteria regulations will probably be put through in a couple of minutes. It is important that the House has an opportunity to discuss fairly standard regulations from time to <Col N="2268" /> time. It is possible that 90 per cent of them will go through on the nod. The Minister in saying that there may be a huge difficulty and that we would suddenly find ourselves here in August, September, or on St. Stephen's Day is not being serious. The reality is, as we have seen in the last day or two, and as we will probably see again with the Finance Bill next week, when the Minister's side want to put through even major legislation, it can be put through almost without debate. There is no reason why the Minister could not enter into the spirit behind the amendment.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Cosgrave. The spirit of the amendment reflects the concern the Labour Party have about the wording of this section. It certainly was not my intention that every regulation or order should have to come before the House. My concern was to restrict the powers of the Minister. I know the Minister likes to have all power, but this is a democracy. This section gives all power to the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Minister should look at section 3 (2): &ldquo;By any regulation or order made thereunder as may appear to the Minister to be appropriate&rdquo;. The Minister might get up one morning and decide to make a regulation because effectively he does not have to answer to anybody. I am concerned that this entire section is peppered by powers granted to the Minister, without restriction. That is the spirit in which these amendments have been put forward, to restrict all power going to the Minister. If the power was left with the local authority we would not need to go to the Oireachtas. I am not happy that taking the power from the local authority and giving to the Minister is better than going to the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, Senator Byrne sought to determine what arrangements had been made for the eventuality of any of these amendments going through, when they would go to the Dáil and how the timescale would be <Col N="2270" /> fitted in.

      <P>I sympathise with the Minister's point of view that the operation of the House could be clogged if there was an enormous mass of regulations which require discussion and to be voted on. However, I have said that I am inclined to support what Senator Costello said, simply on the basis of distinction between the passive acceptance of regulations and their active acceptance because often Order Papers in this House are cluttered with regulations and papers laid before the House. It is obvious from time to time from the Order of Business that many Senators, including myself &mdash; I am not claiming I am any less ignorant than anybody else &mdash; are not quite aware of procedures and just glance at an Order Paper. The advantage of requiring a resolution approving of the draft to be passed would be that any such draft would stand a far greater chance of being read. Unfortunately, because of the nature of humanity, if a thing does not have to be read it slides by, almost willy nilly, unnoticed. I do not think that many of these regulations would require a debate, or great scrutiny, but at least this amendment has the value of drawing such regulations to the active attention of the House. For that reason I am happy to support it.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;<i>New Despotism</i> and <i>The Road to Serfdom</i> dealt with the tendency at the start of this century to delegated legislation; this was the start of <Col N="2271" /> the delegated legislation about which we are talking, subsidiary legislation. These texts must have been reissued recently because certain people here and in the other House promoted the ideology enunciated in those texts in the last few days. However, times have changed, legislation is different and life is more complex. I agree that matters of principle, matters that affect the fundamental rights of people, the fundamental framework of law, must come before us but is somebody suggesting to me that delegated legislation should not now be a fact of life and that the minutiae of legislation in a complex democracy should somehow on a continuous basis come before the House? It is ridiculous and Senators know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there were allegations of abuse or if somebody here can give me a few <Col N="2272" /> examples of abuse in making regulations subsequent to the primary Act being put in place, then I would give a much better hearing to what some of the Senators are saying, but nobody put forward any suggestion or allegation of abuse in this matter. What are we talking about? What are we setting out to curb? Are we trying to shout down ghosts that do not exist? Let us talk in a modern sense and let us not go back to old texts, last century stuff. We are talking about a modern democracy with primary legislation, its orders in draft on the major items, but the minutiae go before the Oireachtas by way of orders that can be annulled. Give me the examples of the orders that have been annulled by the Oireachtas in the last five years? They do not exist so we should stop pursuing ghosts like this.</P>

      <P>The effect of this section is <Col N="2273" /> that the regulations could include appropriate provisions. They have to seem appropriate to someone; that is what I am saying, and that is the basic reason for it. The regulations have to seem appropriate to somebody, and who better to seem appropriate to than to the decision maker? The amendment does nothing to improve the text and it could, in fact, be seen as a disimprovement. The section will, therefore, have to stand as it is because it simply comes down to, to whom should it seem appropriate. Since in normal law the buck stops at the Minister, it has to seem appropriate to him.</P>

      <P>I strongly disagree with the Minister on this point. It is not, however, a flaw peculiar to the Minister. This phrase appears to be almost a kind of cliché of drafts, but I have already made this point with regard to a number of other Bills so I do not want to waste time. I would like once more to place on record that I see the essential differences as being one of substance. I do not think it is appropriate to say that it should just appear to the Minister, because the appearance could be illusory, it could be tendentious, it could be unreal or insubstantial and I think it would be strengthened if it said &ldquo;may be appropriate&rdquo;, in other words it would have to be appropriate. It would not have to be a kind of charade of appropriateness and if the legislation is framed using those words, the Minister would, I believe, be at least morally required to be in a position to demonstrate that appropriateness rather than just to say it appeared to him. It could be a kind of will-o'-the-wisp. I have spoken at some length on this on previous legislation so I am not going to waste the time of the House but it is quite a reasonable distinction and a distinction of substance. It is shadow versus substance in a sense. Appearance is not enough in my opinion.</P>

I am one of those who ask what is the point of pursuing something like that unless you can prove where it has worked against the good intentions of the legislation. The Minister makes the regulations, the Minister in this circumstance is myself, and it has to seem appropriate to me. Who else should it seem appropriate to other than the Minister at the time?</P>

      <P>This amendment would mean that different provisions could not apply to different local authorities and the whole basis of local government law is that different legal provisions apply to the different classes of local authorities. They are not all the same; some are of different sizes, some represent counties, smaller authorities, larger authorities, town commissioners whatever. I will give a good example of this so that everybody will understand: town commissioners are not planning authorities and county councils are fire authorities but a few of the larger urban district councils are also fire authorities. Subsection (3) simply allows regulations to reflect these arrangements and to concern itself with the different classes and sizes, and whatever, of local authorities. That is the basis on which local government regulations have been made over the years and we are seeking to re-enact it here.</P>

      <P>Section 3 (3) (c) provides that regulations could include provision for the giving of directions by the Minister. By virtue of the definition of &ldquo;direction&rdquo; in section 2 (1), all directions must be given in writing. For example, regulations dealing with the expenses of <Col N="2276" /> members under section 5 could allow for a direction by the Minister in a case where a specified amount, say, 13 times the average for all local authorities of a particular class, was exceeded by a local authority. This would not mean an automatic direction but simply that the power of direction could be used when specified thresholds are exceeded.

Draft orders shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and shall have to be cleared in draft before they become regulations or annulled within 21 days.

      <P>In page 9, subsection (1), lines 3 and 4, to delete &ldquo;may represent the interests of the local community in such manner as it thinks appropriate.&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;shall represent the interests of the local community to the maximum possible extent, shall aim to secure the maximum economic, social, environmental, recreational, cultural, community, and general development of its functional area, and shall in particular ensure that all services provided to the community are of the highest possible standard, that the environment is fully protected, and that the community is encouraged to participate to the fullest possible extent in all decisions affecting them.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is the most important and relevant section in the Bill. It seeks to ensure that local authorities will be stronger, more viable and independent.

My amendment No. 19 was somewhat scathingly referred to earlier as one of the &ldquo;must/shall&rdquo; variety. There are occasions when it is important to strengthen the tone of a Bill. What we are seeking to do is make something mandatory which is <Col N="2280" /> just exhortatory in the Bill. The Bill states that the local authority may for the purpose of giving effect to that subsection do various things, whereas what I seek to do is to make it a requirement that they ascertain and communicate with other local authorities and public authorities and so on. It would be a waste of time to go read the whole amendment which seeks to strengthen and require local authorities not just simply to leave it to a judgment.</P>

      <P>The Bill is a Bill to amend and extend. It does not purport to provide any more finance. Without finance we are only pretending to give powers. It is like giving a person a rifle with only blanks to fire. It is a toothless Bill. What we want to do, in effect, is to extend it to this degree and in subsequent legislation the Minister will be able to bring in some means of allowing local authorities to raise more finance to add to their original funds and the support from central fund. That is what we are trying to do. The Bill talks about powers and about extending and amending powers but at the same time it does not provide for finance to help them to give effect to these powers. The amendment should at least draw the Minister out on the question of whether at any stage he intends to do anything about the funding of local authorities to enable them to exercise their powers.</P>

      <P>This is one of the most important amendments on the list of amendments because it deals with the functions of local authorities. If we are extending the functions and truly devolving power to local authorities we must make them responsible for their area. A vague statement that a local authority &ldquo;may&rdquo; represent the interests of the local community is not reforming legislation. Local authorities are elected to represent and they must. Senator Norris referred to the fact that some cold water was thrown on the notion of the difference between &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;must&rdquo;. It is a highly important distinction. &ldquo;May&rdquo; is optional; &ldquo;must&rdquo; is obligatory. If we mean what <Col N="2281" /> we are talking about in reforming local authorities we must ensure that they do truly represent the interests. To do that we must state what they must do, their duties and their liabilities, and then go on to list those. The amendment states the requirement as a basic principle of obligation and secondly, states what local authorities must address. The amendment is crucial.</P>

      <P>Usually I find myself agreeing with Senator John Ryan on legislation. I am on record on most of legislation as agreeing with Senator Ryan. However, I do not understand why he wants recreational, cultural, community, general development and environmental listed. On the &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;must&rdquo; point made by my esteemed friend, Senator Norris, there is no &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;must&rdquo; when one is serving on a local authority whether one is within one's own boundaries, as mentioned earlier, or whether one spreads one's wings further. If one is a good local representative one looks after the electorate.</P>
      <P>I am surprised at Senator Ryan asking that we should include each area because it is what he does in north Tipperary and what I, and my colleagues, do in Clare. I do not think we need include each word. In fact, if the Minister introduced specific wording Senators would absolutely slaughter him.</P>

The words &ldquo;may represent the local community&rdquo; are not sufficiently <Col N="2282" /> strong. If we are to inculcate the idea of a local democracy in the elected representatives and the managerial system at local authority level &ldquo;may represent&rdquo; is not sufficiently strong. It does not indicate from the top that we are interested in having a viable local authority. The reason I spell out the different interests and different needs of the local community is that I want to specify the different interests and objectives in a local authority area.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to oppose the amendment as presented by Senator Ryan and his colleagues. He is attempting to create legislation that will get rid of functions. Those of us who are members of local authorities know that certain activities and interests we would wish to develop are excluded from our brief because of the legislation we are working under. The words &ldquo;may represent the interests of the local community&rdquo; on their own, may give a false impression but if one continues through to &ldquo;in such manner as it thinks appropriate&rdquo; one sees the broad scope of what is involved. In the past local authority members could not become involved in tourism; it was not in their brief. They could not become involved in any great developments, it was not their territory. How does Senator Ryan and his colleagues know but that in 12 months time, if we include this in the Bill, and have specific responsibilities in specific areas there may be up to ten different areas involved and we can be told politely as <Col N="2283" /> we were in the past; &ldquo;That is not in the Bill so it is not in your brief.&rdquo; The Minister's input is that it &ldquo;may represent interests of the local community in such manner as it thinks appropriate&rdquo;. That is very broad and is exactly what I would want. I would not want it tied up as it would be if this amendment was accepted. I have found to my horror on several occasions when we tried to develop tourism and so on that we were excluded and were intruding on somebody else's brief. I cannot support the amendment and I ask my colleagues not to support it because it would take us back to what we had and what we now want to get rid of. We in local authorities want a broad brief so that we can take on any development or any interest that we consider appropriate to the communities we serve.</P>

      <P>My amendment would have been better if, instead of &ldquo;must&rdquo; I used the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. It would be inconceiveable that a local authority would represent a community in a manner that they thought was inappropriate. My amendment No. 19 is less significant and less accurately worded than amendment No. 18. I take the point Senator Finneran made, that it might appear to be a limiting factor, that it restricted the activities of the council to just these specified areas, but I do not think that that need necessarily be the legal impact of it. I understand that the intention of this amendment, of which I approve, is to headline specific activities and draw them to the attention of local authorities. They should represent the appropriate interests. Leaving in the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; implies that there may be certain cases in which they may decide not to represent the interests or may decide not to represent the appropriate interests and so on. It is a small point and I do not honestly believe that the country is riddled with local authorities who are deliberately and perversely going to go out and act against the interests of their local community.</P>

      <P>Senator Finneran has mistaken what is in this amendment. It provides that the local authority &ldquo;shall represent the interests of the local community to the maximum possible extent, shall aim to secure the maximum economic, social environmental, recreational, cultural, community, and general development of its functional area&rdquo;, and so on. Most of what is there is included in section 6 (1) (b) of the Bill which reads:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this section a measure, activity or thing shall be deemed to promote the interests of the local community if it promotes, directly or indirectly, the social, economic, environmental, recreational, cultural, community or general development...</P>
      <P>We have broadened and extended what is in the Bill. In that sense we are extending the provisions, which the Minister has already indicated is his intention. So we are helping him to better his reforming legislation. This is very appropriate.</P>
      <P>The other function of this reforming legislation is to give greater powers to local authorities. If you are going to give greater powers to the local authorities you must indicate what they are obliged to do. You must say local authorities have a responsibility in this area, therefore they shall represent the interests of the local community. We are doing precisely what the Minister has said is his intention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not confuse the section with another section. Section 5 is the representational role. Section 6 is the functional role. Let us not apply the criteria of the functions to the representational side. That is a fundamental mistake and I suggest Senator Costello might accept that. Section 5 is a very important section. As Senator Finneran rightly said, over many years when Senators were making representations whether it was about particular items or to public bodies such as RTE or whatever they were often told, &ldquo;Hands off, it is none of your business, you did not have <Col N="2285" /> the statutory right to make a representation&rdquo;. It is to provide that statutory representational role that I included this and it is a very fundamental section on behalf of the furtherance of local democracy. Now local authorities will be entitled to bring the local view to other public authorities and it gives them a status with other authorities that they did not have previously. They were only making comments in the past at meetings on sufferance and that is the only way they can do it at present. A public body will not now be able to ignore the representation a local authority will be able to make. I deliberately wanted to spell it out in clear and simple terms and that is the way it is stated in section 5. Senators opposite are not quite satisfied with that and I wonder why. In spite of what they say about local democracy, they want this section to be mandatory and to provide that it &ldquo;shall&rdquo; or &ldquo;must&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo;. I do not accept that. That is not good thinking in pursuance of the intention now purely on representational terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of letting a local council carry out this new function in such a manner as they think appropriate themselves, which is what the section provides. Why do we impose restrictions? Let us at least clear that line and agree among us all that we do not want to put restrictions in, we do not want the section to be rigid. Putting in any of the matter suggested by some of the Senators puts the rigidity into it. If we were to spell out what they must do under the new section we are really weakening the whole overall effect of this section. We are in effect introducing different categories of representational roles and I do not want to do that. What is the top priority to one council might be of no consequence to another, so why are we mandating them to give an equal priority to what their attitude might be in any one circumstance? Local authorities should be able to decide themselves what representational role they will apply. This is an enabling section. It was never designed to force a local authority to do any particular thing. That is a matter for local elected <Col N="2286" /> members to decide for themselves and that is the way it should be left. I recommend that to the Senators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This Minister is a very good debater, he is very shrewd and he has the necessary skills to challenge and say something on the spur of the moment without producing an instance. In debate that is not always easy particularly when we are dealing with companies and the <Col N="2287" /> lengthy history of the evolution of legislation. However, on the other hand it is revealing when the Minister says that local authorities make representations to RTE. Section 5 (2) (a) states:</P>
      <P>ascertain and communicate to other local authorities and public authorities the views of the local community...</P>
      <P>It is not specified how those views will be ascertained. In the light of the distinguished leadership of a previous Taoiseach from the Minister's own party, they may simply feel that all they needed to do was to look into their own hearts where they would find engraved, no doubt in green letters, precisely what the people felt. There is no machinery here for consultation whatever. The Bill states &ldquo;they ascertain&rdquo;. How do they ascertain those views? I do not look forward to a situation where local authorities might incite themselves into a state of frenzy against RTE. This Government have had a few good bashes at RTE already. The instance the Minister gave was highly significant.</P>
      <P>The notion of representing the interests of a local community to the maximum possible extent covers just about everything and knocks what Senator Finneran said out through the window. If you are doing something to the maximum possible extent, it surely includes every possible, positive eventuality. If Senator Finneran felt that on previous legislation he was precluded from dealing with tourism, this, obviously, would not be the case if the amendment in the names of Senators Upton, Harte, Costello and J. Ryan were accepted. If I could withdraw my own amendment or change it I would. I can anticipate the Minister's argument and I can see a good argument as to why my amendment should not be accepted so I will not push it.</P>

      <P>By way of a passing comment to the Senator, I am pleased he recognised the distinguished leaders of the political party I support, that they played an important role and that they <Col N="2288" /> were able to recognise what was important, so far as legislation and other matters in the community were concerned. I know the Senator suports that. All I am trying to establish here is the primary role of local representatives which is enshrined in the Bill as now framed. To do the other thing would be to show a total lack of appreciation of the basic purpose of the provision. It is designed simply to give statutory recognition to a fundamental purpose of all local authorities, that is, to be able to represent their own community in any way they wish and to whichever authority, public or otherwise, they may wish to address their representations. I am pleased Senator Norris will withdraw his amendment and I ask the House to accept the section as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that this is an extremely important section. This is the most important item in that section because it defines the role of the local authority. Whether the role of the local authority will be defined in vague terms or whether it will be stated that the local authority shall represent the interests of the local community is what is at stake. If we are reforming the local authorities we should state their role. They are elected by the community in their local electoral area and their responsibility is to represent the interests of those who elect them. I cannot for the life of me see how the Minister has problems with the words: &ldquo;shall represent the interests of the local community to the maximum possible extent&rdquo;. That is all that is requested in the amendment. That, to my mind, is a necessary definition. So far we have not defined the role of the &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; and it behoves us to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, this amendment states that the local authority &ldquo;shall aim to secure the maximum economic, social, environmental, recreational,...&rdquo; and so on. In a nutshell the amendment is determining, describing and defining the representational role of the local authority and also stating the aims and objectives. I do not see how we can move from this <Col N="2289" /> because what is left in the Bill, in terms of the functions of the local authorities as described in the Bill, does not have very much meaning unless we put it in the terms described in this amendment. This is the core of the amendment. It is not good enough for the Minister to say there is a misconception on our part, that we are mixing up the functions with the representation. We are stating our perception of the primary role of the local authority in relation to the local community and its aims and objectives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain sympathy with Senator Costello. We all agree that this is probably the most important section of the Bill. There is a basic difference in approach and possibly also in principle and, perhaps, our objectives are hopeful in that the trend, both in this amendment and previous amendments which Senator Costello and his colleagues have tabled, is to rigidly define the &ldquo;local community&rdquo; and now to attempt to rigidly define the functions of a local authority even in regard to representation. The most important thing for local authorities is to get away from this rigidity: this is the 19th century Victorian rigidity of very tight definitions that tied the hands of the local authorities. I do not doubt that all the suggestions made in this rather long paragraph are all excellent suggestions and, indeed, I would agree with many of them. Section 5 (1) states:</P>
      <P>A local authority may represent the interests of the local community in such manner as it thinks appropriate.</P>
      <P>This gives this broad democratic opportunity to the local authority to represent the interests as it thinks appropriate and members of the authority are the elected representatives of the people. The moment you start &mdash; with whatever good intentions &mdash; to define it, to restrict it, to tie it down, you are likely to end up in the same situation in which we find ourselves so often in local authorities where we cannot do certain things because the power is not provided for in the Act.</P>

      <P>I would make one final comment and I do not intend to intervene again. I am pleased the Senators have recognised that sections 3 and 5 are critical sections in this legislation and they are worth teasing out, as we have done. It is not appropriate, as the amendment seems to suggest, that this inherent characteristic of democratic local government should be couched in terms of a mandatory obligation in the same way as you might have a mandatory obligation to provide a particular service. I would go further and say that if one were to pursue this amendment it would indicate a lack of confidence in the local authorities, because not only does it want to express that their representational role is mandatory but it seeks to spell out in this alternative section in minute detail what they should do towards that end. I would add that some of the items listed in the amendment to which Senator Conroy referred would not be appropriate.</P>
      <P>It was never intended to just list the various functional roles. That is not the intention of this section. It is a statutory confirmation of the general representational role and character of local authorities, and that should not be couched in a mandatory formula as it defeats the purpose. Consequently, I must insist that Senators reconsider their position with a view to allowing the section to stand.</P>

There is a very good example of this in today's issue of <i>The Irish Times.</i> Certainly, as one reads the article dealing with rezoning it seems quite clear that what are being served are very considerable commercial interests, and that this is being done in a venial way by councillors who have been elected to represent particular&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is an appalling statement from a person who is not a member of a local authority. I suggest that the Senator should get elected to a local authority and make his case there. To come into this House with privilege and speak like that about local authority members, and the collective decision of an elected council, is totally inappropriate. I too ask the Senator to withdraw that remark.</P>

It has been done under the privilege of this House by a person who is not a member of a local authority, who does not have the inside knowledge and who, in an earlier statement, said that local authorities often work against their constituents. I let that comment go, but as a Member of this House I cannot let the latest comment go.</P>

As I said earlier, I do not wish to go down that road. I am mainly concerned with getting this legislation through. As this amendment is being pressed I am putting the question: &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>As amendment No. 18 has been defeated, amendment No. 19 cannot be moved. Amendments Nos. 20, 21 and 22 are related and may be taken together.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 19 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (2), line 6, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We covered the ground before in relation to &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; so there is no sense in rehashing all those arguments. We believe strongly that &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be inserted there. Section 5 (2) reads:</P>
      <P>a local authority may for the purposes of giving effect to that subsection&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) ascertain and communicate to other local authorities and public authorities...</P>
      <P>That would be part and parcel of its normal operation. It should ascertain and communicate the views of the local community in relation to these matters which affect the interests of the functional area. We believe the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be inserted rather than &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 21 we want to delete &ldquo;as respects which those other authorities perform functions and&rdquo;. Certainly the wording there is extremely convoluted. I would like the Minister to elaborate on its tautology. It would seem to be sufficient to say &ldquo;in relation to matters which affect the interests of the functional area of the authority and the local community.&rdquo; The phrasing we asked to be delete should not have been there in the first place.</P>
      <P>Finally, in amendment No. 22 we are asking to insert after &ldquo;affairs&rdquo; the following &ldquo;by managing its affairs in such a way as to promote open and accountable local government, by encouraging the maximum participation in all decisions affecting the local community, and by ensuring the highest possible awareness of all decisions.&rdquo; That is a proper and relevant matter to be included as a function of the local authority. These are part of the areas of representation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The emphasis should be on amendment No. 22 because in relation to local authorities people are beginning to take us for granted and perceive that we are a silent group not participating properly in the democratic system. Amendment No. 22 would indicate to the public that the local authority are viable, active and accountable for their actions. It is a very important amendment. We are trying to strengthen the local government system and this amendment would have the effect of ensuring that people would <Col N="2295" /> be aware that there is accountability at local government level and that my encouraging such decisions and activities it would appear that the elected representatives would be encouraging local authorities to fully participate in all the affairs at local level. That is the amendment about which I am concerned and most anxious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have gone through the proposal to substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo; on a number of occasions. It would not be appropriate because the purpose of subsection (5) (2) is to indicate the sort of action which a local authority can make pursuant to their representational role. The amendment will just make the provision far too restrictive. That has been my case before and I made my point on that matter. In amendment No. 21 the deletion makes no sense since, taken in conjunction with the mandatory nature of the other amendments, it could place an obligation on local authorities to communicate views to other bodies on matters in which they had no function.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 22 the suggestion is another example of intent to spell out in the Bill how local authorities could manage their affairs. I am trying to get away from that in the general observations I made previously. This sort of approach in against the whole thrust of the local government reform. That is a basic fundamental attitude of the Minister and of the legislation; it has to be retained to accommodate the reform procedures in the open way we want. In it this sort of detail is inflexible and I want to get away from the rigidity about which we spoke previously in spelling out in any great detail what they may do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want local authorities to be able to decide for themselves; to give them the full democratic flexibility of their role. That inflexibility issue goes back to Victorian times. That was the Victorian approach &mdash; to corral their attitudes so that they could not do things except under very direct and strict control. I want to get away from that in local government law and that is what we are trying to <Col N="2296" /> get away from in this section. I ask the Senators to recognise that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was suggested earlier on another amendment that there was a form of compulsion. In this amendment I am not trying to emphasise &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo;, I am trying to encourage local democracy. This amendment would indicate to the public that there is accountability at local level. I regret that I have to differ from the Minister on this. There is no intention of compulsion. I am trying to outline an open democratic system, where public accountability at local level would not alone be seen and explained but, to all intents and purposes, at local level people would see that there is a vibrant, independent local authority responsible for their actions and held accountable to the public for what they have done. I want to make it very clear to the Minister that the amendment does not suggest any Victorian ways; I am not going back to the 19th century. I am trying to bring people into the system. This amendment would mean more public accountability and would make people aware of what we are doing at local level. The Minister's reading of my amendment is not in line with my thinking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make this observation with regard to a point of drafting. I would be very happy to see the deletion of the phrase &ldquo;as respects which those other authorities perform functions and&rdquo; on a grammatical and stylistic basis because it is unattractive and scarcely literate due to the phrase &ldquo;as respects which&rdquo;; it should be &ldquo;in respect to which&rdquo;. I say that so that the persons charged with drafting might perhaps present us with beautiful English in future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (2), between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) enter into a partnership arrangement with voluntary sector community groups with a view to planning and implementing responses to needs and issues identified in areas and communities of special need.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment adds another paragraph to the general scheme of things. It is clear &mdash; and becoming increasingly obvious &mdash; that no amendments will be accepted today. I embark on this course of action in an almost hopeless spirit of gallantry. I am sure the Minister would sympathise with the intention even though I very much doubt that he will take the amendment on board. That was clear early this morning even on the Second Stage speech, for example, of Senator Farrell who spoke about his work with alcoholics in the community and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is intended to give a kind of specificity to the relations between the local authorities and particular community groups, especially voluntary groups. The idea of partnership ought to be welcomed and it will strengthen local democracy. There are many excellent voluntary bodies working in the city of Dublin, and in the other local authority areas, and they are particularly sensitive to and particularly capable of identifying the needs of sections of the community. I could instance, of course, the travellers, the gay community, and people who work with the problem of drug abuse. Again, perhaps, this is not the correct moment to go into an extended treatment of this, but I am sure the Minister is aware that in Dublin we are now at least facing a new drug epidemic of heroin smoking. Excellent people and excellent organisations are working to try to deal with this. It would be useful to have in the <Col N="2298" /> legislation a section which encourages local authorities to enter into partnership with voluntary organisations to help to identify the issues involved and then to implement a line of action. Again, in order to expedite the matter, I will not speak at length about it. I am sure the Minister understands the thinking behind this amendment and I am also sure that he and his advisers have noticed that there are a number of other amendments which have similar wording, for example, amendment No. 34.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, this is one of a number of amendments submitted to me which I read in conjunction with the Bill and thought were worthwhile. It was submitted by the people who run Pavel Point, the travellers' centre in North Great Charles Street, off Mountjoy Square, where excellent work is being done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment which I consider to be an excellent one. It would add a new paragraph to the Bill to allow the local authorities to enter into a partnership arrangement with community groups. As we are all aware, marvellous work is being done by a wide range of voluntary groups and organisations. It is appropriate, therefore, that the local authorities should get involved in a partnership with those groups who are not in receipt of State funding. I accept that it is difficult to allocate resources for all activities, but it is desirable that the local authorities should engage in activities involving the handicapped, the deprived and sporting organisations in the interests of the local community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the purpose of the amendment is to ensure consultation and discussion between the local authorities and local community groups, such as residents' associations without the need to enter into a contractual arrangement. For example, in Dún Laoghaire discussions would take place with, say, an enterprise centre to see how the corporation could be of assistance. I hope, <Col N="2299" /> however, that there will always be consultation. The question which must be asked is whether it is necessary to enter such a partnership arrangement to achieve the aim behind the amendment but, as I said, it is very important that there be a consultative process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would like to join with other speakers in expressing support for voluntary groups. I regard this as a very important element of the legislation as framed. The legislation is not anti-voluntary or local groups. Indeed, it is pro-local and voluntary groups in every way possible. There should be consultation between the local community and their elected representatives but I am concerned to maintain the superiority of the elected representatives having regard to the fact they have been elected to represent all the groups in the community. It should be a matter for them to decide how best to involve the local community in deciding on what to do on their behalf. Section 6 will be of help in achieving this. Those matters which are not covered by section 6 certainly ought to be covered very adequately by section 37.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to encourage local authorities to avail of the provisions of section 37 to involve local community groups in the various committees attached to the local authorities, but I want the local authorities to do this on their own. They will have adequate powers under the Bill to enter into whatever arrangements they wish. The expert advisory group who advised me on these matters state at paragraph 7:15 that it should be a matter for the individual local authority to make the necessary structural arrangements, for example, joint or open meetings, to accommodate the voluntary groups to which Senator Norris referred. That work is being done. This is not the first time this work has been recognised in legislation, but at least it is recognised that community groups have a role to play. The local authorities should not be prevented from involving them in any way <Col N="2300" /> they wish. That is the reason I am recommending that the section remain as it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>There is absolutely no conflict between the recommendation of the expert advisory group to which the Minister just referred and my amendment. The amendment states that the local authorities &ldquo;may&rdquo; enter into a partnership arrangement. This is the kind of amendment which the Minister if we had more time and the parliamentary arrangements were slightly different, might feel inclined to include.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that we do not need to enact legislation to achieve what he is looking for. Some Senators criticised me for taking too many powers in the Bill, but in the next breath they criticised me for not determining what should happen in a local community. What I am saying to the Senator is that this is a local matter and it should be left to the elected representatives to decide &mdash; Senator Norris referred to this earlier &mdash; on how best to run their communities. They should seek to involve all groupings in the community. We cannot legislate for this and the local authorities should have discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authorities do have discretion. This is a discretionary power. The amendment would not force the local authorities to do this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but it would enable and encourage them to do so and, psychologically, it would give status to voluntary bodies in certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not need to legislate for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a good idea to include this. I am not sure if this is possible under existing legislation, if the Minister can reassure me, fine but it would be a very healthy and positive thing and have the effect of giving some degree of <Col N="2301" /> recognition to the role played by voluntary bodies. May I again point out to the Minister that I was urged to put down the amendment by such a voluntary body?</P>
      <P>Of course, the local authority would not be required to take into partnership any group that simply set themselves up. They would have the discretionary power to determine which groups were of principal significance in particular areas and they would be encouraged by this section to bring them on board. Finally may I say that I was a little confused by some of the Minister's remarks where he spoke about the fact that he was urged not to take on too much power; that he was chastised for taking on too much power earlier on, and now he was being incited to take on power. There is no power for the Minister in this section. The Minister is confused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The only power the Minister seeks in this legislation &mdash; it has not been summarised before but I will do so now &mdash; is to give power to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that this seeks to give powers to local authorities; it is not giving power to the Minister. It is actually empowering and vitalising local authorities in my opinion. However, I do not want to spend the whole afternoon on an amendment whose value I am convinced of but I am also quite clear in my mind that it is not going to be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris is right in saying that what is being done is devolving power to the local authority, and is not in any sense giving power to the Minister. The whole intention is that it be given directly to the local authority. We suggest that the local authority be pointed in the direction of certain activities that they should perform. This section states that a local authority may ascertain and communicate with other local authorities, facilitate and promote interest and involvement in local government affairs; promote, organise or assist the <Col N="2302" /> carrying out of research, surveys or studies and so on.</P>
      <P>Another important area of activity involves the work of the voluntary sector community groups. We consider, and Senator Norris is proposing, that the work and the role of these groups within the community should be promoted and encouraged. The way to do that is to emphasise it; it is not necessary to put it into the legislation. Obviously, a local authority can do it and there is nothing to stop a local authority doing it but if we really want to underline the importance of this sector, namely the voluntary community group sector, the way to do that is by putting in a reference to it in the legislation. I am sure the Minister is not going to accept the amendment, nevertheless it would have been a valuable amendment if it could have been added to the section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (2), between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) conduct referenda on issues of local interest, including referenda sought by petition of a reasonable number of persons normally resident in the functional area of the local authority, and including referenda on proposals to raise funds through local contributions for specific purposes (the purpose, the amount of money to be raised and spent, and the method of collection to be specifed on all voting papers).&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks, and we want also to emphasise another area of activity where the local authority should be involved and the manner in which it <Col N="2303" /> should be involved. It suggests that we should conduct referenda on issues of local interest, including referenda sought by petition and so on. The local authority should determine the importance of certain matters by conducting a referendum rather than simply considering the matter and going ahead with it and finding out later that there is a lot of local opposition to it, after the residents and pressure groups organise to protest. We see this happening all of the time. The opinion or views of the people should be directly sought through local referenda on specific developments contemplated by the local authority. This is broadening the concept of local democracy. I urge the Minister to consider adding this to the representational functions specified in the legislation because it it totally in line with the spirit of the legislation which the Minister enunciated and would certainly improve local democracy within the local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The holding of a referendum locally on every issue is an interesting concept. Without seeming to offend, I ask the Senator whether he really thinks it is a practical idea. It is not practical to hold referenda on every tittle-tattle or every item local authorities would wish to get involved in. We are talking about an enormously cumbersome process. To hold a couple of referenda every week, one would have to consider the cost and the organisation involved. I do not believe the Senators are pursuing this except for the sake of putting down an amendment. They want it to be mandatory, and suggest that local authorities could not do something without asking the people.</P>
      <P>We elect people to the authority and give them the power and the authority to do something and, before they are allowed to do it, they have to go back and ask the people to decide by way of referendum everything that they wish to do. I do not think that is practical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator did not pursue this but I am going to because what he is talking <Col N="2304" /> about here applies to the question of raising funds. We would have referenda when the council want to build something. He suggests that the council should set out the cost and ask people to say yes or no. I know what would happen to many of the ballot papers, if a referendum was held every second day. I do not believe this is a way of raising funds for local authorities and, rather than making little of the suggestion, I ask the Senator to reconsider it.</P>

      <P>Nothing in this section shall be construed as imposing on a local authority, either directly or indirectly, any form of duty or liability enforceable by proceedings before any court to which it would not otherwise be subject.</P>
      <P>I cannot for the life of me understand why we should want to take away from the local authority a liability or a duty to perform their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We elect local authorities to represent the interests of the people and to perform duties and activities. If we say that neither directly or indirectly should there by any form of duty or liability enforceable by proceedings it means that we are saying that a local authority may or may not do something but they have no duty to do it or no liability if they are neglectful. This is a bad subsection. The least we expect of a local authority is to perform their duty and we expect them, like every other citizen, to be liable if they <Col N="2305" /> are neglectful in the performance of their duty.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy with a specific reference which would absolve the local authority from carrying out their duty to the extent that we would have thought it would be necessary for doing it. Of course in the context of the original amendment I tabled suggesting that a local authority &ldquo;shall&rdquo; represent rather that a local authority &ldquo;may&rdquo;, there would be a lead-on implication. I have reservations about that subsection being retained.</P>

      <P>This is just a continuation of the mandatory terms that the Senator insists on placing on the representational role of local authorities. It is turning the process. What is intended to be an underlying and enhancing of local authority status is being turned into a negative instrument which, I should emphasise, would impinge directly on the elected members since the representational functions under the section are vested in them. That is very clearly stated in the Bill and has been voted on. The representational role will be theirs so why should we put any restrictions or mandate on them in that regard? I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>We have a basic difference of opinion on this matter. Local authorities are elected to represent their communities and, therefore, have a duty to make representations. To absolve them of this duty does not seem to be in line with good legislation. If local authorities have certain functions we have to be very careful in reforming legislation to ensure that those functions are carried out in a dutiful and proper manner. To insert a provision which states that there is no form of duty or liability on them, either directly or indirectly, is almost dangerous. If the section were deleted there would implicitly be a duty on them to carry out their functions. Will the provision absolving them of this duty encourage them not to carry out their functions? This seems to be an unnecessary statement of smugness which should not be part and parcel of legislation which deals <Col N="2306" /> with the representational role of local authorities.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (1) (a), line 27, to delete &ldquo;it considers&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment would strengthen section 6 (1) (a) by providing that local authorities should do such things in accordance with law as necessary and not as they think necessary. This is a more objective statement of the situation than an opinion, which is a lesser statement. My proposal would strengthen this section.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 28 is similar to Deputy Norris's amendment in relation to the voluntary sector. Amendment No. 28 provides that:</P>
      <P>Any measure, activity or thing which promotes the interests of any under-privileged, or handicapped section of the community shall be deemed to promote the interests of the local community as a whole...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This again would strengthen our commitment to the deprived, less well-off and handicapped people in our society. It would be an appropriate additional statement of general competence for local authorities. Section 6 (1) (b) refers <Col N="2307" /> to the promotion of social, economic and environmental measures. It would be very useful as an indicator of our commitment as a society to the less well-off, under-privileged and handicapped that we would seek to include them as one of the groups who should be promoted by local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>My original point about &ldquo;may&rdquo; versus &ldquo;shall&rdquo; still stands. This is part and parcel of the discussion on many sections. Amendment No. 27 seems designed to restrict the discretion of local authorities, which is one of the key objectives of the general competence provision. I think all of us support the general competence provision which will give local authorities the right for the first time ever to do things on behalf of their communities. I want to give local authorities the discretion to which I referred earlier.</P>
      <P>I do not think the acceptance of amendment No. 28 which deals with sectional interests would serve any useful purpose. Worthy as the intention behind the proposal may seem at first glance, it would serve to make the general competence provision unduly specific and defeat the general purpose of it. Moreover, this amendment shows a certain lack of confidence in local authorities. I have always had great confidence in local authorities, having been a member of a local authority for a long number of years. I believe all local authorities have been waiting for a general competence provision so that they will be able to do the things they have been asking to do for a long time. I am not aware of any need to impose a statutory prohibition on local authorities so that they will not take measures which would promote sectional interests at the expense of the under-privileged or others. The intent behind the amendment is questionable and is not what it might seem at first glance. Consequently, I ask the Senator to withdraw his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>The Minister has a wonderful facility for turning around the <Col N="2308" /> intention of what I said. I am not in any way suggesting that I have a lack of confidence in the integrity or capacity of local authorities to perform their duties. I am trying to ensure that we, as a Legislature, point out to local authorities certain areas of major critical and central concern. The Minister has also done this. Indeed the Barrington advisory committee have pointed out a number of areas where the general competence of the local authorities should be operational.</P>
      <P>Section 6 (1) (b) refers to &ldquo;social, economic, environmental, recreational, cultural, community or general development of the functional area...&rdquo;. While the sectors referred to in my amendment could, by extension, be dealt with under any of these headings, we need to include a specific reference to them in the Bill. The under-privileged, handicapped and minority groupings represent a large segment of our society. For example, there are almost one million poor people in our society. These people and various minorities, such as those referred to by Senator Norris, may not be adequately dealt with, consulted or protected by our community at large. We should provide that local authorities will have a special competence to deal with these groups. I am not in any way seeking to question the integrity or competence of local authorities in the performance of their duties.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(i) raise revenue through local contribution for specific purposes, provided that the purpose, the amount of revenue, and the method of collection shall have been accepted by the local community in a referendum,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is similar to amendment No. 24 which proposed that local authorities should be empowered to hold referenda. Amendment No. 30 proposes that a local authority, having embarked on a referendum with the goodwill of the community, should be able to make a collection for specific purposes. It would be in the context of some outstanding or some specific essential project.</P>

      <P>I am not sure of the validity of the amendment but I can see what is behind it. It probably underlines the lack in this legislation in relation to any revenue raising role, and the whole question of trying to run the car without any petrol. Perhaps the Minister could indicate the timescale envisaged by him in relation to further legislation being brought forward to provide for proper financing of local authorities &mdash; maybe he will not always be the big bad wolf leaving his children without any food. We should be looking at the timescale for the introduction of further legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I made some comment about this before. If I understand the amendment correctly &mdash; I have looked carefully at it &mdash; a local authority could hold a local referendum and, with a majority in favour, could impose a tax. A system like that would run into some difficulties in practice. It is extremely unlikely that a local authority would get unanimous support from the local community, for example, for a scheme of local contributions, say, by landowners for road repairs. What would they do <Col N="2310" /> then? Would they impose the contributions on the dissenters? How do they scale the contributions? How do they enforce the collection? Any system of taxation needs to be underpinned by a detailed legislative framework covering assessment, levying, collection, enforcement, etc. I am afraid this amendment falls far short on that score. What kind of fundraising has the Senator in mind? What basis of assessment has he in mind? A poll tax, or if not, a new form of rates or property tax? Whatever the Senator has in mind, according to this amendment, it would have to be spelled out in a ballot paper. It is hard enough to get people to vote but if you are asking them to vote to tax themselves and to say yes to it, you would have some chance. I do not believe this has been thought through. It is a nice idea to ask local people to contribute as they do to, say, advancing the school property &mdash; voluntary contributions are made over and above that which comes by way of State grant to provide extra facilities &mdash; but surely a local authority will not have a referendum every time they want a contribution from the community? The hand would be in the fire every week. I would ask the Senator to take his hand out of that fire if at all possible now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is said that we are reduced to this in an effort to find some way to get funding for essential services. That is the unfortunate situation we are in. The second amendment relates to the funds made available from the national lottery for specific purposes provided that that purpose shall have been accepted by the local community in a referendum. I am thinking about some areas that are at present the subject of voluntary contributions such as sporting facilities, whether it is a playing field or club. It really is a matter where the local authority may or may not grant-aid the development. In practice the local community is paying out of its own pocket. This is sad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments of this nature should not have to be put down. The national lottery, however, is not a very satisfactory <Col N="2311" /> body to be looking to for money in the first place. The essential thing, of course, is that the Bill should have financial provisions, but there is not a single financial provision in the Bill. The Minister knows that neither I nor my party is in favour of having this sort of <i>ad hoc</i> Mickey Mouse funding as a major source of funding for local authorities for any community requirement.</P>

They already have the provision in the Local Government (Acceptance of Gifts) Act, 1945, which allows a local authority to adopt schemes for the acceptance of gifts aimed at civic improvements. If that is what the Senator requires, then the provision is already there in law to accommodate what he has in mind.</P>

      <P>(v) Provide a local archives service.</P>
      <P>This is a very worthwhile amendment. It is not one that came to me, Senator Cosgrave or Deputy Howlin out of the blue; it came to us from the Society of Archivists. They presented a very valid argument that there should be a local archive service for local authorities. There is an incredible amount of work done by the local authority but virtually all of it is unorganised. There is no library facility or storing capacity. These data are gathering dust somewhere or may be stored under unsuitable conditions for any period of time. There should be explicit legislative provision to ensure that there would be a local archives service, first, for local authority activities and, second, for activities related to the performance of the duties of the local authority, such as the new heritage centres.</P>
      <P>As a society we have an obligation to ensure that these important historical records are not lost. Many of them were lost in the fire in the Custom House in 1922 when the local authority records were virtually all burned and we were left with a great absence of essential very important and very valuable historical material.</P>
      <P>The amendment is self-explanatory, and I could not imagine the Minister finding any reason to object to it.</P>

      <P>Senator Costello has outlined the intention behind his amendment. Both amendments are roughly similar in character and I hope that the <Col N="2313" /> Minister will support the concept and intention behind them. I raised this on Second Stage and perhaps the Minister could give us some guidance on it. I am sure he has received representations in relation to this matter. I cannot see him opposing the concept of it. Regardless of whether this amendment is the appropriate way of dealing with the matter I think it is important that historical documents and records be kept securely and that local authorities can play their part in that respect. We will await the Minister's response.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much in favour of the principle behind this amendment. Senator Cosgrave spoke about it in his Second Stage contribution. I would have liked, to have responded then. All public bodies &mdash; and this obviously includes local authorities &mdash; have a responsibility to ensure that their records are properly maintained and stored; future historians will need these records if they are to understand how public policy is made. As Senators will be aware, the law governing the protection of public archives is set out in the National Archives Act, 1986 and this provides that the Taoiseach may at the request of any public body, including a local authority, designate that the records of that body be included as part of the National Archives and be accorded the full protection thereof. The Taoiseach may also make an order to include local authorities fully within the terms of the Act. Finally, the Director of the National Archives may require local authorities to send records to the National Archives. Overall I feel that the powers contained within the Act are sufficient to ensure that local archives are properly protected. In addition, the National Archives provide advice on the management, preservation and reproduction of records. Indeed, the National Archives have produced guidance notes for regional and public bodies in which they support the idea of the preservation of records at local archives. Such local archives already exist in some areas. I am very much in favour of ensuring that local records are preserved and that the public <Col N="2314" /> have access to them. The National Archives Act provides the best mechanism for achieving this. The Act sets out detailed conditions regarding the preservation of records which are needed to give effect to what the Senators are trying to achieve with this amendment. The question of the full application of the Act to local authorities is something that I will take up with the National Archives. I can assure the House of my commitment to this issue and I hope Senators will accept the approach I have set out. In those circumstances I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <P>This amendment is an extension of the role of the local authority, part of whose functions, as the Minister has indicated, is to promote economic, social and environmental matters. The amendment seeks to enable a local authority to enter <Col N="2316" /> into partnership with public bodies including local enterprise and local development bodies so that they can participate to a greater degree in local development.

It is a vote of confidence in local authority members that what I am saying to them in this legislation is: &ldquo;I am giving you a job to do and the vehicle to do it.

    <P>This seems to attempt to limit the function of the local authority and to discourage the local authority from involvement in matters by stating they shall not perform any function where there is any likelihood of incurring expenditure or any liability. It is very difficult to understand how a local authority can become involved in any enterprise, certainly any enterprise of substance, where there is not the possibility of incurring expenditure or incurring some liability or undertaking some duty. Like one or two of the sections that I sought to be amended earlier, it seems that it is shying away from the responsibility of providing a full and bold and coherent role of promoting activities in the community of a social economic, environmental and voluntary nature.

In drawing up this programme, the Government shall have close regard to the already published recommendations of the Advisory Expert Committee on Local Government Reform and Reorganisation, in regard to education, health, social welfare, transport and traffic, heritage and amenity, tourism, police, courts, and justice, community information, consumer protection, and development. The programme shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is prepared, and shall be debated in each such House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the programme has been laid before it. No provisional order under this section shall be made until such debate has taken place, and unless a resolution approving of the order has been passed by each such House. The Minister shall annually lay before each House a report of the progress made in implementing transfer and devolution of functions.&rdquo;</P>
