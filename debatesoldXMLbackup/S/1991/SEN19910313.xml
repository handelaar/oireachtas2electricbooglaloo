      <P>I have notice from Senator Haughey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to give sanction to Dublin Corporation to increase the speed and pace of the refurbishment works currently being carried out in Darndale, Dublin 17, under the remedial works scheme.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to fulfil her commitment to construct a second level school at Rathkeale, County Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2" /> I also received notice from Senator Raftery of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to take steps to remove dead and dangerous trees in public places, particularly those along the roadsides.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Doyle of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The urgent need for a paediatric unit at Wexford General Hospital.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to hold a public inquiry into any proposed infill and housing development at West Pier, Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3" /> I regard the matters raised by Senators Haughey, Neville, Raftery, Doyle and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Haughey's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Neville, Raftery, Doyle and Ross may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take item No. 3 &mdash; Destructive Insects and Pests (Amendment) Bill, 1990 &mdash; all Stages, if at all possible, to 6 p.m.  There will be a sos from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. and we will resume discussion on the Independents' motion at 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.  From 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. we will debate item No. 4.  In that connection there will be 20 minutes per opening speaker and 15 minutes for every other Senator.  That debate will conclude at 10 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the business as ordered for today &mdash; but I have two queries to make to the Leader of the House.  I am very unhappy that it is proposed to take all Stages of the Sugar Bill on Friday, which was not agreed by the Whips at the end of last week.  Rather than pre-empt the issue here, would the Leader of the House agree to call a meeting of the Whips after the Order of Business to see if we can sort this out? Also, will the Leader give some indication of what legislation he expects to take between now and the Easter recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I also want to raise the matter of the Friday sitting.  I am not content to leave it to a meeting of the Whips.  I think the House is entitled to an explanation.  We refer often enough to the need for an effective Whips system but it just has not worked this week. There are often difficulties and people can live with that but the idea of at such short notice bringing in a major piece of legislation, trying to rush through all Stages, and also doing it without any <Col N="4" /> notice of a sitting day, is utterly unacceptable. It makes it impossible to plan a proper contribution to the business.  It also makes it impossible to have a Whips system that is effective.</P>
      <P>I recognise, a Chathaoirligh, that this is not on the Order of Business, but I think it is an issue which should be raised today in order to avoid difficulties on another day.  I would certainly want in the House a full and complete explanation from the Leader as to why we find ourselves in this position.  Why the undue haste?  We could all be knocked down in the rush towards privatisation just because somebody in Government feels that is the thing to do at this point.  In the light of that decision to rush business through this week, which always tends to happen towards the end of the term, I would like to get an assurance from the Leader of the House that we will not have a repeat of this over the next two weeks.</P>
      <P>I would like to have a run down on the business that is available to us.  It is our understanding on these benches that we will be dealing with the Environmental Protection Agency Bill at least one day next week, but I noticed that in another place the Minister for Labour was quoted as saying he intended pushing through the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Bill before Easter.  If that happens to be the case, neither the Leader nor the Whip has given any indication to us that the Bill was going to be taken before Easter.  If the Minister for Labour is saying it is going to be, then I think we are entitled to due notice to deal with it.  It would not be acceptable to have that serious legislation on which people wish to make contributions rushed through in a day.</P>
      <P>On the question of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, I have asked the Leader over the past number of weeks to indicate to us how he expects that Bill to be taken; in other words, how much of it he expects to be taken at the first sitting. This is obviously important to people who want to make a contribution to it.  They will need to know how much of the Bill they need to prepare, and people do not have that much time on hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="5" /> I would also ask you, a Chathaoirligh, to indicate to us, as has been asked from these benches last week on a number of occasions, when the Government amendments to this Bill are going to be available. I want to say now for the record that it is not acceptable for us to get the Government amendments to the Environmental Protection Agency Bill next Monday or Tuesday, when the Bill is to be taken the following day.  It does not do justice to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, raise my concern and objections to the way in which this Sugar Bill appears to be ordered for Friday.  I certainly would be very concerned at the idea that this Bill would be rammed through on that day.  That is most unacceptable.  May I ask the Leader if he can give us some indication of what he plans to have taken by way of legislation between now and the end of this term?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to support the protest by the Members about the manner in which the Sugar Bill is being rushed through the House on Friday in view of the manner in which the workers were treated in the past at the other two plants.  It is most important that all Members here be in a position to comment.  I am asking the question through the Chair: why the hurry about passing all Stages of the Bill on Friday?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what has been said about taking the Sugar Bill on Friday because, like a number of other people, I have agreed to take part in some other public functions on Friday and I will not be able to be here.  I regret that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am all in favour of legislation, to work a week for the Seanad, and I have made this clear; but I think the extension of sittings at very short notice, when some of us had planned very serious matters for the day, is regrettable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to bandy clichés, a Chathaoirligh.  I would like to mention two further matters, if I may, and not in any carping sense.  It is something that is often brought up on the Order of Business, namely, the question of the reporting of the business of the House.  I listened on several weekends to RTE's Oireachtas report, which dealt exclusively with the Dáil.  This is in line with certain regrettable elements, because at the time of the last election there was a book published which was a report on the election and it completely excluded the Seanad.  I think that is a pity.</P>
      <P>With regard to item No. 3 &mdash; Destructive Insects and Pests (Amendment) Bill, 1990 &mdash; in the light of the warm reception given to certain remarks of the former Tánaiste at the Ard Fheis this weekend, is it the Government's intention that this should cover their relations with the Progressive Democrats?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <P>Senator Norris is always a hard act to follow.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House if, under the recently accepted rules extending access of this House to distinguished visitors and in anticipation of the release of the Birmingham Six the next meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges might give consideration to extending an invitation to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Committee on Procedure and Privileges you should address.  I wish to point out to you that the manner in which you have raised this matter is not the appropriate way to do justice to the case you are making.  It is made usually in a particular form to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and after that the House may take a decision, with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges making certain recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I bow to your ruling.  My reason for raising it in this fashion is because of the public nature of the case and also because it might afford an opportunity to Members on all sides of the House perhaps to be associated with it.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if we can expect legislation dealing with local government reform that will be relevant to the portion of the local elections on 27 June which we have been told we can expect at this stage.  In view of the importance of local government reform, particularly to this House where five of the six panels are elected through the local government system, will the Leader assure the House there will be no rushing through of any legislation?  We might even request that it be initiated in the Seanad and thence go to the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was late coming into the Chamber but I want to support my colleague, Senator O'Toole, in registering a strong protest with the Leader of the House about the decision to sit on Friday to discuss the Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Bill.  This is an issue on which I would have liked to say a considerable amount.  I can find it possible to be here on any occasion, given reasonable notice. I actually assumed it had been agreed and we would be presented with something like this in the way it was done.  I want to say I am disappointed the general willingness to run this House by agreement seems to have been put aside.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is: why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning queried the calling of Whips to discuss aspects of the debate on the Sugar Bill and certainly that can be done; there is no question about that.  He also asked what other matters will have to be taken before Easter.  I can say, on the information given to me, that the Sugar Bill is one such measure, as is the Social Welfare Bill and the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Bill is another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="9" /> However, I think the wise thing, as Senator Manning said, is that the Whips would have a meeting this evening to discuss proposals for the business this week and perhaps for next week also.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole asked about the Sugar Bill and the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.  I understood that amendments are still coming in at present, so I am not aware now of how it will be dealt with, in what stages it will be taken, how it will be controlled and so on.  I will make inquiries and inform the Senator.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton asked about the Sugar Bill and he made a protest.  Senator Ryan indicated the haste with which it is being taken, as did Senator Norris.  Certainly, some Independents were aware that it was proposed to take it this week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point that it was not common knowledge, but certainly it was available to the Whips as it was given out by our Whips on Friday afternoon to all the other Whips.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Sugar Bill taken on Friday, the Government are most anxious that the Stock Exchange flotation of Greencore Holdings, the proposed holding company of Siúicre Éireann, should take place in the next few weeks.  It has been pointed out to me that if the flotation does not proceed by early April, it will be delayed for several months because of the need to comply with the Stock Exchange rule which necessitates the preparation of audited accounts to the end of March this year. A delay would, therefore, be undesirable as it would mean that the flotation would prejudice the decision already taken to float Irish Life later this year.  There are serious doubts whether the Irish market <Col N="10" /> has the capacity to take on board two major issues such as a short period.  As things stand, Siúicre Éireann flotations has been signalled for some time and it is expected by the investing institutions in the next few weeks.  Any delay in proceeding would undermine the perception of potential investors as to the commitment of the Government on this issue.</P>
      <P>With regard to the need to deal with the Bill this week, the position is that much of the substantial legal work pertaining to the flotation cannot proceed until the Bill is enacted.  In particular, the necessary legal power to acquire and dispose of shares in the holding company is urgently required.  Also, the Stock Exchange is unable to clear much of the documentation in relation to the listing in the absence of the necessary legislation. If the Bill is not enacted this week the timetable for flotation in the next weeks cannot be met.  While it is understood that Senators will naturally wish to have a full&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to explain to the House the Government thinking behind this.  While it is understood that Senators will naturally wish to have a full debate on this important Bill, the position is that most of the matters that gave rise to the long and detailed debate in the Dáil have been settled and are no longer an issue.  The main concerns&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the Dáil related to <Col N="11" /> the rights of employees.  As a result of a ministerial amendment and certain assurances from the company, the matters giving rise to concern have been resolved. Indeed, the company and unions signed an agreement which has been lodged with the Labour Relations Commission. Effectively, the matters which gave rise to concern in the Dáil are no longer contentious and thus are unlikely to give rise to a detailed debate.  That is by way of explanation for the Senators.  They may not be happy with it but that is the position as I understand it.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris also referred to the Sugar Bill.  He also referred to some aspect of broadcasting, which is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  On item 3, not for the first time he is being mischievous.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney raised a matter which was a Committee on Procedure and Privileges matter.  Senator Doyle raised the question of local government reform and asked when the Bill might be available. It certainly will be available in the next session and it might possibly be available at the end of April or in May.</P>

    <Title>Destructive Insects and Pests (Amendment) Bill, 1990: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed amendments in the Bill have two main purposes; first, to bring up to date the level of penalties provided in the original Act; and, secondly, to strengthen certain provisions in the original Act as regards the making of orders.</P>
      <P>There is no basic change in the main structure of the 1958 Act.  It has served its purpose well as the main vehicle for controlling the entry of plant material into this country and for dealing with destructive insects and pests.  The Act gives wide powers to the Minister by way of orders to be made by him to prevent the bringing into the State of destructive insects and pests.  It also gives powers to the Minister to make orders to prevent the spread of destructive insects and pests which are found in the country.  Many orders have been made under the 1958 Act and are operative.  There is also a provision in the Act of 1958 in regard to spraying of potatoes.  This deals with a situation where a particularly destructive pest, such as Colorado Beetle, is found in a potato crop.  The purpose of spraying would be to ensure that the pest did not spread to surrounding crops or gain a permanent foothold in the country.</P>
      <P>This country is fortunate in having a relatively high standard of plant health and in remaining free from a number of destructive insects and pests found on the Continent and internationally.  This fortunate position is attributable to the fact that our island situation forms a natural barrier against the migration of destructive insects and pests and also to the fact that for many years we have operated a strict phytosanitary control on imports of plants and plant products.  In the case of some of the more important insects and pests here, we have statutory controls in operation to prevent their spread.</P>
      <P>Since 1980 our national plant health scheme has changed to a harmonised EC scheme.  While this arrangement removed the former licensing control on imports from other member states it continued the procedure of phytosanitarty certification and import check inspections, as well as a number of special measures to safeguard individual member states from particular destructive insects and pests of which they are free.</P>
      <P>At present time the Community is considering the plant health controls which will operate in the Internal Market after 1992.  A good deal of negotiation has yet to be gone through before the control system will take final shape.  Our objective in these negotiations is, of course, that while having full regard to the implications of 1992 and afterwards, we will be striving to ensure that any changes in procedure will not leave us open to unacceptable risks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanatory and financial memorandum circulated with the Bill gives information about the provisions of the different sections.  I would, however, like <Col N="15" /> to make some comments on what is being provided.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that a person who contravenes or fails to comply with an order made under certain sections of the 1958 Act shall be guilty of an offence. This provision remedies a deficiency in the earlier Act which did not specify that such an offence would be created.  Section 2 of the Bill also strengthens the Minister's powers to make orders under sections 2 and 3 of the original Act.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill extends the area of offence in section 8 of the 1958 Act; that is, the section dealing with the spraying of potatoes.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is the central purpose of the Bill in that it updates the provisions for penalties in the 1958 Act.  The 1958 Act provided for fines of £10 in some cases and £20 in others.  These amounts are very much out of date considering the change in the value of money in the meantime. On the advice of the Attorney General, we are now providing for fines on summary convictions up to a maximum of £1,000 or for imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or a combination of both fine and imprisonment. These are serious punishments but we are dealing with a serious matter.  Enormous damage could be done by the illegal bringing into this country of material contaminated by insects or pests which could ruin a particular sector of agricultural crops with great damage to the producers and traders involved in the business.</P>
    <P>Costs of compensation could also arise as well as costly controls to be put in place and maintained to contain the outbreaks. In these circumstances the penalties are seen in proportion.  It will, of course, continue to be the policy of the Department and the advisory service of Teagasc to inform and advise farmers about the risks of diseases and pests and the necessity for avoiding their entry here on products brought in.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides for liability where the offender is a body corporate. This is a standard modern provision recommended by the Attorney <Col N="16" /> General.  Sections 6 and 7 are procedural provisions.</P>
    <P>The policy will continue to improve and operate every possible safeguard against entry of destructive insects and pests within the limits of EC obligations, and, in the event of such an insect or pest getting through the net, to take the quickest and most effective steps to prevent it getting a foothold or spreading within the country.  This Bill will help to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>The Bill is of special significance to me because of my responsibilities in regard to the horticulture industry.  An Bord Glas have been given the task of developing the horticulture industry so that we can greatly reduce our dependence on imports with benefit to the whole economy and to employment.  An Bord Glas also have the task of developing the export trade in horticulture.  We already have in horticulture some very valuable exports. We have the possibility of extending very greatly our export trade in other sectors. For example, there are great possibilities for substantial increases in exports of hardy nursery stock.  That is the business of growing shrubs and trees for resale to garden centres, to public authorities and indeed to large-scale private users of this material in other countries.  It is of vital importance that we retain a high standard of plant health and that we keep our controls at the highest possible level of efficiency.</P>
    <P>I would like, to pay tribute to the staff in the Department of Agriculture and Food and in other State organisations which have responsibility for the formulation and operation of these very important controls.  They are doing a good job and I would like to compliment them.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the Seanad for a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister and I am glad he is with us for this small but very important legislation.  We cannot do without <Col N="17" /> modern technology and chemicals in agriculture, horticulture or animal production. There are many people who would not agree with me.  The Green movement is particularly concerned with the use of modern technology in food production.  A considerable lobby is building up, anxious that we produce and consume food produced without the aid of chemicals.  Unfortunately, the consumer has been taken in by some of this information and has no great protection in the matter.</P>
      <P>Recently I picked up the results of a survey carried out in Britain by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries on analysis of residues in samples of food. They sampled staple dietary materials such as bread, milk and potatoes, fruit and vegetables and other miscellaneous foods.  It was not a small sample.  They analysed 760 samples of bread, milk and potatoes; fruit and vegetables, 667 samples; miscellaneous foods, 458 samples; animal products, 582 samples; cereal and cereal products, 266; imported and other foods, 1,536 samples and so on.</P>
      <P>The interesting thing is that they also included in this survey what are, rather falsely called, health foods nowadays. Health foods give the impression that these foods have some health-giving attributes. It is a good selling gimmick but having gone through all of these foodstuffs and many others I did not mention such as dried fruit, animal feedstuffs and so on, the surprising thing that emerged was that the foods that had the highest percentage of undesirable residues were those classified as health foods.  Some 60 per cent, or 202 samples out of 339, were found to have such residues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask you, who is codding whom?  Is the consumer not being exploited by being charged a premium price for a product that is supposed to convey some kind of health-giving qualities above and beyond those contained in food that is produced conventionally?  That is the message that is going out quite clearly to the consumer and I have already called for some form of official certification of organically produced food.  Consumers are paying a premium price for what is alleged to be <Col N="18" /> organically produced food.  I am sure most of it is, but there is nothing to stop chancers, of which every society has a fair number, from getting conventionally produced food and selling it as organically produced food and making a nice mark-up in the process.  In the interests of protecting the consumer from exploitation, and indeed genuine producers from having their good name sullied by chancers, we need some form of official certification of how food is produced.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill which is overdue. There are too many people who are prepared to damage or endanger the wellbeing of other producers and I am very glad to note that the penalties are being increased substantially.  We all know that there is a certain percentage of farmers who still do not dip their sheep, giving rise to pockets of sheep scab which endanger flocks all round and which place animals under considerable stress and pain.  The Minister rightly said that the country is fortunate in having a relative high standard of plant health.  That is not entirely due to the fact that we are an island nation.  It is only right that we should compliment our officials in the Department of Agriculture and Food who have worked assiduously over the years to protect the quality of our plants and animals with some success.</P>
    <P>However, we are now running into a new situation where, as the Minister said, our national plant health scheme has changed since 1980 to harmonise with the European Community scheme and it is right and proper that that should be so. We all know, however, that there are going to be considerable difficulties in the phytosanitary area as a result of the greater freedom of movement of various products and of people and services throughout the Community after 1992. This freedom of movement will bring its own risks.  The building of the Channel Tunnel itself will create difficulties and we will have to be more vigilant at ports to protect the health status of our plants and animals.  I note the Minister is aware of that and I am glad he is.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that a person who contravenes or fails to comply with an <Col N="19" /> order made under certain sections of the 1958 Act shall be guilty of an offence. I welcome that.  It is overdue.  Careless people do not have the right to endanger the livelihoods of other producers or the quality of their stock or plants.  In section 3 the Bill extends the area of offence in section 8 of the 1958 Act which is the section dealing with the spraying of potatoes, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>We would have a very difficult situation on our hands if we had to deal with the Colorado Beetle.  The Colorado Beetle is a small insect and it is not easy, despite the vigilance of our port officers, to detect it.  Much larger organisms can escape officers at ports.  It is right that we should have a strategy for dealing with the beetle if it happens to come into this country. Beetles can also come in in timber and we must be able to deal with that situation if it should happen.</P>
    <P>I was amazed the fines had not been updated despite all the inflation we have had between 1958 and 1990 and that we are only now getting round to adjusting the fines that can be imposed.  Who would take notice of a fine of £20 and £1,000 nowadays is not a very hefty fine, either. When one reads through the speech however and finds that the guilty person might also be responsible for compensation that could arise as well as for the costly controls put into place and maintained to contain the outbreaks, then I think it becomes a really effective deterrent.</P>
    <P>I note also that the Minister said that Teagasc will have responsibility for advising and informing farmers.  I would point out to the Minister that Teagasc &mdash; while it is only right that it should &mdash; are under very severe pressure having lost roughly 30 per cent of their staff in recent years as a result of Government cutbacks.  Considering the ever-increasing workload and diminishing number of staff officers who not only have to give advice and information but who also have to collect part of their own wages and salaries from the people they serve, I wonder if they can devote sufficient time to advising and informing farmers about insecticides and <Col N="20" /> pesticides and various other things they should be using.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides for liability where the offender is a body corporate. I am glad of that.  They are not always innocent in matters like that.  It is not always the private individual who is the offender.  It is time that bodies corporate were brought into the net and held responsible for any omissions or failure to implement measures they are supposed to implement.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that there are great possibilities for substantial increases of exports of hardy nursery stock.  I am sure there are.  We have been talking about this for 50 years or more. It is like faith without good works &mdash; not worth a damn.  The Minister has a glorious opportunity to do something about it.  We now have An Bord Glas. The market does exist.  The Dutch who are the main providers of such material have a disease problem.  Their country is so intensively cultivated that they do not have the health status and the healthy soil we enjoy.  That is a matter that we could and should exploit.  They do not have our year-round climate nor the mild winter we enjoy.  Bulb growers in Holland, for instance, have to cover entire areas of tulip bulbs with straw to protect them from the frost over the winter months and to remove the straw again in spring.  These are the kind of costs we do not have to cope with.  Yet, we never get around to exploiting those potential markets.</P>
    <P>We have the disease-free status which is very important.  We also have a reputation that often we do not always deserve.  Yesterday I was lecturing to 15 Danish students who are spending a couple of months in University College Cork.  One of them asked me after the lecture why we are always talking about our green image and our freedom from pollution.  I said: &ldquo;Why do you ask that question?&rdquo;  He replied: &ldquo;I came here thinking that Ireland was a very clean country and everywhere I go I see pollution: litter, abandoned cars and various other things.  I do not think it is a pollution-free country.&rdquo;  He was right of <Col N="21" /> course but that is minor pollution compared to pollution from heavy industry. At the same time, it is not good enough. We have to raise our standards.  We can, however, say with certainty that we have a better health status in plants and in animals than they enjoy on the Continent of Europe.  That should give us an opportunity to exploit markets there but these markets are not going to come to us.  We must do something about going to them. I welcome and support this Bill and I hope it will get a quick and easy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>A few weeks ago we debated the importance of banning pesticides and sprays.  Today we are taking the other end of the stick &mdash; the Destructive Insects and Pests (Amendment) Bill, 1990.  In that debate we made certain recommendations, advised on the careful use of pesticides and sprays and at the wind-up of the debate the Minister announced he was withdrawing the sale of strychnine from the market.  We were all very pleased with that because we felt we had taken a step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill which is an updating of the 1958 Act.  The Minister has assured us that the 1958 Act is serving its purpose well.  I believe it is because over the years the Government of the day have been able to act immediately and to take corrective action under the Act whenever we were threatened by an outbreak of disease.  We are fortunate that we have not had many outbreaks with the exception of a few in glasshouse nurseries during the eighties.  That problem was caused by tobacco whitefly which was successfully eradicated on both occasions.  On a few occasions the Department officials had to intercept consignments of imported coniferous timber which had not been properly debarked and some of the consignments were refused entry and were returned. Like Senator Raftery, I would like to congratulate the officials on their vigilance because on their shoulders rests the responsibility for preserving the high health status for which we have become <Col N="22" /> renowned.  It is very important that we preserve that at all times.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate that because of our island situation we escape the migratory movements of many destructive insects and pests, which often create havoc for farmers and horticulturalists on mainland Europe and can destroy entire crops in a very short time.  They do not respect national frontiers and can spread from one country to another very quickly. Over the years we have operated very strict controls on imports of plants and plant products.  For a country so dependent on agriculture it is only right that this is so.  The production of high quality vegetables, meat and other agri-related products is of immense importance to our entire economy.  The agri-food business amounted to £3.3 billion, or 21.3 per cent of total exports in 1989, so we should make no apologies for protecting that business and for maintaining a good standard of plant health.</P>
    <P>The Colorado Beetle which the Minister mentioned in his speech has always been a source of great worry to potato growers.  Indeed, it is important that growers be vigilant and protect their crops and their livelihood from this pest. There is a specific provision in the 1958 Act covering this pest.  In recent years, a huge number of garden centres have opened.  This trend is very welcome because it shows that people have at least become aware of the importance of planting trees and shrubs.  In doing so, they are beautifying the countryside.  The gardens of new houses are now landscaped properly and some beautiful shrubs have been planted.  This is a very welcome development and it creates valuable employment in the nursery business.  I understand we have built up an export business in this area also and that is to be welcomed.  I am sure Bord Glas will develop and improve this line of business over the years.</P>
    <P>Organic farming is an aspect we can promote but it is not something that will make progress unless a far greater price is paid for such produce.  It will take considerable organising to get farmers to go into this kind of business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" /> Over the years we have spent money on TB eradication, trying to get rid of the disease from our national herd.  Departmental officials have worked very hard to try to get on top of that disease.  As regards control of foot and mouth disease they were always present at our ports and they made sure that dreadful disease was kept out of our country.  The more recent BSE scare has hit our farming community. We must be very careful because of the very bad publicity our cattle and meat exports got last year.  We must be vigilant at all times.</P>
    <P>In yesterday's <i>Evening Press</i> there was a report stating that this year we were going to be invaded by daddy-long-legs, spiders and other creepy crawlies.  I hope they do not do too much damage and that we will be able to take immediate action to minimise any damage caused.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  As I said, it consolidates the 1958 Act.  Section 4, updates the provision in relation to fines.  This is necessary because the fines provided for in the 1958 Act are now out of date. We now provide for fines on summary conviction up to a maximum of £1,000. It is only right that we would update them because fines of £10 or £20 are really out of date.  I welcome the Bill and wish it a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I surprise myself by making contribution to this Bill which I would normally find a bit esoteric for my tastes but having received the Order of Business on Friday, I was reading the paper on Saturday &mdash;<i>The Cork Examiner</i> to the uninitiated &mdash; and it had a very interesting article headed: &ldquo;Getting back to Nature for safe pest control&rdquo;.  I was wondering whether what was said here is a matter of interest to the Department and whether it was part of their policy in regard to insect control.  It refers to research in UCC which concentrates on natural methods of pest control, and in the context of other debates we are all in favour of natural methods, are we not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Biologists in UCC are investigating the feasibility of developing a particular kind of fish, the Goldsinny Wrasse, which <Col N="24" /> offers exciting potential for sea lice reduction.  Even more interesting, is the use of the bat and owl population to control pests.  The owl population, it appears, is under decline because much of its natural habitat is derelict &mdash; the dramatic reduction in the number of ruined houses and so on &mdash; and yet the owl has a legendary effectiveness against the control of mice and rats.  In folklore the bat has a very poor image and people still persist with old wives tales about bats flying into your hair and so on, but it appears the bat is one of the best insect hunters in existence.  The bottom line is that this would be a more natural way of controlling pests and insects.  It is not suggested as an alternative but it is a supplementary method which would reduce the considerable amount of money we spend each year on pesticides. I recommend this article to the Minister. In fact, I wonder whether it comprises any part of departmental policy.  It was in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> on 9 March 1991.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members in welcoming this legislation, and I also welcome the Minister and his officials to the House this afternoon.  I agree it is a very important matter from the point of view of agriculture, and the economy that we should make every effort through legislation and otherwise to protect the very good plant health status we have in the country.  During the coming decade our ability to market our agricultural produce will depend very much on it being associated with coming from a clean environment which we can stand over and say that the produce which comes from Ireland is of the highest quality and can command a premium price. That must be one of the mechanisms in our defence against the assault on farm incomes from developments within the EC and through GATT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note what the Minister said in relation to the Colorado Beetle and I share those sentiments.  It is one pest that causes much concern and I congratulate the officials in the Department and the advisers in Teagasc for their vigilance over many years in protecting the country <Col N="25" /> from such a devastating pest.  I congratulate them also for their viligance at airports and ports.  The officers concerned have been extremely effective in keeping out insects and pests which by their very nature are quite difficult to detect and keep out of the country.</P>
    <P>I would be somewhat concerned about virus diseases.  I realise it is impossible for the Minister to legislate to keep out viruses which may be airborne or carried in by animals or birds.  There are several diseases which are potentially devastating and which have already appeared in Britain having come there from the Continent &mdash; rhizomania in beet is one in particular which has led to whole fields being ploughed up in East Anglia and they can never grow beet there again. The root of the beet is totally destroyed. It would be quite simple to import this through seed, for instance, which is grown in the south of France.</P>
    <P>Secondhand machinery is often imported from the east of England.  What guarantee have we that particles of soil and so on that could introduce very undesirable crop and animal diseases will not adhere to these machines?  Several years ago, when the Irish ploughing team competed in the World Ploughing Championships in Austria, they had to go through very rigorous procedures in relation to how machinery was cleaned and presented before they were allowed into that country with their machinery. We must exercise the same vigilance.</P>
    <P>There is another disease in cereals which has spread gradually westwards from mainland Europe, that is, barley yellow mosaic virus.  That is very serious for cereal growers.  Fortunately, some varieties have been developed which have resistance to that virus but, again, it underlines the need for us to be vigilant.</P>
    <P>The classic example of all is rabies and how it can be stopped from spreading westwards.  As Senator Raftery said, we are fortunate in being an island as that confers certain advantages, but it does not remove the need to ensure that the very valuable asset we have of being a country producing good food from a clean environment is protected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="26" /> There are implications for us on the plant health side &mdash; I am sure the Minister is quite well aware of this &mdash; in relation to what is going to happen in 1992 and under the GATT.  Plant health is part of the 1992 agenda and part of the GATT agenda.  While we would welcome the movement towards the Single Market, it is very important that everything is adjusted upwards to the highest standard rather than downwards when it comes to animal and plant health.  It is notable that we adopt a policy of eradication rather than containment in most of these matters but, quite frequently, it is a policy of containment on the Continent and that might not be to our advantage.  I understand the point that countries cannot establish artificial barriers which will limit access but there are such profound national interests involved here that we are entitled to protect our plants and livestock.  I realise livestock are not a part of this Bill although one could assume that pests are, in some ways, livestock.</P>
    <P>We need to be aware of the importance which other countries attach to these matters.  I do not know if the Minister has been to New Zealand.  I know some of his departmental officials have.  If you travel there with Air New Zealand when the plane doors are opened officers come in with aerosol sprays and spray up and down the plane in the knowledge that will kill all the pests on the plane.  I doubt very much if it is effective in killing the pests but it creates an awareness of the importance of the matter.  It is quite noticeable also in New Zealand that frequently, in addition to the normal controls exercised by emigration officers, agricultural officers are present and everybody must pass by them.  I realise that the Department's officers do a very efficient job at the seaports and airports. People are made aware, when they enter the country, of the need to report to them but it depends to a degree on goodwill. I am not sure to what extent they can positively intervene but our visitors need to be made very well aware that this is an agricultural country, that we depend for a lot of our trade on the food which <Col N="27" /> we produce and that we are quite determined to protect our food from any possibility of taint through pests or disease.</P>
    <P>The other point mentioned by Senator Raftery was in relation to Teagasc.  I share some of the sentiments which he expressed.  Teagasc have a fairly important role to play in this matter and they must be given the resources to exercise that role and their wider remit in terms of advice and so on.  I welcome the extra money which has been made available to them this year but they are still in need of very substantial assistance.  I want to see that service maintained and upgraded as part of the overall strategy to keep our disease-free status and to assist our farmers.</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in welcoming the Bill. The Progressive Democrats wholeheartedly support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  We are blessed with a very high standard of health in our plant and animal products. In relation to plants there are a number of reasons for this.  First, as a number of Senators have already said, our location and the fact that we are an island has, undoubtedly, contributed very significantly to keeping a number of very important pests and diseases out of this country.  The second reason is, to a large extent, due to the efforts and work of the various experts in agriculture in this country over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a very fine tradition of agricultural expertise, particularly in this area, going back to the work of the late Professor McKay and the late Professor Loughnane.  Some of these people were pioneers.  Professor McKay wrote four or five books on plant pathology which was a major achievement in the forties.  These books would be dated now but in those days it was a magnificent achievement. Similarly, there were experts on insects and so on, for example, the late Eugene McMahon, John Carroll and others, who were pioneers in their own way and made a tremendous contribution to agriculture which has not been fully appreciated.  The <Col N="28" /> experts in the Department of Agriculture, in the research department of Teagasc and, indeed, the experts out in the fields, the Teagasc advisers, continue to play a vital role in ensuring that the health of our plant material is at a very high standard.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that we will face an increased risk of importing plant diseases and pests with the developments in trade. The more materials we import the greater the risk of importing undesirable pests and pathogens that attack plants.  Trade will develop.  The Channel Tunnel has been mentioned.  We all look forward to increased tourist activity and so on, but we have to keep in mind that as the numbers of tourists who come to the country increase there is also, as it were, a certain amount of extra risk associated with them.  We need to take precautions to ensure that does not lead to a proliferation of undesirable material.</P>
    <P>I have expressed concern about the use of pesticides already.  I repeat much of that concern today.  The controls on the use of pesticides still leave a lot to be desired.  There is no obligation on the people who use them to have any expertise nor is there an obligation on them to read the label or the instructions.  That is a matter of concern and I would be interested to hear the Minister's response.  I am also concerned about the health implications from the excessive use of these products.  The reality is that the full health implications of persistent exposure to small amounts of pesticides are not understood.  Some estimates from America suggest that as much as 1 per cent of cancers arise due to the use of pesticides.  I know that one can argue these cases in a number of ways and from a number of different angles but, one way or the other, we should be very concerned about the use of pesticides because of the health implications.</P>
    <P>We should also be concerned about maintaining our image as a producer of pure foods.  The image which this country has in the European market as a producer of wholesome, clean, green products is a very valuable asset.  It is vital that we <Col N="29" /> protect that reputation and guard it jealously. I agree with Senator Dardis when he said that our objective should be to have the highest possible standards and if there are changes in Europe they should be directed towards bringing European standards up to Irish standards rather than forcing us to reduce our standards. We should be persistent and dogged as regards protecting our standards and reputation.  There is a tendency in Europe to move towards policies of containment of certain diseases.  That is shortsighted and foolish and, as time goes by, the pure image of our food products will prove to be invaluable.  We will be able to obtain a considerable premium for our products based on that.  If we ensure that nothing happens to damage that image, we will be paid rich dividends in time to come.</P>
    <P>I share some of the concern expressed by Senator Raftery when he spoke about the necessity for certification of organically produced produce.  It is very important that the consumer be in no doubt that when he or she purchases what is labelled as organically produced produce that produce has met certain standards.  I am concerned at the evidence he brought forward in relation to foods which are sold as health products which indicated that those products had higher levels of pesticides/herbicides residue in them than had food taken from the general food pool.  That is a matter of great concern.</P>
    <P>I welcome this very desirable measure and I hope it will go through the House without any problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Kirk, and compliment him on introducing this important legislation which covers the health life of plants and the whole area of food production.  I compliment the officials in the Department. The Department of Agriculture have served us well.  If we go back to the time of the war years when there was foot and mouth disease, they were able to take protective measures at ports and airports. Down the years, whatever the strength of the Departmental staff, they always <Col N="30" /> had an interest in protecting us against the importation of insects and pests.  The general public are aware of the Department's achievements down the years and it is important to recognise this.</P>
      <P>As I said in relation to another debate, there is need for balance.  A farmer looks for protection and those involved in horticulture look for protection.  There are different views and approaches on the question of the control of rabbits, grey crows, pigeons, rats, mice, mink and seal. The minute we start talking about control there is nearly a revolt by a section of the people who believe it is right to maintain and protect some species.  There is a conflict. Recently I wrote to a firm that manufactures breakfast cereals and I suggested to them that they were spending vast amounts of money on advertising.  I would love to establish how they deal with vermin or pests and what chemicals they use.  How can they convince the public that in the production of imported breakfast cereals or powdered soups harmful chemicals have not been used?</P>
      <P>Massive resources are needed to protect our plants and animals.  The protection afforded by another country was brought home to me when I disembarked from an aeroplane in Miami.  I had one orange in my bag the officials at the airport took the orange and questioned me at length.  I said it was a lot of fuss to make over one orange but the official said the economy of the state of Miami depended on oranges and it would be foolish of him to allow anything to be imported that would endanger the economy of his state.  He was right.  Even if the legislation is perfect, do the Minister and the Department have the necessary resources to protect us?  Borders are disappearing and controls are disappearing. How can the general public be assured there is control and protection?  We have a better chance of establishing controls and measures as far as our own food chain is concerned.</P>
      <P>Overall, the Bill is welcome.  I wish the Minister and his officials well and I hope he is successful.  The community will be behind the introduction of this Bill and I wish it success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot resist suggesting that I have yet to find legislation that is perfect, even though I accept that in this area our record in protecting our animal and plant health status has been particularly good relative to other nations.  I will go no further than that.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill but, like many other speakers, it is the broader aspects I will speak about.  I feel it was because of the importance of agriculture to our nation that we joined the EC in 1973.  There were other considerations of course, such as being part of Europe geographically, but the implications for our agricultural sector and agri-business sector was a paramount consideration in opting for Europe and proceeding down that road and being a full and equal member of the Twelve which we are now.  As an aside, the figure of 20 per cent or 21 per cent was given in relation to agricultural exports. Our net agricultural exports are nearer to 40 per cent when you consider the sourcing of the raw material.  The point being made by all of us is that there is an enormous contribution made to this country, to our exports, to our GNP, by agriculture and the agri-business sector. I am extremely concerned about what I see as the levelling down of standards in the Single Market when it comes to animal and plant health status.  There is a growing concern in the country among the agricultural scientific and veterinary sections generally about what the final decisions will be in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incidentally, the Minister is very welcome this afternoon.  It is nice to see a Minister of State here in his own right, in control of his own brief with legislation and not just part of the rent-a-Minister syndrome that I am afraid pervades this House and which has done so through many governments over the years.  When they cannot find the Minister, a Minister of State is shoved into the House.  I once used the expression &ldquo;wheeled in here with a script thrust into his hand&rdquo; and some of my colleagues on the other side <Col N="32" /> of the House still remind me of that statement. The Minister is very welcome with this Bill that deals specifically with his own brief.  I congratulate him on it because we have no difficulty with the specifics of the Bill this afternoon.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said: &ldquo;At the present time the community is considering the plant health controls which will operate in the Internal Market after 1992.&rdquo;  It is now March 1991.  We have until the end of 1992 to know what surprises, what bag of tricks the mysterious bodies in the Community have who are considering the plant health controls. You could add in the animal and plant health controls that will operate in the Internal Market after 1992.  None of us can over-emphasise the importance of the outcome of these considerations and it is to that I would like to direct my few words this afternoon.</P>
    <P>Who in the Community is doing the consideration?  It is very important that the profound national interest, as one Senator referred to it, in relation to the Irish position is fully understood by those doing this consideration.  The outcome of these negotiations and the final deal that will be made in relation to the animal and plant health controls that will operate in the Internal Market impact on every aspect of agriculture and the environment in this country.  Why should we have to accept a levelling down of standards? Can we insist on the rest of the Community coming up to our standards in this area?  It is little to ask for as a nation that joined the Community primarily because of what we had to contribute in the agricultural and agri-business arena.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food and the officials have done an excellent job in protecting the health status of this island in terms of animal and plant health status in the past few decades.  Are we to be asked now to abandon all the controls at our borders and ports?  Whatever we accept and whatever we insist on in terms of standards in this area in post-1992 Europe, we should ask our colleagues in the northern part of this island to stand with us because it is as an island <Col N="33" /> we should treat this issue given the importance of island status in animal and plant health rather than just in relation to the Republic versus a UK situation. When we talk about animal and plant health status, it is in the context of an all-Ireland position and I am sure Members would accept that.</P>
    <P>Is there any reason why we should accept a levelling down of standards?  Is there not an extremely good case to be made for totally different treatment of Ireland, and perhaps also the United Kingdom &mdash; I will let them make their own case &mdash; to be used as a foundation stock island for the Community post-1992? With the best will in the world and with the strictest controls in the world there will be outbreaks of animal and plant diseases on mainland Europe, as there have been over the last decades, outbreaks of different diseases which, mercifully, we have escaped in the main. If there are epidemics of any kind on mainland Europe is there not a tremendous advantage in having a foundation stock in the Community that will be free of that particular disease?  In other words, the very fact that we are the last island nation in the Community given the Channel Tunnel, could we not perform a major service to our EC colleagues by being treated as a foundation stock island in relation to animal and plant health generally?</P>
    <P>That is the case I put this afternoon.  It might not be completely in the spirit of the Internal Market, and I accept that is probably what the Minister will tell me, but as I understand it generally and from what the Minister said this afternoon, the matter is still under consideration.  My plea is that our island nation status should get particular recognition not just because it will protect the animal and health status of this nation now but because we have a particular role we could play in the Europe of the future in the event of any major epidemic or disease in either the animal or plant health fields.  I think we could offer a unique service to the European Community in this area and I would ask the Minister to pursue that line as strongly <Col N="34" /> and vigorously as possible.  If we do not achieve that situation in terms of the final outcome of the considerations that are going on in this area at the moment, I am quite sure the Department of Agriculture and Food will find it very difficult to climb down and abandon the safeguards they have had in place for so many years.</P>
    <P>I had occasion in the past few years to draw up a policy on pig production and in researching it I was looking at the whole area of increasing our breeding stock in relation to pigs.  There is one area that fascinated me and that is that the corona positive pigs were not allowed to be imported into this country because we were corona free in Ireland.  The corona virus in pigs equates to the common cold, nothing more and nothing less, it is not a big deal.  It can be specifically tested for now which it could not in the past.  I think it was confused with an enteritis or a similar disease.  You could not specifically isolate corona positive from other problems in pigs.  Now you can and that has been possible for some time, but there is still a ban on importing pigs even from the UK if they are corona positive.  From 1 January 1993 all the corona positive pigs in the world can land on our shores and, to my understanding, I do not think the Department of Agriculture and Food will be able to do a thing about it given the road we are travelling on and the changes in controls that appear to be on the horizon in this area. That is only one example.</P>
    <P>At the moment if you travel either to the UK or to the Continent with animals in a lorry be they cattle or horses or whatever, you cannot bring them back into the country with hay or straw on the lorry, with bedding on the floor of the lorry or any hay in the lorry.  Obviously there are good reasons for that in protecting the plant health status of our country and I can understand that fully but all the controls in that area will be abandoned on 1 January 1993.  I am talking about areas that would not even be headline grabbing.  I am not talking about major diseases that really capture the media.  These controls which are in <Col N="35" /> place now for very good reason apparently will have to be abandoned because we have accepted blindly the fate of the Internal Market in relation to the animal and health plant status of our island.</P>
    <P>I question severely the road we appear to be travelling.  I know there are hundreds in this country like me who wonder if we will wake up some morning exposing the health of our animals and plants to all sorts of unacceptable risks.  I think I borrowed that expression from the Minister's speech.  He said &ldquo;We are striving to ensure that any changes in procedure will not leave us open to unacceptable risks.&rdquo;  We are with the Minister fully on that; any risk that reduces our standards is unacceptable.  If the Minister agrees with that and puts it on the record today we will take tremendous comfort from the outcome of the negotiation that are going on in the Community in this area.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas where problems have raised their head through different sectors of agriculture.  Apparently it must be the same committee, or it is the same procedure, that is considering the plant health status of the Community post-1992 who are also looking at the veterinary status and the veterinary implications for the Internal Market.</P>
    <P>In relation to horse production, EVA and CEM will not be notifiable diseases, if I am using the correct expression and I am subject to correction on that.  They will not be among the diseases where we can prohibit importation.  Again, that is a lowering of standards.  There will be voluntary treaties and voluntary agreements entered into in relation to some of these diseases.  Perhaps that is the avenue we could travel in relation to plant health as well.  I know in relation to animal health that voluntary tripartite arrangements are being entered into.  In fact, five nations are coming together to protect horse production.  They were not able to get the relevant committees in the Community to accept their concerns in relation to certain diseases so they are entering into a voluntary code of practice, or a voluntary agreement, to protect production in the countries in question.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="36" /> Will we look to this whole procedure of voluntary codes of practice to protect our island nation?  I would like the Minister to point out to us in his reply who is considering the plant and health controls, what structures are they being considered through and who in our Department and in our Government generally has an input into those considerations and the line of the Government on the matter.  I would like the Minister to tell the House the line of the Government in relation to the negotiations and considerations that are going on in this area at the moment. Are they taking a very strong line in not leaving us open to any unacceptable risks?  Does the Minister consider a reduction in standards from the present level to be an unacceptable risk?  Will he be pursuing a particular treatment for Ireland to become the foundation stock island of Europe in the event of outbreaks of diseases and, can he pursue that line with conviction, given our health status?</P>
    <P>An interesting point was made by Senator Dardis when he referred to programmes of containment rather than eradication in many areas.  The one blot in our copybook and the one area where we can be held to have failed in this country is in the eradication of bovine TB.  We have managed to come to terms with most of the other diseases.  We have managed to put in place controls at our borders and ports; generally speaking, thank God, we have been foot and mouth disease free and more or less free of Newcastle's disease.  One could pick any disease across the whole range and see we have managed to contain or control it.  However, for some reason, and we all understand the reason, bovine TB has defeated the best efforts of the Department of Agriculture and Food and I have to confess to date even the ERAD Board, I would think, would admit to making slower progress than they thought when they started off with the media headlines and the flurry of excitement when the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, set it up and threw millions of pounds at it. Despite the money the Government are spending on it and, despite the increased levies the farmers are contributing right <Col N="37" /> across the board towards it, I wonder what progress we are making?</P>
    <P>We can only wish them progress and success in an area that has defeated the best efforts of very good Ministers over the years.  It is one huge blot on our copy book when it comes to holding ourselves out to the rest of Europe as an example of animal and plant health status and management of these problems generally. The whole area of animal and phytosanitary control concernes me and I think we will have other occasions on which to debate it if the Minister cannot give us assurances now with regard to the way we will be treated.  Perhaps the Minister will come back to us when discussions are under way, or at a more final stage, to indicate how Ireland will be treated in the Internal Market in this regard.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn briefly to another aspect, namely, the whole area of research.  When it comes to insect and pest control research, the priority we give to research in this country leaves a lot to be desired.  I am afraid the present Minister must stand indicated for the way Teagasc have decimated the research section of that body.  Research and investment in modern technology will depend on the result of the investment today, in the past couple of years and the next few years.  We have managed to halt most research programmes that were in the planning process, that were in the pipeline. There is a lead-in to all research programmes.</P>
    <P>Unless we feel we are going to piggyback on the research of other nations, much of which may not be applicable to the conditions in this country, I do not know how the farmers and food producers today are going to get the service they deserve from the Department of Agriculture and Food in the years to come.  By decimating the research programme and by Teagasc decimating their research section we are failing other farmers and food producers of the future. The years will slip by and by chopping off programmes, by choking them financially, the effect is not immediate.  This Government may have come and gone <Col N="38" /> but someone else will be picking up the results of the appalling decisions that have recently been made to axe research programmes.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator Murphy who talked about natural pest control.  Unless we know what we are doing, we cannot advocate natural pest control.  We cannot even advocate to the farmers of the future the levels of pesticides and insecticides they should use.  We cannot determine the effect on the environment of the over-use of pesticides and insecticides.  We cannot determine the effect on human health of the over-use of pesticides and insecticides.  We cannot determine the effective withdrawal date or how long before slaughter or harvest the product can be used after being sprayed with the pesticide or insecticide.  If we fail in this whole area of research we are failing the next generation of farmers and indeed the next generation of people in our country who will depend on food production by our farmers and indeed imported foods as well, and who expect the Government to be able to guarantee safety in these areas.  We fail them by axing the research programme now and I am afraid this Government will stand indicted.</P>
    <P>The economic unit in Teagasc has been totally abolished.  One of the roles of the economic unit was to interpret for the nation the implications of different legislation and regulations and orders and directives, etc. coming from Europe and how they would pertain to agriculture, agri-business and food production.  We have decimated the economic unit.  We have reduced research to a point at which most programmes are not viable but have completely obliterated the economic unit in Teagasc.  Again, perhaps, we are not getting the best advice and the best interpretation of the implications of certain regulations and directives in relation to the Internal Market.  Can we be sure in regard to the considerations the Minister referred to in relation to phytosanitary and plant health controls generally that the implications for this country are being interpreted as they should?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is worthwhile <Col N="39" /> and it deals with a very specific area.  The broader canvas must be how we are going to treat this island nation of ours with its high animal and plant health status in the Europe of the Internal Market and whether we can make a case to become the foundation stock island for Europe and provide a particular service to our other European colleagues.  That is my plea to the Minister this afternoon and I would dearly love to know his views, the views of the senior Minister and the Government's views as to how they will proceed in this most important area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  As previous speakers said, he is a frequent visitor here and he is most welcome.  This is a short Bill but that does not take away from its importance. Disease control and disease prevention in all forms in humans, livestock and crops must be taken seriously.  This Bill could be called a technical Bill.  It does not set out any new principles.  The principles of control in the 1958 Act, which we are proposing to amend, are sound.  These principles are that we do all we can to keep diseases from entering the country. If one is unfortunate enough to have an outbreak of a disease, proper measures on how to deal with it are contained in the Bill.  The Bill updates the fines which may be imposed by a court for an offence which is proved in court.  That is as it should be.  People laughed at conventions that result in the maximum fine of £20 being imposed.  That fine would have been all right in 1958 or previous years, but it is not a deterrent or a proper fine nowadays.  The Bill proposes to increase the maximum fine to £1,000 or three months imprisonment.  I am sure that the court, when dealing with offenders, will take into account the circumstances of the offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree fully with the Minister's wish that there should be a better attitude to disease prevention by people whose business is badly affected by disease.  In my country many people depend on the poultry industry.  In west Limerick there <Col N="40" /> are two major poultry processing factories, one in Kantoher and one in Castlemahon. Castlemahon chicken and Kantoher chicken are for sale in every part of the country.  They also export their produce.  Once there is an outbreak of disease tremors go through the industry because most producers have massive borrowings and they could be left in bad financial circumstances.  As I have already said, they export a substantial amount of their produce and provide great employment.  In the areas I speak of vast employment is provided by the growers and in the processing of poultry in the factories.  Therefore the curtailment of any disease is important.</P>
    <P>Difficulties arose recently in the poultry sector but the Department of Agriculture and Food were able to confine the outbreak not only to one area but to the one building.  They have now lifted all restrictions.  Sometimes public representatives and others can be quick to criticise public officials but we have to recognise that they have been very effective in dealing with every outbreak of disease down through the years.  We should pay tribute to them for this.  At times we may not be satisfied with the way in which they deal with these outbreaks.  They may take short cuts, but they have proved successful at the end of the day.  I would like to pay tribute to them for the way in which they have dealt with these outbreaks and in particular the most recent outbreaks.</P>
    <P>Farmers are worried about falling incomes and the outcome of the GATT negotiations.  Hopefully their fears are exaggerated.  Many people tend to forget that our agriculture sector is in a good, healthy state.  That is because we are an island nation and we are in a better position than most to retain our disease-free status in many areas.  I am not saying that our status in relation to disease is perfect.  It never will be until TB is completely eradicated.</P>
    <P>A more informed and responsible attitude should be adopted by all people involved in the scheme.  For that reason, I support the Minister's appeal to farming organisations to actively promote among <Col N="41" /> their members the measures necessary to clear up various forms of disease.  I am sure many farmers and others involved in the areas of eliminating TB are not responsible.  As was said by previous speakers, it has been with us a long time and progress has been slow.  All concerned must co-operate to ensure its complete eradication.</P>
    <P>It is important that proper hygiene standards are maintained by those working in this area, especially in the poultry and beef processing industries.  It has been proved by the more progressive growers and producers that if high hygiene standards are maintained the better returns a producer will get.  Even in difficult times, for example, when the exchange rate between the punt and sterling was bad, producers who maintained high hygiene standards were able to weather the storm without any difficulty.</P>
    <P>Fines under the Act are out-of-date. The problem with many of the cases which come before the District Court is not the maximum fine which may be imposed, the jail term or whatever, but the attitude of the courts.  Someone who is not adhering to the regulations is brought to court only to have a low fine imposed on him.  These fines may have been satisfactory 40 or 50 years ago, but they are certainly not satisfactory today, when so much depends on hygiene in agriculture production, processing and so on.  If someone in the agriculture sector is careless, it can have a devastating effect on many people not alone those involved in the agricultural industry but those who are depending on the agricultural industry for employment, for food, etc.  The Minister referred to risks.  In 1992 and subsequently we will be striving to ensure, and I quote from the Minister's speech, &ldquo;that any changes in procedures will not leave us open to unacceptable risks&rdquo;.  Senator Doyle need have no fears or concerns because I am sure the Minister and the Department will take the necessary precautions to ensure that there will be no unacceptable risks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is important that it be brought in because <Col N="42" /> we have an opportunity now of preserving the great record we have in our exports of trees and shrubs.  I hope the regulations will be strong enough to prevent diseases and insects of various kinds coming into our horticulture and agriculture areas.</P>
      <P>In regard to destructive insects and pests, we have gone raving mad here over the past 20 years.  I agree with Senator Doyle that in the past 20 years the agriculture industry has been snowed under with dumped chemicals and sprays.  The Department of Agriculture did not seem to give any thought to what effect they would have on the human being, on the soil, or on animals.  Take, for example, DDT.  This was used nearly like butter a few years ago.  We were about ten years behind the United States which had banned the use of it when it was found to be the most dangerous cancer forming agent that could be used on the farm.  I believe it is still being sold here.  That is how loose the system is here and that is only one example.  Corn sprays and beet sprays are being dumped here without any research carried out to find out the effects of the end product on the human being.  More will have to be done in the future.  Have we to wait, as we had in the case of DDT, for about 25 years, until the harm is done?</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Doyle, that over the past 20 years the whole farming and horticultural scene has been left wide open to ruthless people who distribute those goods at enormous profit.  Those goods have been rejected by some countries, yet we accept them.  It takes us about ten years to wake up and introduce proper controls.  This happened in the case of DDT and I am sure it is happening in other areas as well.  I hope the Minister, who is from rural Ireland, has taken action to ensure that will not happen in the future.  The whole food chain has been poisoned by all types of sprays and God knows what effect they are having on humans.  They are affecting the balance of nature because certain pests are necessary.  Certain types of sprays kill all insect and snail life in the soil and do long term damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the indiscriminate use of sprays and chemicals wll cease.  Nature has its own way of dealing with things and the killing of many types of insects only leads to other problems later.  We should be concerned about insects which come here in foreign containers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope it will protect both our horticultural and agricultural industries.  I appeal to the Minister to take on board the point made by Senator Doyle and myself about drugs or chemicals used in the dairy, agriculture or horticulture area.  It has been said that if you turn off the kitchen light your head of cabbage will glow and you will not need a bulb in the light.</P>
    <P>A few years ago a lady, who had bought some imported vegetables, asked me where she could have them tested.  I spent about half an hour on the telephone going from Billy to Jack in the Department of Agriculture and Food.  In the end, I had to tell her I did not know who was responsible. That area should be tidied up. There should be spot checks on imported products and also on home produced goods to ensure that they are safe for human consumption.</P>
    <P>In the beef industry irresponsible people are using angel dust, and so on, and those people must be brought to heel. People's health must be seen to be protected and we must not give way to people who want to make a fast buck over a short period, regardless of people's health.  Perhaps I have gone slightly off course in saying that, but it is an important point.  If we are concerned about insects coming in here we should also be concerned about the insects at home and the unnecessary destruction of some of them, including snails.  They have a very important role to play.  We have the best land in the world if it were used properly and in the years ahead we do not want it impaired in any way by the type of haphazard, indiscriminate use of drugs, chemicals and sprays which has gone on for 20 years.  Nobody will cry halt until a medical doctor proves that they are harmful to humans.  We are doing nothing <Col N="44" /> in that area for a country that produces so much food both for export and home consumption.  We should be doing more to ensure that the people who are trying to make soft money and become rich overnight will not get away with it in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their contributions on this Bill.  While, naturally, on Second Stage the subject will afford licence, as it were, to move into fields perhaps removed from the actual field we were talking about, nonetheless, it all adds up to a worthwhile discussion on the whole area.  I will endeavour as briefly as I can, as we are hoping to take all Stages today, to deal with a number of points raised as the discussion proceeded.</P>
      <P>Senator Raftery mentioned the question of the high level of residue in foods in Great Britain.  The legislation we are dealing with today is not particularly about food residues but about necessary amendments to the 1958 legislation.  He also referred to organically produced food.  At the moment, the Community is at an advanced stage in the preparation of regulations to cover this area which will provide the wherewithal to allow us to introduce a system of certification.  In the interim, IOFGA, the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers' Association, hold an examination and provide a symbol to their growers which identifies organically produced products.  From the point of view of having statutory arrangements, we will have to await the completion of the Community regulation on the subject. I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Raftery.  There is a clear and obvious need to have control and an adequate system of certification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the hardy nursery stock, Bord Glas, the State body with responsibility in this area, have clearly identified the hardy nursery stock as an area with considerable potential for development.  The possibility of developing further exports to Britain is being actively pursued both by the board, Córas Tráchtála and prominent growers in the <Col N="45" /> hardy nursery stock sector.  The development of exports to the UK is not, as it were, the confinement of their effort.  The possibility, for instance, of developing an export market for Christmas trees to Germany is being actively pursued.  It would appear that there is a significant market potential in that part of the world. However, there is nothing instant about the growing of Christmas trees.  There is a lead-in period where the obvious capital investment has to be made in the particular project before the product is available for sale.  There is at least one or, perhaps, two people pursuing that possibility on a commercial basis, which I am glad to see.  Naturally, we expect that Bord Glas will afford whatever assistance they can to anybody pursuing that matter.</P>
    <P>The question of the maximum fine is one of the principal considerations in the Bill.  The level of fines under the 1958 Act is completely inadequate but there is now a provision for a maximum fine of £1,000. The Attorney General advises that this is about as high as it should be for a summary conviction in the District Court. Senators will have gleaned from Second Stage that there is also provision for prison sentences of up to three months or, indeed, a combination of both.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Murphy for his news item in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> last Saturday. It is an area we are actively pursuing at present.  There is an organic unit in the Department of Agriculture and Food and in the budgets of the last two years there was a provision of £450,000 to further the work in that area.  Naturally the whole area of the research and development of suitable production techniques for organic growing will need to be a priority and any research work, no matter who is carrying it out, whether it is in UCC or wherever, is to be welcomed.  It reflects the growing interest there is in Getting Back to Nature through safe pest control and we will be inquiring further about the project in question.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis mentioned the problem of rhizomania, a disease which affects sugar beet.  We have had no cases of it here but we have a controlling order in <Col N="46" /> place since last year to deal with any possible problem that might arise.  Also, we require that all secondhand machinery must be washed free of soil before it is imported, as part of the controls.</P>
    <P>Senators referred to Community legislation on plant health and the draft regulations which will apply after 1992.  They are at present being considered in Brussels by the various experts representing member states.  Naturally the thrust of the argument from our point of view will be for a general raising of standards within the Community to match our high health status which is principally as a result of our island location.  That advantage will continue to be available to us and will obviously be very worthwhile in the longer term.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle made a number of points.  The plant health regime to be put in place post-1992 is at present being considered at Commission level and the working party on agricultural questions is actively applying its mind to it at the present time.  I cannot anticipate what the outcome will be or when we will have an outcome but it will probably be some time in 1992.  These groups are made up from expert officials from the respective member states in the Community and, of course, our experts are drawn from the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Forestry Service.</P>
    <P>In a general reference to the position with regard to the economic unit in Teagasc, it is fair to say that the various implications under the sphere of economic matters for the agricultural industry will be dealt with by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  There is, of course, provision for consultation with the State agencies, Teagasc and the various farming organisations and they will be kept informed of progress under the GATT heading or whatever.  The primary function of the economic unit in the Department of Agriculture and Food will be to examine, recommend and suggest the best approach in this area.</P>
    <P>On the question of our island location we are endeavouring to have an isolated zone status established as part of the <Col N="47" /> negotiations, particularly in regard to forestry, potatoes and nursery stock.  We have clear advantages over other member states on mainland Europe and I hope that this advantage, because of our location, can be of benefit to us both in the short term and in the long term. Indeed, we have a request for the designation of Ireland as a high grade seed area for our seed potatoes.  As you can imagine, in the general area for which the Office of Horticulture have responsibility, potatoes are by far the major consideration.  If the annual output from that industry is worth approximately £50 million naturally it is an area on which we will focus.  I hope that in the long term our natural advantages due to our location will be of benefit to us in the development of the seed potato sector. That area, for one reason or another, has lagged behind and has impacted on the ware sector.  Senators can be assured that is being addressed at present by Bord Glas, the Office of Horticulture and Teagasc and we will endeavour to gain any advantage we can as part of the negotiations in that regard.</P>
    <P>I thank the Members for their fine contribution to this legislation.  It is quite restrictive.  As I said earlier, the discussion drifted somewhat around the general subject but that is understandable in the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope this can be said without interruption.  I am quoting from the column in this morning's paper.  I have already given the particulars, and I quote:</P>
      <P>Speaking of the condom syndrome, Mr. Richard Branson, in whose Dublin store condoms have been illegally on sale according to a District Court judgment later upheld by the High Court, sent Christmas cards to his many clients and friends a few years ago.  Attached to each was a condom.</P>
      <P>And now, Mrs. Una O'Higgins O'Malley of Booterstown, Co. Dublin, recalls that a day's outing to the Darling Harbour Shopping Centre in Sydney, Australia, was ruined for her last year.  Because in the window of one of Mr. Branson's stores was a print of an old master painting of the Virgin Mary &ldquo;surrounded by a sea of condoms&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Mr. Branson is the last person I would look to for any type of value. He has publicly articulated his contempt for the laws of this country; yet now the vocal lobby who are obsessed with the condom syndrome are casting him in the role of hero and he is something of a media darling.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the hierarchy are being cast in the role of villains.</P>
      <P>Isn't it time we started putting our values and priorities in order?</P>
      <P>Well said, Des Rushe, because you said it all there.</P>
      <P>I will read from my notes, because I do not have much time and I want to say as much as I possible can.  I would like to speak in favour of the amendment proposed by Senator Seán Fallon to the motion proposed by Senator Norris and Senator Ross.  The original motion seems to ignore the fact that the Irish Family Planning Association deliberately broke the law as passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" /> When found guilty, it continued its illegal operation pending an appeal to the Circuit Court.  Even after the Circuit Court confirmed the decision of the lower court the Irish Family Planning Association still defiantly decided it would not obey.</P>
    <P>The current family planning laws allow the sale of contraceptives generally under medical supervision to people over 18 years of age.  The outlets, as amended by the 1985 Act, are pharamacies, doctors' surgeries, licensed family planning clinics, health board outlets and certain hospitals. This seemed to be a reasonably widespread and controlled distribution.  I do not think that many here wish to see condoms on sale in slot machines, sweet shops, barrows or any public place outlets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Family Planning Association was founded here in 1969 with assistance from its parent organisation, the International Planned Parenthood Federation.  The latter body have a committed policy of breaking the law where it considers that it interferes in any way with the distribution of contraceptives. Basically, it believes in no control whatsoever.</P>
      <P>The Irish Family Planning Association have followed the policies of its parent body.  Some years ago, in 1984, the chairman of the Irish Family Planning Association broke the law by selling condoms in his Clane surgery.  He was convicted at District Court level, appealed the case and lost.  However, a year later the law was changed, legalising what he had done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1985 Act, initiated by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government, was very traumatic in its effects on the major political parties.  A number of <Col N="52" /> Deputies were either expelled from their parties or lost the Whip.  In 1988 the Irish Family Planning Association set up a stall in Mr. Branson's Virgin Megastore.  It knew full well that it was breaking the law but this was its way of challenging it. It took over a year for the Director of Public Prosecutions to issue a summons, which was ineptly served, and the case failed because the summons had not been served within the necessary timespan. Another summons was issued for another offence and conviction followed.  The Irish Family Planning Association appealed this conviction to the Circuit Court and lost again.  The courts had no option but to uphold the law of the land. If an outlet such as a record store frequented by children of all ages were to be a legal outlet, what controls on distribution would be left?  This, I am quite sure, would not suit the majority of the Irish people for whom we are legislating.</P>

      <P>I have available here a copy of a report from the <i>British Journal of Family Planning.</i>  I wanted to read from it.  As far as I am concerned, AIDS is a fatal virus and the use of condoms seems to provide a rather illusory promise of safety.  I think even the Senators on the other side of the House will agree with me that no one has the right to say that there is a guarantee that you will not contact AIDS if you use a condom, that there is a 100 per cent guarantee of safety with them, because there is not and I have a lot of evidence to back that up.</P>

He said in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 25 September 1990, when he was asked a very direct question: &ldquo;I cannot say whether condoms do or do not prevent infection.&rdquo;  Is he authority enough for you?</P>

      <P>Another study found a 17 per cent rate of infection with the AIDS virus in women whose spouses were infected with the AIDS virus and had used condoms over a period of one to three years.  That is taken from the <i>Journal</i> of the American Medical Association, 6 February 1987, volume 257, pages 640 to 644.  Again, according to a recent study at the University of Miami Medical School, 17 per cent of women whose husbands had AIDS used condoms became infected themselves.  The reference is <i>AIDS and the Education of our Children: a Guide for Parents and Teachers.</i>  I have already quoted Dr. Walsh.  I have another quote here.  The reference is <i>Crisis: Heterosexual Behaviour in the Age of AIDS, Masters, Johnson and Kolodny.</i>  The question is: Does condom use make sex safe or safer?</P>
      <P>If we are to give credence to the data from Africa and to our own findings, it is unacceptably risky to engage in penile-vaginal intercourse when one or both partners' HIV status is unknown, or when one partner is known to be infected.  In the absence of studies showing that this risk is significantly reduced by the use of condoms, to rely on condoms for truly safe sex &mdash; or even a reasonably approximation of safe sex &mdash; is blatantly to disregard the facts.</P>
      <P>It is irresponsible to claim that there is a 100 per cent guarantee, because there is not.  In other studies &ldquo;Mates&rdquo; condoms are shown as being particularly defective. I have figures on that too, if anybody is interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many laws on the Statute Book which many Members here may <Col N="55" /> not agree with.  We are free to try to change them.  That is the democratic process. We are not free to break them at will.  That is not the way to do things in a democratic law-abiding society.</P>
    <P>The family planning laws were passed in 1979 following the McGee judgment. There was much controversy about the laws at the time and much more controversy again in 1985 when Mr. Barry Desmond steered the 1985 Act through in a most hurried manner.  Laws passed with such division should at least be obeyed. Any legislator who surrenders to blackmail from the Irish Family Planning Association, Mr. Branson, or whoever shows little respect for the laws passed by the Oireachtas and for his own position as a legislator.</P>

      <P>It seems extraordinary that a debate on a serious issue like this should have to be conducted in this extraordinarily controversial type mood.  It seems that in this country an issue of social nature should be debated seriously, but it does not appear that people are capable of so doing.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael support the Independents' motion to review the criminal law governing the sale of contraceptives in the light of the judgment of 26 February and also because of the implications of the judgment for the spread of HIV infection among young people.  There is certainly a need to review.  We have nothing before us from the Government at the moment to look at; but, when we do, we will examine it and make our views felt. Going back to the legislation in 1974, 1979 and 1985 there has been nothing but controversy and trauma regarding that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach apparently intended <Col N="56" /> having the amending legislation brought forward as quickly as possible.  From what we read he intended to have the age reduced for the sale of condoms from 18 to 16.  But it is typical of the haphazard response of the Government to social issues that nothing is thought out or discussed thoroughly in advance.  I would interpret the Taoiseach's reaction to the criticism of his party for representing outdated views.  We in Fine Gael have suffered over the years &mdash; I would like to have the time to air our views democratically &mdash; from the pangs and attacks from Fianna Fáil when the whole notion of social change, amending legislation, pluralist society were taboo names to Fianna Fáil.  We surely have suffered. The commentators over the last few days have remarked that the legacy of President Mary Robinson's election is such that Fianna Fáil now wish to take on a liberal agenda, but it is not that easy. You either believe in what you are doing, you either follow it thoroughly, or else you forget about it.  But you cannot jump on the bandwagon of issues as important as the issue before us today.</P>
    <P>Going back over the particular periods when social issues were addressed and looking at Fianna Fáil in action, when Barry Desmond introduced the present legislation it led to the expulsion of Deputy Desmond O'Malley from Fianna Fáil for, I quote, &ldquo;conduct unbecoming&rdquo;. Today, when we look at the headlines on our national newspapers, what is happening is that the issues that should be dominating today's debate are marginalised. Health, unemployment, housing, etc. are just put aside.  What we are seeing today is a Government not functioning as a Government.  There is no leadership.  there are conflicting suggestions emerging from Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats but there is no Government response.  We have a Government consisting of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats but there is no conformity of views, time is wasted in vacillating, there is a lack of a clear policy and we have the sad and sorry spectacle of the Progressive Democrats partnership in Government moving away <Col N="57" /> from the principles of what they considered then was their new republic.  I wonder about the oft-quoted statement &ldquo;I stand by the Republic&rdquo; and how the Progressive Democrats see their republic today.  Apparently, they did not put any pressure on their coalition partners on this issue, but they do not seem to know where they stand collectively.</P>
    <P>Ironically, the existence of the Progressive Democrats party stems from that period in 1985 when the Progressive Democrats Leader, Deputy O'Malley, refused to vote against the legislation at that time.  I can understand the people of Ireland being utterly confused.  Confusion reigned during the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis.  The general public looked at that Ard Fheis as an occasion when they might see constructive policies on unemployment but what did they find?  We had all the controversy about the condom issue.  I wonder if this was a ploy by the wily Taoiseach to avoid having to address constructively the problem of unemployment. We have 244,000 unemployed and that number is increasing.  Surely the Ard Fheis would have been the opportune time to have debated the main problems that concern the people of Ireland today.</P>
    <P>When I looked at the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to find where this Government amendment came from, I found that it occupies a line and four words: &ldquo;The operation of family planning service will be kept under review in association with the relevant organisations.&rdquo;  Interestingly enough, it was under the heading &ldquo;Women's Health Services&rdquo;.  I certainly would think that the two previous points made, as regards mammography service and a cervical screening service being available to all women, would be spelled out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> It is a fact of life that in times of recession it is women's health that is the first to suffer, because the man is the bread-winner and his health and the children's health will be to the fore.  I cannot understand why the Minister for Health uses the quotation from the document, because I believe the <i>Programme</i><Col N="58" /><i>for Economic and Social Progress</i> partners have no business making laws on condoms.  I see this, again, as the Government's derogation of their responsibility.</P>
    <P>We live in the nineties.  The general public are absolutely bored with the issue.  I have not had one young person &mdash; and I have been teaching for 25 years &mdash; coming to me asking about condoms or the sale of condoms.  The impression is being given that they have not a brain in their heads, that we must dictate to them, whether through the Church or through legislation.  I am worried they will be absolutely cynical at the amount of time spent over the last week on this matter and you may be sure the controversy will rage longer.  They will say it is the business of the Government to apply themselves to the creation of jobs and they will ask why the Government are so obsessed with this other matter.</P>
    <P>This is a sixties agenda.  We give the impression that young people are not responsible for their own lives or their own modes of behaviour.  The Catholic teaching is straightforward: if we are Catholics we surely would know where we stand.  Why do we always have the State to tell us what to do?  I do not believe there is any other religious group in the world that has to wait for the State to tell them how to behave.  The teaching of the Catholic Church is there.  If people want to obey it, that is their business but if they have not the guts to do that as Catholics I do not see why they should have to be harangued by the State.  It shows a complete immaturity of us as Catholics.  That is a fact of life and it is how young people see it.  They have not been the slightest bit troubled.</P>
    <P>The real problem today is that teenage pregnancies are rising.  The facts are before us.  In 1986, five years ago, one-third of births outside marriage were to mothers aged between 15 and 19 years. When I was debating last week the Child Care Bill I had a statistic from a housing estate in Limerick, which was that one in four of family structures there was a single parent family.  We cannot say these things do not exist.  I cannot say it because I see it.  These are virtually children <Col N="59" /> having to live out mature lives at an immature age.  We have to accept that that is the social, family structure in many of our housing estates today.  If we want to put our heads in the sand, as legislators we will be out of touch with the real world and out of touch with our real role as legislators.</P>
    <P>There is information which tells us there is a direct link between teenage pregnancies and a lack of sex education. I quote: &ldquo;Teenage pregnancy rates vary directly in inverse ratio to the provisuion of sex education in schools.&rdquo;  While I was teaching &mdash; and I was teaching up to September of last year &mdash; I was shocked at the brouhaha over the health education programme.  It seemed extraordinary that there is so much time used debating whether we should have such a programme in our schools.  If we want to educate our young people we must have thorough sex education in schools to ensure that the curricula is relevant to their needs today, not to the needs of the 1960s or the 1950s.  I can understand why our young people are so cynical with politicians when they see us dilly-dallying, vacillating over something they consider is not important, because they live in the real world.  They are concerned about the job situation and they look to us to create jobs.</P>
    <P>The AIDS issue is with us.  We might be lucky in this country that we do not have the huge statistics of other countries. There are two million cases in the United States.  We do not have a figure here, but we have to agree that the use of condoms reduces the risk of AIDS significantly and that they have a role to play to prevent the spread of AIDS. Thankfully, it would appear we have a lower incidence of AIDS than other countries and we now have a golden opportunity to be pro-active and introduce effective programmes to protect the population.</P>
    <P>We have heard enough about the problems of our health services.  We should try to remove from those services the huge burden this disease could impose, not to mention the cost if we are not <Col N="60" /> going to take action now.  It is not the time for hesitation.  The condoms controversy is taking up time that should be spent on the other issue of job creation I ask the question, are we as passionate in relation to job creation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish him well in his new position.</P>
      <P>At the outset, when this motion was brought to the Seanad last week, it was as a result of the judgment of 26 February 1991.  There seemed to be at that time a certain calmness about the situation. There was a recognition by everybody concerned that there was an anomaly in the law and on the Order of Business, I called on the Taoiseach and the Government to move in this area.  At that stage I understood things were progressing and very definite indications were given as to the outcome.  However, once again, a week is a long time in politics.  It is with a very heavy and sad heart that I say that.</P>
      <P>Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas talk about Irish youth who need to be protected; I will tell you who they need to be protected from.  It is from the likes of us that they need to be protected, from the disrespect with which we treat them when we give them no credit for having a sense of responsibility, a sense of their place in society or a sense of maturity.  Many of them could teach us a thing or two about how we should behave.  I question why we have to be the great moral legislators and why we have to be the people who decide on these issues.  I do not believe there is a role for us in this matter.  Why should my morals be inflicted on other minority groupings in this country?  That is the nub of this argument.</P>
      <P>I joined a party that stood for the separation of Church and State and I want to make it clear that I remain true to that value.  For me it has never been a question of whether it is worth more votes to opt one way or the other; it has to do with the principles I believe in and I, for one, intend to remain true to those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want a pluralist society in this <Col N="61" /> country which should be a society that embodies the idea of a republic.  We do not want the rampant republicanism that operates with an Armalite in one hand and a ballot paper in the other.  That is not what republicanism means to me. Republicanism embraces all of the people, all of the diverse views, and not only embraces them but actually respects them and tries to make all people feel a part of society.  As legislators, our role is to ensure that minorities are given the same status as the rest of us.</P>
    <P>I have no particular hang-up about the age question.  I was satisfied it was to be brought down to 16 because that was the legal age at which one could get married in this country.  If that satisfied many people I had no problem with it.  I can assure you, however, that if we are going to end up in a situation, as rumoured at present, where we are going to come up with a 17 age limit as the Irish solution to the Irish problem, I will have huge difficulties running along with a vote-getting, meaningless, exercise of jargon that achieves nothing as far as I am concerned. The issue here is whether condoms are to be made available on a wide scale and my view is that they must be. A machine does not ask anybody their age.  The responsibility lies with the person who uses condoms and the sense of responsibility of the young people that you are concerned about originates in the family, in the values given to children.  I do not have children of that age but I will give them values and when they reach that age I will expect them to exercise their judgment rather than my judgment, based on the guidelines I saw fit to give them on whether the use of these articles is appropriate for them in their own lives.</P>
    <P>Where should they be available?  I think they should be freely available in third level colleges and where groups of people meet in the evenings.  It is nonsensical for us to criminalise people and try to put forward age limits in regard to the use of condoms.  It does not hold water.</P>
    <P>There have been arguments about the <Col N="62" /> relevance of this issue to the AIDS question. The reality is that the use of condoms reduces the possibility of transmitting AIDS.  That is a fact.  I have never said, and I do not think anybody else has ever said, that it is the be-all and end-all of everything or that the use of condoms on their own is the answer to this horrific problem in this country or throughout the world, but it is certainly a factor.  AIDS is not exclusive to people who use drugs or to the homosexual community. It is a heterosexual problem as well and let us not run away from that and try to shift our guilt onto other sectors of our community.</P>
    <P>This issue affects everybody, whether single or married.  Those are the facts and there is no point in trying to sweep them under the carpet or pretend the problem does not exist.  Our role as legislators in this area should be to ensure that where issues like this arise we legislate in a way that helps to solve and not compound the problems.  It is useless to approach them on the basis of the great moral arguments that seem to get everybody so excited throughout the country.  I cannot understand why an argument which was taken so calmly a week ago has reached the levels it has reached in this debate.  There is certainly an argument for much better health and sex education in our schools and I do not think it is a question that has to be confined exclusively to secondary education.  I think there are certain aspects of growing and living that can be embodied in the school curriculum throughout the whole learning period. We could move forward by anticipating these situations before problems arise.</P>
    <P>People have to make judgments for themselves.  I do not believe I have the right to make moral judgments for anybody else.  I have to make my own moral judgments and I think people are mature enough in this country and elsewhere to make their own moral judgments regarding the lifestyle they want to pursue as long as it does not harm the greater society which this legislation would not do.  I am pleading with both parties in Government to see this matter for what it is and not as others would have us see <Col N="63" /> it.  This is a clear issue where we must allow people to be the judge of where they want to go.</P>
    <P>If this is the response we are getting on the condom issue, I shudder to think where we might be going on divorce. It has almost removed divorce from the agenda and I wonder if there was method in the madness of some of the people who promoted this issue in such a way that other issues such as divorce have been removed from the agenda.  We cannot continue to go down the same path we have gone for so many years.  We have to face up to our responsibilities as a mature people and to pretend that the problems in Ireland are different from those elsewhere or that our people have not got the capacity within themselves to deal with problems of this scale is ludicrous and insulting to our young people.  They have not, as other speakers have said, been running to me with a problem about condoms but to know what we are all doing here.  If we could get half as fired up about unemployment as we have about this issue, we might do some good in this country.</P>
    <P>Those are the issues we are here to work on but I think we treat issues like this as an opportunity to weigh up votes on either side of the divide.  Many people are full of hypocrisy in this regard; it is not a question of principle for them but a question of whether a few more votes might be won from their own electorate. That has nothing to do with building a real republic and a pluralist society.  If we do not face up to that, how can we then extend the hand of friendship to other people on this island?  In many ways it is beyond my comprehension and a source of sadness when I turn on international television and see them laughing at us for getting so hung-up on these issues.  It is tragic and gives a false impression of us. We are a positive people, a highly educated people, a people capable of making decisions.  It is the leadership at legislative level that is letting the people of this country down by treating these issues in the way they do.  In answer to another speaker, that is the type of pluralist <Col N="64" /> republic that I stand by and I will not betray it.  That is why I joined the Progressive Democrats and I hope now to stand up for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris' and Senator Ross's motion is highly reasonable. All that is required is that Seanad Éireann call for a review of criminal law governing the sale of contraceptives in view of the implications of the judgment for the spread of AIDS.  I have great difficulty in seeing how anybody could have any problems about going along with that call.</P>
      <P>The attention and interest that this debate has generated in the last week tells us a lot about the way we order our business and reveals many of our inherent contradictions.  As a number of speakers have said, unemployment, poverty, homelessness, Third World issues, the economy, emigration and the crisis in agriculture have been brushed aside since the carry-on of the last week.  The front pages of all the newspapers and the lead stories in all radio and television news programmes have been dominated by this matter.  It certainly seems to be a curious way for this country to order its priorities. This issue, which of necessity has to be a fairly minor issue compared to those other great ones, has been pushed right into the centre of the action.  It seems to me to have sent the Fianna Fáil Party into convulsions, the likes of which have not been seen since the great trauma of Deputy Brian Lenihan in the middle of the Presidential election.  Again, that tells us much about the nature of Fianna Fáil and about the type of people that they have been playing ball with or the type of people who influence them in these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept that.  We also have people who are worried about the effects of contraceptives in Ireland but who are totally indifferent to what will become of people when they emigrate. Contraceptives are fully and freely <Col N="65" /> available in other countries to which many thousands of young people emigrate each year and yet people who get themselves into a great big tail spin here seem to be indifferent to emigration. They turn a blind eye to it and behave as if it does not exist.</P>
      <P>I do think that the central issue here is health, the question of AIDS and of the growth of numbers of HIV positive people in our population.  There are almost 200 people in this country suffering now from full blown AIDS; quite a number of people have already died from AIDS.  Approximately, 1,000 people are HIV positive; all the experts tell us that AIDS spreads exponentially. That has been the pattern in other countries and we are not going to be any different regarding the extent or the manner in which AIDS will spread.  Fortunately, the instance of AIDS in this country is not as great as in other countries and that is another incentive to do everything possible to damp down the spread of the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder why it is so low in this country.  It is an interesting point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, indeed, very interesting. There are all sorts of reasons why that is so.  Experts, including an Irish expert on radio the other morning, tell us that the availability of condoms helps to prevent the spread of AIDS.  Anyone who knows the minimum about the way the infections are spread would have to concede that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier, Senator Hanafin was quoting some data from one of the thousands of medical journals which he seems to have been pursuing prior to his speech; certainly he was well armed.  With all the journals he would do justice to the best of the medical scientists by the way he was geared up.  I accept that there is an element of failure but there is no doubt at all that condoms do help to diminish the risk of the spread of AIDS.  I think the Legislature has an obligation to face up to that reality and I believe that making condoms more widely available <Col N="66" /> will undoubtedly play a role in helping to curb this terrible problem.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other aspects which I think have been glossed over. We are pathetically inadequate on the question of AIDS education.  We have had a row on this matter as well during the last year to illustrate the way we are in case there was any doubt on that issue. AIDS education is very poor at school level and for the general public.  Most Irish people do not seem to me to have a clue as to how infection is spread and it is very important that the average person should have some such understanding. The only people in this country who seem to have been realistic about facing up to the problem and trying to come to grips with it have been the homosexual community. They seem to have a very effective education programme which seems to have worked very well for them.  There is a lot to be learned from the way they approached the provision of AIDS education.</P>
    <P>Some people have got themselves into a terrible tail spin about all of this.  One simple point which should not be forgotten is that there is no obligation on anybody to purchase or to use contraceptives. That is a statement of the absolutely obvious.  I see such matters as matters of private morality and it is imperative that the Church and State in this country be separated.  The last thing we want in this country is a theocracy.</P>
    <P>People talk in terms of Catholic politicians being seriously influenced by Catholic thought and if such thought takes precedence over notions that relate to the common good I think we are going down a very slippery and dangerous road. I think that many of the people who will give you that line of argument would be the same people who would be appalled and shocked if Catholics were to be discriminated against in other jurisdictions where Catholicism was not the dominant religion.</P>
    <P>There is an element of double thought in some of the lines which have been pushed out as to how legislators should be influenced by their own private morality. <Col N="67" /> Legislators in this country have an obligation to legislate for the common good and our party has as good and as fine a record as any party on that matter.  If we are to become political about the whole thing we must consider what went on during the earlier debates on this matter and during the divorce debate and in many ways what is happening now to Fianna Fáil.  Somebody said to me that it could not happen to a nicer party.  Some of the chickens are now returning home to roost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome my colleague.  We worked together for many years in Tallaght and the Minister has demonstrated by his work, first as a councillor and then as a TD, his diligence, his aptitude and his outstanding abilities.  I have no doubt whatsoever that he will carry them through as a Minister of State and no doubt in due course as a Minister.  He is very welcome here on his first visit to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>It would seem as though the debate which we are having has stirred up quite a lot of emotion and I suppose when emotion comes in reason very rapidly departs.  Certainly, listening to many of the comments one wonders at times whether we are living in the real world. I have no great problem with the motion. I think one of the fundamental aspects here is freedom of conscience and of behaviour so long as this behaviour does not do damage or is not malign in its effects on others, particularly, perhaps on children.  The motion, however, improves the matter.  The amendment improves the motion and the motion as phrased is perhaps a little disingenuous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, as regards the law, we are fortunate to be living in a democracy. The majority of countries are not democracies; their people have to accept whatever is given to them.  We are fortunate to be one of those minority countries in which we can democratically decide upon our laws.  We have certain laws which may need to be changed, but breaking them does not seem an appropriate method of change in a democracy when <Col N="68" /> we have the opportunity to change them by democratic means.  Nonetheless, we have a particular responsibility in a democracy to guarantee freedom of conscience and of behaviour in so far as that is possible and especially when there happens to be one dominant religion or philosophy.  If we really believe, as I am sure we all do in this House, in the unity of our country we have to give thought to those who may have differing views.  I believe in the republic, that is the unity of the Republic of Ireland.  That means that the people have to be considered and must have freedom of conscience and of behaviour where these do not impinge in a damaging or malign manner on others, particularly on children.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about Church and State.  I find some of it a little difficult to follow.  As a legislator I certainly believe that there must be a separation between Church and State. We are here to legislate for the people as a whole, not for any particular religious group, irrespective of whether they be 1 per cent or 99 per cent.  That does not mean that we are not supposed to inform our consciences or do as we believe right, or that if we happen to belong to one Christian denomination that we must reject the morality and views of that particular religion.  There are times when it would seem as though if the Bishops of this country have the temerity &mdash; it is almost a temerity now &mdash; to express their views, many politicians immediately jump on the bandwagon to condemn these views and even, apparently, to condemn intolerantly the right and, indeed, the duty of the Bishops of any denomination or clergy to express what they consider to be the appropriate morality. It is up to us as legislators to decide whether we accept them or not but they have every right to express their views and indeed a duty to express their views.</P>
    <P>We tend at times to talk about divisions but basically all of us in the western countries believe in what is a Christian or perhaps more correctly, a Judaeo-Christian ethos, a Judaeo-Christian philisophy. We may tend to think that we are different from each other but that is <Col N="69" /> the basis of our philosophy.  It is only if you go to live in, say, a Moslem country or a Buddhist country, that you realise that there are totally different concepts of philosophy and religion from those taken as the norm in these western countries by people who are not necessarily religious but who would describe themselves not merely as agnostic but as atheistic.  Perhaps we should emphasise a little more the general broad basis of philosophy which most of us tend to accept in these countries and which may, at times, lead us to be quite intolerant of other views.</P>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of reference to unemployment and the subject of family planning, emotional as it is, also has a very specific economic basis.  Earlier this afternoon I was talking with some officials from the Chinese People's Republic.  There they have a very definite Government family planning policy and philosophy for, from their point of view, very good reasons.  They have a population approaching 1.2 billion and they are endeavouring, with extremely severe penalties, to ensure that families have only one child.  In France there is already a premium or a subsidy available to encourage larger families. There you have, for economic reasons, two different approaches.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for western liberals to go out to Africa or to various parts of Asia to talk about family planning and indeed to try to enforce or implement it. Perhaps these countries should have the opportunity to work out their own philosophies; our intrusion is sometimes resented on the grounds that we, wealthy and rich and in a situation in which we can freely decide to have either a small or a large family, are trying to impose a form of cultural colonialism.  Often we do it without the least realisation that this may be the perception of the people concerned; in Africa or Asia the presence of a large family may be of considerable social and economic importance.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the matter of AIDS. I feel that it is totally inappropriate that AIDS should be brought in in this connection.  I am sorry to have to say <Col N="70" /> that but I think that people should have freedom of conscience and of behaviour to have condoms available to them if that is what they so wish, and to make use of them or not as the case may be.  If AIDS had never occurred, people should still have that right.  However, since a point is made of it in the motion, by reference to HIV, let us think about the transmission of AIDS.  It can be transmitted, for example, in the course of a surgical operation or during the course of a dental extraction.  It can be transmitted by injection and hence drug addicts tend to be a major portion of the population suffering from AIDS.  It can be transmitted, as we have seen so tragically, by a blood transfusion.  It may come in the course of an assault, if a person is bitten or attacked.  It may come, as so often happens, through the form of sexual behaviour which male homosexuals indulge in. As it happens, this is probably the commonest form of transmission, but it is an entirely&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Not on those scales, as I am quite sure the Senator would know if he consulted the World Health Organisation statistics.  It is overwhelmingly transmitted through heterosexual intercourse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly happy to argue that point but I do not think there is any question that the origin of AIDS was &mdash; I have said that deliberately &mdash; an accident of the form of sexual relationship. It certainly has spread very widely since and it spreads by blood happening to come in contact with other blood.  That is a simple physiological fact whether Senator Norris wishes to accept it or not.  I am sorry to hear Senator Norris interrupting in such a manner.  I was endeavouring to take it in a fairly balanced and easy manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Condoms should be a matter of conscience and should be freely available to people.  It should not be a matter of AIDS, one way or another.  It is certainly beneficial in certain types of homosexual intercourse to wear condoms and it may <Col N="71" /> be also of some benefit in heterosexual intercourse.</P>

      <P>Thank you. I listened with great interest to what Senator Hanafin had to say.  I regret very much what he had to say this evening and I regret that he will not hear what I have to say.  I regret that he did not hear the views of the Opposition.  What has happened in this debate is a very sick type of a joke for this country.  Senator Cullen, in an excellent speech, put his finger on what is happening: we are making complete international fools of ourselves over this issue.  The international interest focused on this issue in the last two weeks is quite extraordinary.  The reason international interest has focused on this issue is not because it is a great momentous issue of the day internationally, but because we are odd and we look quaint.  It is because we are completely out of step with the rest of Europe.  I read some of the international newspapers and their interest in us is that we are quaint little country behaving rather strangely.  We are making fools of ourselves internationally. It is quite extraordinary to those outside this country that an issue that superficially is as trivial as this is causing so much fuss in this country and internally in the political system.  That is something which the Fianna Fáil Party, of all parties, but not exclusively, should bear in mind when they publicly bare their breasts on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to look at what the perception of this must be in Northern Ireland.  It is that we are a Roman Catholic, denominational, theocratic State.  I have not heard anybody who has convinced me that is a wrong perception. The perception among those to whom I have spoken, and in the Northern Ireland newspapers is that once again the Roman Catholic Church, the Hierarchy, have flexed their muscles and the Fianna Fáil <Col N="73" /> Party have jumped.  That is the perception and that is to a large extent what has happened in this debate.  It is very difficult to listen to Senator Conroy talking about wanting the unity of this country when he is doing absolutely nothing to convince those in the North that he is doing anything about achieving a pluralist society.  What has happened in the last week is that we have confirmed the suspicions of those in Northern Ireland that issues of private morality are dictated by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. They have plenty of evidence for that already.  We had massive and farcical problems in every debate on family planning. I cannot remember how many Bills we had, but we had one in 1975, 1979, 1985 and we are to have another one in 1991 &mdash; four Bills in a few years and we still have not cleared up the mess.</P>
    <P>Every single time this issue arises we get into the most extraordinary contortions both within the governing party and among ourselves in other ways.</P>
    <P>The same situation, as Senator Cullen says, will arise if we touch the issue of divorce later this year.  It is quite obvious that the Fianna Fáil Party are unfit to tackle the issue of divorce later this year if they cannot solve a small problem.  The only problem that seems to worry them is the age at which people should use condoms.  If they cannot solve that problem without internal wranglings and difficulties, which are still unresolved, they are totally ill-equipped, both intellectually and emotionally, to deal with the problem of divorce which apparently they are hinting at tackling later this year. What is necessary for the Government is to reassure those people for whom Senator Conroy protested such affection that they are not threatened by a theocratic State in the Republic.  That reassurance is not forthcoming.  I do not say that as a denominational member of the Church of Ireland.  I have to make a confession, I am a member of the Church of Ireland but I do not have a clue what the Church of Ireland's view of family planning is.  I do not know what it is and I do not care what it is.  It is not my <Col N="74" /> business and I would not take any notice of it if they expressed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I was encouraged initially by the Taoiseach's announcement when he said that he would reduce the age to 16.  I was encouraged by the informal attitudes and statements that this issue was once and for all going to be taken off the agenda.  It was almost as if was a <i>fait accompli.</i>  There would be more outlets and condoms would be more freely available. Sixteen was to be the age.  I was very encouraged by the fact that the Taoiseach said on radio, and before that, that he had no intention of consulting the Hierarchy on this issue.  For whatever reason &mdash; I do not want to give him too much credit &mdash; he had decided that on this issue he was going for the liberal ground and adopting a new attitude, presumably to take this awkward problem off the agenda.  In fact, having said that he would not consult with the Hierarchy, he has done nothing else in the last week.  There has been a very public consultation with the Hierarchy and a very public point of view expressed by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even after the initial statements made by the Fianna Fáil Leader it was stated that they were not going to bow the knee to the Hierarchy.  They have now retreated.  It seems that for some extraordinary reason after this public controversy the Hierarchy only had to flex their muscles, call on Senator Hanafin and a few others to mobilise the troops and, abrakadabra, the age was no longer to be 16 or less and the Taoiseach was in a full and disorderly retreat.  The public perception is that pressure was brought to bear on members of the Fianna Fáil Party during the Ard-Fheis. Others speak quite openly about the number of telephone calls they had, whether orchestrated or not I do not know, but it is quite clear that pressure was brought to bear and a campaign was run in the last week which caused the <Col N="75" /> Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil to retreat and change their minds.  The issue, albeit initially trivial, has split the Government and the only possible choice which they have left themselves is to retreat.  That is regretted.</P>
    <P>As regards the AIDS virus, I am one of the few people in this House who does not know much about it.  There are many experts and the people I tend to listen to are doctors, the World Health Organisation and the Paris Centre for AIDS Research.  There is one stark fact which sticks out, and that is condoms prevent AIDS.  It is quite simple and I do not think there is any need to go further than that.  It does not take an enormous amount of intelligence to conclude that the restriction of condoms will promote the AIDS virus.  That is quite simple and straight forward.  We must accept the terrible responsibility that we are allowing people to get AIDS who would not normally do so if they had access to condoms. That is something the Government party refuse to face up to because of spurious pressure from the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the Church and religious scruples.</P>
    <P>We must face the fact that the sexual activity of young people is far more intense and starts much younger than it used to.  We should not take our policy in this area from people who are all over 60, or more.  The principal players in this controversy appear to be the Archbishop of Armagh who is over 70, the Taoiseach who is 65, Dr. Desmond Connell whose age I do not know and Senator Hanafin. They are all very noble people but I do not believe for one moment that they are qualified to speak on the issue of condoms.  This should come from people who are experts in the field and from people who are in the way of using them rather more frequently than those I have named.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Taoiseach and to Fianna Fáil to have a free vote.  It has already been said by the Progressive Democrats that they would allow a free vote.  I do not know the views of the other parties. I would remind the Fianna Fáil Party that although the Taoiseach has already said <Col N="76" /> that there should not be a free vote on this issue, there was, I think I am correct in saying in 1979 a Deputy James Gibbons who decided, courtesy of the Taoiseach of the day, that he would take it upon himself to vote freely on this issue.  He did not vote for the Taoiseach's Family Planning Bill in 1979.  For the Fianna Fáil Party there is a noble precedent for a free vote on this issue and I would make a plea that they consider doing that.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It was interesting to listen to Senators, in particular the last speaker, who seem to know more about the Fianna Fáil organisation than the members of Fianna Fáil.  They seem to know more about what goes on at the parliamentary meetings than the members of Fianna Fáil.  I wonder what kind of information the last speaker is getting.  I was at the party meeting all morning and I did not hear anything about free votes or about anything else he mentioned.  The Taoiseach did not say he would reduce the age limit to 16 as was stated.  People might say that Fianna Fáil want to bury their heads in the sand and forget about the very serious problem that exists, whether it is the AIDS disease or other diseases which are on the increase as well.  We definitely do not.  The way the media have been prompting this issue over the last week one would think the only sexually active people are those between the ages of 16 and 18.  Where in the name of God are we going?  If the media were really interested in our young people they would highlight unemployment and emigration. I have never heard as much rubbish about condoms as I heard in the last six weeks, whether on television or Kerry Radio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a very important Ard-Fheis over the weekend.  The condoms issue seemed to be the main issue.  What was debated at that conference was not highlighted. There were very important issues debated, far more important than the use <Col N="77" /> of condoms.  There is a problem and this party are facing up to it.  There should be wider availability of condoms.  If 50 per cent of pharmacists feel for moral reasons, or whatever, that they do not want their shops used as outlets for these items then the outlets should be broadened to other registered people.  I do not believe there should be dispensing machines in disco clubs or bars.  They should be properly controlled.  I know of several seaside resorts where there is only one chemist shop in the town and, for moral reasons, the owner will not sell condoms.</P>
    <P>There are problems in large housing estates with marital breakdowns, broken homes and so on.  One is inter-related with the other.  As was stated earlier, perhaps we should have more education in schools about the sexual diseases that are rampant.  I do not think that condoms will prevent these problems.  We are not running away from anything.  We have family planning legislation.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is in place.  We will face up to the realities and move with the times as we have always done.</P>

      <P>Five minutes is not adequate time in which to deal with this subject in detail.  I intend using my five minutes to set the tone of the debate and make a few points about the way various people are trying to manipulate the debate.</P>
      <P>Those who do not believe in the total liberalisation of the law are classed as doing so either because of the Hierarchy or because they lack the courage to do otherwise.  This problem should be approached from the point of view of the common good.  Just as I would respect the views of Opposition Senators who would be diametrically opposed to my views on various matters, they should, in turn, not only accept the bona fides of people in this House who disagree with them but also accept the bona fides of members of the various Churches, including the Hierarchy, who speak out in what they believe to be the interests of the common good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> There is a certain amount of unreality about this debate.  There is no doubt that condoms are readily available and all age groups have access to them.  If that is not so in Dublin, it is certainly so in rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>It is totally unacceptable to certain people that there should be any control or regulation in relation to access to condoms, but those same people do not call for a change in the law in relation to underage drinking or purchasing a lottery ticket.  I do not understand why people cannot admit that there could be a properly sustained view that it is in the interests of the common good that access to condoms would not be available to people under 18 years of age.  As the parent of a young family, I am very conscious of the problems of peer pressure and all the pressures that young people face today.  I am also very conscious, as somebody who has experience of dealing with young people and adults in various capacities, of the peculiarities of human behaviour and the way people act on the spur of the moment and become subject to pressure.</P>
      <P>This problem must be approached in the interests of the common good.  If that coincides with the teaching of one Church, so be it.  Just as I believe in having controls on underage drinking, even though I would give alcohol to my own children in certain circumstances, I believe in having general controls on access to condoms but there is also the concept of free conscience and allowing adults make up their own minds on basic issues.  My view is based on what I see as the overall common good and is in the interests of placing an ideal before our young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about the motion being disingenuous the amendment with its unctuous and irrelevant tone is clearly disingenuous.  I would like to deal with a couple of the arguments that were raised.  I am amazed that <Col N="79" /> Senator Conroy, a man of medical eminence, is unaware of the global facts.  I would like to place on the record of this House what the authoritative facts are from the World Health Organisation.</P>
      <P>One-third of the eight to ten million people currently estimated to be infected with HIV, the virus which leads to AIDS are women, according to the World Health Organisation.  Overwhelmingly, they have contracted the virus through heterosexual intercourse which globally is the major route for HIV transmission, apparently for about 60 per cent of the infections by 1990.  The World Health Organisation expects that 75 to 80 per cent of HIV infections will have resulted from heterosexual intercourse by the year 2,000.  That knocks comprehensively on the head what Senator Conroy had to say.  I presume it will also deal with the <i>Irish Independent</i> drama critic to whom I will return later.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that there are political repercussions from this debate.  Last week, as Senator Cullen indicated, we were in a different situation where there were indications that Fianna Fáil were moving towards what An Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, described at the Ard-Fheis as a progressive and pluralist society.  It is clear that we have backtracked from that in response to the intervention of the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church.  It is a sectarian matter and the law is sectarian in that it endorses and finances only those methods of contraception that are approved by the Roman Catholic ethos.  So let us be quite honest about this and let us understand what the impact will be on Northern Ireland.  Let us understand also the nature of that intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bishop Comiskey said that the country would be morally and financially bankrupt if it introduced the kind of legislation the Government contemplated.  Dr. Connell said that the people of Ireland would be disenfranchised &mdash; a curious view of parliamentary democracy if the legitimate actions of parliamentarians are held to disenfranchise the people.  Bishop <Col N="80" /> Newman of Limerick said he was nauseated by the Taoiseach's speech.  I could give more quotations but that seems to be intemperate language.  I will place on the record what members of the different Churches have to say and I will ask if it is not possible to allow some kind of freedom of choice in these areas or is it necessary, as one of the Bishops indicated, to sustain the weak and fragile members of one Church who are apparently unwilling to listen to the moral precepts and guidance of their ecclesiastical leaders by the use of the criminal sanction of the law.</P>
    <P>I refer to the Minister's speech where he claimed for himself all kinds of honourable things as a tissue of fiction. He said that prevention through a health education strategy was aimed specifically at the young and at risk groups.  This educational programme was instituted late in 1990, ten years after the epidemic commenced and is targeted at the intravenous drug using population principally. There is no programme for the gay community. There is no funding for the gay community.  There is a policy at Government level, and I am aware of it, not to institute an educational programme in the gay community and not to finance it. There has been an allocation of £250. The mere suggestion of the word &ldquo;gay&rdquo; is enough to kill financing for any project and we have classic examples of it, including the starving of finances to the Hirschfeld centre which Ministers are prepared to compliment and flatter and yet in defiance of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, in defiance of two resolutions of this House and in defiance of the support given by Dublin Corporation, all funding is just thrown in the bin.  So let us not have any nonsense.  This funding does not exist. We discriminate against them.</P>
    <P>We are told about all kinds of wonderful care and management programmes. There is no integrated hospice care.  What there is, in fact, is the use of the general nursing services which are already over-stretched in the community. There is no provision of extra care.  So let us knock that one on the head.  There is <Col N="81" /> supposed to be a strategy in line with that adopted in all advanced countries, according to the Minister.  The recommendation of the WHO is for an integrated strategy bringing into place all the different bodies, both statutory and voluntary. This does not exist here at all and the Minister knows it.  What we have is some curious co-ordinating body admittedly with an excellent man in charge, Dr. James Walsh.  He has my sympathy. There is one thing on which all sides of the House would agree and that is the remarkable contribution of Dr. Walsh in attempting, with very limited resources and virtually no political assistance, to fight this epidemic.</P>
    <P>I will place the figures on the record. In January 1988 there were 32 cases of AIDS.  In January 1989 there were 69; in November 1989 there were 111 and in November 1990 there were 174.  For February 1991 the latest figure is 186 cases of full blown AIDS.  In January 1988 there were 14 deaths; in January 1989 there were 31; in November 1989 there were 53 and in November 1990 there were 75. The latest figure for deaths is 77.  The infection rate known is 692 in January 1988; 787 in January 1989; 886 in November 1989 and 1,005 in November 1990. The latest figure, for December, is 1,020. That is one in every 4,000 members of the population.  It is internationally known that there is a multiplier factor of 3 to 4. That is one in every thousand.  If you subtract those at both ends of the age spectrum you are into a very frightening situation indeed.</P>

      <P>If you want to know what members of the different churches say, may I introduce you to the fact that in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, 13 March 1991, the Dublin synod of the Presbyterian Church called on the Government to bring in legislation that would protect, as far as possible, those who are sexually active outside marriage.  The Rev. David Bruce said:</P>
      <P>Regarding contraception, we beg to differ in some important respects from the Roman Catholic Church.  We consider the Bible to teach that the primary purpose of sex is not procreation, but the enrichment and mutual fulfilment which husband and wife may have in each other.  Contraception, therefore, is not only morally acceptable, but psychosexually necessary to a healthy marriage relationship, where the real purpose of a full sexual relationship can only be explored free from the constraint and worry of an unplanned and even unwelcome pregnancy. We find puzzling the distinction drawn between artificial and natural methods of contraception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He referred also to the question of an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  May I say that is the biggest insult that Charles J. Haughey has ever delivered to the Irish <Col N="84" /> people, suggesting the hypocrisy and evasion of standards by which this country is run.</P>
    <P>May I quote from a Department of Health manual entitled: &ldquo;AIDS: The Facts,&rdquo; published by the Health Promotion Unit of the Department of Health:</P>
    <P>For sexually active people, who are not in a one faithful partner relationship, a good quality new condom correctly used is the single most effective defence against HIV infection.</P>

      <P>I am aware of that.  Based on physical properties alone, undamaged latex condoms provide an effective barrier against all known sexually transmissible agents including HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.  Furthermore, condoms protect against the Hepatitis B virus, which at 42nm is the smallest of these agents.

      <P>Go molann Seanad Éireann Aire na Gaeltachta as an soláthar fial atá déanta ag an Rialtas don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht i Vóta Roinn na Gaeltachta don bhliain reatha.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Aire Stáit ag Roinn na Gaeltachta (Mr. Gallagher) Aire Stáit ag Roinn na Gaeltachta (Mr. Gallagher)">
      <NameTxt>Aire Stáit ag Roinn na Gaeltachta (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is cúis áthais dom féin mar Aire Stáit a bhfuil cúraimí na Gaeilge <Col N="89" />agus na Gaeltachta orm labhairt anseo i Seanad Éireann inniu ar son na tairisceana seo.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús tagairt a dhéanamh d'fhorbairt thábhachtach atá déanta sa Teach seo ó labhair mé anseo an uair dheireannach, sé sin, an córas aistriúcháin chomhuainigh atá anois ar fáil.  Tá súil agam go dtabharfaidh an áis seo uchtach do Sheanadóirí an Ghaeilge a úsáid níos minicí feasta i ndíospóireachtaí an Tí.  Tá a fhios ag an saol go bhfuil Gaeilge ar a dtoil ag cuid mhaith Seanadóirí agus táim cinnte go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó Gaeilge ag Seanadóirí eile ná mar a cheapann siad féin.  Iarraim orthu uilig dea-shampla a thabhairt do phobal na tíre seo agus roinnt éigin Gaeilge a úsáid gach uair a labhraíonn siad anseo.</P>
      <P>Tá breis agus £33 mhilliún á chur ar fáil ag an Rialtas i mbliana ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge agus an nGaeltacht.  Is airgead vótáilte £25.7 milliún den mhéid sin atá á cur ar fáil trí Vóta Roinn na Gaeltachta agus, anuas ar sin, íocfar airleacan £7.5 mhilliún díreach as an Státchiste le Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Is méadú an-mhór é seo ar an soláthar iomlán &mdash; méadú de 40 faoin gcéad ar an tsuim a caitheadh anuraidh, rud a leiríonn thar aon rud eile dáiríreacht an Rialtais seo maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge agus forbairt na Gaeltachta de.</P>
      <P>Tá na figiúirí éagsúla le fáil i Leabhar na Meastachán agus ba mhaith liom an deis seo a thapú chun míniú a thabhairt ar na fíricí taobh thiar de chuid de na figiúirí sin.  Mar áis do Sheanadóirí, pléifidh mé leo san ord ina bhfuil siad leagtha amach i Leabhar na Meastachán.</P>
      <P>Tá deontais tógála agus deontais feabhsúcháin le fáil i gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) agus táim sásta gur leor an soláthar £1.2 mhilliún atá curtha ar fáil i mbliana chun freastal ar an scéim do thithe Gaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is cúis mhórtais domsa agus don Rialtas go raibh ar ár gcumas deontais fheabhsúcháin tithe a choinneáil ar siúl sa Ghaeltacht ó 1987 i leith, tráth a cuireadh deireadh leo sa chuid eile den tír.  Bhí lúcháir orm i rith na bliana seo caite fosta a fhógairt go mbeadh deontas £2,300 ar <Col N="90" /> fáil feasta chun díon tuí ar thithe ceanntuí a athnuachan.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh, ní íocann mo Roinnse cuidiú ach i gcásanna ina mbíonn an Ghaeilge á labhairt mar ghnáthurlabhra ag teaghlach an iarratasóra.  Bíonn deacrachtaí uaireanta faoin ngné seo den scéal i gceantair áirithe Ghaeltachta ach, murach an Ghaeilge, ní bheadh aon ghá le mo Roinnse, le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta ná le Bord na Gaeilge agus tuigfidh sibh go gcaithfear féachaint chuige gur ar Ghaeilgeoirí dáiríre a dhíreofar an cúnamh atá ar fáil faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht).</P>
    <P>Tá méadú arís i mbliana ar an soláthar de bheagnach £1.9 milliún atá ar fáil do na scéimeanna feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht a bhíonn á reachtáil ag mo Roinnse.  Faoi na scéimeanna sin, tá cuidiú á thabhairt le fada chun bunstruchtúr na Gaeltachta a fhorbairt agus a fheabhsú agus táim cinnte de go bhfuil tionchar tábhachtach ag na scéimeanna sin ar an nGaeltacht. Tá feabhas curtha ar na saoráidí calaíochta sa Ghaeltacht agus tá go leor poist cruthaithe ag an infheistíocht sin.  Is clár leanúnach a bhíonn i gceist anseo agus beifear ag leanúint de sa bhliain atá romhainn chun a chinntiú go bhfaighfidh muintir na Gaeltachta an tairbhe is fearr as mhaoin aiceanta na farraige.  Ar ndóigh, cuirtear cuidiú ar fáil freisin chun scéimeanna uisce agus saoráidí séarachais a chur ar fáil agus téann sé sin go mór chun leasa na ndaoine.  Ní bhíonn mo Roinn ag díriú ar fhorbairt eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta amháin, áfach, agus d'fhonn cur le saol sóisialach na ndaoine, bíonn cuidiú ar fáil ar mhaithe le háiseanna caidrimh agus caithimh aimsire a fhorbairt.</P>
    <P>Measaim féin go bhfuil tábhacht ar leith ag baint leis na deontais a íoctar chun bóithre áise agus portaigh sa Ghaeltacht a fheabhsú.  Is cuidiú í seo a fhreastalaíonn go díreach ar ghnáthphobal na Gaeltachta agus is mór an tairbhe atá bainte amach faoin scéim seo thar na blianta.</P>
    <P>Is maith is eol dúinn uile go bhfuil <Col N="91" /> tábhacht nach beag ag baint leis an gcomharaíocht i bhforbairt na Gaeltachta. D'fhonn freastal go príomha ar chainteoirí Gaeilge agus d'fhonn daoine eile a mhealladh ar ais i dtreo úsáid na Gaeilge, tá cuidiú fial curtha ar fáil do na comharchumainn Ghaeltachta ag Roinn na Gaeltachta agus ó Údarás na Gaeltachta. Íocfar deontais, idir caipiteal agus reatha, leis na comharchumainn Ghaeltachta ón Roinn arís i mbliana mar is maith mar a aithním cé chomh tábhachtach is atá an chuidiú sin do na comharchumainn agus is mian liom a chinntiú gur i dtreise a bheidh siad ag dul sna blianta atá romhainn.</P>
    <P>Tugann Roinn na Gaeltachta deontais do choistí áitiúla d'fhonn saoráidí sóisialta agus taitneamhachtaí cosúil le hallaí, ionaid phobail, ionaid spóirt, páirceanna imeartha, agus mar sin de, a chur ar fáil. Cé go bhfuil teorainn leis an soláthar atá ar fáil chun freastal ar thograí dá leithéid, tá cuidiú nach beag tugtha ag mo Roinnse do thograí éagsúla ar fud na Gaeltachta agus tá na torthaí le feiceáil go forleathan anois.</P>
    <P>Tá feidhm ag cuid de na scéimeanna a thagann faoin gceannteideal Scéimeanna Cultúrtha agus Sóisialta ar fud na tíre ar fad ach baineann cuid eile acu leis an nGaeltacht amháin.  Is í scéim na bhfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge an scéim is tábhachtaí de na scéimeanna seo.  Faoin scéim sin tugtar cuidiú do theaghlaigh Ghaeltachta a choinníonn foghlaimeoirí Gaeilge ar íostas fad a bhíonn siad ag freastal ar chúrsaí aitheanta Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht. Soláthar £1.38 milliún atá ar fáil don scéim sa bhliain reatha agus rinne beagnach naoi mhíle déag dalta freastal anuraidh ar na cúrsaí a thagann faoin scéim. B'shin an líon ba mhó a rinne freastal ar na cúrsaí sin le blianta fada.</P>
    <P>Tá lúcháir orm a rá go bhfuil caighdeán na Gaeilge ag feabhsú i gcónaí i beagnach gach coláiste agus tá a bhuíochas sin ag dul do lucht eagraithe na gcúrsaí.  Tá áthas orm fosta a fheiceáil nach bhfuil leisce ar bith anois ar roinnt coláistí cloí <Col N="92" /> go daingean leis na rialacha maidir le labhairt na Gaeilge le linn na gcúrsaí.</P>
    <P>Tá cuidiú nach beag á cur ar fáil againn don nuachtán <i>Anois</i> agus do thréimhseacháin Ghaeilge eile.  Is cúis díomá dom féin nach ndíoltar ach líon beag cóipeanna de <i>Anois</i> agus, mura mbeidh méadú suntasach sna figiúirí díolacháin, ní bheidh an dara rogha agam ach socruithe eile a dhéanamh.  Tá scéim á reachtáil ag mo Roinnse chomh maith d'fhonn iriseoireacht áitiúil a fhorbairt sa Ghaeltacht trí phobail áitiúla a spreagadh chun irisí a fhoilsiú i nGaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá lúchair ar leith ormsa gur chinn an Rialtas ar mhéadú de 76 faoin gcéad a dhéanamh i mbliana ar an soláthar airgid atá ar fáil d'Údarás na Gaeltachta chun cabhrú leo tionscail sa Ghaeltacht a fhorbairt. Táim cinnte go mbeidh ar chumas an Údaráis an fhostaíocht i dtionscail éagsúla faoina scáth sa Ghaeltacht a chaomhnú agus a mhéadú dá bharr. Beidh beagnach £21.5 mhilliún san iomlán ar fáil don Údarás ón Stát i mbliana i gcomparáid le thart ar £13 mhilliún anuraidh.  Is comhartha an-soiléir é sin den tacaíocht atá ann ón Rialtas don obair thábhachtach atá ar siúl ag an Údarás chun saol eacnamaíoch, sóisialta agus cultúrtha na Gaeltachta a fhorbairt agus a chur chun cinn.  Bíonn an tÚdarás i gcoimhlint i gcónaí le h-eagrais fhorbartha Stáit eile sa tír seo chun tionsclóirí a mhealladh le tograí fiúntacha a lonnú sa Ghaeltacht a chuirfidh deiseanna fostaíochta breise ar fáil don phobal ansin agus aithníonn an Rialtas go maith na deacrachtaí bunúsacha a bhíonn le sárú acu.</P>
    <P>Léiríonn torthaí na bliana 1990 gur éirigh leis an Údarás méadú a bhaint amach arís &mdash; don naoú bliain as a chéile &mdash; i líon na ndaoine a bhí fostaithe go lánaimseartha i dtionscail sa Ghaeltacht a fuair cuidiú uathu.  Tuigim ón Údarás gur cruthaíodh suas le 1,000 post nua breise ar an dtalamh sa Ghaeltacht i rith na bliana seo caite agus, nuair a chuirtear an líon post a cailleadh sa bhliain sin san áireamh, feicfear go raibh glanmhéadú <Col N="93" /> de 5 faoin gcéad ar an bhfostaíocht lánaimseartha. Tá moladh tuillte ag an Údarás dá bharr agus táim lánchinnte go mbeidh an eagraíocht ag brú ar aghaidh, le beannacht agus tacaíocht an Rialtais, lena gcuid tréan-iarrachtaí leanúnacha ar mhaithe le fostaíocht bhreise a chruthú do phobal na Gaeltachta sna blianta amach romhainn.</P>
    <P>Tá béim ar leith á cur ag an Údarás le roinnt blianta anuas ar fhorbairt acmhainní nádúrtha na Gaeltachta agus tá ag éirí go maith leo san obair thábhachtach seo.  Ghlac an tÚdarás ról ceannródaíochta i bhforbairt tionscail na feirmeoireachta éisc sa tír seo agus mar thoradh air sin is fíor a rá anois go dtagann breis is 50 faoin gcéad d'olltáirge náisiúnta na mbradán ó fheirmeacha atá lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht gan trácht ar an bhfostaíocht fhiúntach atá á cur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta dá bharr.  Aithnaíonn an tÚdarás go maith freisin na buntáistí atá le fáil ó fhorbairt tionscail ardtheicneolaíochta.  Chuige sin tá dhá thionscal ar leith bunaithe acu sa Ghaeltacht atá ag baint úsáide as ardtheicneolaíocht agus modhanna nua-aimseartha teilecumarsáide.  Agus an bhliain 1992 ag druidim níos cóngaraí dúinn, tá an tÚdarás ag díriú ar Mhargadh Comhaontaithe na hEorpa agus ar an leas a bheidh le fáil ag cuideachtaí sa Ghaeltacht ach iad a bheith ullamh agus eagraithe i gceart chun na deiseanna gnó a bheidh ann a ghlacadh.  Le comhairle agus tacaíocht ón Údarás táim lánchinnte go mbeidh na tionscail Ghaeltachta réidh don dúshlán sin agus go n-éireoidh leo an tairbhe is fearr is féidir a fháil ón margadh leathan sin.</P>
    <P>Is léir go raibh fadhb na himirce ag déanamh dochair mhóir don Ghaeltacht, agus don tír i gcoitinne le blianta beaga anuas, ach is féidir glacadh leis go leanfaidh an tÚdarás go fonnmhar leis na hiarrachtaí leanúnacha atá ar siúl acu i gcónaí chun tionscail fhiúntacha a aimsiú a chruthóidh fostaíocht bhreise sa Ghaeltacht agus, leis an soláthar méadaithe atá curtha ar fáil dóibh i mbliana, táim <Col N="94" /> lánsásta go mbeidh an rath ar a gcuid iarrachtaí.</P>
    <P>Is as Ciste na Gaeilge &mdash; fo-mhírcheann I den Vóta &mdash; a íoctar cuidiú le Bord na Gaeilge, le Bord na Leabhar Gaeilge agus leis na heagrais dheonacha Ghaeilge &mdash; Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, Gael-Linn, Conradh na Gaeilge agus eagrais eile.  Ar ndóigh, is as fáltais an chrannchuir náisiúnta a thagann an soláthar do Chiste na Gaeilge anois.</P>
    <P>Soláthar £1.5 mhilliún atá ar fáil do Bhord na Gaeilge i mbliana agus tá dóchas agam go n-éireoidh leis an mbord obair fhiúntach a chur i gcrích i rith na bliana seo.  Tá obair mhór le déanamh ag an mbord agus b'fhearr liom go ndíreodh siad a n-iarrachtaí ar na ceantair mhóra daonra, áiteann a bhfuil dul chun cinn déanta le blianta beaga anuas ó thaobh na Gaeilge de.  Tréaslaím a gceapacháin leis na gcomhaltaí nua a ceapadh ar an mbord le déanaí agus táim cinte go rachaidh a mbuanna chun tairbhe don Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Níl mé chun mórán a rá anseo inniu faoi cheist na teilifíse trí Ghaeilge.  D'fhógair Aire na Gaeltachta &mdash; An Taoiseach, An Teachta Ó hEochaidh &mdash; ag an deireadh seachtaine go mbunófar an tseirbhís an bhliain seo chugainn agus, ar ndóigh, tá fáilte curtha roimh an fhógra sin.  Bígí cinnte de go mbeidh go leor le rá agam faoin ábhar seo sna míonna amach romhainn.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar a dúirt mé cheana, is tríd an gcrannchur náisiúnta a dhéantar airgeadú ar Chiste na Gaeilge as a gcuirtear cuidiú ar fáil do Bhord na Gaeilge agus do na heagrais dheonacha Ghaeilge.  Anuas ar sin tá a lán tograí fiúntacha ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge á gcur i gcrích le hairgead ón gcrannchur náisiúnta.  Mar shampla, cuirfear tús i mbliana leis an obair ar an áras nua don Ghaeilge atá le tógáil i gColáiste na hOllscoile i nGaillimh le cúnamh de £1.2 mhilliún.  Is buntáiste mór do chur chun cinn na Gaeilge an chuidiú seo as fáltais an chrannchuir a bheith ar fáil agus is áthas liom go bhfuil teacht againn ar an bhfoinse airgid sin &mdash; £4.9 milliún sa bhliain reatha, sé sin <Col N="95" /> méadú de bheagnach 19 faoin gcéad ar an tsuim a caitheadh anuraidh.</P>
    <P>Ní fhéadfaí a rá ach go bhfuil soláthar fial déanta ag an Rialtas i mbliana don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht.  Faoi mar atá ráite agam cheana, tá soláthar na bliana seo 40 faoin gcéad níos airde ná an tsuim a caitheadh anuraidh.  Nuair atá srianta i bhfeidhm i gcónaí ó thaobh caiteachais Stáit de, tuigfear go soiléir nach bhfuil sa tairiscint atá á plé anseo anocht ach lom-chlár na fírinne.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl don Teach go gcuireann sé isteach go mór orm go bhfuil teidil na díospóireachta seo ar na monatoirí scríofa i mBéarla.  Tá súil agam go ndéanfar é sin a cheartú.</P>

      <P>Shíl mé i dtosach báire nach mar seo a bheadh an cineál díospóireachta atá ar bun againn, nach mbeadh sé go huile agus go hiomlán faoin méid airgid atá a cur ar fáil do Roinn na Gaeltachta i leith réimsí éagsúla a bhaineann leis an Ghaeilge.  Seo seachtain na Gaeilge agus is é an spiorad atá taobh thiar den rún seo ná go mbeimis ag breathrú orainn féin ó thaobh na Gaeilge agus go ndéanfaimis smaoineamh ar cá seasaimid uilig &mdash; agus tá mé ag caint faoi Chomhaltaí sa Teach seo agus sa Dáil agus daoine timpeall na tíre go léir.  Má thugaimid anseo dea-shampla do dhaoine taobh amuigh, táimid ag déanamh rud cruthanta don Ghaeilge.  Tá díomá orm go bhfuil an díospóireacht atá ar siúl againn bunaithe ar, mar a dúirt an tAire, an cúnamh fial ó thaobh airgid de atá curtha ar fáil, mar beidh mise in ann a chur in iúl nach bhfuil sé sin fíor i leith réimsí airithe a bhaineann le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ó tháinig mé isteach sa Seanad, feicim go bhfuil an-mheas ag go leor daoine &mdash; agus in a measc tusa, a Chathaoirligh &mdash; ar an teanga labhartha.  Thug tú anchúnamh nuair a bhí an troid againn chun an córas aistriúcháin a sholáthar.  Tháinig <Col N="96" /> sé sin de bharr obair a bhí déanta ag Seanadóirí le blianta fada anuas sula dtáinig mise go dtí an Teach seo.  Tharla gur chuireamar brú an-mhór ar siúl; bhí an dá thaobh den Teach trí chéile ach bhí na Comhaltaí báúil, agus bhí tú féin, a Chathaoirligh, i do cheannródaí le cinntiú go gcuirfí ár n-aidhm i gcrích.  Is dá bharr sin go léir a d'éirigh linn an córas aistriúcháin a fháil.  Is dul chun cinn mór é sin agus léargas é do mhuintir na hÉireann go bhfuilimid i ndáiríre agus go bhfuilimid ag déanamh rud praiticiúil ar son na Gaeilge.  Cuirtear i leith lucht polaitíochta go minic nach bhfuil ach cur i gcéill i leith na Gaeilge agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil fáth leis sin agus b'fhéidir nach bhfuil.  Ach sna Tithe seo caithfidh mé a rá go bhfaighim an-chomhoibriú ó chuile dhuine, ó Theachtaí Dála, ó Sheanadoírí, fiú amháin ó chuile dhuine atá ag obair anseo.  Tá siad go léir cairdiúil agus báúil don Ghaeilge agus am ar bith a labhraímse leo nó nuair a bhím ag plé leo, feictear dom go bhfuil an Ghaeilge beo beathach thart timpeall Tithe an Oireachtais.</P>
    <P>Dul chun cinn eile a deineadh ná Seomra na Gaeilge a chur ar fáil.  Rinneadh an beart sin d'aonturas le go bhféadfadh Teachtaí Dála agus Seanadóirí agus daoine eile teacht le chéile agus úsáid a bhaint as an teanga.  Is oth liom a rá &mdash; agus tá súil agam go gcuirfidh an tAire Stáit faoi bhráid an Taoisigh agus Aire na Gaeltachta é seo &mdash; nach bhfuil úsáid dá laghad á baint as.  Bhí mé ag iarraidh dul isteach ann inniu ach bhí glas ar an doras.  Níl foireann ná áiseanna ar bith ann len é a chur ag obair.  Bíodh is go raibh an intinn go maith agus go raibh go leor cainte nuair a hosclaíodh é, tá díomá orm nach bhfuil scéim níos simplí, níos praiticiúla le leanúint ar aghaidh leis an tús a deineadh sa Teach seo.</P>
    <P>Tá dul chun cinn eile le feiceáil.  Tá ranganna Gaeilge á reachtáil le haghaidh na gComhaltaí agus mar sin de.  Is comhartha eile é sin go bhfuil suim sna Tithe sa Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Ar an dtaobh eile den scéal, caithfimid <Col N="97" /> uile a bheith aireach faoin Ghaeilge.  Tá gráin agam go pearsanta ar Seachtain na Gaeilge, go dtugtar Seachtain na Gaeilge ar sheachtain amháin, am ar bith sa bhliain, bíodh go bhfuil Lá 'le Pádraig istigh ina lár, mar ní dóigh liomsa, mar dhuine a d'fhoghlaim an Ghaeilge, ar nós chuile dhuine eile, go mba chóir dúinn bheith ag ainmniú seachtain ar leith le Gaeilge a labhairt.  Tá go leor daoine ann a cheapann, os rud é Seachtain na Gaeilge a bheith ann, go labhróidís Gaeilge amháin ar feadh cúpla lá agus ansin go ndéanfaí dearmad air an chuid eile den bhliain.  Ba cheart dúinn uilig a bheith níos dílse don Gaeilge ar feadh na bliana go léir agus ní ar feadh Sheachtain na Gaeilge mar atá á fógairt faoi láthair. B'fhéidir nach mbeadh an díospóireacht seo ann anocht ach amháin gur chinn duine éigin go mba dheas an rud é go mbeadh díospóireacht againn os rud é gurb é seo ócáid Sheachtain na Gaeilge. Ba mhaith liom a cheapadh go mbeadh muid in ann díospóireacht a chur ar siúl trí Ghaeilge sa Teach seo seachtain ar bith sa bhliain agus ní le linn tréimhse amháin a dtugtar Seachtain na Gaeilge air.</P>
    <P>Anois caithfidh mé filleadh ar an rún atá molta, go bhfuil soláthar fial airgid curtha ar fáil ar son na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta don bhliain reatha.  Ní aontaím leis sin, agus chuir sé iontas orm, dála an scéil, alt a bhí ag an Seanadóir Ó Cuív ar an <i>Irish Times</i> inar dhúirt sé go raibh an iomarca ar fad d'airgead na Roinne á chaitheamh ar riarachán agus luaigh sé go raibh £3 mhilliún á chaitheamh ag oifig Roinn na Gaeltachta, Bord na Gaeilge, Gael-Linn agus Conradh na Gaeilge, agus mar sin de, i mBaile Átha Cliath.</P>
    <P>Más cur amú airgid agus más rud é nach bhfuil an t-airgead á chaitheamh i gceart ba chóir don Seanadóir nó do dhuine ar bith eile a chuireann ráiteas mar sin amach seasamh leis an ráiteas agus tacaíocht dá réir a thabhairt sa dóigh is go bhféadfaí deireadh a chur leis, nó é a ghearradh nó rud éigin níos fearr a <Col N="98" /> dhéanamh leis.  Luaigh sé san alt céanna go raibh solúbthacht i bhfad níos fearr ag Roinn na Gaeltachta i leith deontais agus airgead a dháileadh ná mar atá ag Údarás na Gaeltachta agus go gceapann sé gurb iad riarthóirí Roinn na Gaeltachta na riarthóirí is éifeachtaí sa tír.  Má bhí áibhéil riamh ann, tá mé ag ceapadh gur cuid den áibhéil é sin.  Is beag riar atá le déanamh ag Roinn na Gaeltachta ar an méid airgid a bhíonn acu.  Dúirt sé rud in aghaidh Údarás na Gaeltachta nach bhféadfainn glacadh leis ar chor ar bith, go gcosnaíonn sé 50p in aghaidh chuile phunt le haghaidh riaracháin agus gur indictment é sin, rud uafásach, ar Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Caithfidh go bhfuil dearmad déanta aige go bhfuil luach thart ar £60 milliúin d'fhoirgnimh agus chuile shórt eile ag Údarás na Gaeltachta agus go gcaithfear é sin a mhaoiniú agus a bhainistiú agus ní dhéantar é sin gan caiteachas airgid.</P>
    <P>Níl sé fíor go gcaitear 50p in aghaidh chuile phunt ar riarachán ar chor ar bith. Sa bhliain 1989 chaith an tÚdarás £18 milliún ar fad agus as sin caitheadh £3.6 mhilliún ar riarachán, sin 20 faoin gcéad, agus i bhfad níos lú ná an 50 faoin gcéad a luaigh an Seanadóir.  Ó thaobh airgead na bliana seo le haghaidh Údarás na Gaeltachta, fuair an tÚdarás deontas caipitil £9.4 mhilliún sa bhliain 1990 agus i mbliana fuair siad £12.6 mhilliún agus déarfá go bhfuil ardú mór airgid ansin. Ach fuair tionscal amháin i nDún na nGall, atá ag cur cuid mhaith fostaíochta ar fáil, £3.2 mhilliún de sin, agus nuair a bhaineann tú sin den iomlán feicfidh tú gurb é an t-airgead céanna atá ann, £9.4 mhilliún, atá le fáil le haghaidh dheontas caipitil do ghnáthimeachtaí Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Nuair a chuirtear san áireamh go bhfuil treoir ón Roinn gan dul thar £6.2 mhilliún i 1991 agus go raibh £5 mhilliún glanta cheana féin sul má bhí deireadh na bliana 1990 ann, fágann sé sin nach bhfuil ag Údarás na Gaeltachta le caitheamh i mbliana ach £1.2 mhilliún.</P>
    <P>Más moladh don Údarás atá ann de bharr a bhfuil curtha i gcrích acu mar atá <Col N="99" /> ráite ag an Aire Stáit ina óráid, cén chaoi a bhféadfadh Údarás na Gaeltachta bheith i mbarr a réime agus gan ach £1.2 mhilliún ar fáil acu, sé sin gan airgead deontais don bhliain seo.  Tógaimis ceist airleacain ansin, i 1990 arís bhí £4.6 mhilliún i gceist, bhí meastacháin istigh le haghaidh £14 mhilliún agus fuair siad £7.5 milliún ón Stát, ardú 100 faoin gcéid beagnach.  Ach caithfidh tú a chur san áireamh ansin, as an £7.5 mhilliún, go bhfuil £2.5 mhilliún ag dul do Rubber Motor Teo.  agus £2 mhilliún do thionscal a bhí ar bun an bhliain roimhe sin.  Má bhaineann tú é sin den iomlán níl fágtha ach £3 mhilliún agus as an £3 mhilliún sin caithfidh tú scaireanna a thógáil agus chomh maith leis sin, a bheith ag plé le gnáth-thógáil monarchana, athchóiriú monarchana, tógáil réamh-mhonarchana agus caiteachas ar eastáit tionsclaíochta, rud a fhágann, go bunúsach, nach bhfuil fágtha, dáiríre, i gciste Údarás na Gaeltachta le haghaidh obair na bliana seo ach £1.5 mhilliún d'airleacain nuair a bhaintear airgead scaireanna amach; fiú amháin, den £1.5 mhilliún atá ann tá £600,000 de sin imithe cheana féin agus tá sé uilig imithe go Dún na nGall, agus níl mé a rá gur drochrud é a bheith imithe ansin.  Tá £400,000 le haghaidh Snáth Chill Chártha agus £200,000 le haghaidh Éadach Chonamara, sin £600,000 as an £1.5 mhilliún caite cheana féin le scaireanna a chur isteach in aon chomhlacht a bheidh ann i rith na bliana.</P>
    <P>Táimid ag glacadh leis sin, ach níl sé ceart a rá go bhfuil an Roinn fial, ar aon nós níl sé fial le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta. Thar aon chuid eile den Státchóras atá faoi Roinn na Gaeltachta, tá Údarás na Gaeltachta, dar liomsa, ina sheoid agus ba chóir go mbeadh tacaíocht an-láidir le fáil acu.  Tá torthaí bainte amach ag an Údarás, mar atá ráite ag an Aire Stáit féin.  Tá 1,000 post cruthaithe ag an Údarás i 1990, sin comhlachtaí a fhaigheann tacaíocht ó Údarás na Gaeltachta. Mhéadaigh sé seo an fhostaíocht lánaimseartha iomlán 5 faoin gcéad go <Col N="100" /> dtí 5,587, agus seo an naoú bliain as a chéile gur tharla méadú ar fhostaíocht sa Ghaeltacht.  Mar sin, ní thuigim cén chaoi a bhféadfaí a rá gur indictment é ar Údarás na Gaeltachta an chaoi a bhfuil siad ag caitheamh a gcuid airgid.</P>
    <P>Tá glanmhéid cánach 25 faoin gcéad tugtha i gcás fhiacha 1980 agus shroich líon na bpost seasmhach 1,898, sin méadú 11 faoin gcéad geall leis ar líon iomlán na bliana roimhe sin.  Ar ndóigh, cruthaíodh 1,000 post, cailleadh 746 ach, mar sin féin, bhí méadú 5 faoin gcéad san iomlán. Ceadaíodh 270 tionscnamh, idir mhór agus bheag, i rith na bliana agus tá 1,146 phost ansin.  Ceithre mhilliún punt déag d'airgead Stáit atá ann.  Chomh maith leis sin tá an earnáil phríobháideach ag cur isteach £36 mhilliún, agus, mar mheán, £11,000 le post a chur ar fáil.  Léiríonn sé sin go han-soiléir do dhuine ar bith a bhfuil fonn air éisteacht, go bhfuil anobair go deo ar bun ag Údarás na Gaeltachta, agus aon chúnamh a fuair siad nach airgead amú a bhí ann agus go bhfuil sé cruthaithe acu go bhfuil na poist curtha ar fáil acu.  Tá sé cruthaithe acu, níos fearr ná an IDA ná aon chóras Stáit eile, agus nuair a chuirtear san áireamh cé chomh hiargúlta is atá a limistéar feidhmiúcháin, na deacrachtaí agus na coinníollacha oibre a bhaineann le saothair Údarás na Gaeltachta maidir le jabanna a chur ar fáil, is geall le míorúilt é go bhfuil siad chomh héifeachtach sin.</P>
    <P>Dá mhéad tacaíocht a thugann an Stát dóibh is amhlaidh is fearr é maidir le buaine mhuintir na Gaeltachta, ó thaobh maireachtála de, ó thaobh na Gaeilge de agus ó thaobh shlánú na Gaeilge de.  Os ag caint air sin atá mé, is ábhar an-mhór imní do bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta é an síorchreimeadh atá á dhéanamh ar an nGaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá cloiste agam go ndearna Bord na Gaeilge suirbhéireacht le deireanas agus go bhfuil siad ag diúltú an tsuirbhéireacht sin a fhoilsiú, mar tá sé chomh soiléir sin sa suirbhé go bhfuil a ré caite ag an Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá mé féin ag rá sin le blianta fada anuas, go bhfuil a ré caite.  Tá neart <Col N="101" /> Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht cinnte; tá sí agam féin agus ag mo chlann, ag chuile dhuine timpeall an bhaile, ach gabh siar go dtí aon cheann de na scoileanna náisiúnta agus is é an Béarla atá á labhairt i ngach uile cheann acu gan eisceacht.  Sin bás na Gaeilge sna Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>Sin é an fáth go bhfuil an-imní orm. Táimid ag cur béime air sin chomh maith le hiarrachtaí a dhéanamh an Ghaeilge a thabhairt linn.  An t-airgead atá á fháil ag Údarás na Gaeltachta tá sé á chaitheamh ar an dóigh cheart, agus níor chóir a rá nach bhfuil sé á chaitheamh i gceart.  Níor chóir a rá nach bhfuil luach an airgid faighte ag an Stát ó thaobh Údarás na Gaeltachta de.  Tá sé sin le feiceáil, tá na figiúirí ann le é a chrúthú, agus is amhlaidh an scéal ní amháin inniu agus inné ach le blianta fada anuas, ó aimsir Ghaeltarra Éireann, agus mar sin de. Mar sin, nuair a chloisim go leor dá bhfuil ráite ag an Aire Stáit, is deas é le haghaidh na Gaeilge, is maith ann é, is maith an rud atá ráite aige faoi a Roinn féin agus faoin Udarás ach, ag deireadh an lae, is í an teanga labhartha atá sa chomhaireamh, agus tá díomá orm nach ann do theilifís Ghaeltachta.  Chomh luath agus a bheidh sé sin ar bun againn tá seans éigin ann go mbeimid in ann an dé a choinneáil sa teanga ar feadh, b'fhéidir, glúine eile le deis a thabhairt don ghlúin sin í a phiocadh suas.  Feicim go bhfuil an Cathaoirleach ag éirí mífhoighneach liom.  Críochnóidh mé ach arís molaim na hiarrachtaí go léir atá á ndéanamh sa Teach seo chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn agus tá súil agam go leanfar leis seo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús moladh a thabhairt don Aire Stáit as an obair atá sé ag déanamh ar son na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.  An díospóireacht seo atá ar bun faoi Sheachtain na Gaeilge, sílim go mba thráthúil é gur fhógair an Taoiseach ag Ard-Fheis Fhianna Fáil Dé Sathairn seo caite go mbeidh teilifís na Gaeltachta againn an bhliain seo chugainn. Creidim, má tá aon ní amháin ag teastáil ón nGaeltacht, is í an teilifís í. <Col N="102" /> Creidim gurb í seo an chéim is mó a bheas tógtha ar son na Gaeilge ó cuireadh Raidió na Gaeltachta ar bun sna seachtóidí.</P>
      <P>Tá i gceist agam labhairt go ginearálta faoin nGaeilge, faoin nGaeltacht, agus, ar ndóigh, i ngeall nach bhfuil againn ach scór nóiméad ní bheidh mé in ann tagairt a dhéanamh ach do roinnt ábhar. Molaim, i dtosach, an rún atá faoi bhráid an Tí seo.  Níl aon amhras, dá mbeadh slánú na Gaeilge i ndán ach breis airgid a chaitheamh, bheadh sé cinntithe anois. Tháinig méadú fíor-shuntasach; bliain ar tháinig 4 faoin gcéad, de mhéadú ar na Meastacháin Rialtais ar fad, tháinig méadú 17 faon gcéad ar Mheastachán Roinn na Gaeltachta, agus ní beag sin. Ar ndóigh, caithfimid a admháil nach le hairgead amháin a shábhálfar an Ghaeilge.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh don Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, don Údarás agus do Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Rinne an Seanadóir Ó Foighil tagairt don méid a dúirt mé agus a raibh tuairisc air &mdash; ní alt a scríobh mé ach tuairisc &mdash; ar cheann de na páipéir laethúla le gairid.  Séard a bhí mé a rá ná go gcaithfear, arís agus arís eile, scrúdú a dhéanamh ar pholasaithe na Gaeilge.  Na rudaí a bhí feiliúnach sna caogaidí agus sna seascaidí tá cuid de na scéimeanna sin nach bhfuil feiliúnach do shaol an lae inniu.  I gcás na Gaeltachta, caithfimid breathnú as an nua ar ról na Roinne agus ar ról an Údaráis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar bhainisteoir comharchumainn is minic a chuala mé bainisteoirí comharchumainn ag gearán faoin mbealach a ndéanann an tÚdarás plé leo.  Is minic a chuala mé muintir na Gaeltachta ag gearán faoi easpa pholasaí teanga an Údaráis.  Is minic a chuala mé an gearán nár dhírigh an tÚdarás níos mó iarrachtaí (agus glacaimse leis go bhfuil athrú áirithe polasaí ann anois) ar pholasaithe forbartha a bheadh bunaithe ar acmhainn na teanga í féin.  Mar shampla, is le gairid amháin a cuireadh Telegael agus a leithéid ar bun le fístéipeanna a chur ar fáil. Níl mé sásta ach oiread go bhfuil ceangal <Col N="103" /> sách dlúth idir muintir riaracháin an Údaráis agus pobal na Gaeltachta.  Sin a deir na daoine liom, sin mo thaithí féin.</P>
    <P>Caithfear, níos mó agus níos mó, dul i gcomhairle leis an bpobal féin nuair a bheas pleananna forbartha do na ceantair á réiteach.  Freisin, mholfainn d'Údarás na Gaeltachta pleanáil go cuimsitheach le féachaint chuige go mbeidh áit lárnach ag an nGaeilge in aon fhorbairt atá ar bun sa Ghaeltacht.  Níl mise ag iarraidh go mbeidh cumhachtaí, mar shampla, turasóireachta, ar láimh amháin, ag Údarás na Gaeltachta agus, ar an láimh eile, ag Bord Fáilte sa Ghaeltacht.  Má tá locht ar bith ann, ó thaobh an dreama atá ag iarraidh obair a dhéanamh ar an talamh, is é go bhfuil an iomarca áisíneachtaí ag titim thar a chéile, ag cur dreamanna amú le hobair agus le hiarratais. Níl éinne atá gafa le cúrsaí forbartha nár mhaith leo an rud sin ar fad a fheiceáil simplithe.  Ach, cinnte, dearfa, i gcás na Gaeltachta, aon fhoras Stáit atá ag obair sa Ghaeltacht, caithfidh blas Gaeltachta, blas Gaeilge a bheith ar a gcuid oibre.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, d'fheicfinn mar a tharla leis na SES schemes go mbeadh cás ann go mbeadh gníomhaireacht Ghaeltachta ag Údarás na Gaeltachta nó ag dream mar iad thar ceann Ranna nó bhoird Stáit i bhfeidhmiú a gcuid polasaithe ar an talamh sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá sé seo thar a bheith tábhachtach i gcás na tuarasóireachta, mar feictear dom nach bhfuil polasaí Gaeilge ar bith ag Bord Fáilte. Feictear dom nach bhfuil béim dá laghad acu ar an acmhainn a bhaineann, ó thaobh tuarasóireachta de, leis an nGaeltacht agus leis na nGaeilge.  Ní fheicim aon chláir acu le daoine ón iasacht a thabhairt anall mar go bhfuil Gaeltacht againn agus, cinnte, tá an t-éileamh sin ann, go mórmhór ó ollscoileanna thar sáile.</P>
    <P>D'fheicfinn an rud céanna le FÁS.  Ní heol dom cén chaoi a oibríonn FÁS agus rannóga traenála an Údaráis i dteannta a chéile agus tá mé 17 mbliana ag plé leis <Col N="104" /> an dá dhream.  Feictear domsa go mba cheart gur faoi FÁS a bheadh ceapadh polasaí ach gur faoin Údarás a bheidh feidhmiú agus riaradh an pholosaí sin ó lá go lá sa Ghaeltacht, ó thaobh cúrsaí traenála de.  Maidir leis na cláracha nua atá ag teacht isteach &mdash; an clár Leader: Integrated Rural Development &mdash; creidim go mba cheart iadsan a eagrú sa Ghaeltacht ar bhonn Gaeltachta. Creidim gur idir an Roinn agus an tÚdarás a ba cheart na scéimeanna sin a oibriú.  Ní fheicim go bhfuil sé ciallmhar ná réasúnta go mbeadh Roinn na Gaeltachta ag íoc deontaisí riaracháin le bainisteoirí Ghaeltachta agus go mbeadh dream eile riaracháin áitiúil á chur isteach ag dream eile Stáit, ag an am gcéanna. Go minic, nuair a chuireann dreamanna ó thaobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht daoine isteach sa Ghaeltacht, ní cuirtear aon bhéim ar an dtábhacht go mbeidh Gaeilge ag an té a cheaptar.  Ba bhreá liomsa, nuair a bheas an t-athstructúrú á dhéanamh ar chúrsaí rialtais áitiúil, go dtabharfar aitheantas don Ghaeltacht san athstructúrú sin.  Ba chóir a chinntiú go dtabharfar aitheantas don Ghaeltacht mar aonad nó mar aonaid, go háirithe ó thaobh riarachán laethúil de.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh anois do Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Ní dóigh liom go bhféadfaí a sárú d'fháil ó thaobh riaracháin de, agus tá mé ag plé leis an Roinn le fada.  Deireann daoine eile a bhíonn ag plé leis an Roinn seo go bhfuil an-éifeacht leis an bhfoireann bheag sa Roinn agus go bhfuil simplíocht ag baint leis an cineál iarratais a chaithfear a chur chucu agus leis na coinníolacha a leagtar síos nuair a cheadaítear deontais.  I gcás comharchumainn de chuid Roinn na Gaeltachta, scríobhtar na coinníolacha ag gabháil le ceadú deontas ar leathanach amháin páipéir.  Bíonn suas le scór leathanacha de choinníolacha ag gabháil leis an deontais is lú ó Údarás na Gaeltachta. Ag deireach an lae, thabharfadh sé seo le fios gur lú an loiceadh ar dheontais agus ar choinníolacha deontas ag Roinn na Gaeltachta, ó thaobh loiceadh sa <Col N="105" /> ghnáthchiall nó ó thaobh daoine ag tabhairt droim láimhe dóibh, mar go bhfuil ceangal dílseachta ag daoine leis an Roinn mar go dtuigtear go gcaitear go cothrom leo.</P>
    <P>Molaim scéim chomharchumainn Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Is é an scéim seo, thar aon scéim eile, a thionscnaigh forbairt sna ceantair bheaga Gaeltachta. Murach an scéim sin ní bheadh comharchumann i mo cheantar féin.  Murach an comharchumann ní bheimis in ann iarratais a chur chuig an Roinn nó chuig an Údarás ar son rud ar bith.  Ba í an scéim agus an deontas reachtála a chuir ar chumas daoine an comharchumann a bhunú.  Cén fhorbairt a bheadh ann in Inis Meáin, in Inis Oírr, in Árainn Mhór, ar Oileán Chléire, i gCorca Dhuibhne, Cois Fharraige nó i nDún na nGall murach scéim chomharchumainn Roinn na Gaeltachta?  B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé in am dúinn athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar an scéim sin agus cuid de na téarmaí a athrú.  Tá mé féin ag moladh, le fada, go gcuirfí deireadh leis na deontais chaipitil agus go mbunófaí an cúnamh ar fad ar phleanáil Ghaeilge agus ar dheontais reachtála.  Fós féin, ba iontach éifeachtach an scéim sin ar bheagán caiteachais airgid.</P>
    <P>Bheadh go leor de na pobail Ghaeltachta marbh murach an cúnamh a tugadh do mhuiroibreacha.  Ba mhaith liom moladh speisialta a thabhairt don chúnamh fial a tugadh do mhuintir Inis Meáin anuraidh.  B'shin ceann de na scéimeanna is mó a chuaigh chun sochair muintir an oileáin ariamh.  Caitheadh go tuisceanach leis na daoine agus íocadh go scioptha iad.  Tá a fhios agam gur thug an scéim sin an-misneach do mhuintir an oileáin bhig sin atá ar cheann de na Gaeltachtaí is Gaelaí dá bhfuil sa tír.</P>
    <P>Ní mór breathnú freisin ar scéim na mná tí.  Is é an scéim seo a choimeádann an Ghaeilge beo sna Gaeltachtaí, cé gur beag a chaitear air.  Is é seo an t-aon scéim eacnamaíochta ar féidir a rá ina taobh, nach féidir greim a fháil ar an airgead mura bhfuil Gaeilge á labhairt sa teach <Col N="106" /> ina bhfuil na páistí ar saoire.  Is é seo an scéim thionsclaíoch is fairsinge agus is scaipthí sa Ghaeltacht agus gur féidir a rá faoi go dtreisíonn sé go mór leis an nGaeilge.  Molaim an Roinn go mór as an scéim sin.</P>
    <P>Creidim, in ainneoin atá ráite agam, go bhfuil sé in am dúinn breathnú ar chuid de scéimeanna na Roinne.  Luaigh an tAire an t-airgead atá á chaitheamh ar <i>Anois</i> agus an easpa díolaíochta atá air. Luaigh sé freisin scéim Bord na Leabhar Gaeilge.  Ní mór breathnú as an nua ar na scéimeanna seo.  Cuireadh alltacht agus uafás orm le deireanaí nuair a chuaigh mé ag cuardú fístéipeanna le bheith agam don choláiste Gaeilge i mbliana.  Ní raibh mé ábalta teacht ar sholáthar ceart fístéipeanna do na coláistí Gaeilge.  Is cosúil nach bhfuil a leithéid ar fáil ach oiread do mheánscoileanna nó do bhunscoileanna na tíre.  Má táimid ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a chur chun tosaigh, caithfear é seo a dhéanamh ar bhealach thaitneamhach nua-aimseartha.  Is minic a smaoiním ar an mhaitheas a dhéanfadh sé dá mbeadh a leithéid de Mickey Mouse nó Donald Duck ar fáil trí Ghaeilge le taispeáint lá fliuch i mbunscoileanna na tíre ag am an bhriseadh.  Bheadh an-tarraingt aige sin ar pháistí.  D'fhoghlaim mo pháistí féin Béarla ó bheith ag breathnú ar chláracha cartúin ar an teilifís.  Más féidir Béarla a fhoghlaim uathu, dob fhéidir Gaeilge a fhoghlaim uathu freisin.</P>
    <P>Maidir le ceist na Gaeilge i measc an phobail, measaim gurb é an cinneadh a ba thábhtachtaí ná an cinneadh a déanadh faoi theilifís na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá sé in am dúinn athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar na heagraíochtaí Gaeilge ar fad.  Ní leor a rá go bhfuil siad ann agus nach féidir iad a scrúdú mar dá ndéanfaí é sin go bhféadfaí a rá go raibh an scrúdaitheoir ina n-éadan agus in éadan na Gaeilge.  Baineann an fhadhb seo le gluaiseacht na Gaeilge le fada an lá.  Má deirtear rud ar bith futhu, cuireann na heagraíochtaí amach a gcuid spicí ar nós gráinneoige, agus diúltaíonn siad breathnú ar an gcás.  Níl aon amhras <Col N="107" /> ormsa ná go bhfuil an iomarca eagraíochtaí Gaeilge ann agus go bhfuil an iomarca airgid á chaitheamh orthu i leith riaracháin, go háirithe i mBaile Átha Cliath.</P>
    <P>Is minic nach dtuigim cén ról, ann féin, atá ag Bord na Gaeilge.  Tháinig an bord faoi bhráid Comhchoiste an Oireachtais agus nuair a bhí deireadh ráite, ní fhaca mé céard a bhí ar bun ach nach bhféadfadh dream eile a bhí ann rompu a dheánamh chomh maith céanna.  B'fhéidir nach dtuigim an cás go baileach agus muna dtuigim, fáilteoidh mé roimh eolas ar an gceist.</P>
    <P>Measaim gur Roinn na Gaeltachta amháin a ba chóir a bheith i mbun deontas Stáit a íoc ar imeachtaí Ghaeilge leasmuigh den Ghaeltacht, agus go mba chóir don Roinn iad a íoc go díreach le Gaelscoileanna agus le heagraíochtaí eile.  Ní fheicim ciall ná réasún le bheith ag cur airgid ón Roinn ar aghaidh go dtí an Bord agus ón mbord ar aghaidh go dtí eagraíochtaí eile.  Caithfear féachaint ar na fíor-riachtanais atá ann, ní ar chothú eagraíochtaí ar mhaithe le heagraíochtaí. Tá obair na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta ró-phráinneach.  Mar sin féin, tá borradh ó thaobh na Gaeilge i measc an phobail, agus admhaím é sin, agus tá go leor den chreidiúint sin ag dul do na Gaelscoileanna agus do Ghlór na nGael.  Agus ó thaobh Ghaeilgeoirí na tíre de, caithfear go leor den fhorbairt ar an nGaeilge a bhunú ar an dá ghluaiseacht sin.  Caithfear díriú ar a gcuid riachtanas agus an t-airgead atá ann a dhíriú, níos mó sa treo sin.  I gcás an phobail go ginearálta ní mór féachaint chuige go bhfuil ionad beag ag chuile eagraíocht Stáit in a mbeidh ar a gcumas cáipéisí a aistriú agus seirbhís a chur ar fáil i nGaeilge do phobal na Gaeilge.  Tá sé sin déanta, mar shampla, ag an dream cánach.  Tá sé déanta ag Bord Telecom agus molaim iad, ach caithfear leanúint leis an pholasaí sin agus é a chur ar fáil gan dua gan stró.</P>
    <P>Tá go leor eile gur mhaith liom a rá agus a cheapaim go mb'fhiú a rá, ach, ar ndóigh, ceal ama, ní bheidh deis agam na <Col N="108" /> hábhair sin a phlé anois.  Ach ag deireadh, ba mhaith liom moladh eile a dhéanamh, go ndéanfadh RTÉ cinneadh go gcuirfí ar fáil, go mór mhór nuair a bheidh an Dáil agus an Seanad á dteilifísiú, clár seachtainiúil i nGaeilge de na sleachta as díospóireachtaí an tSeanaid agus na Dála.  Tá mé cinnte, dá ndéanfaí sin, go dtiocfadh méadú 300 faoin gcéad ar úsáid na Gaeilge sa dá Theach, agus gurbh shin an bealach ba phraiticiúla a d'fhéadfadh RTÉ, i gcomhar le Tithe an Oireachtais, úsáid na Gaeilge in dhá Theach an Oireachtais a chur chun cinn i mbliana.</P>

      <P>Is rún amaideach é seo, dar liomsa, rún gan bhrí, rún nach bhfuil taobh thiar de ach plámás.  Níl i seachtain na Gaeilge ach gnás folamh. Deir an rún &ldquo;go molann Seanad Éireann Aire na Gaeltachta as an soláthar fial atá déanta ag an Rialtas don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht&rdquo;.  Má tá sé fíor, má tá siad tar éis caitheamh go fial agus go flaithiúil leis an teanga náisiúnta agus an Ghaeltacht, níl ansin ach an dualgas atá air.  Níl aon mholadh tuillte aige dá bharr. Is é fírinne an scéil nach bhfuil faic na ngrás déanta ag an Rialtas seo ná ag Fianna Fáil, ó tháinig siad ar ais i gcumhacht i 1987, chun an Ghaeilge a chothú. Dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Foighil go bhfuil dul ar aghaidh áirithe déanta sa tír, ó thaobh na teanga de, agus thagair an Seanadóir Ó Cuív d'eagraíochtaí ar nós Gaelscoileanna agus Glór na nGael. Ach, is don phobal atá an chreidiúint ag dul agus ní don Rialtas.  Is grúpaí deonacha, tuismitheoirí agus na gnáthdhaoine, atá ag cur na Gaeilge ar aghaidh i láthair na huaire gan aon bhuíochas don Rialtas.  Is iad Fianna Fáil a mhaíonn gurb iadsan caomhnóirí na teanga &mdash; aidhm de dhá mhóraidhm náisiúnta is ea athbheochan na teanga.  Luach lárnach is ea athbheochan na Gaeilge, mar dhea, ach, mo léan, níl fianaise ar bith go gcreideann siad gurb amhlaidh atá.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá stádas na Gaeilge an-lag sa saol poiblí, agus ní dhéanfainn aon idirdhealú idir saol na ndaoine, fiú saol na ndaoine <Col N="109" /> sa Ghalltacht &mdash; tá ag éirí níos fearr leis an teanga sa Ghalltacht i láthair na huaire ná sa Ghaeltacht &mdash; ach dhéanfainn idirdhealú idir saol na ngnáthdhaoine agus an saol poiblí, an saol polaitiúil, agus tá stádas na Gaeilge lag sa saol polaitiúil. Anocht, ar feadh tamaill mhaith, ní raibh ach fotheidil Bhéarla ar an scáileán teilifíse, item No. 4.  Nuair a tháinig an tAire Stáit isteach sa Teach seo cuireadh fáilte roimhe trí Bhéarla ag an gCathaoirleach, agus is é an leagan Béarla den rún a léigh an Cathaoirleach amach.  Bheifeá ag súil go mbeadh Fianna Fáil chun tosaigh ag iarraidh Alt a hOcht de Bhunreacht na hEireann a chomhlíonadh, os í an Ghaeilge an teanga náisiúnta, is í an phríomhtheanga oifigiúil í.  Ach níl sé le thabhairt faoi deara go dtógann siad an chlasáil sin í ndáiríre.  Sa Seanad anseo, níos mó ná uair amháin, chuir siad daoine ar aghaidh chun oifigí a líonadh, an Chathaoir agus oifigí eile, nach raibh ach ar bheagán Gaeilge nó nach raibh aon Ghaeilge acu.  I mo thuairimse, is comhartha drochmheasa é sin ar a ndearcadh ar an nGaeilge.</P>
    <P>B'éigean don Seanadóir Ó Foighil cás cúirte a bhagairt ar an Rialtas sar ar ghéilleadar dó, sar ar thugadar dó a cheart bunreachtúil trí chóras aistriúcháin a chur ar fáil.  Ní hionann agus fadó, is fíorbheagán cainteoirí Fhianna Fáil anois a bhfuil fiú an cúpla focal acu.  Tá sé sin, is trua liom a rá, le tabhairt faoi deara.  Níl ach an dornán anois a bhacann fiú leis an gcúpla focal.  Tá fáinne airgid, an bhfuil a fhios agaibh, ag bean chéile Ambasadóir na Breataine sa tír seo, an Bantiarna Fenn, agus déarfainn go bhfuil níos mó Gaeilge aici siúd ná mar atá ag an-chuid de dhaoine Fhianna Fáil.  B'fhéidir go n-éireoidh le hathbheochan na Gaeilge thall i Sasana.  Thug an Taoiseach óráid fhada uaidh ag an Ard-Fheis ag deireadh na seachtaine seo caite ach bhí sé suimiúil nach raibh ach cúpla alt suarach aige trí Ghaeilge.  Ó bhliain go bliain laghdaítear ar an méid Gaeilge atá le cloisteáil ar ócáidí poiblí mar sin.  Thug sé agallamh don chlár &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; agus <Col N="110" /> bhí sé ag plé cheist na teilifíse, is é sin teilifís Ghaeilge nó teilifís na Gaeltachta, agus ba léir ón méid a dúirt sé, agus ba léir ón dearcadh a bhí aige, go gceapann sé anois nach bhfuil sa teanga ach meán chun dream beag a shásamh, rinne sé tagairt do Ghaeilgeoirí faoi mar a dhéanfadh naimhde na teanga fadó, ag tabhairt le tuiscint nach bhfuil iontu ach dream beag agus caithfear iad a shásamh ar shlí éigin.</P>
    <P>Bheadh sé i bhfad níos fearr dá mbeadh sé de mhacántacht ag an Taoiseach a rá go bhfuil an cluiche caillte nó an cluiche imeartha ó thaobh Fhianna Fáil de. Maidir le comhpháirtí an Rialtais, na Progressive Democrats, cén tionchar atá acu siúd ar dhearcadh nó ar pholasaí an Rialtais? Bhí mé ag breathnú ar an dréacht atá acu de Bhunreacht na hEireann, agus is léir go bhfuil céim síos tugtha acu don teanga, fiú sa Bhunreacht sin, cé go bhfuil an dá leagan ann.  Níor chuala mé riamh aon bhall de na Progressive Democrats a bheith díograiseach faoin teanga náisiúnta. Ní foláir go bhfuil sé sin i gceist mar thionchar ar plolasaí an Rialtais chomh maith.  Ach is é an masla is mó atá tugtha ag an Rialtas, ag Fianna Fáil, don Ghaeilge, agus is masla a thosaigh cúpla bliain ó shin, agus maireann sé fós, ná nach bhfuil an Taoiseach sásta aon Aire faoi leith a cheapadh don Ghaeltacht. Ann féin, is céim síos tubaisteach don teanga é siúd nach bhfuil aon Aire ag bord an Rialtais le gradam lán-Aire, seachas Aire sóisearach, Aire Stáit.  Is rud scannalach é sin, dar liom.  Bhí Aire na Gaeilge sa chéad Dáil agus i mblianta tosaigh na réabhlóide, agus táimid ag cúlú siar ó shin i leith.</P>
    <P>Tá go maith, bíodh an Taoiseach ina Aire Gaeltachta, agus más amhlaidh atá, ba chóir dó na dualgais sin a chomhlíonadh. Cá bhfuil sé anocht?  Cad ina thaobh nach bhfuil sé anseo, agus i mbun an rúin sa Teach seo anocht?  An bhfuil sé róghnóthach in áit éigin eile?  An bhfuil aon ní níos gnóthaí ná gnó na teanga Gaeilge? Is rud uafásach é, dar liom, nach labhraíonn sé féin an Ghaeilge ach go <Col N="111" /> fíorannamh agus, go bhfóire Dia orainn, droch-Ghaeilge ansin.  Tríd is tríd, mar sin, níl sa rún seo ach cur i gcéill; cuireann sé déistean orm agus táim chun cur ina aghaidh go tréan.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach seo.  Caithfidh mé freisin mo bhuíochas agus mo chomhghairdeas a ghabháil leis toisc a mhéad airgid a thug sé don Ghaeilge, do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus d'Údarás na Gaeltachta i mbliana.  Is ait an rud é ach bíonn gearán ann i gcónaí ag na daoine ar an taobh eile den Teach seo.  Caithfidh muid féachaint ar record Fhianna Fáil i leith na Gaeilge. Cé a bhunaigh Údarás na Gaeltachta, cé a chuir Raidió na Gaeltachta ar siúl, cé a chuir Bord na Gaeilge ar siúl &mdash; an ndearna an Comhrialtas nó na daoine ar an taobh eile den Teach?  Ar bhunaigh siad aon rud riamh i dtaobh na Gaeilge? Bhíodar ann ó 1974 go dtí 1978.  Cad a rinne siad?  Ní dhearna siad faic i dtaobh na Gaeilge.  Bhí siad ann arís ó 1983 go 1986 agus an t-aon rud a rinne siad ná caint san aer.  Táimid anois tar éis fógra a fháil ón Taoiseach go bhfuil sé chun teilifís do mhuintir na Gaeltachta a chur ar siúl.  Ní haon mhasla é ón Taoiseach gan a bheith anseo anocht.  Tá fear chomh maith anseo ó Dhún na nGall agus tá fáilte roimhe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aontaím leis an tairiscint atá romhainn. I mbliana thug Rialtas Fhianna Fáil méadú mór ar an airgead don Ghaeltacht, níos mó ná £26 mhilliún, i gcomparáid le £16 mhilliún anuraidh.  Thugamar deontas dúbalta d'Údarás na Gaeltachta, beagnach £23 mhilliún.  Faoi mar a dúirt Aire na Gaeltachta, an Taoiseach é féin, &ldquo;Is í an Ghaeilge croí-lár ár n-oidhreachta, an tseoid is luachmhaire agus an comhartha is suntasaí ar ár náisiúntacht&rdquo;. Ag an deireadh seachtaine, d'fhógair an tAire go mbunófar teilifís na Gaeltachta an bhliain seo chugainn.  Tá a fhios againn go léir cé chomh tábhachtach is atá na meáin chumarsáide.  Ní fada ó tháinig an teilifís isteach sa Teach seo.  Is ar RTÉ a <Col N="112" /> bhíonn na craoltaí faoi láthair, ach an bhliain seo chugainn beidh muid in ann freastal i gceart ar an nGaeltacht, áit arb as dom féin, agus níl fáth ar bith nach mbeidh ár gcuid gnó sa Teach seo trí Ghaeilge.  Tá an córas aistriúcháin againn anois agus caithim arís buíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire mar is é sin a thug an córas aistriúcháin sin dúinn.  Bhí mé ag éisteacht leis an Seanadóir Ó Foighil ar feadh tamaill ansin ag caint as Gaeilge, agus bhí sé ag éisteacht leis an gcóras aistriúcháin; ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis na daoine a bhí ag déanamh an aistriúcháin.  Níl a fhios agam cá bhfuil siad, ach tá siad ag éisteacht.</P>
    <P>Mar is eol do Sheanadóirí tá cúrsaí Gaeilge le tosú ag an Státchóras, Bord na Gaeilge, ar 9 Aibreáin, agus is iad GaelLinn a bheidh i gceannas.  Beidh sé ar siúl trí lá sa tseachtain, Dé Máirt, Dé Céadaoin agus Déardaoin, agus mairfidh siad uair a chloig, ag tosú 9.30 ar maidin, agus arís ar a sé a chlog tráthnóna.  Níl leithscéal ag éinne gan freastal ar na cúrsaí.  Má úsáideann gach aon duine againn beagáinín níos mó Gaeilge beidh muid in ann ár ndúchas a shábháil, agus go mórmhór sa bhliain 1992 é a thaispeáint don domhan.  Chomh maith leis sin, tá an seomra speisialta curtha ar fáil ina bhfuil taifeadáin ar fáil as Gaeilge. Mar chuid den ullmhúchán le haghaidh na bliana seo chugainn, is é Rialtas Fhianna Fáil a thug isteach clárphlátaá nua doghluaisteáin &mdash; plataí dhátheangacha a thaispeánann ainm an chontae, i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla, chomh maith le hainm an Chomhphobail.  Bhí an-áthas orm an chéad cheann a fheiceáil roimh an Nollaig ag an Aire Comhshaoil, an Teachta Flynn.</P>
    <P>Bunaíodh Bord na Gaeilge faoi Rialtas Fhianna Fáil sa bhliain 1978.  Is córas Stáit iad rud a ndéanann an-chuid daoine dearmad de.  Is í aidhm an bhoird an dátheangachas a chur ar aghaidh ar fud na tíre, go mbeadh an Ghaeilge mar phríomhtheanga sa Ghaeltacht agus béim ar leith uirthi in áiteanna eile mar theanga thráthúil.  Ní chuireann sé isteach ar aon <Col N="113" /> duine an dá theanga a bheith aige.  Chun an fhírinne a rá is dóigh liom féin go gcabhraíonn sé go mór nuair a bhíonn duine ag iarraidh teanga eile a fhoghlaim &mdash; cibé acu Fraincís, Arabais nó aon teanga eile.  Mar chid den obair seo chuir Bord na Gaeilge roinnt féilte seachtaine agus deireadh seachtaine ar siúl.  Chuir siad dhá fhístéip ar fáil.  Beidh siad ag reachtáil Fonn '91 i mBaile Átha Cliath, comórtas d'amhráin nuachumtha i nGaeilge.  Tá comórtais á n-eagrú ag lucht gnó, ollmhargaá agus óstáin.</P>
    <P>Is é Bord na Gaeilge a bhunaigh ÁIS, an comhlacht mór díolacháin do leabhair Ghaeilge.  An bhliain seo caite dhíol ÁIS leabhair le 350 siopa sa tír seo agus d'fhreastail seo ar dhá thír déag thar lear. Tá tuairim is 2,500 teideal á láimhseáil ag AIS.  Tugann an córas Stáit seo, Bord na Gaeilge, deontais do Chomhar na Múinteoirí Gaeilge agus cabhair eile oideachais; bíonn said párteach sa Chomhchoiste Réamhscolaíochta freisin. Tá rannóg speisialta ag an mbord chun plé le cearta daoine agus tá fáilte roimh chách an tseirbhís seo a úsáid chun cabhair a fháil trí Ghaeilge.  Le tamall anuas tá tuiscint ag lucht gnó ar thábhacht na Gaeilge, rud atá soiléir ón méadú a tháinig ar fhógraíocht trí Ghaeilge. Roimhe seo is minic a bhí clú an fanatic ar daoine a d'úsáid an Ghaeilge, ach anois tá sé soiléir, ní amháin do lucht na siopaí agus na gnóthaí beaga ach don tionsclóir gur rud indíolta í an Gaeilge: Feargal Quinn, Tim agus Denis O'Mahony agus Marks and Dpencer ina measc.  Tá gradam bunaithe acu a chuirfidh an Ghaeilge chun cinn go rialta, ní amháin ar chursaí gailf agus ag lóin.  Tá iarracht á déanamh acu.  Tuigeann gnáth-mhuintir na hÉireann tábhacht na Gaeilge.  Tá os cionn 225 naíscoil agus breis is 50 Gaelscoil sa tír anois.  Ní bhíonn mórán Gaeilge ag tuismitheoirí na leanaí seo go minic ach tá siad ag déanamh iarrachta.</P>
    <P>Bhíodh faitíos ar dhaoine uaireanta an Ghaeilge a usáid ar eagla go mbeadh an lipéad &ldquo;fanatic&rdquo; á chur orthu.  Buíochas le Dia tá an lá sin thart.  Táimid sna <Col N="114" /> nóchaidí anois.  Tá dúil ag pobal na tíre inár dteanga féin, an Ghaeilge.  Is sinn-ne ionadaithe an phobail, béal na ndaoine. Nach ceart dúinn an iarracht chéanna a dhéanamh?  Chuir sé brón orm nuair a thug an Teachta John Bruton, ceannaire Fhine Gael, ísliú chéime don Ghaeilge leis an mbinse tosaigh a d'ainmnigh sé le déanaí.  Cuir sin i gcomparáid leanár gceannaire féin, An Taoiseach, Cathal Ó hEochaidh, atá ina Aire Gaeltachta é féin.</P>
    <P>Is í seo seachtain na Gaeilge.  Tosnóimis inniu.  Cuirimis go lé le chéile faoi mar a dhein Fianna Fáil ar son na Gaeilge.  Aontaím leis an rún, a Chathaoirligh.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús caithfidh mé a rá nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge go ró-mhaith agam mar tá mé as cleachtadh le blianta.  Mar sin féin, os rud é gurb í seo seachtain na Gaeilge, déanfaidh mé iarracht.  Ní aontaím leis an rún.  Dar liomsa tá gá i bhfad níos mó airgid a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht leis an teanga agus an Ghaeltacht féin a fhorbairt.</P>
      <P>Tá go leor deacrachtaí le sárú sa Ghaeltacht. Tá na daoine óga, go mór-mhór, ag imeacht ón nGaeltacht agus nuair a imíonn siad tógann siad leo cultúr ansaibhir. Is mór an trua é nach bhfilleann mórán de na daoine sin thar n-ais go buan.  Cé go bhfilleann cuid acu ar laetheannta saoire is cúis bhróin domsa go bhfuil an scéal mar atá.  Tá an-chuid daoine sa Ghaeltacht dífhostaithe mar tá go leor le déanamh fós le tionscail a fhorbairt inti.  Tá deacrachtaí eile ag baint leis an infrastructure.  Bhí go leor le rá ag an Seanadóir Ó Cuív go speisialta maidir leis an gcóras teileafóin sa Ghaeltacht agus maidir le costas an chórais go háirithe do thionsclaíocht sa Ghaeltacht.  Dar liomsa bhí go leor den cheart ag an Seanadóir Ó Cuív nuair a labhair sé ar na hábhair sin. Tá go leor deacrachtaí ag baint le bóithre na Gaeltachta, na bóithre beaga go mór-mhór ar a bhfuil an t-uafás pot-holes.</P>
      <P>Bhí cúpla rud le rá ag an Seanadóir Fitzgerald mar gheall ar na &ldquo;fanatics&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" /> Níl siad chomh forleathan nó chomh fanaticiúil is a bhí siad.  Is rud an-mhaith é sin mar dhein siadsan a lán damáiste don teanga tríd na blianta.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an teanga féin, níl an scéal ró-mhaith.  Tá an-chuid daoine as cleachtadh cosúil liomsa agus tá moladh ag dul do Bhord na Gaeilge agus daoine mar sin atá ag déanamh iarrachta deiseanna a thabhairt do dhaoine atá as cleachtadh a gcuid Gaeilge a fheabhsú.  Cuirim fáilte roimh an obair atá á déanamh ag an mbord ón dtaobh sin de.  Níl na daoine ag labhairt na teanga chomh forleathan is a bhí siad.  Ní rud maith é sin ar chor ar bith.  Cuirimse fáilte roimh seachtain na Gaeilge agus tá súil agam go n-éireoidh léi.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa ar dtús fáilte a chur roimh an Aire, an Teachta Gallagher agus á rá go n-aontaím leis an rún atá os ár gcomhair.  Déanaim comhgháirdeas leis an Seanadóir Pat Upton as an sár-iarracht a rinne sé an Ghaeilge a labhairt sa Teach anocht.  Ní aontaím leis ach mar sin féin tréaslaim leis as ucht an méid a bhí le rá aige.</P>
      <P>Rinne an Seanadóir Murphy tagairt do phlámás an Rialtais i leith an rúin seo agus athbheochan na Gaeilge.  I mo thuairimse is daoine diagasúla cosúil leis an Seanadóir Murphy, daoine atá cinnte go bhfuil siad níos fearr na éinne eile sa tír, agus a bhfuil gearán acu faoi gach aon ní, a dhéanann níos mó damáiste do ahtbheochan na Gaeilge ná aon duine eile.  Bhí sé ag caint faoi dhaoine nach bhfuil mórán Gaeilge acu a bhí á gcur ar aghaidh ag Fianna Fáil do phostanna éagsúla.  Níl aon rud cearr leis sin, i mo thuairimse.  Éinne a bhfuil spéis aige sa Ghaeilge, ba cheart gach aon chabhair a thabhairt dó chun an Ghaeilge a labhairt agus chun a shuim sa Ghaeilge agus san athbheochan a spreagadh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir, ar an gcéad dul síos, go raibh labhairt na Gaeilge ag imeacht ó na daoine agus, ar an dtaobh <Col N="116" /> eile den scéal, dúirt sé go raibh athbheochan na Gaeilge ag dul ar aghaidh in áiteanna éagsúla.  Ní fhéadfadh sin a bheith ag tarlú, áfach, gan cabhair a fháil ón Rialtas i bhfoirm deontais agus araoile chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Gach uair a labhraíonn an Seanadóir Murphy tugann sé masla don Taoiseach. Cibé rud a dheineann an Taoiseach níl sé ceart i dtuairim an tSeanadora.  Is uafásach an scéal é go bhfuil sé ag teacht isteach anseo ag déanamh gearáin agus ag déanamh damáiste do athbheochan na Gaeilge.  Tá seisean cinnte gur cheart go mbeadh an Ghaeilge go líofa ag gach éinne chun í a labhairt ar an gcéad dul síos.  Ní hé sin an bealach chun an Ghaeilge a chur ar aghaidh in aon chor. Caithfimid gach iarracht a dhéanamh na daoine a mhealladh chun an Ghaeilge a labhairt.  Tá daoine a bhfuil an-spéis acu sa Ghaeilge ach nach bhfuil ar a gcumas í a labhairt.  Mar sin féin, tá siad sásta iarracht a dhéanamh agus molann siad dá gcuid páistí féin an teanga a labhairt. Tá mise i mo bhall de ghrúpa stiúrtha a bhunaigh an Rialtas roinnt blianta ó shin chun an Ghaeilge a chothú tríd an chóras rialtais áitiúil.  Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil an-dul chun cinn déanta ag an ngrúpa sin. Tá an-chabhair ar fáil againn, ní amháin ón Rialtas, ach ó Bhord na Gaeilge, Chomhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge agus eagraíochtaí eile mar iad.  Chomh mhaith leis sin, is fíor go bhfuil borradh agus feabhas tagtha ar athbheochan na Gaeilge ó bunaíodh na Gaelscoileanna.</P>
    <P>Ba mhór an onóir dúinn féin i Borrisokane nuair a thug an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Gallagher, cuairt ar an mbaile chun teastas agus boinn a bhronnadh ar thuismitheoirí agus dhaltaí a bhí ag freastal ar ranganna Gaeilge.  Bhí slua mór i láthair ag an mbronnadh an oíche sin. Creidim go bhfuil níos mó suime sa Ghaeilge faoi láthair ná mar a bhí riamh.  Cén fáth go bhfuil sé seo amhlaidh?  Níorbh fhéidir, dar liomsa, é a dhéanamh gan an chabhair a bhí le fáil ón Rialtas.  Tá an-spéis ag an bpobal sna hiarrachtaí atá ar siúl, ar nós an tionscnaimh atá ar siúl <Col N="117" /> againn féin le cúpla bliain anuas, &ldquo;Tiobraid Árann ag labhairt&rdquo;.  Léiríonn sé seo uilig cad is féidir a dhéanamh agus léiríonn sé chomh maith go bhfuil an-spéis ag na daoine ina bhfuil ar siúl chun an teanga náisiúnta a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Tréaslaím arís don Aire Stáit, don Taoiseach agus do Roinn na Gaeltachta as a bhfuil á dhéanamh acu, agus is mór an onóir dom cuidiú leis an rún.</P>

      <P>Déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire Stáit as an obair atá á déanamh aige chun ár dteanga dhúchais a neartú.  Is dócha gur chuala na Seanadóirí an seanfhocal.  &ldquo;Is fearr Gaeilge briste ná Béarla cliste&rdquo;.  Níl ach Gaeilge bhriste agamsa ach tá áthas orm go bhfuil níos mó Gaeilge in úsáid anois.  Cluinim Gaeilge á labhairt ar na páirceanna imeartha gailf, rud a thugann le fios go bhfuil dul chun cinn déanta.  Sílim go bhfuil níos mó Gaeilge lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht ná laistigh.  Nuair a chuala mé an Seanadóir Ó Foighil ag rá go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag dul i laige sa Ghaeltacht níor chuir sé mórán iontais orm mar tá sí ag dul i laige ansin le blianta fada anois. Nach mór an trua nach féidir leis an Aire deontas a thabhairt do thionsclóirí lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht a bheadh sásta monarcha a thógáil lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht agus gan ach fostaithe le Gaeilge bheith ag obair ann.  Dá ndéanfaí a leithéid sin chuirfeadh sé feabhas mór ar an scéal.  Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh le Bord na Gaeilge, mar sílim gurb iad an grúpa is mó agus is gníomhaí maidir leis an teanga a chur chun cinn.  Is cá an bord a bhí taobh thiar de fhochoistí a bhunú sna comhairlí contae agus is iad na comhairleoirí féin atá ag brú na Gaeilge ar aghaidh.  Bíonn cúrsaí Gaeilge ar siúl ag a lán comhairlí contae faoi láthair.  Sa fochoiste againn féin i Sligeach tá cúrsa Gaeilge beartaithe don mhí seo chugainn agus bainfidh mé úsáid as.  Mar fhocal scoir, déanaim comhghairdeas arís leis an Aire Stáit agus leo siúd a chuir an rún seo os ár gcomhair anocht.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - Darndale (Dublin) Estate.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. S. Haughey Mr. S. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this item to be taken on the Adjournment.  I also thank the Minister of State for being here so late this evening to take this matter.</P>
      <P>The last time I spoke at length in this House about Darndale was a few years ago when problems emerged in relation to travellers encamped on the Darndale link road adjacent to the Darndale estate. At that time, real unrest existed in Darndale because of the unsatisfactory living conditions of the travellers involved.  Thankfully, that matter has now been resolved.  In consultation with local community organisations the Department of the Environment provided funding for special housing schemes at Grove Lane and Caragh Park, and Dublin Corporation gave special preference to travellers in their allocation policy for the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Darndale is a Dublin Corporation housing estate on the northern city boundary.  It consists of 921 houses. When the estate was built in the seventies it won design awards.  What emerged, however, was a disaster.  The housing was of poor quality and many social problems emerged.  Tenants continually complained of defects and maintenance problems. Unemployment and problems associated with poverty contributed to ensure that Darndale simply was not a desirable place to live in.  The community in Darndale was further damaged following the introduction of the £5,000 <Col N="119" /> house purchase grant scheme.  What seems to have happened is that half the tenants, including many of the active community leaders in the estate, simply left the area and purchased private houses.</P>
    <P>During the eighties, however, the people of Darndale began to fight back. A group of young people from Darndale, known as the &ldquo;Image Changers&rdquo;, set about changing the image of their own area.  In response to this community initiative the Government and Dublin Corporation decided to implement a remedial works scheme for the Darndale estate.  I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Flynn, and to the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, for making the necessary finance available for phases one, two and three of the Darndale remedial works scheme.  The situation to date is as follows: phase one involving 81 houses at Primrose Grove and phase two consisting of 119 houses at Buttercup Park, are now completed.  Phase three has been sanctioned.  A builder has been appointed and work is about to commence. I pay tribute to all concerned in preparing these plans.  The new, refurbished houses are a great improvement on the old and credit is due to Dublin Corporation and the personnel employed there.  There are some outstanding complaints in relation to phases one and two but I am hopeful that these will be dealt with in due course in the normal matter.</P>
    <P>I regret to inform the Minister that problems have emerged in relation to the haste of the refurbishment works.  There are many hardworking community groups in the Darndale area and several of them have contacted me recently expressing concern in this regard.  These groups include the Darndale Tenants' and Residents' Association, the Darndale Belcamp Development Association and another group called THREAD, which is an amalgamation of several groups, and also more recently the local parish priest, Father Oliver Barry.  I <Col N="120" /> might just mention as an aside that Darndale has a great community spirit. There are literally 40 community organisations working in the community and I do not think you will get that kind of dedication in many communities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I know the House would like me to extend sympathy to the family of the late, hardworking and popular chairman of the Darndale Tenants' and Residents' Association, Mr. George Lynch.  He certainly will be sadly missed in the community.</P>
    <P>At the present rate of progress in relation to the refurbishment programme, it may take up to ten years to complete the entire estate.  Many tenants simply do not know when their house will be refurbished.  The tenants are poorly motivated to maintain their houses and, indeed, their general environment.  The new plan for social housing and its emphasis on private housing may lead to a new exodus from Darndale.  This would be a worrying development as the community could become even further destabilised.  The community is now being divided between the haves and the have-nots, those who are in newly refurbished houses and those in the old houses.  This has led to envy, mistrust, frustration and even despair in some cases.  This delay in dividing the community and it offers no incentive to those awaiting the redesign to feel settled or to feel pride and interest in their own area. Tenants complain also that essential repairs are not being carried out quickly by the local authority pending the redesign of the houses.</P>
    <P>The members of Dublin City Council and the corporation management are very much aware of these new, emerging problems.  We have asked, as a city council, that phases four, five, six and seven be submitted to the Department of the Environment together for sanction and that they be completed on a rolling basis.  The corporation management informed the members of the housing <Col N="121" /> construction committee on 28 February 1991 that they wrote to the Department of the Environment seeking permission to submit phases four, five, six and seven together.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for the Environment and his junior Ministers for their help and co-operation to date.  I ask the Minister to accede to this request from Dublin City Council.  It is essential for the prosperity of Darndale that the speed of the refurbishment works be increased and that the necessary funding be provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Gaeltacht (Mr. Gallagher) Pat 'the Cope' Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Gaeltacht (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with the Darndale project, I would like to say a few words about the remedial works scheme in general and in particular the role it plays in local authority housing. I want to make it clear that the management and maintenance of their rented dwellings are matters for the local authorities, to be funded from their revenue resources.  The remedial works scheme was introduced to assist them in tackling major structural problems which it was recognised would put an intolerable strain on these resources.  Eligible works include the refurbishment of dwellings built under low cost arrangements, pre-1940 dwellings in need of structural repairs and modern sanitary facilities and certain run-down urban estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Darndale is one of approximately 75 estates which are benefiting from the scheme.  As Senator Haughey pointed out, Darndale is a 921 house estate built by the corporation in the seventies.  The refurbishment involves a redesign of the original estate layout as well as structural works to the houses.  Because of the size of the project and the high cost involved, over £12 million is appropriate and it should be carried out on a phased basis. However, I must emphasise that the location and the number of dwellings involved in each phase and the amount to be assigned to the project from their annual remedial work scheme allocation <Col N="122" /> are entirely matters for decision by the corporation.  To date, phases one and two, 81 houses in Primrose Grove and 119 houses in Buttercup Park have been completed.</P>
    <P>Following the recent approval of the Minister for the Environment for the acceptance of a tender, work is about to commence on phase three &mdash; 119 houses at Primrose Grove.  Preliminary documentation in respect of phase four to 112 houses in Marigold Court is being examined in the Department of the Environment.  The corporation's proposals in regard to future tendering procedures are also under examination in the Department of the Environment and the Department will be in contact with the corporation about this matter as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Darndale is one of seven Dublin Corporation housing estates which have been designated for funding under the remedial works scheme.  The others are Ballymun, Cherry Orchard, Blessington Street, St. Mary's Mansions, Fatima Mansions and Oliver Bond House.  The total estimated cost of these projects is in the region of £80 million.  The corporation have to date been allocated capital totalling some £13.4 million in respect of these schemes, including £5.3 million or one-third of the total available nationally in 1990.  The apportionment of the allocation between their approved schemes, including Darndale, is entirely a matter for themselves but it must be recognised that an increase in expenditure in Darndale in any year must involve a cutback on one or more of the remaining schemes.  That is a matter for decision by the corporation and not for the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>There can scarcely be a Senator who has not seen the beneficial effects of a remedial scheme project in his or her own area.  It is an excellent scheme geared to preserving and improving the existing housing stock.  I must, however, make it clear that it is not a substitute for a properly planned and executed programme of <Col N="123" /> management and maintenance and should not be seen as relieving an authority of their responsibility for keeping their housing stock in good condition.  It would also be unreasonable to expect them to deal overnight with the backlog of problems which have built up over the years.  That the Government are committed to the scheme is evident from the increase in capital allocations from an outturn of £1.5 million back in 1986 to £16 million in 1991.  It is, of course, open to the corporation to supplement from their own revenue resources the allocations made by the Department as a means of expediting work in Darndale.</P>
    <P>There is, I am sure, much that can be <Col N="124" /> done to improve the housing in general and the environmental conditions of those tenants whose dwellings are not due for immediate refurbishment.  It is also essential that they should take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the management and maintenance of the estate is such as to ensure that the benefits of the refurbishment continue in the longer term, that the substantial investment in the project is protected and that the quality of their housing accommodation is maintained in the future for the benefit of the residents of Darndale.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 14 March 1991.</P>
