      <P>I have notice from Senator Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to bring forward his proposals for remedying the miscarriage of justice in the Nicky Kelly case with a view to recommending a Presidential pardon.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the light of the report adopted by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe to ask the Soviet authorities in Moscow (1) to reopen the file on Mr. Raoul Wallenberg and his driver, and (2) to <Col N="2" /> allow an international commission access to all the relevant archives.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that the extension to St. Mary's national school, Askeaton, is constructed in 1992.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to intervene in the present strike by court staff in view of the escalation of the strike, having regard to the consequences for the legal system and the hardship caused to the general public.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Costello, Norris, Neville and Cosgrave <Col N="3" /> as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Costello's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Norris, Neville and Cosgrave may give notice another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is as follows: from the conclusion of the Order of Business until 6 p.m. we will have Second Stage of the Sea Pollution Bill, 1990. There will be a sos from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.; at 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. we will take item No. 40 on the Supplementary Order Paper, that is, the Independent motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, may I first of all ask the Leader of the House for a detailed schedule of the Bills and business to be taken this session? The Government have had three months to prepare such a programme, yet so far as we have no indication on this side of the House as to what is proposed for this session. If we do not get that information early on the Business of the House will become a shambles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask that three specific matters be debated during this current session, and on this Order of Business I would like to say this to the Leader of the House. First, as we all know a great deal has happened since we last met here. There have been various scandals and controversies. We have record unemployment. There has been the growing crisis in agriculture. There are the difficulties with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> A whole range of things have happened since we last met. What I want &mdash; it is what my party <Col N="4" /> want and is something from which the House could benefit &mdash; is a full scale state of the nation debate here during this session where we can, as a Parliament, address all of these questions. If we do not talk about them &mdash; and we are the only people in the country who are not talking about these issues&mdash;we are bringing the whole process of Parliament into disrepute.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I asked on a number of occasions last session that we have a debate on Northern Ireland but on each occasion I was refused. I was told it was unhelpful because of the Brooke talks and, in fact, there may have been some justification for that. Now there are no talks. There is a political vacuum which has been filled by brutal sectarian killings and Northern Ireland threatens to go into full-scale civil war. I ask the Leader of the House, as a matter of urgency, to have a debate on Northern Ireland in this House so that we can analyse the situation and see if we have any contribution to make to fill the vacuum that exists there at present.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I would like to ask the Leader of the House questions. I have here two documents. Document No. 1 is the <i>Programme for Government, 1989-91.</i> In that there is a specific commitment to reform the Houses of the Oireachtas by the end of 1989. As we all know, that did not happen. In the document No. 2, of happy memory, published last week, the reference to reform of the Oireachtas is even more vague and in fact there is no reference whatsoever to this House in it. Everybody here knows that we need to reform our procedures and our work practices. If we do not we will lose what small credibility we have at present as politicians and the House will have very little real purpose. Reform will only come from within this House; it will not come from Government. There is no point in waiting for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to do it because the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has failed to undertake this task over the past couple of years. I ask the Leader of the House today, as a sign of his good intentions in regard to reform of the Seanad, <Col N="5" /> to begin next week an open-ended debate on the reform of this House so that all the groups can put forward their views as to how we think the House should be reformed. He could let the debate run until Christmas and at that stage bring together the various ideas which have been suggested and let us in this House come forward with a specific programme to reform the House. It is long past time to do this and this may well be our last chance to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to put on the record, without making reference to recent happenings, that politics and public life in general have been fairly poorly served by recent events, and I will say no more than that. We have an essential decision to make now, that is, that we make ourselves as relevant as possible to Irish public life.</P>
      <P>In the ordering of business between now and the end of the session I ask the Leader of the House to ensure that all aspects of the major social areas of life are addressed in a regular pattern by this House. It is appalling, for instance, that today's business was set up without any meeting of the Whips. I am not saying tht in a critical way but I am saying it reflects a sloppy approach to business. I have no idea of the business that is likely to be addressed over the next couple of weeks. I can no longer justify to people outside Parliament why the House needs to be in recess for such a long period of time. I am not making cheap points here but everybody on both sides of the House knows this and we really need to be clear about where we are going. Politics have been taking a fair hammering over the summer and it is incumbent on us at least to establish for the Houses of the Oireachtas a sense of credibility and also a sense of relevance in regard to what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a debate tomorrow on Developments in the European Community, but I believe there is a deeper debate than that &mdash; the whole question of what is happening among Governments, between the member states on the question of the European Community and the <Col N="6" /> decisions to change the Treaty of Rome. All of these will impact on us in a very serious way. We need to be seen to address those points &mdash; international issues and the issues which need to be addressed in terms of Irish life. I do not know what legislation we intend taking over the next number of weeks, what motions we intend taking or what topics we intend to address. I know the Leader of the House can stand up and quite justifiably say that the only business to be dealt with on the Order of Business is today's business. Perhaps we should start with that and wipe that out as a nonsensical out-of-date fashion of ordering business. We should know where we are going from now until the end of the session.</P>
    <P>I know the reality is that the House is waiting to hear from the Government Chief Whip in the other House in regard to what we will be dealing with over the next number of weeks. We should start making demands. There is a clear need for legislation. There is a Programme for Government which was referred to by Senator Manning which we need to address. Let us get involved with these matters immedately. I do not see why over the next few weeks we cannot begin the process of initiating legislation in this House and also of ensuring that we address and debate those aspects of Irish life which are relevant to people everywhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by the two previous speakers for reform of our procedures here. I think they are long overdue. May I ask the Leader if he has any specific proposals arising from commitments he gave here some time ago to consider the situation after one of these Order of Business sessions which lasted for about an hour and a half? May I further ask what has become, if indeed anything has become, of the foreign affairs committee or has it simply faded away? May I ask the Leader further if he is prepared to give priority in particular to the animal remedies Bill arising from the results of the British survey which have been announced this morning? <Col N="7" /> Finally, may I ask him if he can give us some outline of the Bills which are to be initiated in this House in the coming session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House, in view of the report published yesterday in the UK by Mr. Robert May on the sinking of the <i>Antares</i> trawler by a British nuclear submarine, if it is possible that what happened there is a complete indictment of the British navy? We have suffered similar tragedies in Irish waters and there has been the strong suspicion that they were caused by submarine activity. I believe the truth of those tragedies is now clear for all of us to see. What is appalling is that these submarines, even if there was a possibility of saving lives, have tended to run and hide their activities.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House bring two matters to the attention of the Minister for the Marine? First, would he consider bringing forward legislation in the Dáil and Seanad to deal with these activities, because I am afraid that if they shift these British exercises out of UK waters they may shift them into Irish waters, thereby further endangering Irish trawler fleets, and we do not want to see that happen? Second, he should discuss this with his counterpart in the UK Parliament to make him aware that we are as concerned as they are for the lives of our own trawler crews. The Minister for the Marine should do this as a matter of urgency and the Irish Fishermen's Organisation are anxious to see some response in this regard. I ask the Leader of the House to take the action I suggest and report back to the House on his discussions with the Minister for the Marine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he will make time available as soon as possible to give the House an opportunity of discussing the growing disastrous famine in a number of African countries. There is precious little being done about it. While I accept that we should be giving aid to Eastern Europe and helping the nations that are <Col N="8" /> emerging there, we should also have an opportunity of debating the plight of the Croatian people. The Croatian problem is one that has been on the agenda for a long time. It would appear from media reports that the Commission and the European Community are talking about the problem while the unfortunate citizens of that fairly substantial country with a very old tradition are being annihilated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Manning in his request to the Leader for time to discuss the question of the North because I would again claim that this House is entitled to discuss problems such as the North. While other discussions are proceeding &mdash; the Anglo-Irish Parliamentary tier is meeting in Belfast tomorrow &mdash; and there are several other discussions, this House can make a positive contribution. I think I am entitled to make this request, because things are evolving all the time. Part of this country is closed off by gates which are shut at night. I do not think everybody on the island knows this. I honestly believe that if part of Cork or Kerry or other parts of the country were closed off at night and you had to wait at a gate until the British Army decided to let you out it would be regarded as a more serious matter. I am asking the Leader of the House to ensure that time is provided to air some of the grievances and problems we have about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take up a point made by Senator Manning and ask the Leader a question arising out of the text of the revised <i>Programme for Government.</i> I do not know if other Senators shared my astonishment that in the section dealing with proposed parliamentary reform there was no specific mention of Seanad Éireann. Are we to take it that the proposed measures apply to this House as well as to the Dáil? However, the question that really intrigues me is why in regard to a House that needs reform of its procedures, to say the least, as much as Dáil Éireann there was no mention whatever of this House. Is this a measure of the contempt <Col N="9" /> in which the Government partners hold this House? Is this silence a prelude to a more radical step? Is there a hidden agenda here? Perhaps the question I am putting to the Leader should be properly addressed to the three cuckoos in our nest over there&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to point out that I do not think the description is appropriate to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very precise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to join with the call for reform of the Seanad but I would not be as paranoid perhaps as Senator Murphy. I also believe that it is time we changed some of our practices and made the Seanad more relevant and more effective in it day-to-day work. If we have to do some of this work ourselves perhaps we could start by going down the list here. There are at least ten motions that are irrelevant and I think that some people who have them down should look at them. They refer to the Gulf War and other issues which are no longer as pressing as before. Perhaps they should have been taken at a more relevant time, but they are no longer really as important as they were and we could start by looking at the list here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am satisfied with the motion that has been chosen for the Adjournment, I am not quite as satisfied with the Order of Business today. There is only one piece of legislation, that is, the Sea Pollution Bill. That, of course, is very much a formality because it is simply implementing an international convention, which is normally implemented or is transferred to national law without too much debate because it is part of our international responsibilities. Therefore, we are not dealing with legislation and it is quite unacceptable that this House should be facing a new term without any real legislation before it. I cannot see why the Leader of the House could not have brought forward at least some new legislation from that planned for this term. For example, surely we could have had <Col N="10" /> the two Education Bills &mdash; the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill and the Regional Colleges Bill &mdash; in regard to which this House is particularly capable of initiating debate and teasing out the implications of any measures proposed. I would have thought that that would have been very useful. Even at this late stage, may I ask the Leader of the House if he will see about getting that proposed legislation to us at the initital stage.</P>
      <P>Secondly, we should have a debate on the revised Programme for Government. This is intended to be the basis of policy-making over the next two to two and a half years. The least we could do is to have a debate on that and provide the opportunity for this House to examine those policies, particularly in so far as they affect the future of this House in terms of Oireachtas reform. I suggest to the Leader of the House that he would also include that in the matters that will come before the House in this session.</P>
      <P>Finally, may I propose that we take as the first item on the agenda today Motion No. 42 which reads:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Justice to investigate the recent widspread allegations of breaches of the Companies Acts, 1963-1990, with a view to instituting criminal prosecution where wrongdoing has occurred; that this investigation shall focus on insider dealing and non-disclosure of directors' interests.</P>
      <P>We have established existing inquiries, and that is a good thing but where there are allegations of criminal offence it is our responsibility to ensure that prosecutions take place. That is specifically what section 194 of Companies Act states: that there must be prosecutions where there is a case to be answered in relation to an offence. That is a criminal prosecution and we have already had admissions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had admissions that there has been non-disclosure in <Col N="11" /> relation to Bord Telecom, in relation to Greencore&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Like some of the other Senators, I am disappointed that the Seanad was not mentioned in the Programme for Government. I am quite disturbed about it. I feel there is need for reform of the Seanad and, rather than waiting for other bodies to do it, I would call on the Leader to use his good offices to set up an all-party committee of the Seanad.  We could then hand our findings over to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in order to get them implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the recent survey which showed that over 50 per cent of our people are afraid of being attacked or burgled and in view of the fact that 60 per cent have no confidence in our courts system in trying to combat crime, would the Leader of the House give time to discuss the present outdated criminal legislation with a view to updating it, especially where we have a situation where judges have no choice but to impose a small fine or send people to grossly overcrowded jails? I ask the Leader of the House to give time for a debate both on the level of crime and the lack of confidence in our courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share the concern expressed by Senator McGowan in relation to the closure of cross-Border roads and I am glad he raised this issue in this House. I am not so sure I would agree with his call for a full three hour debate, although I am sure that Senator McGowan could look after 90 minutes of it and I could look after the other 90 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="12" /> I come from the county that perhaps has suffered most from the closure of Border roads, County Leitrim. Its natural hinterland with Fermanagh has been cut off without any access whatever by public roads. There is, as the Cathaoirleach and Members of the House will be aware, an active cross-Border support group which has been attempting to influence the political decisions and the military decisions on the northern side that has surrounded this appalling development that is cutting off the natural hinterland of two counties. Therefore, with the Cathaoirleach's permission, I ask the Leader of the House &mdash; and I am sure Senator Norris among many others would agree with the sentiments I am expressing &mdash; to convey the feeling of the House to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that this is an unfair discriminatory development and that it would be in the best interest of the people both of Fermanagh and Leitrim on all sides that the development be reversed so that at least the proposals that have been put forward by the cross-Border group and supported by most right-thinking people, North and South, would be implemented.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to put that on the record of this House. I invite my distinguished colleague and friend, Senator Norris, to visit the area on some occasion so that he can see at first hand the discrimination and the results of the discrimination on this issue alone.</P>
    <P>I would also like to welcome in the joint Programme for Government the commitment of the Coalition partners to investigate the feasibility of granting voting rights to emigrants. I suggest to the Leader of the House, in the light of this commitment of the Government, that perhaps this House would be a proper forum for discussion of the feasibility of granting voting rights and that there could be a measured and reflective debate on the various issues involved in granting voting rights to our emigrants. I must put on record that this is a move I personally support. Perhaps the Leader of the House might at some point discuss it with the Whips on the other side to see <Col N="13" /> if there could be time agreed for a debate between now and Christmas. I understand the joint programme indicates that a proposal will be brought to Government around Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who represents some of our exiled brethern I am very happy with Senator Mooney's enthusiasm for votes for emigrants. I hope we will make good progress.</P>
      <P>I fully agree with Senator Cullen in regard to what is happening in the Irish Sea. It is a great pity that his party colleague, the Minister for Energy, did not show a similar enthusiasm during the Radiological Protection Bill to deal with the problems of potential pollution from weapons-carrying systems that pass through our seas and our air space. The enthusiasm would be a lot more convincing.</P>
      <P>One of the phenomena on returning after an appalling and unjustifiably lengthy break is the long page of papers laid before the Seanad as set out in the Order Paper. May I ask the Leader of the House what No. 24 on page 229 referring to RECHAR is about? I would hate to have matters passed through the Oireachtas that we know nothing about: that would be making a further mockery of an already severely mocked institution. May I also ask the Leader to explain to me from the same list of papers laid before the Seanad why it is only this summer that the accounts for 1981 for three educational institutions &mdash; Thomond College of Education, Limerick; the National Institute of Higher Education, Limerick; and the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin &mdash; were finally laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas? Even by the standards of the less than perfect institutions we operate in this country, a ten year delay in publishing accounts is a bit much. Perhaps there is some reason there that escapes me. They only get as far as 1986 for the more recent accounts. Who has been minding the books since in these institutions, or what has happened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, since there has been a huge <Col N="14" /> spasm of open government and openness to the public engulfing us all over the past six or eight weeks, may I ask the Leader to indulge the House for what would take no less than two minutes by accepting an amendment to the Order of Business, which is that Item No. 8 be taken first? Item No. 8 refers to First Stage of a Register of Members of the Oireachtas Interests Bill. It is simply seeking permission to print the Bill.  At this stage we are not about to demand anything else other than the Bill be printed. Given the commitment of what Senator Mooney, for the first time in my presence, described as the Coalition partners to this principle, I do not think there should be any objection to us at least publishing the Bill as a contribution to the debate. Therefore, I formally move an amendment to the Order of Business, &ldquo;That Item No. 8 be taken before Item No. 1.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Several references have been made to the agreed Programme for Government and the need for Oireachtas reform. May I advise the Leader of the House that the programme says that the Government consider that reform of the Oireachtas is an essential prerequisite to carrying through a legislative programme of reform and to make its work relevant and effective to the people. Would he not agree that the word &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; includes the Seanad? Would he agree with that interpretation? We must welcome the interest shown on the Opposition benches in relation to Oireachtas reform and, for that reason, I support Senator Manning in his request for a debate in the House so that at least we could get some detailed proposals from the people opposite as to what they mean by Oireachtas reform.</P>

      <P>The court staff strike is of national importance and it is causing a great deal of stress. I would like to know if the Leader of the House can get us some information before the day is over as to whether the Department or the Minister for Labour are prepared to take any initiative in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="15" /> I formally second Senator Costello's proposal that Item No. 42 replace the present Order of Business.</P>

      <P>As a member of the reforming party in the Oireachtas I ask the Leader of the House to take on board the suggestions for a review of the operations of this House. Does the Leader propose to allow a debate on the operation of bank charges by commercial banks, particularly in view of the heavy burden being placed on borrowers, the harmful effect it has on job creation and the fact that the Minister for Finance on two occasions has raised this issue publicly? I raised this matter on previous occasions and it was suggested that I request it be discussed in an Adjournment debate. However, I was told that as there is a lack of ministerial responsibility it could not be taken on the Adjournment. In these circumstances, I suggest to the Leader that he might set aside some time for statements to be made on the issue to express on the record of the House the anger and frustration of many people.</P>

      <P>I support those Members who referred to Oireachtas reform and a debate on this subject would be appropriate at this time. I want to ask the Leader of the House the position <i>visà-vis</i> a debate on agriculture. We talked about this matter during the previous session and it is timely that we talk about it again. We are coming near the end of season for farmers and the position has become more difficult. I ask the Leader to arrange for an early debate on the entire area of agriculture and the agribusiness generally, encompassing all aspects of the Common Agricultural Policy, GATT and so on. Quite frankly, farmers are in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Finally, I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he could arrange for a debate on unemployment. We know it is not easy to solve the problem of 265,000 unemployed at present. However, I believe that a concerted effort should be made to alleviate the position. We should have an early and comprehensive debate on the whole area of unemployment.

      <P>I have worked as a businessman for many years and there is no doubt that the banking system is totally immoral and amoral. There is a small group of bankers who think they can tell everybody what they should do but they make diabolical decisions themselves, for example, the Bank of Ireland and AIB in their investments abroad. They are now suggesting that perhaps in two or <Col N="17" /> three years their investments in America might come back into profit. They are making profit in Ireland as they have always done and they have always gone outside this country to lose money. Their charges are immoral as is their attitude to small business people. If I have a computer that can produce forward figures they will give me enough money but if I go in as a small business person looking for a few pounds from them they will ask me to produce figures. Ninety per cent of the people in this country who are honest enough will not produce figures that will not stand up. The bigger you are the better you are according to the Irish banking system.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to have a debate on the banking system. I suggest that the banking system in Ireland is corrupt. It dictates that people who want money cannot get it but those who have money can produce every type of plan to enable them to get more money. The farmers have been mulcted by the banks. They were given money when they did not need it and now the banks want their <Col N="18" /> money back. We have heard criticism from the Labour Party and The Workers' Party of the tax amnesty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The tax amnesty was not a tax amnesty; it was an interest amnesty. The Department of Finance gave an interest amnesty to people and, as a result, people went out and borrowed to pay their taxes. Now that they have paid their money to the Department of Finance the banks are coming at them to get their money back. The banks are putting firms and farmers out of business because they paid their taxes. I am asking for a debate on banking.</P>

      <P>On 30 October in Madrid an international conference will take place which may produce a solution to the problems of the Middle East.

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second Senator Ryan's proposal that we take Item No. 8, First Stage of the Register of Members of the Oireachtas Interests Bill, 1991, as Item No. 1 this afternoon. I would also have been happy had it been possible <Col N="19" /> today to take Item No. 42 which deals with the question of criminal prosecution where wrong-doing has occurred. These are areas where I think recent financial difficulties are uppermost in the minds of Members of this House.</P>
      <P>If we do have a debate I hope it will be conducted in a substantially different tone to that in the Dáil where at the conclusion of the debate vitriolic and sometimes personal abuse clouded the issues. From speaking to people in Dublin it is obvious it left them feeling deeply disillusioned. In certain instances we must wait for the reports of judicial inquiries, tribunals and so on.</P>
      <P>I disagree profoundly with Senator Costello who said that our responsibility was to ensure that there is a prosecution in certain cases. Our responsibility is nothing of the kind. This is Parliament: it is not a court of law. We cannot ensure any form of prosecution. I was surprised to hear that because I have been lectured, inappropriately may I say, from certain sections about the separation of powers. This is a very clear example where the separation of powers comes into play.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Mooney and others in calling for a debate on Northern Ireland. I would be very happy to place my views with regard to the closure of roads on the record again &mdash; they have already been placed there &mdash; not in a wash of sentiment but with facts and figures which show clearly that although it is regrettable and an inconvenience that these roads are closed, the alternative is death, serious injury, bomb outrages and so on. I have the facts and figures and I will place them on the record. If it comes to a choice between inconvenience and murder, I am sorry but some people will have to be inconvenienced. I look forward to an opportunity of placing that in a more expansive form on the record when there is a debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we are back after a very lengthy delay and in view of the <Col N="21" /> suggestion that there is paucity of business, may I point to the fact that this simply reflects the lack of democracy in our society because the Government are basically saying that the only business that can be processed by this House is business initiated by them. In other words, they will not allow a Private Members' Bill to originate in this House. I draw the attention of the Leader of the House to the fact that there is, for example, the Interpretation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1989. It is simple legislation which proposes to remove sexist language from our legislation and the substance of it has already been commended by the Taoiseach in the Lower House. I see no reason, apart from the usual dog-in-the-manger attitude of the Government, why we cannot take a Private Members' Bill. It is 30 years since a Private Members' Bill was put through this House. The whole thing is a farce. In an ironic way it is reassuring that we should be back in this wash of hypocrisy. I support reform of the Oireachtas. There is no need for a debate. We have already had the debate.</P>

I would like the Leader of the House to confirm what the Taoiseach said at a Cáirde Fáil dinner a year ago, what the Minister for Justice said in this House 18 months ago and what the newly minted accord between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil allege, that they are going to reform the law in the light of the astonishing assertion of Deputy Tunney, Chairman of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party, that he is going to oppose this.

      <P>That is not appropriate. There is another mechanism for dealing with these matters. I am quite sure that most Senators in this House are aware of the mechanism. It is not a question of people in the public gallery being involved in a verbal display or any other form of display either.</P>

      <P>I must praise the Cathaoirleach for his great indulgence in trying to deal with heated matters. I support my colleague, Senator Harte, in relation to the courts dispute because that will bring the whole system of justice to a halt. Will the Leader get the up-to-date position from the Minister for Justice and, if necessary, ask the Department of Labour or the Minister for Labour to intervene? If this strike in the courts is allowed to continue it will create chaos and the public will suffer.</P>
      <P>What is the up-to-date position with regard to the all-out strike in the Probate Office in Cork which is causing anguish to bereaved families and those looking for either grants of probate or administration? The office has been closed down for some months. That is not good enough. I would like to have the situation clarified and the Leader to report back to the House on both matters.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael Party would like to support the request of Senator Brendan Ryan that the Leader consider Item No. 8 on today's Order Paper as part of the Order of Business. We agree in principle with what it is trying to achieve and particularly support the concept of allowing Private Members' Bills greater priority in this House. If the Leader could indicate that he would either allow it today or even tomorrow we would be satisfied, but we would like <Col N="26" /> an indication from him that in the next day or two it can be moved so that the Bill can be published. What happens to it after that will be up to the Leader of the House and the Whips. I very much support the point made and the principle involved of encouraging Private Members' Bills and allowing them to be published and, therefore, circulated.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to inform Senator Dardis who is concerned about the views of the Opposition in relation to Oireachtas reform that the Fine Gael Party have a 40 page document published on it. If he would like it I can circulate him with a copy least he be in any doubt as to our views on Oireachtas reform.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael support the request of Senator David Norris for clarification of the point made in Item No. 5 on the Supplementary Order Paper. The Chairman of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Tunney, has thrown considerable confusion on an area in which I thought we had an agreed procedure. If the Leader could throw some light on the Government's position now in relation to this topic we would appreciate it very much.</P>
      <P>The Cathaoirleach mentioned earlier this afternoon that the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1990 has returned to this House, the Seanad amendment having been passed by the Dáil. It was with a sense of alarm I heard those words because I hoped that sense would prevail in the other House. There are major consequential questions about sections 9, 12 and 13 in this Bill, as we pointed out in June when it was being debated in this House. I have no doubt that President Mary Robinson will refer it to the Supreme Court. It will be her first action to test its constitutionality and it is a shame when the Seanad pointed out the constitutional questions in relation to this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to join with my colleague, Senator Cullen, in raising the issue of the report on the loss of our lives and the loss of the <i>Antares</i> which clearly confirms that the Royal Navy, and more specifically a submarine, were responsible. Fifty lives have been lost in the Irish Sea in such incidents over the past ten years. These are well documented. I am delighted at this stage to have the support of Senator Cullen and a rather watery support from Senator Ryan.</P>

I join with my colleague in asking Senator Fallon to proceed immediately to invite the Minister for the Marine to take the report on board which is a total whitewash.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out, before I call on the Leader of the House to reply, that Bills coming before the House are normally in the English language by tradition and are only translated into the Irish language after having passed into law.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>There were many questions raised. One which was asked by many Senators referred to a programme for the session before us. The Bills that will come before us during this session include the Patents Bill, 1991, the Milk (Regulation of Supply) Bill, 1991, the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill, 1991, the Roads Bill, 1991, the Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Bill, 1989, an Electoral Bill, 1991, two Education Bills, the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill, 1991 and the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, 1991, and also the Liability for Defective Products Bill, 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="29" /> Bills which are expected to be published this session include the amendment of the Animal Remedies Act, 1956 &mdash; referred to by Senator Upton &mdash; which increases the penalties for the abuse of animal medicines. I know that Senator Upton will welcome that Bill as he has spoken on the matter on a number of occasions. I understand also that a Bill dealing with the control of dogs will be published soon, together with a Solicitors' Amendment Bill and an Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Bill. Others include the Criminal Law (Evidence) Bill, the Criminal Law Bill itself, a Housing Bill and a Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill which will deal with the speeding up of planning appeal procedures.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning asked for a debate on Northern Ireland as did other Senators and Senator McGowan in particular. I took a note when the question of Northern Ireland was mentioned of the clash between Senator Norris and Senator Mooney; this subject tends to bring out the best or the worst in us, whichever way you like to look at it and highlighted my concern about a debate on Northern Ireland in the House. I still live in hope that talks will recommence and I do not agree that a general election in Britain will or, indeed, should be a reason for talks not to continue. That is the position I stand by.</P>
    <P>The programme for reform of the Seanad has been raised by a number of Senators. Senator Manning, who requested a debate on the matter, knows my views on it and I feel that I speak for all Members and certainly for those who are members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges when I welcome the suggestion. It has already come very strongly from my own party members behind me both individually and from a little group that meets from time to time. It will be recalled that a debate on a motion on Seanad reform was held during the last Seanad. I think it was proposed by Senator Ross and it certainly aroused much interest. I think we are all united in our desire to see Seanad <Col N="30" /> Éireann working to its maximum potential and I feel that an open and constructive debate on Seanad reform would be most beneficial. It would enable Members to put forward their views and proposals that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges could then consider them in detail and decide on their suitability and feasibility. My reply to Senator Manning is that I will arrange for this debate as soon as possible knowing it has the full support of my colleagues.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole also referred to reform of the Seanad as did Senator Upton, who asked about a Foreign Affairs committee. The Programme for Government indicated that the Government will be establishing a European Affairs committee along the lines proposed in Report No. 7 of the Sixth Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities. I am also able to tell Senator Upton that the Foreign Affairs committee will be set up and I hope it will contain Seanad representation.</P>
    <P>Senator Cullen and Senator Byrne referred to what I might call &ldquo;submarine activities&rdquo; which I was asked to bring to the attention of the Minister for the Marine and I will do. My reply to Senator McDonald is that I do so not propose at present to have a debate on either famine in Africa or a debate on Croatia, important as they are. I have commented on Senator Murphy's and Senator McGowan's references. Senator Eoin Ryan also referred to a Seanad reform debate. Senator Costello asked about an education Bill. They are Dáil Bills at present but I and the Chief Whip will continue as before to try to have as many Bills as possible initiated in this House.</P>
    <P>Item No. 42 was proposed by Senator Costello. I do not propose to take that item today. Senator Kiely referred to Seanad reform. I will investigate and see what I can do regarding a debate which would deal with the level of crime which Senator Neville mentioned. I cannot comment very much as Senator Brendan Ryan requested on papers that are laid before the Seanad but as they are before <Col N="31" /> us they should be investigated and examined by all Senators. Senator Brendan Ryan asked that Item No. 8 which is an amendment to the Order of Business be taken. The register of interests is clearly contained in the Programme for Government; I will read out the relevant part:</P>
    <P>A register of all members' material interests will be established from September 1992 and available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>May I remind Senator Brendan Ryan that many Members of this House are members of local authorities on all sides of the political divide and registers of their material interests are available in county council offices. All members of local authorities must register their interests and I am certain we have nothing to hide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is there already in the Programme for Government as Senator Dardis rightly reminded us. I will repeat what he read:</P>
      <P>The Government considers the reform of the Oireachtas is an essential prerequisite in carrying through a legislative programme of reform and to make its work relevant and effective for the people of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Senator Harte raised the question of the courts' strike which I will take up with the Minister for Labour. He seconded an amendment to the Order of Business that we take Item No. 42. Senator O'Keeffe and Senator Lanigan asked about bank charges and bank matters generally. I hope that some time in the future we will have a debate on the economy and if that happens we may then encompass many aspects of the banking system that they referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hourigan asked for a debate on agriculture and referred to the Common Agricultural Policy. Tomorrow we will have a full day's debate on developments in the EC and he will have a glorious opportunity then to say what <Col N="32" /> he feels about the Common Agricultural Policy and other developments in the EC.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris seconded Item No. 8 which I do not propose to accept. He also asked about Item No. 5 and on that matter I understand that legislation to comply with the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in this case is being prepared and will be announced in the normal way as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I have noted what Senator O'Donovan indicated about the courts' strike and about the Probate Office in Cork. I noted what Senator Doyle said regarding the Fisheries Amendment Bill and I think the Cathaoirleach has answered the query put to me by Senator Ó Foighil.</P>

It is for the Leader of the House to make his reply in whatever form he thinks fit and if unwittingly he excludes somebody from his reply I have to take it that that is what he intended to do.

    <Title>Sea Pollution Bill, 1990: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to be associated with this Bill. The environment action programme includes a commitment to terminate indiscriminate disposal of ships' waste in the marine environment; this Bill endorses that commitment by addressing the problems relating to protection of the marine environment from pollution by ships.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Sea Pollution Bill, 1990 is to update existing legislation on the prevention of pollution from ships and on intervention with ships following upon a maritime casualty, as enshrined in our Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts, 1956 to 1977. These Acts govern pollution by oil but we all know that as the world becomes more industrialised more dangerous substances being transported by sea are polluting the marine environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our legislation must also take cognisance of current trends in the shipping industry, namely, the dramatic increase in the size of ships, in particular of oil tankers; the &ldquo;lame ducks&rdquo; in an ageing world fleet; the emergence of offshore <Col N="35" /> registries and Third World low-cost crews; the reduction in manning levels due to modern technology and performance pressures from shipowners or managers. Ireland's geographical location on the periphery of Europe with the Atlantic Ocean lying to the west, south-west and south and at the apex of one of the busiest ocean-trading routes in the world leaves the country vulnerable to maritime casualties. We must also remember that it is our relatively unpolluted waters that attract foreign tourists to this country. We must endeavour to avoid casualties occurring in our territorial waters, the resulting pollution of our waters and blight of our shore environment with wrecks. Of course, I must mention that the Atlantic is also to the north of Ireland and my province.</P>
    <P>In order to prevent or control pollution that may be caused by ships the State's powers need to be strengthened. The international treaty commonly known as MARPOL 73/78, considered to be the most ambitious international treaty covering marine pollution ever adopted, and the international treaties on intervention on the high seas, give the scope to do so. We are indebted to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) for the adoption of the treaties in question. The IMO are a specialised agency of the United Nations, wholly dedicated to maritime affairs and with the twin goals of cleaner oceans and safer seas.</P>
    <P>The question Senators may wish to ask is: &ldquo;Why the need to become party to further international treaties?&rdquo;. The answers are simple. The conventions, protocols and resolutions of the IMO reflect the concerns and interests of over 130 states; the IMO are the international body who have developed the &ldquo;rules of the road&rdquo; as it were, for the high seas and command the respect and recognition to press for universal acceptance of these rules. Ireland needs the support of such an organisation in its endeavours to protect its marine environment from pollution from ships and the disposal of ships' wastes at sea.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="36" /> The main objective of MARPOL 73/78 is to reduce to a minimum, and in certain instances prohibit, the operational discharge of marine pollutants from ships through the establishment of operational discharge criteria and procedures, and construction and equipment standards. Provision is made for a regime whereby violations of the international rules and standards are prohibited and punished with sufficient severity to discourage future violations. The convention has 67 contracting states, representing 88 per cent of the gross tonnage of the world's merchant shipping fleet.</P>
    <P>The convention itself comprises five annexes which are, effectively, the regulations laid down for the prevention of pollution by oil; by noxious liquid substances in bulk; by harmful substances carried by sea in packaged forms or in freight containers, portable tanks or road and rail tank wagons; by sewage and garbage from ships.</P>
    <P>Each annex deals exclusively with all aspects of its subject pollutant such as vessel construction and equipment, survey, certification, discharge control and, importantly, reception facilities to be provided at ports for the disposal of waste.</P>
    <P>All countries which become party to MARPOL 73/78 must adopt annexes 1 and 2 relating to oil and noxious liquid substances in bulk, respectively; annexes 3, 4 and 5 relating to harmful substances in packaged forms, sewage and garbage respectively are optional. Acceptance of annexes 1 and 2 is obligatory because of the more deleterious effects of oil and noxious liquid substances. Liability and compensation for pollution damage caused by discharges of persistent oil from a ship carrying oil in bulk as cargo, or discharges from its bunkers, are covered by the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Act, 1988.</P>
    <P>The intervention treaties provide that, following a maritime casualty, contracting parties may take such measures on the high seas as may be necessary to prevent, mitigate or eliminate grave and imminent danger to their coastline or related interests from pollution, or threat <Col N="37" /> of pollution, by oil and other substances which are liable to create hazards to human health, to harm living resources and maritime life, to damage amenities, or to interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea.</P>
    <P>MARPOL 73/78, its annexes, 1, oil, 2, noxious liquid substances, 3 harmful substances in packaged forms, and 5, garbage from ships and the Intervention Convention and Protocol are in force internationally. Annex 4 of MARPOL &mdash; sewage from ships &mdash; which is optional will not come into force internationally until it has been ratified or acceded to by countries representing over 50 per cent of the gross tonnage of the world's merchant shipping fleet. Current ratification or accession to this instrument stands at approximately 40 per cent of world shipping tonnage, as of now. I intend to adopt all five annexes, including that one, so we will be adding to that 40 per cent, giving priority to annexes 1 and 2 the compulsory annexes, and annex 5, garbage from ships.</P>
    <P>The following are the principal provisions of the Bill. Section 10 enables the Minister to prohibit or regulate the operational discharge of oil, oily mixtures, noxious liquid substances carried in bulk &mdash; for example hazardous chemicals &mdash; harmful substances carried in packaged forms, sewage or garbage from Irish-registered ships anywhere at sea and from other ships whilst in the territorial waters of the State. The Minister may apply similar controls to other substances prescribed by him as being harmful if introduced into the marine environment and he may require the owner or master of a ship to notify him of the intention to load or unload any of these substances in the State.</P>
    <P>Section 12 enables the Minister to require harbours in the State to have adequate facilities for the discharge or disposal of ships' waste. Harbours may make reasonable charges and impose reasonable conditions for use of the facilities provided. Section 14 and 15 enable the Minister to require an Irish registered ship to be constructed, fitted or operated in such a way as to prevent, control or reduce <Col N="38" /> discharges into the sea and to keep such records of discharges of harmful substances as he prescribes. Such records would relate to operations on board ship in respect of any substance, discharges made to secure the safety of the ship or to save life or discharges in excess of the quantity, if any, permitted.</P>
    <P>Section 17 enables the Minister to have surveyors of ships, or inspectors appointed by him under warrant, to carry out surveys, inspections and tests to ensure compliance with MARPOL standards laid down by him for ships, their equipment and fittings. He may also cause to be issued in respect of a ship a certificate of compliance with requirements.</P>
    <P>Section 23 permits a harbour master to refuse entry into a harbour if he believes a ship not to be in compliance with certificate requirements or to be a serious threat to the environment, the harbour or other ships. This section also enables the Minister to require the owners or masters of all ships, or any classes of ships, to give notice of entry or intended entry into Irish territorial waters.</P>
    <P>Section 26 permits the Minister, following upon a maritime casualty, to take such measures as he considers necessary, to prevent, mitigate or eliminate grave and imminent danger to the coastline or related interests, for example, fisheries activities or tourist attractions, from pollution or a threat of pollution. The Minister is entitled to recover expenses incurred in such intervention from the owner of the ship.</P>
    <P>Section 29 lays down the penalties for breach of the requirements of the Bill, when enacted, or any regulations made thereunder. Penalties range from a maximum of £1,000 or imprisonment for up to 12 months, or both, on summary conviction and a maximum of £10 million or imprisonment up to five years, or both, on conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>Parts I and IV deal with the more standard provisions of the Bill. Parts II and III of the Bill which deal with prevention of pollution and enforcement are fundamentally the framework within which <Col N="39" /> regulations to give effect to the five MARPOL annexes will be effected.</P>
    <P>There has been an enormous increase in environmental awareness and concern for the environment over the past few years, particularly amongst the younger generation. In the marine area attention is being focused on the threat to the environment and to fish stocks and mammals of pollution from ships in the form of oil discharges and persistent forms of garbage, in particular plastics, including synthetic ropes and fishing nets and refuse bags. These pollutants are offensive from an aesthetic point of view as they come ashore with the tide and spoil beaches and beauty spots on the coastline. They are also offensive from an economic point of view in that they affect local fishing and aquaculture industries as well as tourism, water-based leisure activities and public amenities generally.</P>
    <P>Marine environmental awareness was heightened last year with the launch of the Government's environment action programme and the commitment to require harbour authorities to instal facilities for receiving ships' waste and thus enable Ireland to become a party to the MARPOL Convention. Facilities must be adequate to meet the needs of the ships using them without causing undue delay.</P>
    <P>The issue of a poster by the Department of the Marine in conjunction with the Wildlife Service at the end of 1989 to schools as well as to shipping and fisheries interests and which illustrated the cruel, harmful and oftentimes fatal effects of plastic on fish and marine mammals further highlighted the hazards of ships' waste. I have a copy of that poster and judging by the correspondence we received it was very successful. The poster depicts a dead bird, general marine debris and shows the damage done to marine life by plastic which resembles natural food. That is an indication of the harm that can be done by throwing out debris, particularly plastic debris which is non-biodegradable. It is not surprising, therefore, that MARPOL has come to be associated with garbage <Col N="40" /> from ships and that the younger generation speak quite knowledgeably on annex 5 which relates to the provention of pollution from garbage.</P>
    <P>MARPOL strictly prohibits the disposal of plastics at sea; they must be deposited in receptacles at port. Plastics are non-biodegradable; once thrown into the sea they are extremely persistent and potentially harmful if ingested by seabirds and marine mammals. In framing regulations under the Sea Pollution Bill, 1990 to cover annex 5 the disposal of plastics at sea will be prohibited. Stringent conditions will apply to the discharge and ultimate disposal of other wastes from ships, in particular food waste. The ultimate disposal of discharged waste must be undertaken with regard to wider concerns. In disposing of oily residues every effort will be made to ensure recycling and the disposal of food waste or swill must take place within the requirements of the animal diseases regulations of the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>I am glad to mention to the House that in the new and almost revolutionary ship design in the <i>Bell Pioneer</i> the use of that heavy waste fuel is incorporated into the design of the ship, consequently lowering the cost of fuel on a ship which is famous for not having hatches and for having the quickest turn around of any ship in any fleet in the world today designed by our own naval architects and built in Japan. In disposing of oil refuse every effort is made to ensure recycling and the disposal of food waste or swill and that must be done in accordance with the requirements of the animal diseases regulations of the Department of Agriculture and Food. In compliance with the Environment Action Programme and in anticipation of the passage of the new legislation commercial and fishery harbours have been asked to provide reception facilities to meet the demands of ship and fishing vessel operators coming into port. Consultations with Irish shipping interests are also ongoing with a view to ascertaining their requirements.</P>
    <P>There are other very important benefits accruing from passage of the Sea <Col N="41" /> Pollution Bill, 1990. At the top of the list must be the State's enhanced powers to deal with offending foreign ships coming into its territorial waters. Masters of ships which are not constructed, equipped or operated to MARPOL standards will not be anxious to risk inspection, detention and penalty for unseaworthiness or deficiencies. This could have the effect of reducing the number of damaged vessels seeking refuge in ports off our south-west and north-west coasts.</P>
    <P>I should at this stage make it clear that the Bill before the House does not cut across my Department's policy in search and rescue. Safety of life at sea still remains paramount and it may be necessary at times to admit troubled ships into territorial waters or harbours for the purpose of saving life. Section 11 of the Bill permits discharge into the sea of harmful substances where it is necessary for the purpose of saving life at sea. However, a record must be kept of such a discharge.</P>
    <P>Equally important will be the benefit to Irish shipowners. By virtue of holding MARPOL certificates they will no longer be embarrassed by subjection to stringent inspection and delay while in MARPOL Convention countries; any such inspection will now be limited to verifying that there is on board a valid MARPOL certificate. Ireland is the only EC maritime member state and the only State party to the Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control, the Paris Convention, not to have ratified or acceded to MARPOL 73/78. Under this Memorandum of Understanding each of the 14 member states undertakes to achieve an annual total of inspections of foreign-registered ships entering its ports corresponding to 25 per cent of individual merchant ships. Inspection ensures compliance with the standards laid down in a number of international conventions including the MARPOL Convention.</P>
    <P>Ireland will also be assured of the cooperation of other parties to the MARPOL Convention and the International Maritime Organisation in the detection of violations, the enforcement of rules, environmental monitoring and <Col N="42" /> accumulation of evidence against offenders.</P>
    <P>The Oil Pollution of the Sea (Amendment) Act, 1977 empowers the Minister to take such action as he considers necessary in relation to a ship or its cargo for the purpose of preventing, mitigating or eliminating the effects of oil pollution arising from a maritime casualty. The Minister may only exercise these powers in respect of an Irish-registered ship anywhere at sea; any other ship while in the territorial waters of the State or, following a Government order, any ship registered in a country which is party to the Intervention Convention, 1969, while outside the territorial waters of the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister must exercise his powers of intervention with discretion. There must be grave and imminent danger of major harmful consequences through pollution by oil of the coastline or related interests. Where a stricken ship is not carrying oil as cargo there must be sufficient threat of danger from bunker or fuel oil to justify intervention. Where it can be established in the case of an Irish registered ship or any other ship while in the territorial waters of the State that intervention was unreasonable then compensation must be paid.</P>
    <P>The Minister used his powers of intervention early in 1989 when the 85,000 tonne bulk carrier <i>Yarrawonga</i> having lost 300 square metres of steel side plating in mid-Atlantic was abandoned by its crew. Similarly, he intervened in February 1990 with the holed 122,000 tonne bulk carrier <i>Tribulus</i> which limped into Bantry Bay leaking heavy fuel oil and in April 1991 during the <i>Capitaine Pleven II</i> incident at Ballyvaughan. I must say that the marine team from my Department acquitted themselves with distinction in all those cases to the benefit of our environment and our fisheries and tourism industries. This week I got a letter from Captain Histon, the harbour master at Foynes, indicating his complete satisfaction with the activities of that team in the case of the <i>Atlantis Sky</i> off Foynes on 6 October, 1991. He said he would, and I quote:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> particularly like to thank your Captain Kirwan, Director of the Marine Rescue Service and your Mr. Seamus McLoughlin, Department of the Marine for the excellent work carried out by them in this emergency. I should also point out that the use of the helicopter in the incident was of great assistance. It is gratifying to know that in this country there is now a means through your Department to deal with marine emergencies such as arose in the Shannon Estuary on this occasion. It has already been noted by the owners of the <i>Atlantis Sky</i> and has been remarked by same as a credit to the marine tradition of our country.</P>
    <P>When we have something good to say about ourselves I think we should say it. The Bill strengthens the Minister's powers considerably. The threat of pollution may be from any harmful substance, intervention may be made anywhere at sea and only in the case of Irish-registered and Intervention Convention country-registered ships while outside the territorial waters of the State may be a case of unreasonable intervention be entertained.</P>
    <P>The Bill takes account of lessons learned from past disasters, namely, the need for legislation requiring the owner of a ship to compensate the Minister for expenses of, or incidental to, any action taken by him to prevent, mitigate or eliminate danger from pollution or a threat of pollution from that ship and the need to have penalties for offences commensurate with damage done. It is intended that clean-up costs would be recoverable by the Minister. At first glance, £10 million maximum penalty for conviction on indictment may seem unrealistic or excessive but when one considers the extent of damage that may be caused by marine pollution it is justifiable. I need hardly remind the House of the $1 billion-plus bill which followed the <i>Exxon Valdez II</i> million gallon crude oil spill in Alaska last year, about which the whole world knows. The remainder <Col N="44" /> of the Bill is concerned with the strengthening of the powers of the inspectors &mdash; section 21 &mdash; and harbour masters &mdash; section 25 &mdash; in the detection of unauthorised or alleged discharge, defective ships or equipment and standard provisions which are self-explanatory. Section 5 provides that every regulation made under the proposed legislation shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. There will be an opportunity, therefore, for all Senators to consider the precise terms of the regulations to give effect to the five annexes to the MARPOL Convention.</P>
    <P>It has long been held that Ireland should have a compulsory vessel reporting or notification system for all ships entering Irish waters. Such a system is currently in force in respect of fishing trawlers registered in Spain and Portugal, for a transitional period, and in non-EC countries when entering Community waters under Irish control.</P>
    <P>The system would be beneficial in protecting the marine environment and also in detecting undesirable ships or cargoes of on security grounds. Section 23 enables the Minister to set up such a system should he consider it necessary and enforceable. Alternatively, a system whereby certain classes of ship which are a potential threat to the marine environment, for example, oil tankers might be required to give advance notification of entry into Irish territorial waters could be considered.</P>
    <P>This Bill is one that will play a vital role in protecting the State's clean marine heritage.</P>
    <P>Molaim an Bille seo don Teach. Mar a dúirt mé cheana, tá cúrsaí comhshaoil agus truaillithe an-tábhachtach agus ag éirí níos tábhachtaí in aghaidh na bliana. Tá oidhreacht chomhshaoil againn, agus is cóir dúinn an oidhreacht sin a chosaint. Is fiúntach an oidhreacht í agus is fiú í a chosaint. Beidh na glúnta atá le teacht buíoch dínn. Is chuige sin atá mé sa Bhille seo agus molaim é don Teach.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh Aire na Mara sa díospóireacht seo agus é ag cur an Bhille seo um thruailliú na farraige <Col N="45" /> os ár gcomhair. Mar atá ráite aige féin is Bille fíor-thábhachtach é, a bhaineann lenár n-oidhreacht agus a chuireann ar ár gcumas mar Eireannaigh feabhas a chur ar an tír agus í a dhéanamh níos sláintiúla maidir le truailliú a sheachaint. Tá anmholadh ag dul don Aire gur éirigh leis an Bille tábhachtach seo a thabhairt os comhair an Tí. D'fhéadfainn freisin a rá faoin Bhille, más maith is mithid. Mar atá léirithe ag an Aire ina chuid cainte, tháinig an Bille seo chun tosaigh de bharr tuarascáil MARPOL agus tá sé sin, de réir mar a thuigim, le fáil againn suas le 12 nó 13 bliana.</P>
      <P>Is dócha go bhféadfaí a fhiafraí céard a bhí ar bun againn féin idir an dá linn mar náisiún nár éirigh linn reachtaíocht a thabhairt isteach go dtí an lá atá inniu ann. É sin ráite tá sí againn agus tá sé fíor-thábhachtach go gcuirfí fáilte ar leith roimpi. Baineann an reachtaíocht leis an tír uilig, níl mé ag séanadh sin, ach baineann sí go speisialta le chósta iarthar na hÉireann uilig atá oscailte amach chomh mór sin don Atlantach agus go bhfuil an oiread sin cumarsáide farraige ar bun idir na Stáit Aontaithe agus an Eoraip agus, go deimhin, an Afraic agus áiteanna nach iad. Tá cósta iarthar agus deisceart na hÉireann, ó Dhún na nGall go Port Láirge, díreach ar an líne go bhfuil an mhórghluaiseacht bhád seo go bhfuil tagairt speisialta faoi sa Bhille seo. Bímis ar an bhfarraige mhór ag iascaireacht nó cois cladaigh ag baint taitnimh as an bhfarraige, bímis ar bhád bheag rámhaíochta nó ag obair ar an soitheach is mó atá ag iompar ola, is cuma faoi sin, tá sé uilig tábhachtach i gcomhthéacs an Bhille seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá an úsáid atá á baint as na farraigí móra atá thart timpeall orainn i bhfad níos mó agus níos tréine ó thaobh iompar earraí ar fud an domhain. Bhíomar féin páirteach in iomportáil ola le blianta, agus tá fós. Mar atá ráite arís ag an Aire, tá cuid de na longa seo ag éirí níos mó agus níos fairsinge in aghaidh na bliana, agus, mar gheall air sin, tá an chontúirt ag dul i méad dá réir. Tá sé cruthaithe gur sean bháid go leor de na soithigh atá ag iompar ola agus earraí eile go domhanda. Tá cuid mhaith acu a bhfuil <Col N="46" /> athnuachan ag teastáil uatha agus tá gá le báid mhóra nua. Ach, de dheasca ghéarchúlú idirnáisiúnta eacnamaíochta níl na báid mhóra nua á gcur ar fáil sciobtha go leor agus tá an chontúirt ann truailliú farraige bheith ann i gcás timpiste nó rud ar bith ar an dul sin. Bíonn an baol sin ann i gcónaí.</P>
    <P>Tá sé fíor-thábhachtach go mbeadh rialacha, ní amháin ag an tír seo ach ag tíortha eile agus go mbeimis faoi réir rialacha a nglacfaí leo go domhanda. Thar aon rud eile, tá mé ag ceapadh gurb 'in an tábhacht is mó dá mbaineann leis an mBille seo, is é sin, go bhfuil 130 tír, is dóigh liom, luaite sa Bhille agus breis agus 80 a bhfuil dlúthbhaint acu leis an troid in aghaidh thruailliú farraige. Tá an tír seo ag dul a thógáil páirte san iarracht idirnáisiúnta seo. Tá sé an-ámhárach go bhfuil a leithéid de Bhille ag dul tríd an Seanad agus an Dáil faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Le blianta beaga anuas tá an-bhéim go deo ar thruailliú agus chaomhnú na timpeallachta. Nach aisteach an rud é ach thiar i gConamara, ina bhfuil cónaí orm féin, i mbaile beag darb ainm Leitir Freac, i bhfad ó Bhaile Átha Cliath, tá Seachtain na Farraige faoi lánseol &mdash; an tseachtain seo féin. Tá chuile shórt faoin bhfarraige á phlé ag aos óg an cheantair, idir bhuachaillí agus chailíni bunscoile, meánscoile agus pobalscoile. Tá siad gníomhach ag foghlaim chúrsaí farraige ach tá sé uilig i gcomhthéacs chaomhnú na farraige, cur in éadan thruailliú na farraige, mar tá suim ar leith acu sa cheantar seo agus sna himeachtaí go léir.</P>
    <P>Le blianta beaga anuas tháinig an tionscal feilméireachta éisc ar aghaidh go mór i gceantar Chonamara, agus is é an ceantar is láidre fheilméireacht éisc é. Ar nós gach tionscail mhóir, b'fhéidir, rinneadh dearmaid agus ní raibh lucht thionscal fheilméireacht éisc chomh cúramach agus ba chóir dóibh a bheith i dtús ama ó thaobh chaomhnú na timpeallachta ina raibh siad ag obair agus, dá dheasca sin, tar éis roinnt bheag blianta tháinig amhras mór ar dhaoine faoi chúrsaí farraige, faoi fheilméireacht éisc, faoin truailliú agus faoi rudaí eile mar sin. Tharla sé sin cois cladaigh, mar a deirtear. Ar an taobh eile den scéal bhí daoine <Col N="47" /> ag caint faoin truailliú ar an bhfarraige mór agus cúiseanna mar éalú ola, timpistí, stoirmeacha, agus neamh-aireacht agus daoine i mbun a gcuid oibre.</P>
    <P>Bhí an dá rud ar siúl, agus daoine ag obair i ngan fhios dá chéile maidir le cúrsaí farraige. Bhí daoine ar an mórthír a raibh suim acu i gcúrsaí na farraige agus, chomh maith leis sin bhí daoine eile ag plé chúrsaí farraige ar bhonn idirnáisiúnta agus chinn siad ar an teacht le chéile seo as ar eascair roinnt mhaith de na hAchtanna le tamall de bhlianta anuas. Thug siad le chéile an dá aicme seo a bhí ag obair as láimh a chéile ar bhealaí éagsúla. Tá sé sin an-tábhachtach, go háirithe i gcomhthéacs an Bhille seo. Níor chóir dúinn, nuair atáimid ag caint faoin mBille seo, faoi thruailliú na farraige móire, dearmad a dhéanamh go bhféadfadh an truailliú bheith cois cladaigh chomh maith céanna. D'fhéadfadh an dá aicme cúnamh a thabhairt dá chéile le fáil réidh leis an rud is nó dá bhfuil ag cur isteach orainn, is é sin an truailliú seo.</P>
    <P>Arís, thiar i gConamara, agus níl mé ag déanamh aon ghaisce as, bíonn seachtain eile ann agus caitheann muintir cois cladaigh ó Chloch na Rón amach ón gClochán suas, anuas trí Charna agus na háiteanna sin, caitheann siad laethanta ag dul thart ar na cladaigh ag bailiú bruscair agus truflaise. Labhair an tAire féin go han mhaith faoi seo in a óráid ar an mBille seo. Luaigh sé ábhar plaisteach agus thug sé le tuiscint an dochar mór atá á dhéanamh nó a d'fhéadfaí a dhéanamh leis sin.</P>
    <P>Ní ar an fharraige mhór amháin atá sé sin ag tarlú, de dheasca an chineál seo ruda bheith in úsáid ar longa móra; tá sé ag tarlú freisin ar an gcladach. Tá sé ag tarlú cois trá agus caithfimid, le chéile, iarracht an-mhór a dhéanamh chun fáil réidh leis an truailliú seo. Deirtear go mairfidh an t-ábhar plaisteach seo na céadta bliain. Rud suntasach eile faoi, ní féidir é a chur faoi uisce. Bíonn sé ar snámh ar bharr na farraige agus tagann sé isteach ar na cladaigh agus, ar na tránna, ní amháin timpeall na hÉireann ach timpeall an domhain uilig. Mar sin, na cúig céimeanna atá tógtha sa Bhille, <Col N="48" /> tá siad fíor-thábhachtach; tá an Bille ag tabhairt aitheantais do na cúig rudaí is mó atá ag déanamh dochair.</P>
    <P>Uimhir a haon, tá caint ann faoi chúrsaí ola, ola den uile chineál, agus tá cosaint á lorg agus tá rialacha dochta daingne á leagan síos maidir le cosaint, chun nach dtabharfaí aon truailliú isteach ar thránna ná an fhairraigí timpeall na hÉireann. Is mór an chontúirt é an ola, rud is léir dúinn, agus thrácht an tAire ar an gceist seo. Is amhlaidh an scéal in Alaska, i Meiriceá, san Astráil, agus fiú amháin i gcuan Bheanntraí, agus áiteanna eile nach iad. Léigh sé litir faoin mbaol a bhí ann thíos i gcuan na Sionna. Tugann sé sin léargas dúinn ar an gcontúirt mhór maidir le cúrsaí ola agus an dochar gur féidir leis seo a dhéanamh. Chomh maith leis sin tá luaite anseo go bhfuilimid ag caint faoi shubstaintí nimhneacha i bhfoirm lachta, nó rud éigin eile gur féidir leis dochar a dhéanamh don dúlra agus don timpeallacht.</P>
    <P>Ní gá gur as na longa seo atá ag taisteal na farraige móire amháin a bheadh substaintí nimhneacha ag teacht freisin. Mura mbeimid fíor-chúramach agus rudaí faoi smacht againn tá contúirt ann go bhféadfadh substaintí nimhneacha a bheith ag teacht amach as feirmeacha éisc. Nílim a rá go bhfuil siad ag teacht amach. Níl, ach caithfidh rialacha dochta daingne a bheith leagtha síos &mdash; faoi mar atá déanta ag Roinn na Mara &mdash; le cinntiú nach dtiocfadh aon substaint nimhneach ar an bhfarraige as dul chun chinn den saghas sin.</P>
    <P>Deirtear i gcónaí, is cuma cén rud a dhéanann tú ar an saol seo, más dul chun chinn é, bíonn rud éigin le n-íoc ag duine éigin nó ag eagras éigin síos an bóthar dá bharr. Mar a deirtear sa Bhéarla, bíonn checks agus balances le déanamh i ngach áit agus i ngach rud a bhíonn ar bun againn. Ó thaobh muidne de agus ó thaobh an Bhille seo de, ba chóir a chinntiú go mbeidh na cúig mór-rudaí atá i gceist, ní amháin ráite i bhfoirm Bhille agus Achta, ach curtha i ngnímh agus smacht curtha ar aon truailliú nó aon truflais a d'fhéadfadh tarlú.</P>
    <P>Tá tracht sa Bhille faoi shubstaintí gur féidir a iompar timpeall i leoraithe nó i <Col N="49" /> containers móra millteacha ar an bhfarraige. Tá contuirt uathu siúd má tharlaíonn timpist nó má thagann aimsir stoirme nó rud éigin mar sin. D'fhéadfaidís briseadh in aghaidh cladaigh nó calafoirt nó ailltreacha. Tá sé sin clúdaithe go maith sa reachtaíocht seo.</P>
    <P>Tá gach tír sa domhan tar éis in-chur a bheith acu sa Bhille ar bhealach amháin nó ar bhealach eile. Maidir le séarachas ar long nó séarachas ar an bhfarraige, ní hé sin an chloch is mó ar ár bpaidrín. Caithfimid féin sa bhaile aghaidh a thabhairt ar an ndeacrachtaí féin gan trácht ar shéarachas a bheith ag imeacht as long nó bád. Is ceist mhór an séarachas atá ag dul amach ar an bhfarraige gan aon rud á dhéanamh faoi. Tá caint á dhéanamh faoi go mbeidh deireadh leis go luath. I gCathair agus i gContae na Gaillimhe féin tá a fhios agam cé chomh mór is a theastaíonn córas séarachais &mdash; agus córas ceart a dhéanfaidh treatment den chéad go dtí an tríú grád más gá sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Níl a fhios agam an bhfuilimid i ndáiríre faoi smachtú i leith bhrúscar trá agus brúscar chladaigh thart timpeall an chósta seo againne. Léigh mé in áit éigin go bhfuil suas le seacht milliún tonna brúscar á chur sa bhfarraige chuile bhliain. Tagann an t-uafás den bhrúscar sin ó nithe plaisteacha. Tóg an iascaireacht mar shampla. Bhí am ann go raibh eangacha á úsáid a bhí déanta as corda. Tar éis roinnt blianta d'imeodh sé ó mhaith agus ní bheadh sé le feiceál nó le fáil níos mó. Ach má bhreathnaímid ar na heangacha móra atá ag na hiascairí uilig anois chífimid go bhfuil siad déanta as cineál plaistigh. Cailltear na céadta agus na céadta míle den eangach monafilm mar shampla in aghaidh na bliana timpeall an domhain uilig. Níl mé ag caint faoi timpeall chósta na hÉireann amháin. Tá an iascaireacht bainteach go dlúth agus go nádúrtha leis an bhfarraige. Ach anois tá an iascaireacht mar ábhar thruaillithe ar an bhfarraige de bharr an chíneál eangach atá á usáid.</P>
    <P>Níl aon rud luaite go sonrach sa Bhille seo faor thruailliú ó bháid iascaigh. Táimid ag caint go speisialta faoi na taincéirí móra atá ag iompar ola timpeall an domhain. Ach bíodh a fhios againn go <Col N="50" /> bhfuil siad seo in ann an dochar ceanann céanna a dhéanamh. Ach cosúil le go leor rudaí eile, mura bhfuilimid in ann agus sásta aghaidh a thabhairt ar na deacrachtaí uilig agus iarracht a dhéanamh iad a chur faoi smacht, teipfidh orainn ar an mór-chuid. Feiceann tú an t-uafás rópaí, gloine, cannaí, boinn agus rudaí eile déanta as ruibéar agus plaisteach. Níl siad san ag teacht ón bhfarraige mhór amháin a bhfuil an Bille seo ag díriú air ach tá siad ag baint leis an dtalamh freisin. Tá siad ag baint le cuairteoirí ag saoire cois cladaigh, leis na báid bheaga pleisiúrtha agus leis na achtanna seo go léir atá timpeall an chósta. Caitear an truaflais agus an brúscar astu siúd isteach sa bhfarraige. Tá mé ag glacadh leis go bhféadfar faoin mBille seo, an dlí a chur ar na daoine sin chomh maith céanna le úinéirí na tráilaer agus na longa móra.</P>
    <P>Tá áireamh déanta ar an dochar uilig atá á dhéanamh. Tá sé le feiceáil lenár súile féin chuile lá. Tóg arís sampla gar do bhaile againn féin. Tá rud mór nua tosaithe thiar i gConamara rud nach raibh ann blianta ó shin. Bhí sé ann blianta ó shin ach amháin go bhfeictear an chaoi a bhfuil sé tar éis fáis. Is é sin an méid turasóirí atá ag dul go dtí Oileán Árann sa samhradh. Táimid ag caint ar na céadta míle ag taisteal ansin, agus smaoinigh ar an méid brúscair agus truflaise atá á chaitheamh thart acu siúd in aghaidh an lae isteach san fharraige? Go leor de na rudaí sin, tá ábhar plaisteach iontu agus is rud é sin atá gar don bhaile; ní gá dúinn dul amach ar an bhfarraige le go bhfeicfimid é. Ba chóir go mbeadh rialacha dochta, daingne ann le teacht orthu siúd sa chaoi is go bhféadfaí stop a chur leo i gceart. Mar shampla, tá cumhacht ag an Aire féachaint chuige go mbeadh áiseanna ann i ngach calafort chun brúscar agus truflais fharraige ó na longa agus ó na báid iascaigh seo uilig a bhailiú. Tá sé thar am tosú, agus tosú sna háiteanna is mó a bhfuil siad ag teastáil. Ba bhreá liom dá bhféadfainn a rá go bhfuil sé tosaithe thiar i Ros a' Mhíl, ach ní amhlaidh an scéal. Ba chóir go mbeadh tús maith déanta againn air sin.</P>
    <P>Tá an t-uafás le moladh sa Bhille, ach tá rud amháin ann a chuireann as dom, <Col N="51" /> agus tá mé cinnte go mbeidh an tAire ábalta mé a chur ar mo shuaimhneas nuair a bheidh sé ag freagairt ar ball, agus sainmhíniú ar &ldquo;ship&rdquo; agus &ldquo;bád&rdquo; atá i gceist. Tá sainmhíniú ar bhád ar leathanach a seacht, líne a 30:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;ship&rdquo; means a vessel of any type whatsoever operating in the marine environment and includes hydrofoil boats, air-cushion vehicles, submersibles, floating craft and fixed or floating platforms and includes fixtures, fittings and equipment.</P>
    <P>Tá imní orm faoin sainmhíniú sin, what a ship is, mar a déarfa. Tá an Bille tógtha air agus tá an focal &ldquo;ship&rdquo; luaite tríd an doiciméad seo go mion is go minic, agus inseoidh mé an fáth go bhfuil imní orm. Bhí baint agam féin le feirmeoireacht éisc, agus bhí soitheach ann ar tugadh &ldquo;bád&rdquo; air. Tá pictiúr agam anseo de agus dá bhfeicfeadh duine ar bith an pictiúr den bhád seo ar an bhfarraige thabharfadh sé bád air, ach &ldquo;barge&rdquo; atá luaite in áit eile. Tá sé an-mhór agus an-fhada, agus is cuimhin liom gur thug an Seanadóir Carmencita Hederman cuairt ar Inis Oírr bliain ó shin, bhí sí ag déanamh meastóireachta ar bhaile nó oileán slachtmhar agus bhí an-suim go deimhin aici sa bhfeirmeoireacht éisc, mar go raibh an oiread sin cainte déanta faoin truailliú a bhí ag teacht ó na feirmeacha seo. Chuaigh sí timpeall an oileáin agus sa deireadh chas sí liomsa agus d'fhiafraigh sí díom: &ldquo;Cá bhfuil an fheirm éisc anseo? Agus thaispeáin mé amuigh ar an bhfarraige dí é. Ach a deir sí, &ldquo;is báid iad sin. &ldquo;Sea,&rdquo; a deir mé féin, &ldquo;is bád é ach ar an dtaobh eile den scéal is feirm éisc é.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Ag dul ar ais go dtí an scéal, inseoidh mé fáth mo bhuartha don Aire &mdash; nuair a tháinig an long go dtí an tír seo ar dtús agus nuair a bhíothas ag iarraidh árachas a chur air dhiúltaigh Rialtas na hÉireann &mdash; níl mé a rá an Rialtas <i>per se,</i> ach cibé daoine a bhí ag feidhmiú don Rialtas &mdash; bád nó ships a thabhairt ar an árthach sin. Agus bhí sé fíor-thábhachtach dúinne go dtabharfaí bád air. Uimhir a haon, ó thaobh árachais de, dhéanfadh sé difríocht an-mhór sa mhéid árachais a <Col N="52" /> bheadh le híoc againn. Ach mar atá ráite anseo:</P>
    <P>On the basis of the analyses and the model tests... reviewed and discussed the conceptual design of the sea-going fish farm. The Norwegian classification society decided it could be operated within the ship class notation +1A1...</P>
    <P>Bhí siad sásta bád a thabhairt air, classification a thabhairt dó agus teastas dáiríre a thabhairt air. Ní raibh muidne sásta sa tir seo. Ach an fáth a bhfuil mé á rá, dar liom gur chóir go mbeadh a leithéid sin de rud sonraithe agus luaite sa Bhille seo le bheith cinnte go bhfuil siad clúdaithe go sonrach ann. Sa Bhille arís agus arís eile tá an tAire ag caint faoi bháid atá &ldquo;cláraithe&rdquo; nó &ldquo;registered&rdquo; sa tír seo. Má tá sé cláraithe, dar liomsa is bád a bhí ann sa chás seo ach níor éirigh linn é a fháil registered. Deir sé anseo:</P>
    <P>The <i>Bradán Feasú</i> is a ship and has to be treated like one. It will therefore have to be docked after ten years. Every summer, the hull will also have to be inspected by divers...</P>
    <P>Leanann sé ar agaidh mar sin lena chruthú gur long nó bád a bhí ann. Faoin Bhille seo is í an cheist atá agam, an bhféadfadh an tAire, nó na cigirí nó surveyors atá luaite sa Bhille seo, dul ar bhord an árthaigh seo nuair nach bád é agus nuair nach bhfuil aon cheist ann go bhfuil aitheantas tugtha dó mar bhád. Ag an am céanna tá an deis thruaillithe ann chomh maith céanna agus chomh mór is atá ag an mbád mór atá clúdaithe anseo. Tá daoine ag obair ann, tá tú ag caint faoi sheárachas, faoi bhruscar agus faoi shubstaintí nimhneacha a bhíonn in úsáid ann agus an t-árthach áirithe sin tá suas le 5,000 gallún ola inti ag am ar bith agus níl sé leathmhíle amach ón gcé. An pointe atá agam ná nach gá dúinn dul go dtí na farraigí arda, ní gá dúinn dul timpeall an domhain. Tá rud ag an doras againn féin. Bíodh go bhfuil sé ráite ag an Aire: &ldquo;a ship means a vessel of any type whatsoever&rdquo;, dar liomsa, mura bhfuil classification faighte ní féidir é a bheith ináirithe anseo mar rud gur féidir bád nó <Col N="53" /> ship a thabhairt air. Ar an mbealach seo, nuair a thiocfas an chéad chéim eile, beidh mé ag brú go bhféadfaí é a chur isteach mar leasú beag go mbeadh feirmeoireacht éisc de chinealácha áirithe luaite go sonrach sa Bhille.</P>
    <P>Bíodh go bhfuil rialacha láidre le bheith ann, tá iontas agus diómá orm nach bhfuil sé ráite sa Bhille go bhfuil cosc ar longa farraige, longa cogaidh agus báid faoi thoinn. Ní thuigim cén fáth go mbeadh cead acu siúd, is cuma cé as iad, dul faoi fharraigí na tíre seo, nó faoi cheannas na tíre seo, am ar bith a shocraíonn siad. Tá siadsan in ann truailliú a dhéanamh chomh maith le bád ar bith eile. Ach is cosúil go bhfuil glactha go hidirnáisiúnta gur amhlaidh a bheadh, ach is trua liomsa go dtarlaíonn a leithéid agus go nglacaimid leis.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios againn céard atá déanta ag na báid faoi thoinn maidir leis na báid bheaga iascaigh. Tá parlaimint Shasana, fiú amháin, ag iarraidh rud éigin a dhéanamh faoi seo anois. Ní cóir dúine aon chúnamh, a bheag ná a mhór, a thabhairt do na longa cogaidh nó báid faoi thoinn seo a bheadh ag taisteal na bhfarraigí seo againne, ar uachtar nó ar íochtar, agus cead a gceann acu. I bhfo-alt a 11 sa Bhille, faoi bheatha, shláinte, dhochar agus faoi chontúirtí shaol na farraige, tá rialacha agus forálacha stuama. De réir an Bhille seo tá cumhacht ag an Aire go leor rialacha a leagan síos, ach tá faitíos orm gurb é an seanscéal a bheidh ann mar beidh an oiread sin rialacha ann go mbeidh sé fíordheacair go deo iad a chur i dtoll a chéile agus iad a fheidhmiú. Beidh caiteachas mór airgid i gceist má tá grád na gcalafort timpeall na tíre le hardú le freastal ar chuile shórt atá anseo.</P>
    <P>An cheist deireanach a bhfuil mé idir dhá chomhairle faoi &mdash; agus beidh mé á árdú arís ar Chéim an Choiste &mdash; ná an chigireacht a chaithfear a dhéanamh agus céard is cigire ann; céard é an cineál oibre atá leagtha síos do chigire agus cén chaoi a bhféadfadh ball den Gharda Síochána bheith ina chigire? Sin an rud a rith liom le linn dom bheith ag breathnú ar leathanach 14. Cuirtear ar mo shúile dom an méid rialacha a bheadh le comhlíonadh. Mar shampla, i bhfo-alt (2), tá suas le <Col N="54" /> scór rudaí éagsúla le déanamh ag cigire. Dá mba chigire garda agus dá mbeadh air dul amach agus gníomhú dá réir ní bheadh sé oilte é a dhéanamh. Níl aon trácht sa Bhille seo ar oiliúint ar leith maidir le cigireacht sa dóigh is go mbeadh ar a chumas plé leis na deacrachtaí a bhaineann leis an bhfarraige a d'eascródh as feidhmiú fhorálacha an Bhille.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, bheinn ag fiosrú cumhacht an Gharda Síochána sa chomhthéacs seo agus cén chaoi a bhféadfadh siad gníomhú mar chigire maidir le cuid de na rialacha seo a chomhlíonadh. Tá speisialtóireacht ag baint le go leor forálacha anseo. Thuigfinn ceart go leor garda ag tabhairt tacaíochta do chigire saintraenáilte agus a thuigeann céard atá ar bun, agus bheadh sé an-chiallmhar a leithéid a bheith ann. Ach maidir le garda bheith i gceannas ó thús deireadh ní fhéadfadh sé feidhmiú de réir na rialacha agus ní bheadh an t-oideachas ná an traenáil aige le dul i ngleic leis na fadhbanna. Mar shampla, de réir ailt 24 &mdash; agus deirtear go bhféadfadh sé seo tarlú &mdash; b'fhéidir go mbeadh ar chigire dul amach chun long a smachtú agus a bheith freagrach as. Anois, i gcás an chigire sin, ní thuigim cén chaoi a bhféadfadh sé sin a chur i bhfeidhm. B'fhéidir nach dtarlódh sé ach os rud é go bhfuil sé seo sa Bhille b'fhiú an cheist a scrúdú.</P>
    <P>Go bunúsach, mar a dúirt mé roimhe seo, is Bille an-mhaith é seo. Tá an-mholadh go deo tuillte ag an Aire as an mBille seo a thabhairt isteach. Tá sé thar am a leithéid a bheith againn agus ní féidir ach maitheas a theacht as. Tá súil agam go rachaidh sé tríd an Seanad anseo agus go mbeimid in ann aontú ar na pointí beaga eile agus an Bille seo a chur ar aghaidh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste and Minister for the Marine to the Seanad. He is introducing a very welcome Bill. The Minister rightly says that it is a very timely Bill. Anyone in this country, or indeed in the world, who does not know about the problem of sea pollution has not been watching the results of the war in the Gulf. It brought forcibly home to all of us how serious sea pollution can be. The people in that area <Col N="55" /> will have for a generation to live with the consequences of that very bad sea pollution. To come much nearer home, today outside this building we had a large number of people demonstrating against the building of an incinerator in County Derry, an incinerator which will incinerate waste right beside the sea. The present arrangements are that the company involved has to export toxic waste by sea to Finland.</P>
      <P>When one comes to look at the legislation one gets some idea of the whole magnitude of the problem. I am pleased that the Minister has taken a positive initiative in introducing legislation which will go a long way to protect our island. On the introduction of legislation of this kind we have to deal with people who project themselves as having knowledge, and some of them have some knowledge, but very few of them have comprehensive knowledge. Therefore, the Government and the Minister charged with responsibility must be seen to be taking a lead and I am glad that the Minister is to the fore and is taking high ground in this very important area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be very serious dangers of pollution where you have ships in the Irish Sea and in proximity to our coast transporting toxic waste and waste that we are not yet in a position to monitor and to assess the dangers and the consequences should accidents happen. All too often during storms and inclement weather the ships are not adequate in the first instance to carry the type of waste that is being shipped. This can have serious consequences. We have not always been well equipped to monitor the extent of the pollution. This must be a major concern for the Minister. Even after this legislation is implemented the Minister and the Government have a major task in so far as we are a small country with limited resources. How will we police the legislation after we implement it? Those are fairly important considerations. I strongly believe that the monitoring of shipping carrying dangerous substances of a toxic nature is very important. Ships <Col N="56" /> carrying such substances should be registered. As the Bill rightly recognises, they must inform the country in whose waters they are travelling. This is dealing with a major task and I welcome the initiative being taken.</P>
    <P>I also recognise the importance of the legislation. Most Irish people have seen films of serious dumping of nuclear waste at sea, and not too far from the Irish Sea either. I do not know if there is anybody in the country at any level, all of the environmentalists and the experts who knows exactly what amount of dumping has taken place in proximity to the Irish Sea. It is important to continue to assess the dumping problem which has been taking place for a very long time.</P>
    <P>Sellafield is one of the areas we are capable of monitoring, but to date we have not been very successful in persuading the British of the harmful effects of the pollution from Sellafield. This is one of our major concerns, especially for those of us who are directly in line with Sellafield. There is there an ongoing manmade threat of pollution. We have got to assert ourselves in Europe and to enlist the support of all our friends in Europe to see that that is minimised and ultimately contained and stopped, because it is unfair. The British have got to be told by the European Commissioners in as strong terms as it is possible to do that that pollution is not acceptable to anybody. It might be profitable and it might be convenient, but it is certainly dangerous. I say that without any technical qualifications to assess its danger. But the ordinary individual knows that it is dangerous and knows that it could have serious consequences.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister for the Marine will continue to act in as strong and determined a way as he possibly can because he has the backing of the Irish people. There are many who believe that the Government should be doing more to persuade the British to discontinue Sellafield. I realise that it is a major task. The country has already embarked upon it. The people in Sellafield have an excellent PRO. They invite everybody to come and look at the processing facilities there. <Col N="57" /> They can tell you that it may be harmful and that the people who work there are concerned for their own families. But they will give an excellent account of the performance at Sellafield. However, it is a concern that is not going to go away so far as the Irish people are concerned.</P>
    <P>When the Minister handed across the pictures of the consequences of dumping waste, my first thought was that it was a map of the maritime jurisdiction this country might have. I welcome the introduction of the Sea Pollution Bill because it brings to the surface the question of where our jurisdiction at sea starts and finishes. I am not making a joke when I ask if Rockall is included in our responsibility or jurisdiction. With the introduction of the Sea Pollution Bill, it is not an unreasonable request to ask the Minister to reply and to state where our jurisdiction starts and finishes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. McDonald) Acting Chairman (Mr. McDonald)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. McDonald)</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to the Minister, the Senator might remember that the Bill appears to deal solely with pollution from ships and facilities in the harbours. It is a very extensive Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. I have read the Bill, I have listened to the Minister and I am aware of what the Chair is rightly saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is trying to be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>You are being helpful. However, as someone who comes from an area not far removed from the territorial waters &mdash; as indeed does the Minister &mdash; I am prompted to raise the issue. I am sure I am not alarming the Minister. I am sure he is as concerned as I am about the same issue. Perhaps he has to be diplomatic and is not yet ready to give the answer I asked for. Nonetheless, I am free to ask it and I ask it with sincerity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill refers to the problem of plastic containers. That may not register as very important but I totally agree with the reference in the Bill to the problem created by plastic containers at sea, <Col N="58" /> especially containers that are discarded with substances in them that are dangerous in themselves. This must be a major problem. I hope there is some method of restricting the dumping of plastic containers.</P>
    <P>I also ask if it would be possible to monitor, control or do something about discarding nets. I am thinking mainly of monofilament netting. They can be very dangerous, not only as a pollutant but to seafarers themselves. There are miles of discarded monofilament netting all around our coast. I hope we can find some way of controlling the dumping of nets at sea. It is another of the serious problems we have.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to one other matter. It is time that we took a look at our ports and harbours. Do we have to have the unsightly scene in every harbour town of having scrap boats there for perhaps 20 years, old wrecks turned upside down and falling to pieces? We are very concerned about dumped motor cars and other vehicles all over the country but these dumped and discarded vessels do not improve the appearance of our seaside towns and villages. I ask the Minister to look at this area. Perhaps we get so familiar with things that in the end we do not see them.</P>
    <P>I could not finish my contribution without making some reference &mdash; and I am sure the Minister will understand this &mdash; to the Foyle Estuary. It has had its share of problems down the years; it certainly has had its share of pollution and manmade pollution scars. We had clinical bags washed up on beaches and it has never been established how they got there. There was also a substance containing DDT found there, and DDT has not been around for some time. Perhaps it is unreasonable to expect the Minister to be in a position to respond to these matters. Nevertheless, we had a report and Greenpeace were called in two years ago to investigate the DDT substance found in the Foyle Estuary. I had hoped Greenpeace would have followed up the matter or at least give their opinion on how in the first instance DDT got into the Foyle Estuary. It is a question that <Col N="59" /> has never been answered and one that has concerned the people who use the Foyle.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very timely, it is very useful and I would wish the Minister for the Marine success with it. I have a lot of confidence in his ability to effectively police the Bill when it is passed. I would venture to say that that will be the most difficult and most important part of it. I welcome the Bill and wish it success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, may I say I am pleased to see the Minister for the Marine in the House. It is certainly a long time since he has been here, if today is not his first appearance in this House during this term of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Bill, I think the title of the Bill, namely, the Sea Pollution Bill is somewhat extravagant and grandiose. It appears to deal with the implementation of the provisions of an international convention. Certainly, these provisions are very restrictive and I would have thought there is a good deal more to the whole idea of sea pollution beyond what is contained in the Bill. Nonetheless, the Bill is welcome. It is welcome because it will help to protect the sea around us which of course is a wonderful resource and indeed one that has been very seriously underutilised in this country for very many years. It is good to see legislation now being introduced that will help to preserve that resource and protect it so that in years to come it can be exploited for the benefit of all the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main criticisms in relation to this Bill would be those matters which in a way are conspicuous by their absence. I am disappointed the Bill does not deal with the question of nuclear dumping and indeed the whole problems which arise because of Sellafield. I undersand they are somewhat outside the provisions of the international convention but, at the same time, I would have thought they are very much within the scope of what a Sea Pollution Bill should be. Again, I emphasise my concern about the nature of the title of this Bill which I think is <Col N="60" /> misleading. I also think a Bill with a title such as this misses a considerable opportunity to deal with matters and issues which relate to the dumping of nuclear material into the Irish Sea from the Sellafield processing plant.</P>
    <P>I am also disappointed the Bill excludes from its terms of reference anything which deals with naval vessels, military craft and so on. Again, it is a pity that these matters are not covered in this Bill. Certainly, the presence of nuclear armed ships in Irish waters is a matter of great concern to many people in this country and the manner in which we deal with this matter is certainly disingenuous. This Bill would have provided us with a means of addressing that problem if we sought to exploit it fully. The public are not at all reassured by the present procedures which in effect means that when vessels come here that are armed with nuclear weapons and various nuclear materials, we simply turn the blind eye to them and pretend they do not exist. That is a matter of great concern to many people and indeed it is a matter of great concern that the Government continue to fail to address this question.</P>
    <P>At a more specific level I am somewhat concerned about the requirements which the Bill places on harbours to have the capacity to deal with oily wastes and residues. I wonder if many harbours have the capacity to provide the resources and the equipment, needed to deal with the processing of these residues of oily materials? I would think there would be quite a lot of expense required to improve the facilities and resources of many harbours and if this Bill places an obligation on them to install the necessary equipment then that is going to create very serious problems in the context of the resources available to them.</P>
    <P>I share the concern expressed by other speakers in relation to the problems which will arise in the enforcement of the provisions of this Bill. I wonder if we have the capacity to adequately enforce them and I would welcome hearing the Minister's views on that. Indeed, I would welcome hearing from the Minister if he has any proposals to increase our capacity <Col N="61" /> in relation to the resources that are available to the Navy and to the other agencies within the ambit of his Department who will be concerned with the enforcement of the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, I must confess to being a little bit concerned about the wide nature of the definition of craft and ships and so on. It seems from a very brief perusal of the Bill that pretty well everything that floats in the seas comes within the definition of craft. I wonder if it is possible for somebody who goes out boating on a Sunday afternoon and who throws the cellophane wrapper of their sandwiches into the sea to be liable to be prosecuted up to a maximum fine of £1,000 or indeed up to a level of £10 million should someone in the Attorney General's office get a trifle carried away? I would be interested in hearing from the Minister on that point.</P>
    <P>I would also be interested to hear from the Minister what would be the position, let us say, in relation to lifeboats and life craft that are loaned from ships and where it may be necessary to dump material into the sea to facilitate the saving of life. I accept that these are fairly minor technical points but I would be glad if the Minister would clarify the situation in relation to them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of the Bill although I find the title a trifle extravagant and grandiose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill which seeks to ratify certain international conventions and legislation throughout Europe. I am from the south-west coast and live in Bantry Bay which has been the scene of many problems. Bantry Bay is the second most accessible bay in the world from the point of view of shipping safety, depth of sea, carriage, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The first in beauty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that. The provisions in the Bill are timely and must be given broad support. The busiest shipping lanes in Europe pass off the south-west coast of Cork and Kerry. We have <Col N="62" /> had a plethora of problems in the area and I hope that once this Bill becomes law it will eliminate them.</P>
      <P>In the mid-eighties there were two major oil spills in Bantry Bay. Luckily enough Gulf Oil footed the bill. With the co-operation of the Department and Cork County Council at that time successful clean-up operations were put in place. No adverse effects were encountered with regard to fishing either in the rich herring beds in Gerahies or in prawn fishing in Bantry Bay. There was a scare at the time that maybe some of the pollutants would go to the bottom of the sea and affect the beds. There has been no scientific or other evidence that this occurred.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to that we had unfortunate developments along our coastline which I hope this Bill will eliminate. The <i>Yarrawonga</i> went down off the beautiful Slea Head peninsula. That wreck came ashore and was battered on the rocks. The wreck is still there, occupying a beautiful beach. We must prohibit this. Our tourist industry is vital to the economy. We have a beautiful coast and must maintain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the second most important fishing port in Ireland, Castletownbere, in the middle of the harbour between Bere Island and the mainland, the wreck of the <i>Bardini Reefer</i> is sticking up. It has been there for nine years. When that disaster happened another Government were in power but nothing was done. This vessel was abandoned in the inner harbour and from my information it was more or less scuttled. There was no insurance and no company has picked up the bill. Perhaps the Minister might comment on this. The Minister mentioned the lame ducks off our coastline. It is regrettable that this vessel still remains and nothing has been done to shift it. Perhaps the Minister can throw some light on this. Can this vessel be moved to ensure the safety of the people coming to and from Bere Island and the safety of the fishermen using this most valuable harbour? At this time of year we will have a large number of ships coming in to purchase herring and mackerel. This is most welcome because they contribute <Col N="63" /> to the economy of the port and of the area.</P>
    <P>We had the saga of the infamous <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> which because of severe storms, sheltered in Bantry Bay. Luckily for us in Bantry Bay the ship left and was heading for another destination but somewhere off Fastnet Rock the crew were taken off and the vessel drifted aimlessly with its engines running. We hoped it would miss the west Cork coast but if it missed that it would probably end up in Waterford. It struck Stags Head and lodged there. It had a cargo of metal and it is now occupying one of the richest herring beds off our coastline. This morning I was speaking to the skipper of a trawler who said that apart from the fact that it is dangerous to trawl in that area because of the submerged huge vessel the contents have caused damage to the rich herring bed. This is regrettable. At the time because of adverse weather conditions little could be done. Efforts were made to try to pull the huge cargo vessel off the rocks but they failed. Subsequently when there was a discharge of oil from the tanks the council and the Department did an excellent job. It cost the State in the region of £1 million to offset the detrimental effects of the <i>Kowloon Bridge.</i> I am not sure but as far as I am concerned the tab was never picked up and the State carries the loss.</P>
    <P>The <i>Tribulus</i> oil tanker limped into Bantry Bay. This vessel, owned by Shell, was severely damaged and had a large hole in its side. These were the problems we had off the south-west coastline. This was an emergency. Lives were at risk and it was right and proper that the vessel was allowed into Bantry Bay and given shelter. I compliment the Minister and his officials in the Department of the Marine for the excellent way in which they immediately set about trying to ensure, firstly, that this vessel would not pollute the bay and, secondly, that it could be repaired. It lay in the bay for several months and the Department of the Marine &mdash; the Minister visited the stricken <i>Tribulus</i>&mdash; did an excellent job. The amount of pollution was minimal. It <Col N="64" /> indicates that as time goes by we are improving.</P>
    <P>We must ensure the safety of seamen and as a humanitarian nation give shelter to stricken vessels. We must also ensure as far as possible that damage is not done to our coastline. Regrettably, over the last ten years in particular, the south-west coast has become a graveyard for stricken vessels and apart from the successful <i>Tribulus</i> operation we have a bad record in this area.</P>
    <P>I may seem parochial but Bantry is a beautiful bay. We have the Roan Carrig lighthouse and an excellent shipping lane serving the Whiddy Island terminal. Two years ago a huge Spanish trawler foundered and went on the rocks. It lay there not far away from the <i>Bardi Reefer.</i> Visitors touring West Cork, the beautiful Beara Penninsula, Goats Path, or other scenic routes should not be subjected to having mangled wrecks of steel thrown upon our shores or rocks.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a compulsory vessel reporting and notification system for all ships entering Irish waters. He said such a system is currently in force in respect of fishing trawlers registered in Spain and Portugal. I urge the Minister to consider seriously putting in place such a system. It may be difficult to operate and I know that other Senators have rightly adverted to the fact that our harbour authorities should have the power, finance and resources to deal with these problems. The nettle should be grasped and I hope the Minister in his reply will dwell on this.</P>
    <P>There should be stricter controls on vessels coming into our waters particularly on huge bulk carriers carrying oil and, as in the case of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i>, ore. If we had a monitoring system perhaps we could prevent a situation where we would end up with a wreck. In some instances we are dealing with Third World countries and lame ducks where no insurance company picks up the tab. Maybe there should be some method whereby any ship of the magnitude of bulk carriers entering Irish waters should have insurance and in the event of a tragedy the Department and <Col N="65" /> the county council could get the insurance company to pick up the tab. This is a matter which I hope the Department will take on board seriously.</P>
    <P>As regards the dumping of plastic bags, plastic bottles, refuse and rubbish by ships I was heartened last year when eight or nine school children in second class in my home town of Bantry wrote to me asking how I, as a public representative, could help mammals along our sea coast such as seals, otters and so on and the fish stocks which were beng damaged by these materials. At that stage I wrote to the children explaining that this Bill was on the cards and hopefully would be introduced. It is very heartening to see that teachers in those schools and pupils at that age have an awareness of and a very positive approach to pollution.</P>
    <P>I take issue with my colleague, Senator Upton, who asked what do you do if somebody out for a Sunday evening cruise in a punt or a little pleasure craft throws out a plastic bag of rubbish. These people should be taken to task. I have an 18-foot pleasure cruiser and my children, the oldest is 11 years of age, are very careful to ensure that any rubbish, whether it is a coke bottle, a plastic bottle, a plastic bag or orange skins are brought ashore and put in the bin. That is the type of awareness we must encourage.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton's comment that you fine somebody £1,000 for doing this or, in the case of an indictable offence, impose a prison sentence is not realistic. If somebody who is caught in the act is brought into the district court and fined maybe £20 or £30 he or she would not do it a second time. There is no need to put the gun to their heads. The Minister has clearly outlined that these provisions are appropriate and necessary. It is a problem that we must tackle. It is utterly crude of us to speak about foreign vessels dumping rubbish, etc., if we cannot ensure that this sort of pollution, whether by children or fishermen off trawlers or halfdeckers, is stopped. If we do not respect our own waters it is very hard for us to expect others to do so. The <Col N="66" /> provision whereby anybody caught polluting our waters can be brought to task is most desirable and welcome.</P>
    <P>Central to this is the question of our environment. I spoke on the Environmental Protection Agency Bill on this issue because, apart from anything else, there is now a very solid and well-founded public interest in our environment. This Bill consolidates the fact that the Legislature are serious about curbing pollution from whatever source. That is vitally important.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the tourist industry is one of our fastest growing and most important industries. Before the end of this decade it is likely to outstrip the agricultural industry and it will probably be the most important industry in the State. It is vitally important that the relatively unspoiled beauty of our coastline, particularly in southern Ireland, in Cork and Kerry, remains unspoilt. I am not sure if the provisions of this Bill enable the Minister to deal with he problem of the <i>Yarrawonga</i> and other wrecks that are creating havoc off our coastline. I may be somewhat parochial but these issues are vitally important having regard to the fact that the south-west coastline is on the main shipping lane. If a problem arises vessels head for Bantry Bay. We have had a couple of near disasters. I shudder to think of the consequences if the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> actually foundered in Bantry Bay. We escaped from that disaster.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill are welcome. Since the incident involving the <i>Tribulus</i> there is a greater awareness in the Department of the Marine. County councils are better prepared for these eventualities and are able to move in day or night. When the <i>Tribulus</i> came in they were on stand-by and Department of the Marine officials were there on a 24-hour basis. I was delighted with this. Were it not for that type of immediate response by the Department and the county council under the auspices of the Minister the <i>Tribulus</i> could have foundered. It was touch and go for a number of days and eventually it was repaired. It left the bay <Col N="67" /> and little or no damage was done. This is the type of development I wish to see.</P>
    <P>This Bill will improve the situation regarding pollution off our coastline and along our shores. That must be welcomed. The south-west has been hardest hit. I trust the provisions of the Bill will be welcomed and received positively by this House and that this legislation will become law in the very near future. I urge the Minister to discharge the responsibilities we are talking about when the Bill becomes law. Have we the financial resources to deal with these problems? That is a serious question. We are all aware, for example of the difficulty of monitoring illegal fishing off our coast. In this instance there are serious questions from an environmental and tourist point of view. Local authorities, particularly harbour boards, must be prepared and must be given the financial resources to monitor this because disasters and casualties can be prevented. If the Bill when it becomes law, hopefully in the very near future, is fully implemented I hope whatever Government will be in power will take a realistic and positive approach to this so that by the end of this decade the problems we have encountered off our coastline will be diminished if not totally eliminated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill. As an island nation, it is of utmost importance to us. We are very vulnerable when you think in terms of the tiny size of Ireland on the edge of the Atlantic. Our nearest neighbours are major continents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan mentioned the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> accident. It is interesting that it was just five years ago, on 24 November that our minds were concentrated for the first time on the damage caused by such accidents. Luckily the damage was not horrendous in what the Senator says is the most beautiful spot in Ireland. I suggest that other areas on the west coast might be just as beautiful but the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> incident dominated the headlines of newspapers for eight months. It was an important event for us <Col N="68" /> and it is almost a word in the dictionary now at this stage. <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> to an Irish person, particularly in Cork and Kerry means oil spillage, pollution.</P>
    <P>The Departments of the Environment and the Marine received the highest praise for the decisive way in which the clean-up was tackled. It was a first for us and served as a model for future disasters. The operation was carried out efficiently but the issues that emerged from the debate at that time related to the control of the movement of hazardous material in the country. It was suggested that local authorities should be informed daily when such materials are passing through our cities and towns. That was an interesting observation. Reading through the Bill we tend to think of hazardous wastes from ships as such but if hazardous wastes are going into our rivers obviously at some stage they will eventually emerge into our coastal waters. I wonder whether local authorities are informed daily when hazardous materials are passing through our towns and cities? I doubt very much if they are. It is something that should be followed up in consultation with the Department of the Environment. I would be interested to know if that is the situation and if such information is passed to local authorities.</P>
    <P>Another issue raised at that time was river and lake pollution. It was suggested that a task force be established in each county comprising all relavant interests groups &mdash; anglers, farming, tourist and business interests. I know the Environmental Protection Agency has addressed many of these issues but I am very concerned as a member of a local authority that these measures be adopted and that resources be given both in human and financial terms to local authorities to ensure that they can play the part they are expected to play in monitoring pollution. It was also suggested at that time that the local authorities would publish a yearly report of the various outbreaks of pollution in their areas. I see that the Bill introduces heavy penalties for pollution.</P>
    <P>There was reference to a programme of education. Many Senators referred to <Col N="69" /> the school posters in relation to the dangers of plastic and, at the end of the day, the control of pollution. We are talking today not just of heavy pollution from ships but pollution on our beaches. This must be tackled at an early age and it should be ongoing. The control of pollution effectively is in the hands of young people.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the <i>Yarrawonga</i> in 1989 and the <i>Tribulus</i> that limped into Bantry Bay leaking heavy fuel in April 1991, and I was in the Ballyvaughan area at the time and I witnessed the problems. The loss required Ministerial intervention and the operation was well conducted. Praise was heaped on the Minister and the various people involved at that time. What costs were incurred? They must have been enormous particularly if we go back to the <i>Kowloon Bridge.</i> Do we recoup moneys from the EC?</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Foighil referred to the interpretation of ship, when is a ship not a ship. He produced documents showing the use of the word &ldquo;barge&rdquo; in one case, then it was referred to as a ship and the same vessel was referred to as a cage. Who defines the word &ldquo;ship&rdquo;. I know it is defined as meaning a vessel of any type operating in the marine environment. Hydrofoil boats, air-cushion vehicles, submersibles, floating craft and fixed or floating platforms were mentioned. Maybe there could be a further development of state of the art ships that may be termed some other more sophisticated name and may not be technically included in the definition. I do not know but it is something that could be looked at.</P>
    <P>There is reference to the materials used in ship construction. It is not so much very old vessels that went aground but smaller, newer vessels. The Atlantic is an extraordinary ocean with enormous powers and we never know when those powers will be destructive. There is also a great deal of inclement weather. I wonder whether there is a need for an examination of the international construction of ships and their durability? Have we the expertise in the Department <Col N="70" /> of the Marine? Has the Minister the financial resources to bring in outside expertise?</P>
    <P>Section 10 (1) (a) refers to oil and noxious liquid substance. I am concerned, as are many other speakers, about nuclear effluent particularly with the ongoing Sellafield controversy. Part I (4) deals with the exemption of warships being used by the Government. This obviously causes concern. As regards the prevention of nuclear powered ships entering our waters we do not have the manpower or monitoring equipment to detect such vessels.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann supports</P>
      <P>the following key objectives of the long term strategy for the nineties outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress:</i></P>
      <P>&mdash;a substantial increase in employment;</P>
      <P>&mdash;a major assault on long term unemployment;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the development of greater social rights within our health, education, social welfare and housing services;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the promotion of collective and individual social responsibililty in relation to discharge of tax liabilities, fair conduct in business dealings, sensible treatment of the environment and reasonable use of public services and</P>
      <P>&mdash;the development of worker participation, women's rights and consumers' rights; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>supports the implementation of the agreement on pay and conditions; <Col N="71" /> and calls for the immediate implementation of the improvements recommended in the areas of education, health, employment creation, taxation and legislative reform.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister of State has taken the time to listen to the calls of the economy to implement what the Government agreed with the social partners earlier this year. I have no doubt that his response will be far more positive than the very weak Government amendment which fails to address some of the most significant points. That amendment tries to make the Minister's adviser and people like him pay for the cost of the problems of the economy. I intend to defend the public service throughout my speech.</P>
    <P>It is important to set this motion in a context and the context which I propose is the 1991 budget speech of the Minister for Finance. Once again this country has been thrown askew by so-called economists who try to give the impression that they know what is going on in the country. Economists in their forecasts over the past 15 years have always been incorrect. For example, last year they told us that the unification of Germany would destroy interest rates. Earlier this year they said interest rates would go up; instead, they went down. They have been consistently wrong simply because they have never been able to grasp the most important factor in the economy, which is people. They have never been able to fit people into their equation.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to what the Minister for Finance said in his budget speech earlier this year when he talked about the economic situation and outlook. I would like somebody to tell me where the Minister was right and where the Minister was wrong in January. Many people outside the House, including the economists, have told me how wrong the Minister got it but it does not appear all that wrong to me given the outcome. He compared the performance of last year with this year and his predictions have largely been borne out. He said that growth in the OECD area would <Col N="72" /> decelerate to around 2 per cent and that has happened. It is estimated that it will be about 1.1 per cent. He estimated that the UK market was likely to be very weak this year which has also happened. The Minister did say however that there were good solid reasons why we can maintain progress and he went on to list them.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that the parameters which he indicated were accurate, broadly speaking. The problems which he identified were problems he was aware of at that stage and the cost of various proposals which he had in mind were also well known at that stage. Regarding the <i>Programme for Social and Economic Progress</i> he said:</P>
    <P>In the programme what we have done is to forge a powerful shield to protect us in the difficult days ahead... Approval of the programme offers economical and fiscal stability, assurance about employment costs and a foundation for a further period of industrial peace. These are all crucial.</P>
    <P>This is the reality of 1991. That is where we began this year and nothing much has changed. In 1987 the Government sat down with the social partners and had a look at the economic situation. The debt/GNP ratio was approaching an intolerable 150 per cent.</P>
    <P>The social partners sat down to plan certain achievements during the course of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> I know what those objectives were in the area of debt/GNP ratio and under the Exchequer borrowing requirement figures. I want the Minister to admit to us tonight that we over-achieved, that we did better than any of those economists in 1987 said we would do. Economists greeted the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> with disdain in 1987 just as they greeted the PESC in 1981. They said it would not achieve what we set out to achieve, but it did, and more.</P>
    <P>The present debt/GNP ratio is down to approximately 109 per cent. The medium term objective was to reduce it to 100 per cent by 1993, 1994 and 1995. That is being achieved. I have not heard any economists admit over the last six months <Col N="73" /> that despite all that has happened we will still reduce that figure by at least 1 per cent this year. It would go from more than 108 per cent down to just over 107 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer borrowing requirement will certainly be reduced as well. The latest forecast issued by the stalwarts of fiscal and economic society in Ireland in Mr. Desmond's former company indicated during the week that we can sustain an Exchequer borrowing requirement of approximately 3 per cent or more this year. This figure would enable the Government to implement fully all the proposals and requirements of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>By the time we began this programme in 1991 we had achieved greater improvements in the key indicators, such as interest rates, than could be expected in 1987. The consumer price index was hovering around 3 per cent or 4 per cent. Interests rates had shown a continual drop having gone up and down during that period. The Exchequer borrowing requirement has consistently gone down every year despite contrary forecasts from the ESRI, and despite figures issued by the Department of Finance for August. The latest figures from the various stockbroking firms all indicate that these figures will continue to improve. The debt/GNP ratio despite what is being said, will still be improved during the course of this year.</P>
    <P>In relation to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the social partners and Government after a painful though productive process produced a series of minimal proposals and agreements on pay and conditions. They represented progress however and were welcomed for that reason. There is a lot at stake in terms of credibility and industrial peace, as the Minister stated during the course of that budget speech but the Government risk jeopardising industrial peace by the way in which they are operating at present.</P>
    <P>Between 1987 and 1991 members of trade unions, workers in the private and public sectors, and all PAYE members, <Col N="74" /> were involved in a major belt-tightening exercise and put up with hardship. Pay due to them was deferred but they kept their side of the bargain despite the fact that the Government over-achieved on their end of the bargain. Nobody went back to the Government and asked to renegotiate in order that all might reap the benefit. The social partners waited until 1991 and then sat down again for the sake of the country and came to a series of agreements which formed the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>After four years of belt tightening and in the light of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money being creamed off by unscrupulous entrepreneurs in one scandal after another, the suggestion that public servants now be deprived of their hard-earned entitlements is unacceptable and totally unsustainable. Having given the economy an extraordinary boost it is now time that workers reaped the benefits which accrued during the past four to five year period. In 1987 we set out to achieve a range of objectives that included putting the public finances on an even keel. There is no aspect of public finances for next year which was not costed by the Department of Finance down to the last penny during the course of the negotiations, which took place during December and January of last year.</P>
    <P>The famous &ldquo;specials&rdquo; that people talk about in an offhand way is deferred money due to various groups in the public service since 1987 and everybody around that negotiating table knew about it. It is comparable to putting off changing your car for a couple of years; it has to be done some time and during that time it is going to cost a bit more and that is the sort of period of attrition the Government are going through at this stage.</P>
    <P>The first three years of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> brought results far and beyond those ever believed possible. Following the conclusion of the PNR the negotiation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> represented an <Col N="75" /> effort to allow workers to share the benefits of an improved economy. It represented a consensus among the social partners and any attempt to break or undermine that consensus now is unacceptable. It is a most minimal, though welcome, attempt to develop the Irish economy even though economic indicators are better than at any time since the mid-eighties. I want the Minister to confirm that fact in his response. Many economic factors have been reduced to their lowest level. Nonetheless at the first attempt to pay public servants what is due to them stockbroker economists once again come out with their anti-public service line and proposals.</P>
    <P>At this stage three issues are at stake for public servants under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> These are the special pay increases which were awarded through the conciliation and arbitration process, the public service pay agreement which is the general agreement for all public servants and thirdly, commitments which were made in the areas of health, education, employment, tax, legislative reform etc., which form the third part of the commitments to public servants under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> There can be no question of tampering with outstanding arbitration awards due to teachers, nurses, gardaí and higher civil servants. They are the last people in the round to be paid and failure to pay their awards would be inequitable and discriminatory. It would not be acceptable on any agenda to renegotiate what is rightly due and what has rightly been awarded to these people.</P>
    <P>Why should the teachers of Ireland accept a worsening of their conditions while they see millions of pounds being creamed off by the golden circle club in one scandal after another? Is it fair that teachers in Europe's most overcrowded classes or nurses healing the sick in our underresourced health service, or gardaí whose commitment and service is unquestionable and civil servants who make a superb contribution despite embargoes on appointments should be <Col N="76" /> the people to pick up the tab for the creaming off of taxpayers' money by Greencore, the International Financial Services Centre, Telecom, the beef industry, Carysfort &mdash; and the list goes on? I have not heard any of these smart commentators ask when we are going to get the money back from this crowd. I heard that of the £8 or £9 million involved in the Greencore affair, less than £200,000 became liable for taxation. Therefore, instead of paying what should have been £4 million taxation on it, only £200,000, as I understand it, became even liable for taxation as it moved from one tax shelter to another.</P>
    <P>I will make no comment on the rights or wrongs of what happened in Greencore because a series of inquiries have been set up to investigate it. I hope the Minister will have the courage to concede that it is utterly unacceptable that someone, whether rightly or wrongly, can earn £8 million and be liable for tax on less than £200,000. Such opportunities for tax avoidance render the taxation regime inexplicable to the ordinary PAYE worker who does not have any choice in these matters. It is just not on. It is time these people were booted out of the country and exposed as unpatriotic, unscrupulous exploiters of a poor economy which is what they have been.</P>
    <P>We are currently witnessing an extraordinary period of the double-think in Irish society. We can find millions to pay the land speculators out in Carysfort &mdash; again I am not commenting on whether it is right or wrong &mdash; but I certainly know that we can find £8, £9 or £10 million so let us not argue about a million or two, whichever way it happens to go but just down the road from there, three or four school buildings are waiting for improvements, for extensions to buildings, to get rid of outside toilets in south Dublin in this day and age and the primary schools building programme is grinding to a halt. Let someone explain this anomaly to parents with children in sub-standard school accommodation, to teachers working under those conditions and most of all to the children who are expected to learn in that environment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> While the nation's finances are reportedly in difficulties we hear of the millions now being hived off by our leading industrialists, entrepreneurs and financiers. We hear of the profits that are being exported and repatriated tax free. We know that tax is being avoided on major profit-making schemes. The burden of the State is falling on the shoulders of the PAYE worker. Yet, predictably, at the first sign of trouble right-wing commentators attempt to victimise the public service, the taxpayer and the worker with demands that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> be renegotiated. Forget about these guys who are still opeating scams every day of the week. Forget about the people who are not paying their taxes, about the efforts being made to devise tax avoidance and tax evasion schemes. The solution is to hammer the public servants, hammer the PAYE worker and hammer the workers at all levels again. If anybody thinks that is going to work this time I challenge any Minister to debate the matter with me.</P>
    <P>The people of Ireland are no longer going to be codded by this kind of carry on. It is time we took action to sort these people out and if it means sorting out Governments as we go along, so be it. If that is what it takes to do it, that is what will be done. The wool will not be pulled over anybody's eyes any longer on these issues. It is totally and utterly unacceptable that these stockbroker economist and accountant types should now propose to tell us what to do and how to run the economy, since they are the people who got us into the trouble. They make a career out of designing, modelling, creating and implementing tax avoidance and tax evasion schemes. They are the people who are responsible for costing the Irish taxpayer billions of pounds year after year. They are now the people who are going to try to deprive us of the money required to implement the programmes or proposals of Government.</P>
    <P>They are the same experts who stood idly by while millions were being creamed off the taxpayer during the period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> as has <Col N="78" /> come to light over the past number of weeks while Irish workers were suffering redundancies, rising unemployment, increasing emigration and vicious belt tightening, cutbacks and embargoes at all levels. While all that was going on these smart alecks who would now tell us how to make the public servant and the PAYE worker pay even more were running the scene for their friends. It takes outrageous cheek as far as I am concerned, for these gurus who are responsible for the poor state of the nation's finances to suggest now that the answer is to dig even deeper into the pockets of teachers, gardaí, nurses, civil servants and other PAYE workers. I am waiting for somebody to make that argument and they had better tie me to my seat before it happens. I am not prepared to listen to that kind of balderdash anymore.</P>
    <P>Who are the people who are going to suffer most next year if the public finances run out of kilter? Who are the people who are going to have to pick up the pieces? The Minister and I are aware of what has happened over the last few years to the public finances and of the medium-term and long term objectives which were set. We are aware of the way the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is part of a longer ten year programme to set the economy right. It is a long term objective to get the debt-GNP ratio to below 70 per cent. It is a medium-term objective to get that ratio, by 1993-94, down towards 100 per cent. That is being achieved. I re-emphasise that despite all the problems which have been outlined to us over the past couple of weeks, that will still be achieved. Did anyone see any of these economists jump up and down when the latest figures for the third quarter of exports showed them to be far better than the same gurus had predicted in June?</P>
    <P>Where are we going now? I have heard nobody in the past three weeks say that we will have zero or one per cent economic growth this year. The most negative forecast of economic growth over the last month has, extraordinarily enough, come from that much beleaguered man, An Taoiseach, who in the course of one of <Col N="79" /> his recent discussions forecast economic growth of marginally over one per cent this year. It could well reach two per cent this year by the time all the fourth figures are in. There are few stockbrokers and economists who will now give odds against its reaching 1.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the Minister for Finance said he expected a 2.25 per cent growth. By the middle of the year the gloom and doom merchants have got the country into its present difficulties told us there would be zero growth this year. That is inaccurate. The Department of Finance on 16 August projected economic growth of 1.25 per cent to which the Minister for Finance is still holding. That was before the third quarter figures came in, which are better than expected and before we received indications from the UK that the recession was over. This recession is going to prove to be the shortest post-war recession of all.</P>
    <P>We have been subject to self-fulfilling prophecies of gloom and doom merchants who know nothing about this country and who have never been able to make a proper judgment. They were the people who said Knock Airport could not exist; I keep a list at home of what these people say. They should all be turned into accountants and given profit and loss sums to spend their lives at because they know nothing about the first basis of a sound economy, which is a healthy well-educated population. It never enters any of their equations and they can never project beyond their present experience.</P>
    <P>In 1989 the only economists to project a drop in the rate of emigration were those of the ESRI. Their forecast came out in June 1989. We were not in business much at that time but I made reference to it then in the House. The ESRI's medium term report costs about £19 which means nobody buys it. It has only 20 or 30 pages in it and it comes with an executive summary which made no reference to this forecast so it was not reported and probably went unknown. I raised this point many times and got nobody to agree but I am proven to have been right. They are accused of being the optimistic economic <Col N="80" /> forecasters in this country but they have been proved right time and time again and their current figures are also interesting.</P>
    <P>Another figure which is better than expected at budget time is the price of oil. Remember the debate on the price of oil in the late eighties, when it was thought that everything would depend on the price of a barrel of oil?</P>
    <P>The inflation rate is well within the range forecast. Inflation is down to around three per cent and will remain there. There has been restraint in public borrowing and a reduction in the debt/GNP ratio. The Exchequer borrowing requirement is a matter of discussion at the moment but the forecast this week from NCB stockbrokers that the Government could handle a three per cent Exchequer borrowing requirement for 1992 would allow the Government to implement all the proposals in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>The ESRI forecast in the summer of 1991 was for two per cent economic growth. The August forecast of 1.25 per cent came from the Department of Finance. The Central Bank in autumn said somewhere between a half and one per cent and the Taoiseach, in his latest forecast, is talking about between one and 1.25 per cent growth. I am prepared to wager money that it will be closer to 1.5 per cent than to one per cent by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The figures for the balance of payments and particularly for exports are better than expected and are continuing to improve despite all the difficulties experienced in other countries. It is worth noticing that we are well within our projections regarding our main markets, the US and the UK, though not doing as well with Germany, our second European market, as we would like. Nevertheless we are holding our own there.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> proposals at this stage is essential for industrial peace, for the maintenance of credibility in the negotiating process and for the welfare of all those in health, <Col N="81" /> education and other social services who are depending on pay awards contained in it, not to mention the huge group of workers who are dependent on its minimal proposals to increase their incomes.</P>
    <P>While all these people have been talking about renegotiation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> one group have been very quiet and they are the Federation of Irish Employers. They have said nothing about renegotiation because they could not afford to renegotiate. Any renegotiation would cost them an awful lot of money, given the kind of money that the financial services are making at the moment. They will not be shouting for it.</P>
    <P>The question of industrial peace is not to be underestimated at this stage. Trade union leaders around this country went to their members earlier this year and put forward a set of proposals formulated under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Whatever people might think about it at this stage, it was not an easy task to go to each doubting Thomas in the trade union movement and to say that this was the best deal that could be negotiated with the best interests of the country at heart among a consensus of trade unions, farmers, Government, employers and everyone else. It required a compromise at all levels and because of this I believe we should accept it. An alternative would mean going back to those people who stood up at meetings all around the country and said it should be opposed because it would never be accomplished, that one cannot depend on a Fianna Fáil Government or on a Coalition Government. It would be necessary to say to those people that the Government are now trying to welsh on their committment to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> This development would set back for years the process of negotiation, agreement and of national consensus from which there would be no recovery. Committments given under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will have to be honoured.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> I have a number of points to make in the area closest to my own heart, the area of education. There are certain commitments under that heading, not least the commitment to set up a proper caretaker service, an ancillary staff service and school secretaries, all for primary schools. That is an aspect of the proposals in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which must be addressed. People from all parts of the country will be aware of this and many schools are dependant on it. There is a proposal that the capitation grant for primary schools be increased by £30 per pupil. That is a very paltry increase in terms of what it costs to run a school and anybody who has the slightest connection with a school will know that. Nevertheless it is clearly a move in the right direction. Any attempt to pull back on the commitments in education is going to cause a huge problem, particularly the commitments to reduce class size and to set up a programme of caretakers and clerk typing services for schools.</P>
    <P>The commitment under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> for extra jobs in the remedial, disadvantaged field must be delivered. There is no question of welshing on these commitments. There is no place on any agenda for renegotiation. People are dependent on Government for this money. I finish with the words of the Minister for Finance in the budget of 1991 when he said about the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress:</i></P>
    <P>It is the initial Government contribution to a decade-long partnership for linked economic and social progress... With colder international breezes already blowing</P>
    <P>&mdash; and these words are going to haunt the Minister &mdash;</P>
    <P>1991 is going to be the true test of our perseverence on fiscal policy. Be assured, the Government will not fail that test.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> Your first test is to honour the commitments which we all signed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in 1991. Let us see it delivered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. We are in severe danger in this country from something that used to be thrown at those of us who came from anywhere to the left of centre: we are in danger of being tied up in a network of ideological rigidities foisted upon us by individuals who are not elected, but implemented by Governments who, because of their lack of a vision of their own, or a lack of a belief in their own version, parrot the quite idiotic recitation of a number of these ideologues in the Irish private sector. I am amazed at what they can get away with. Let me give a very simple example off the top of my head.</P>
      <P>They have persuaded many people that the public sector pay increases next year are going to cost the State £340 million. That figure has been produced and thrown around so often. Do public servants pay no income tax? If they do, where does the public service income tax go? It goes back into the coffers of the State. When you consider that these are all wage increases, that many public servants also have a substantial deduction to pay for a contributory pension and on top of that, many of them also pay some level, however small, of PRSI, it is not unreasonable to suggest that at least half of that £340 million will come straight back into the coffers of the State. If the individuáls who get this pay increase then choose to spend their money, which they most likely will do unless they are utterly impoverished, and spend some of it on goods that attract a rate of VAT of between 12 per cent and 21 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>They certainly will not send it off to tax shelters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not be able to afford to pay the people to advise them <Col N="84" /> about tax shelters. First, you have to be able to pay the person who is advising you and you have also to know how to pay him in a way that will enable him to avoid paying income tax on what you pay him. This is the golden circle that this Government, and indeed to a certain extent the previous Government, encouraged. It was a magnificent little circle which until recently most people in this country thought was only a concoction of extreme left-wingers.</P>
      <P>The biggest shock for people in this country has been to discover the degree to which greed has taken hold on a scale that nobody imagined. I am not talking, incidentally, about necessarily illegal acts. I am talking about the extent to which our system facilitates greed on a scale that most people could never imagine, where people who are being paid in excess of £50,000 and £60,000 a year apparently believe they should be entitled to make a million, for reasons that are based on their image of themselves.</P>
      <P>Into this miasma of greed insert the new rigid doctrinaire orthodoxy which proclaims that if things are going well you must reduce public expenditure; if things are going badly you must reduce public expenditure; if things are standing still you must reduce public expenditure and, if you must reduce public expenditure, you must reduce it at the expense of those who are employed in the public sector. You must not, for instance, suggest even gently, to the Central Bank that its interest rate policy is increasingly looking both daft and eccentric in the context of western Europe. You must not suggest that the level of interest they charge, which in turn determines the level of interest the banks charge, is perhaps pushing up the cost of borrowing to an extent that is ripping off a large sum of money from the State which is a major debtor to the Irish banking system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be worth wondering, for instance, if the same people who say the State cannot afford to pay public service pay increases would say the State cannot afford to pay the extra interest should the Central Bank, in one of its more eccentric <Col N="85" /> moments, decide to push up Irish interest rates again. Would they say, &ldquo;the State cannot pay, the State should not pay&rdquo;? No, they would not. Apparently the banking system is immune from this. You could not upset the banking system by suggesting that the banks should actually accept a reduction in the interest on the safe, guaranteed national debt or indeed that small businesses should accept a reduction. That, of course, would offend the orthodoxy. There is only one target, namely, the public service and those who depend on the public purse, the recipients of social welfare.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the House of one of the high priests of orthodoxy whom I shall not name because it is not in the tradition of this House to name somebody who, theoretically at least, cannot defend himself. The same individual has done a hell of a job defending himself over the years. He decided to show us that there was no poverty in the country and produced comparative statistics. He went through the numbers of television sets, phones and so on per thousand of the population. He went on to say that unemployed people had more than the population at large and that he had proved it. What he forgot to tell us is that he looked at people in receipt of unemployment benefit. By definition, people in receipt of unemployment benefit have been at work relatively recently whereas the population at large incorporates all of those on unemployment assistance, the elderly and those in rural and urban poverty. He picked a selective group among the unemployed, those who, by definition, are relatively well off, having worked in the recent past, and he said something.</P>
    <P>That is not economics, that is an ideological obsession with a particular view of the world, masquerading as a science. The tragedy is not that people like him have opinions like that but that Governments believe them.</P>
    <P>That is what led us into the situation where we have been told that one aspect of public expenditure is causing our problems. A correspondent on RTE said on a news programme in the past ten days that the problem was public sector pay. <Col N="86" /> The problem is not public sector pay, partly because the problem does not exist. I was glad to see one economist at least, at the annual junket to Kenmare, announce that he did not think the Government should be panicked into significant reductions in public expenditure because the present problems were not permanent and an excessive reduction in public expenditure might actually precipitate us into a recession which would not be created by either the public service pay deal or external forces but by ourselves. Let us not forget that.</P>
    <P>It is possible for public policy not just to protect the public finances but for the wrong kind of public policy to cause a recession when no recession was going to occur. It happened across the water. It happened disastrously, in the early eighties and again towards the end of the eighties where minor perfurbations were precipitated into disasters by idiotically doctrinaire Government policies. I had counsellled the Government not to allow themselves to be stampeded into a corner, particularly by the ideological rigidities of the minority partner. They have been stampeded a heck of a long way already.</P>
    <P>On the subject of public sector pay a number of facts should be put on the record. People are very good at quoting averages. I want to quote something. There are 6,000 clerical assistants in the public service and many more in health boards and local authorities. In the public service, 83 per cent of those are women and their pay scale ranges from £137 a week to £205 a week. Whose image of luxury is that? Those who pronounce about the luxuries of public service pay usually do so from a cushy job in academic life paid for by the taxpayer. Those people would not know how to live on £205 a week and would regard it as absolute penury. There are 3,000 clerical officers in the public service whose maximum gross income is £250 a week. There are 800 staff officers whose maximum salary is £16,000 a year.</P>
    <P>Let me quote some more from <i>Eolaire an Stáit.</i> The wage rate for a messenger in the general public service ranges from <Col N="87" /> £178 to £193 a week. That is the wage for many a person who is supporting a family. The wage rate for a head messenger is £225 a week. The wage rate for an usher in this House ranges from £193 to £228 a week. I invite all those sitting in comfortable restaurants, probably on somebody else's expense account, who are pronouncing on public service pay to look those people in the eye and tell them they are too well paid and must make sacrifices yet again for some mythological thing called the national interest. Apparently only those who work in ordinary jobs must consider this national interest. Those who work in position of high finance must consider the dictates of the market. I understand the market perfectly well. If I went down to the international financial services centre and told people that in the national interest they should not export capital out of this country because interest rates are a half per cent higher in Germany than they are here, they would all fall around laughing and tell me how unrealistic I was. Apparently, it is acceptable to tell people who live in penury that they must act in the national interest. In other areas we must be realistic.</P>
    <P>If we are to be realistic and if we are to deal with problems, then perhaps those who want realism would accept the following dose of reality. About ten or 12 years ago a Government abolished child allowances for income tax. They have now been restored under very constrained conditions and what has been done is welcome. A year before they thought of poor workers on PAYE the present. Minister for Finance reintroduced child allowances for one very deprived section of the community about whom he was very concerned. They were people who were earning incomes in excess of £26,000 a year and who were liable to pay residential property tax on their small houses worth at least £80,000. The Government reintroduced child allowances for them and nobody suggested we could not afford that. They were obviously very deserving people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="88" /> Then we got the real farce, the report of the Revenue Commissioners which admits that in 1988-89 the total number of self-employed people who declared an income in excess of £25,000 amounted to less than 4,000 out of a total number of 118,000. This is declared income. I do not understand where they get these figures. An air of unreality exists in our tax enforcement. Anyone walking around the centre of this city cannot tell me there are only 4,000 people in a whole country who can afford to dine in expensive restaurants, who can afford to drive expensive cars. Who is spending the money on expensive cars and expensive restaurants, on all the luxury items that sell <i>The Irish Times</i> and sell advertising in the <i>The Irish Times</i>? 4,000 people. Who is codding whom? That is the reality. If people want to sort out what I believe to be a temporary hiccup in the public finances then they can do it by making sure that those who earn the vast incomes pay the income tax they should pay on those vast incomes. The first thing to do before getting them to pay is to try to identify the incomes. This report shows not that the Revenue Commissioners are not doing their job as well as they are allowed but that they are prevented by law and by inadequate staffing to do the job they want to do. The Revenue Commissioners do their job. In fact the Revenue Commissioners, apparently, can be very helpful if a senior official of a finance house wants to get something passed through very quickly.</P>
    <P>I, for one, do not believe we are in a crisis, but those who worry about the public finances should look to those who can afford to pay and get off the backs of the public servants, most of whom are far from well paid and many of whom have suffered quite dramatically in their generosity to try to help the State over the past four years.</P>

    <P>agrees that all objectives of the Programme must have regard to its overriding public finance objectives if the beneficial results in growth, employment and social equity are to be attained; and</P>
    <P>accordingly, supports</P>
    <P>&mdash;the approach being adopted by the Government in relation to the particular difficulties which have emerged for the Exchequer whereby discussions on the issues involved have commenced with the social partners under the aegis of the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress;</i> and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" />&mdash;the consensus process inherent in this approach and in relation to the Programme generally.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to go back before moving forward and concern myself momentarily with the 1982-87 Government when total employment fell by 60,000 and the national debt doubled. Fianna Fáil came into office in 1987 and, basically, had to take the economy by the scruff of the neck.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to give cognisance to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, what it set out to achieve, actually achieved and what happened along the line under that programme.</P>
      <P>Each of us listening to the commentators must acknowledge that at that time we had a Government who knew where they were going, who had the ability to take tough decisions, who were not afraid of marches or of the Opposition and did not give in to lobby groups. They continued with a programme they set themselves, believed in and were absolutely certain was in the national interest and the net result was that confidence was, at last, restored to the economy. Up to 1990 we had a sustained growth in the economy of an average of 4.5 per cent per year. The reason for that was the confidence which meant that there was a far greater investment in our economy and production and output grew. There was, in my view and in the view of all the commentators, a healthy respect for a Government who were willing to dish out the medicine on the basis that at the end of the day it would be in the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 1990 the public finances were transformed. The borrowing requirement spelled out by Senator O'Toole fell from 12.5 per cent to 2 per cent of GNP in 1990. The current budget deficit fell from 8.3 per cent to 0.7 per cent of GNP. Total Government expenditure was reduced from 55 per cent of GNP to 40 per cent and revenue fell from 40 per cent to 36.6 per cent in 1990. Many sacrifices <Col N="91" /> were demanded of Irish society at that time and the community responded generously in the national interest in the knowledge and hope that all would be well at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>This year, at the time of the budget, the Minister for Finance forecast a target growth of 2.25 per cent. At that time, that was in line with all of the relevant EC and other forecasts. The Minister for Finance specifically stated &mdash; and this was reiterated by the Taoiseach &mdash; that at the time of framing the budget it was extremely difficult to do so given the uncertain international background and, accordingly, in January, we had a scaling down of the estimates. A number of events took place which had not been anticipated. For instance, there was the Gulf War and a very definite recession in the UK and in the US. Our economy is a market-led economy and when a recession occurs in two countries which account for half of our exports obviously that will have a catastrophic effect. In addition, emigration ceased and many of our emigrants returned putting an immediate pressure on expenditure for social welfare. This upset Government targets. Given those circumstances, it could be asked, what the Government did. In July, the Government cut public expenditure by a further £1 million. But even with that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to stress that in spite of all of this we have one of the lowest deficits in the Community. Despite the lower growth rate the share of employment has remained quite stable. That means the basic economy is sound. Our inflation rate, interest rate and balance of payments have all been kept under control. As an economy, we are in a position to benefit when there is growth in international trade but in the coming year, unfortunately, the predictions are that this growth in international trade is not going to be as spectacular as we had hoped it would be.</P>
      <P>In dealing with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> neither Senator O'Toole nor Senator Ryan mentioned the foundation on which it was based. That programme was based on an average growth over the years of 1991-94 of 3 per cent. It is generally accepted now that these growth rates will not be achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>That, of necessity, means that we must have further discussions with the social partners. I concur with many of the statements by Senator O'Toole and Senator Ryan. I have no time for tax shelters and tax evasion. I am all for closing off loopholes. I believe those people who defraud our economy should be taken to court and have the rigours of the law applied to them. We have established a series of inquiries to get at the facts and sort out these people if they have committed misdemeanours.</P>
      <P>In terms of the private sector, when the mechanism for the economy to grow was put in place, when profits rose, the private sector did not plough back as much money as they could have done to create jobs. In considering tax evasion and tax avoidance we must ask what does it all amount to in terms of money? Does it involve a loss to the economy of £100 million, £200 million, £300 million or £400 million? I am in no position to put any figure on that and I do not think anybody else is either. The likelihood is that it certainly would not be so significant in overall economic terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, therefore, found it necessary to have further discussions with the social partners, to put before them the problems facing the Government and to find a ready solution that was in the national interest. The last thing anyone needs is a relapse in the management of the economy with sectional interests <Col N="94" /> rather than the national interest gaining strength. Senator O'Toole is right in saying that it is in everybody's interest that the social partners come together and reach an agreement.</P>
    <P>The overall concern of the Government is to ease the burden of taxation and, at the same time, bring about real tax reform which will lead to economic growth, job creation and social equity. In examining the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Minister is faced with an 8.5 per cent increase in public spending and an inflation rate of 3 per cent. This means that in 1992 the Minister must find £110 million for general pay agreements and £95 million for special pay agreements. The Minister also faces the possibility of a further increase in unemployment which will have to be met by further social welfare payments. However, I acknowledge that the Taoiseach has established an employment task force and, again, this is not before time.</P>
    <P>I understand that, as a member of a trade union, Senator O'Toole wants a commitment to payment of all the increases negotiated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> I am a member of a teachers' union and my fellow members are also looking for full payment as are the nurses and everybody else in the public sector. I exhort the Minister to pay those increases but where will the money come from? If we do not cut back somewhere along the line where will the money for those increases come from? The health boards say they cannot cut back any further. Senator O'Toole wants a caretaking service, secretarial assistants employed and the pupil teacher ratio reduced. They are all laudable requests in their own right and good for education right across the board.</P>
    <P>We have to run this economy and we have to face up to our responsibilities. I have every confidence that when the Taoiseach and his Minister meet the social partners they will come up with a solution to this problem that is in the national interest.</P>

      <P>Over the years my party <Col N="95" /> have invested heavily, in political terms, in trying to ensure a reasonable outcome for Fine Gael is budgetary strategy &mdash; I am referring to the Tallaght Strategy. We are not afraid to support measures, even when they may be politically unpopular from our party's point of view and perceived to be unpopular by the public, if we feel those measures are in the long term interest of our country and particularly of those who will take over the reins from us in the various sectors. However, there are major problems facing the country now, particularly in relation to renegotiation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> There is a huge price to be paid for industrial peace.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the credibility of the negotiating process. We will take an enormous hammering if we now have to turn around and say to those people in the ICTU, the FIE, CII, the IFA, the ICMSA, ICOS and Macra na Feirme who agreed the programme that circumstances have now changed and we are sorry we cannot stick by it. It goes back a little further than the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> itself; the rot set in at the time of the budget this year. We could go back to 1977 but we will stay with this year. The basic tenets on which this year's budget was based were inaccurate &mdash; I could use much stronger language but it might not be appropriate here. I am not sure on what advice the Minister for Finance presented the budget but it was patently obvious then, as it is now, that his predictions and proposals in terms of the macro-economic indicators for the year on which he was basing the budget were way out of line.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It sometimes hurts to listen. Before the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> went off the rails it was obvious that this year's budgetary strategy was going to go off the rails and it has. It is not only tragic for Fianna Fáil and for the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, who must take the ultimate responsibility even though it will fall on the entire Cabinet, but it is tragic for all of us particularly those of us in Fine Gael, in the other parties and for all who invested heavily, in political terms, to support what was right for the country.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael were the only party that actually opposed the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> when it was voted on in the Houses. We opposed it because we felt it was not possible for it to work. It was based on false premises, false figures and on a bouyancy that would not materialise. It was based on macro-economic indicators that flew in the face of the best advice available to the Minister and his team when setting it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as it has been agreed by a majority vote of these Houses there is an onus on us to support it. If we turn around after a few short months and say that we know there was collective bargaining and that we agreed certain things but we just cannot honour those agreements, the whole democratic process will be brought into disrepute and the implications of that are horrific. It will be more of the legacy of C.J. Haughey and it will diminish all of us. We will all be tarred to some extent if this is the way the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> proceeds. If we break the agreement now we will increase <Col N="97" /> the cynicism existing about the political process. It will be a bonus for anarchy and for those who have no faith in the constitutional politics of this country. That would be an enormous tragedy. Collective bargaining in itself was a great achievement when we think back to the multi-union days of industrial chaos. The whole process of collective bargaining was introduced against a background of socialist ideology. It was an enormous achievement to get the union leaders to accept collective bargaining from basically capitalist Governments over the years.</P>
    <P>We owe it to those on the dole queues, to employees, to the public and Civil Service and to those who want to create more jobs, to be honourable and to stand by agreement we enter into but how we can do that, having entered into an agreement that we patently cannot afford to maintain, I do not know. I hope the Minister is in a position to get better advice, or at least to listen to his advisers, when he tries to undo some of the damage he did when he entered into this agreement. We cannot take the special pay agreements on their own and say they must be renegotiated. There is no question of us fingering the lower paid in the public and Civil Service and expect them to take the rap for the incompetence the Government showed in terms of the negotiation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> That is totally unacceptable and Fine Gael will not agree to it.</P>
    <P>We are not told where the cutbacks will be made. There is a large chapter on social reform in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> It deals with many areas, all of which are crying for attention and which have been raised in this House over the years &mdash; the social insurance base, child income support, occupational pensions and sick pay, all the health area. We could each spend an hour tonight giving our version of the two-tier health system, where those with money can have immediate access to treatment if they need it while those who depend on the public health system must take their place in the queue. Let us <Col N="98" /> forget about proper adult dental treatment for the public sector and about orthodontic services for our children, as they virtually do not exist.</P>
    <P>Will the health sector lose out in the renegotiation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>? Will the physically disabled lose out? Will the mentally handicapped lose out? Will our psychiatric services lose out again? In regard to the education sector will the TUI, the ASTI and the INTO now be told: &ldquo;I am sorry the promises entered into cannot be fulfilled&rdquo;? Will the agreements entered into in relation to the PTR, the primary and second level system remedial teachers, vice-principals and the sixth year in secondary school, all go by the board? Is that what we are to assume? Was peace bought with all those unions? I will not use the expression &ldquo;con job&rdquo; as it is not very parliamentary &mdash; but whatever the parliamentary expression is to imply what I am trying to say &mdash; did we try to fob off those unions and buy their peace knowing in our hearts and souls that we would never be able to honour the agreement entered into?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Ministers involved in negotiating the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, and, indeed, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, must have known that as their budgetary predictions were off the rails they would not be able to honour the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> They stand further indicted because of that double blow to the people and to the economy this year.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in itself and the process under which it was negotiated is, perhaps, questionable. There was collective bargaining and negotiation with the social partners but the fact that all, except the Government parties, in this House were excluded from debating and negotiating this programme adds to what we have been referring to as the democratic deficit. I believe in and my party support democratic discussion and thorough detailing of the issues to be agreed in <Col N="99" /> these Houses rather than undermine the Houses of the Oireachtas and bring it before us to be voted on, yes or no. There was no way it could have been amended or that there could have been a further input into any of its sections by the Houses of the Oireachtas. Large sections of the democratically elected people of this country were precluded from having a say in the social programme particularly and even in relation to tax reform and other issues of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that might have been in operation here for many years. The fact that six short months later we are back negotiating it indicates that it was not worth the paper it was written on initially.</P>
    <P>A most important point is the fact that women will be hardest hit if the agreements entered into in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in relation to the public sector generally are not honoured. As has been said here this evening, 83 per cent of the public sector are women and they are among the lowest paid workers in the public and civil service. There are males on the same low scales but the majority on those scales are women. Even with all the talk about social equality, the legislation on equality that has passed through these Houses and the many words that are tripped off the lips of politicians from all sides, women still have not been able to catch up and get equal pay for equal work in the various grades. Women will be the big losers if the special pay agreements and the public service pay agreements are not honoured as, apparently, is the Government's intention.</P>
    <P>We have a great deal of catching up to do in order to be ready to take an equal place among the Twelve on 1 January 1993. I do not want us to enter into interminable debates on derogation but we should face up to what has to be done and be prepared. The Government have, to a large extent, ignored the importance of this but there are major difficulties we have to face particularly in relation to tax reform. Some of them are referred to in this document but am I to assume that <Col N="100" /> they too are gone and that we will not be able to face the other 11 members of the European Community in January 1993 having properly prepared and laid the groundwork?</P>
    <P>In relation to tax, a widening of the tax bands is of the most immediate interest, particularly to the lower paid and to those with large families. We would all love to have 25 per cent and 44 per cent tax rates but the bands need to be widened. A total of 80 to 85 per cent of people are still paying the standard rate of tax because their incomes only justify that rate. As people go up the pay scale they reach the higher rates of tax too quickly and that hurts more than the tax rate itself. That is not being tackled.</P>
    <P>Are all the other empty promises that were made in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> also gone? Our commitment to overseas development aid is very dear to the Seanad because Members from all sides raise this issue regularly. Again, this is aspirational; of course, we would all like to see the ODA target of 0.7 per cent of GNP being reached but we are not told when that may happen or by what increments each year. Are we to assume that there will be the same paltry attitude towards ODA in next year's budget as we have had from the Government this year? Is that their commitment to the Third World and particularly to the African Continent which is experiencing such major famine problems at the moment?</P>
    <P>I was amused to hear the last speaker blame the Gulf War and the recession in the UK and the US for having to renegotiate the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> That is more or less what he said. The Gulf War was up and running 12 months ago last August, <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was completed this spring.</P>

      <P>I think so, perhaps the postal strike started earlier down there. How lame can we be in trying to justify an appalling decision and an even worse <Col N="101" /> one now to renegotiate? It was bad enough to fool various sectors into letting them think that collective bargaining was just that, collective agreement which would be honoured but it is much worse now to turn around and say: &ldquo;Sorry, we may be the democratically elected politicians but we are not going to honour this agreement&rdquo;. Our word is worth nothing because, effectively, that is the message the Taoiseach will give to all those depending on the health services, the education system, housing from local government and the vast array of other areas that were promised help under <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> His message will be: &ldquo;Sorry, our word is worth nothing, I have changed my mind, we got it wrong; Albert's figures in the budget were wrong and we will have to have another look at it&rdquo;. We cannot take the pay issue alone. If it must be looked at again, it must be looked at fairly and we must protect the lower paid public servants, particularly the women who have not had equal treatment over the years.</P>

      <P>That was a very amusing contribution from Senator Doyle but then where economics are concerned one has become used to amusing contributions from that side of the House. I could not but be reminded of that old Dickens story about Scrooge. He hated Christmas; in fact he got to the stage where he hated everything and hated everybody and he used to say &ldquo;Christmas bah&rdquo;; it is like the <i>&ldquo;Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> bah&rdquo;. Everything as far as the Opposition are concerned and in regard to what this Government have been doing on the economic front is &ldquo;bah&rdquo;. I would like to assure Senator Doyle that whatever about the difficulties that the economy of this country may be faced with, Fianna Fáil have taken a very responsible attitude in relation to the commitments what were entered into under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a film doing the round at the moment called &ldquo;The Commitments&rdquo; and I could not help but think about that as <Col N="102" /> I was listening to Senator Doyle. I do not want to single her out particularly. Indeed, that seems to be the trend of the contributions from the other side whenever matters economic come to the fore in this House. I seem to remember £9.60 being a commitment at one time; it was to do with tax and tax formed a great part of Senator Doyle's contribution. I seem to remember a promise of fiscal rectitude in 1982 which doubled our national debt. I remember when the figure for our gross national product zoomed to something like 126 per cent. It is now down to around 113 per cent and, in fact, the Government's objective is to bring it down to 100 per cent and well below that figure. That will bring it in line with many of the member states of the EC and will put us in a much stronger position in relation to economic and political union. I do not believe that the negotiations entered into and the commitments made are not being honoured. In fact, there is an old cliché which says &ldquo;lies, damn lies and statistics&rdquo; and I suppose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator would stay with the drift of my argument she might understand more clearly what I am attempting to say. There is a line, or a paragraph in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in relation to the economic situation and the Taoiseach spelled that out when he was reluctant to use the word &ldquo;renegotiate&rdquo;. He said there was a mechanism in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to take account of the prevailing budgetary and economic situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well to disregard the Gulf War, the economic realities such as the recession in Britain which is the worst in decades and the recession in the United States which is one of the worst in the last decade but the reality is that we are an open economy. We depend to a great extent on the strength of the economies of our trading partners. In addition to the difficulties in the USA and in the UK <Col N="103" /> the reunification of Germany took place before the Gulf War. The economic difficulties that Germany &mdash; one of our major trading partners &mdash; encountered as a result of reunification were known before the Gulf War.

      <P>Unfortunately, I thought I might have got in a little earlier as I would have been able to correct some of the misrepresentations she has been rambling on about the past 20 minutes or so. It is unfortunate that I have only a short time at my disposal in which to outline some of the real economic facts of life. While economists differ and I would not be among their greatest admirers &mdash; this economy is doing relatively well. People in this country, particularly those in Opposition have a myopic view that somehow our problems are unique. The fact that we are not an island in the real sense but part of a greater economy, particularly the European economy, was disregarded by Senator Doyle. She said it has nothing to do with the argument. It has everything to do with the argument. It might be of interest to the Senator that not only did this Government take corrective action in July but the other economies in central Europe &mdash; Germany, France, Italy &mdash; were all obliged to introduce corrective packages over the past couple of months because of the downturn in the world <Col N="104" /> economy. If the Senator had been following the economic press in the past few weeks she would know that even the most wealthy of nations, the G7 group of nations, have acknowledged that there is a real problem in the world economy. Why will the Senator not acknowledge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is obvious that my contribution is falling on deaf ears because I have been attempting to state unequivocally that the attitude adopted by this Government has been a responsible one. They would have been irresponsible, considering the developments in the world economy over the past few months if they had not tried to renegotiate the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The state of the economy was ignored to an appalling extent during the administration of which Senator Doyle was a member. The Senator can argue about how it started but we are talking about the Senator's party when they were in Government, being put in with a mandate to take corrective action in regard to the economy. What were we left with? The Senator cannot point the finger at the Government at this stage if she looks at the record between 1987 to the early part of this year. Economists still disagree on a weekly basis over the growth rate for this economy during <Col N="105" /> 1991. It is hopping about between 0.05 and 0.125 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I know that. At the end of the day we will all agree that the breakthrough that followed from the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and continued by the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was significant to the extent that it is a blueprint for the next decade and I have every reason to believe it will work, with the goodwill of the social partners as well as the Government. It might not be beyond the bounds of possibility, as we are living in a democracy, that Senator Doyle could be on this side of the House in a few years time and that I will be on the other side having the same argument, except that she will be defending what I am defending, etc. However, both of us realise that this programme is a blueprint for our future prosperity and it should be given the opportunity to work. It is being given the opportunity to work by the social partners who have readily acknowledged that the economy is in difficulty and who have readily sat down with the Government to look at the various aspects of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and to come up with a fair and <Col N="106" /> equitable formula to protect the least well off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise one fundamental issue in relation to job creation. Over the last 12 months I have been involved with various FÁS projects in County Leitrim. They say you learn something new every day and I will readily admit that in this instance I learned what many knew already, but I still found it surprising. A FÁS project which had done a great deal to enhance the local community in Drumshanbo lasted its obligatory 12 months. It was then terminated despite the fact that the sponsors of the project who were a local community group had sufficient work on hands to continue with the important work of community enhancement. In fact, because of the work carried out by the FÁS group of five excellent workers the town of Drumshanbo increased its marking rate in this year's Tidy Towns Competition by five, which is quite exceptional.</P>
      <P>I do not want to sound parochial in the context of macro-economics but on a particular Friday evening five workers were laid off because of the termination of the FÁS project. Because they were long-term unemployed they want back on the dole the following Monday. For a 12 month period the taxpayer was paying five people to carry out important environmental work and then on a particular day they were put back on the dole, to sit at home, because there was no other alternative for them in the area in which I live, drawing the same money literally that you and I as taxpayers were paying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an anomaly in the whole FÁS structure that needs to be addressed where people were prepared to work for the good of the community rather <Col N="108" /> than to sit at home, even though, as I am sure Senator O'Toole and Senator Costello are aware, they were being deprived of the privileges of the long term unemployed by going on a FÁS project; they were being denied the Christmas bonus, they were being denied stamps, they were being denied all the privileges of the long term unemployed. Despite all of that, these people &mdash; and I am sure I am speaking for many other groups and individuals around the country &mdash; were quite prepared to work as a matter of dignity rather than just for money. Yet they find themselves sitting at home because there is no alternative.</P>
    <P>I know there is a task force on job creation. I would hope the Minister with us this evening might, perhaps, when he is putting forward the various contributions that have been made here, extract just that small little codicil that I have added to the overall macro-economic view as I see it, and ask that the FÁS schemes be looked at in order to maximise, on the one hand, the job potential of the workforce and, on the other, that where there is a financial burden on the taxpayer, as there undoubtedly is as a result of increased unemployment, perhaps that financial burden could be minimised by an equal spreading of the available unemployment money so that the State would get some value rather than having people sitting at home who want to work, are not able to, but are still drawing State money.</P>
    <P>I want to end on that because it is something that has been a source of great irritation not only to me but to others. I know that the trade union movement has been making various representations to the Government through the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> on FÁS and related issues. I am also very much aware that the Government's priority is job creation, despite what their most severe critics may say. We are all concerned &mdash; in fact &ldquo;concerned&rdquo; is no longer an acceptable word &mdash; we are all appalled at the unemployment situation in this country. I know that the Government of which I am proud to be a part of and to support, are anxious to diminish <Col N="109" /> and hopefully at some stage in the future eliminate this awful unemployment problem. But certainly in the area of FÁS I think something should be done to allow people to work if they are prepared to work. Those FÁS schemes for which they are eligible and which are available should be continued and extended. I am sure that the Minister would agree that it would be far better to have somebody out doing something in the interests of service to the community drawing State money than having them sitting at home drawing State money.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Costello that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter: the need for the Minister for Justice to bring forward his proposals for remedying the miscarriage of justice in the Nicky Kelly case with a view to recommending a Presidential pardon. I welcome the Minister of State to the house and I call on Senator Costello to address his motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for having this as the first motion of the new session on the Adjournment. I think it is most appropriate. New evidence has come to light and it augurs well for this session that we are addressing a matter of immediate and urgent concern at the very beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter of the motion refers to an unfortunate incident that occurred in Sallins in March 1976 when the mail train to Cork was robbed. That took place 15 years ago and immediately afterwards the usual suspects, as a book written about <Col N="110" /> the event described, were rounded up by 60 to 70 members of the Garda. They amounted to about 40 to 50 people. They were interrogated and some of them were charged, duly convicted and ended up in prison. I would like to describe for a moment the context in which all of this happened. It is not exactly the context of 1991.</P>
    <P>I would like you to take your minds back 15 years ago to the situation that existed. There was a perception at the time that there was a threat to the very existence of the State and very specific powers, if not introduced, were certainly being implemented. In the first instance the Offences Against the State Act was used very widely. That was a special piece of legislation that was introduced originally in 1939 before the outbreak of World War II. It has been used in an ordinary context as well as an extraordinary or emergency context in the years since, and particularly when it was reintroduced after 1972. This allowed suspects to be held for 24 hours and that to be increased to 48 hours on the word of a superintendent. Indeed, shortly after this event in early 1977 the 48 hours was increased to seven days' detention when we had the ironic situation that the emergency that existed since 1939 had to be rescinded to allow a new emergency to be declared which allowed special detention powers of seven days to be introduced.</P>
    <P>That, in a sense, give you the flavour of what was happening at the time. In addition, the police operated what is known as a &ldquo;heavy gang&rdquo;. It is not just myself who is saying that here in the privilege of the House; it is well acknowledged and recognised. The previous general secretary of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, Derek Nally, is on record in 1977, and again in 1989, as saying categorically that a heavy gang existed and was in a position to and did in fact give names of the heavy gang to the then Taoiseach in early 1977. That was a special force of gardaí who had special functions and that was largely to elicit confessions from suspects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> Thirdly, we had the Special Criminal Court. The ordinary jury courts were not thought competent to deal with offences that were regarded as offences against the State or that were indeed serious offences. This was an extension of the use of the courts to cover matters that might not be of a political nature strictly but matters of a serious nature. Of course, these were courts without juries. That was the court that was used in this instance.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, while the laws of evidence existed in the same fashion they operated in a different fashion. At that time it was not unusual that matters that were not supported by further corrobarative evidence other than a confession by the individual suspect were allowed to be sufficient to obtain a conviction and of course that has since been found to be very unsafe grounds for a conviction. In the case of Nicky Kelly there were no fingerprint evidence, there was no forensic evidence, there was no identification that he had been involved.</P>
    <P>Finally, and fifthly, in terms of legal representation, there were exceedingly difficult obstacles placed in the way of legal advisers being present either during the questioning or later after the referral of the suspects into custody after they were taken to a special sitting of the District Court at midnight. That is the general context in which all of this happened &mdash; special courts, special laws being used, a special body within the police force, the acceptance of special evidence and then difficulties and obstacles to legal advisers being present when statements were elicited.</P>
    <P>To give you a further flavour of the type of statement in the Nicky Kelly case I will briefly describe the evidence given by Kelly himself in court, his own version of the events:</P>
    <P>(Garda A) rammed my head off the locker door. Some of the Brits treatment. Spreadeagled. Jabbed in ribs, slapped in face, legs kicked. Lights switched off. Placed behind door. <Col N="112" /> Spreadeagled. Door pushed in. Collision. Ended up on ground. Once on floor refused to get up. Hair pulled. Hit on back. Frightened more than hurt. Taken upstairs by (Garda A). Smell of drink off him. Corner of cell. Toilet. Grabbed by hair. &ldquo;Tomorrow &mdash; long day&rdquo;. Shoved head five-six times down toilet, didn't wet face. Taken out of cell by (Garda A). To wall &mdash; out of sight of cell. Short delay. Knee in groin. Caught in thigh. Spat in face. Back to cell. Five minutes there. (Garda A): &ldquo;eventually you'll talk&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(Garda A) hit (me) back of ears after wrong answers. Telephone ears ten times. (Garda B) slapped in face and arms. (Garda C and Garda D) punched, punched. Fell to ground. (Garda D) hit me with chair &mdash; not much force.</P>
    <P>On floor, on back, hands stretched backwards. Chair put on palms. (Garda A) sits on chair. Spits on face. Leering. Cried. Frightened. Don't know what they are going to do to me. Very tired, sore, ears ringing, bad headache, stomach sick, afraid of my life. (Garda A) produced blackjack. Beaten by (Garda E) on biceps. Left on table. Black lathe ten inches long, one inch in diameter. Flexible, Swish noise. &ldquo;Own up, make statement&rdquo;. Beaten above the knee...</P>
    <P>That is the type of description that was given. There is the independent medical examination by Dr. Seán Ó Cléirigh and Dr. Samuel Davis. Dr. Séan Ó Cleirigh, an independent doctor who examined Kelly, and Dr. Samuel Davis medical officer at Mountjoy, who examined him the following day found that the injuries he had suffered could not possibly have been self-inflicted. The evidence they gave was that in their opinion the injuries were not self-inflicted.</P>
    <P>Arising out of that, Amnesty International introduced an investigation and sent over a team for the very first time in the history of the country to examine the allegations that had taken place, and the Kelly case was one of many. They recommended that an inquiry be established into all of the events that took place. The <Col N="113" /> then Opposition spokesperson, Deputy Collins, stated that they would conduct an inquiry into the entire investigation. Subsequently, when Fianna Fáil came to power in 1977, an inquiry was set in with limited terms of reference, not so much to investigate the actual events that occurred or the existence of a heavy gang and its ramifications but largely to ensure that recommendations would be made to ensure that safeguards would be put in place to protect gardaí against unfounded allegations and also to protect victims of suspects in custody against possible ill-treatment. Barra Ó Briain's report in 1978 came up with very strong proposals to ensure that all interrogations were monitored, taped verbally and video taped as well, to prevent such an abuse again.</P>
    <P>Kelly in the meantime had been found guilty and convicted. He eventually ended up in prison and went on hunger strike. He was invited to sue by the Government of the day and, apparently on the grounds that he would be able to take a civil action, he was informed that there were grounds for a civil action, that he would be able to take the civil action and he came off the hunger strike. Then, when he did proceed with the civil case, obstacles were put in his way on the lines of the famous Lord Denning &ldquo;appalling vista&rdquo; statement, namely, and I will quote from his judgment in 1983: &ldquo;the public interest can sometimes be better served by imprisoning innocent persons rather than allowing a case to proceed which might undermine an institution of the state&rdquo;. That, coupled with the statement that Kelly already had exhausted his access to litigation and that the courts had found against him on a matter of fact, led to the conclusion that therefore there were no grounds for Kelly to pursue his case. That, of course, does not coincide with the slogan over our own courts, which says that justice must be done even though the Heavens fall. The Denning statement was in fact totally contrary to any decent and proper system of justice.</P>
    <P>Of course, the statement was made in the context of the Birmingham Six. Since <Col N="114" /> then Lord Denning has had reason to regret that statement. But the authorities who in 1983 presented that as the basis for their opposition to stop Kelly from proceeding with a civil case have not as yet withdrawn their objection to his pursuit of vindication of his rights and for damages on the basis of a civil action, even though Lord Denning has stated that he had been wrong in his judgment and wrong in his statements.</P>
    <P>All of that new evidence has come to us through Andrew Morton, the gentleman from Scotland who has done linguistic and syntactical analysis of speech patterns and who has come to a firm conclusion that Kelly's alleged statement was not a statement by one person but by at least two persons and did not coincide with Kelly's own speech patterns. That raises new evidence on top of the existing independent evidence that was given at the time by people who were present in the Bridewell who gave evidence that there was roaring and shouting and crying in the Bridewell that night in the cell where Kelly was detained and, secondly, there is the medical evidence from Doctor Davis and from Dr. Seán Ó Cléirigh.</P>
    <P>That bring us to the question of what should be done at this time. We are in a situation where it is difficult for Kelly to vindicate himself through the court process because of the absence of an appeal mechanism. It is not possible for Kelly to go back to the courts in the same form as the British Home Secretary was able to refer the Birmingham Six case. We do not have that channel. Considering the enormous public disquiet that existed prior to this new evidence and the fact that this has been greatly increased by the very substantial new forensic evidence in his favour, remembering that there was nothing against Kelly other than a confession elicited under duress over a period of 43 hours' interrogation in circumstances that have never been explained other than what was rather euphemistically referred to by Judge Hamilton as &ldquo;self-inflicted injuries&rdquo; and which was discredited by the independent medical evidence, we must <Col N="115" /> look for a pardon for Nicky Kelly in this matter. The evidence is so strong at this time and there is universal concern in the same way as there was universal concern in the cases of the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four.</P>
    <P>We have a recommendation in the Martin report that there should be an independent inquiry established which would investigate miscarriages of justice and then advise the Attorney General who, in turn, would advise the Government to seek a presidential pardon. That is a body that must be set up because we have no other channel at present. In the immediate term we have no channel. As I said, he has been estopped in relation to the civil case, and that is not adequate by any means, but in terms of vindicating and exonerating the good name of Nicky Kelly and of his co-defendants who were convicted in similar circumstances, we have no choice but to call for a pardon.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to recommend to the Cabinet that the Cabinet would recommend to the President that she would exercise her powers under Article 30.6 of the Constitution to pardon Nicky Kelly. This would be very much in line with statements that have been made by such eminent people as yourself, a Chathaoirligh. You were Minister for Justice and you are on record as stating that in your opinion Nicky Kelly should be pardoned. I was delighted to hear that. Another former Minister for Justice, Deputy Michael Noonan, has also put it on record that he believes that Nicky Kelly should be pardoned. As recently as yesterday a Minister of the Government at the time, the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, Justin Keating, stated in very humble terms that he believed that he and his Government were quite wrong in not pursuing very strongly the allegations that had come before them in relation to certain activities that had been going on and that he believed the only procedure to take at this time was to seek a pardon for Nicky Kelly through the President.</P>
    <P>First, we should go ahead and seek a Presidential pardon, and I hope the Minister will be able to give me definite <Col N="116" /> information on that tonight. Second, we must ensure there is proper vindication and exoneration of the good name of Nicky Kelly and that he would be given compensation for the trauma he suffered and the injuries that were inflicted on him. Third, we must have regard to the recommendations of the Barra Ó Briain Committee and of the Martin Committee. The Barra Ó Briain Committee recommendations relate to safeguards for suspects and for the Garda during interrogation in custody. These were taken up by the Martin report and reinforced in relation to monitoring everything that went on in a police station. The Martin Committee went beyond that and sought that this independent tribunal be established to advise the Attorney General who would then advise the Government.</P>
    <P>Finally, I ask that an inquiry be established into the circumstances surrounding what happened, not just in the Sallins case, but how at that time a development could take place which would bring justice to such a low state that the rule of law did not operate. We must look for an inquiry into all the circumstances at the time that could allow an incident like this to arise where for a period of 15 years innocent people would not have their names vindicated. Even at this time there has been no vindication. This is one person; there are other persons in the Sallins case and there are other persons in the wider context. For the good name of justice and for the integrity of our judicial system and our legal system we must look at all the things that happened at that period but the first step along this course is to ensure that Nicky Kelly is pardoned without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to inform the House that the position with regard to RTE's &ldquo;Wednesday Report&rdquo; programme of 9 October concerning the conviction of Mr. Nicky Kelly is that the advice of the Attorney General has been sought on the various issues raised by that programme. In those circumstances it would <Col N="117" /> be clearly premature and certainly inappropriate for me to comment in any way on the case in question and I do not propose to depart from that other than to say that the Minister for Justice will be guided by the advice of the Attorney General in regard to whatever steps are appropriate or are required to be taken as a result of the matters raised by the programme.</P>
      <P>Reference has also been made to the findings of the Martin Committee and I propose to outline for the information of the House the details of the committee's recommendations. The committee's terms of reference were, in part, to examine whether there is a need for a procedure whereby persons who have exhausted the normal appeals procedures can have their cases further reviewed and, if so, to make recommendations as to what procedure should be provided and in what circumstances it should apply.</P>
      <P>In brief, the committee recommended the establishment of an independent body with statutory powers of inquiry to examine cases where substantial doubt as to the propriety of a conviction has arisen but where the normal appeals procedure has been exhausted. The committee considered that any such case would first be examined by the Attorney General who would decide whether the case warranted referral to the inquiry body and who would advise the Government accordingly. The function of the inquiry body on the referral of a case would be to inquire into all of the available facts and circumstances surrounding the particular conviction. It would then express its opinion as to whether doubt existed as to the propriety of that conviction. Following that it would then be a matter for the Government to decide whether action should be taken and what action was appropriate in any particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be clear that these recommendations raise important issues concerning the respective functions under the Constitution of the Executive and the Judiciary and they are currently under examination. Any proposals arising from this examination will be announced by <Col N="118" /> the Minister for Justice in the normal way in due course. The primary concern of the Minister for Justice is to ensure that the scheme that is put in place to deal with issues of this kind is the right one. That is very important.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the recommendations of the Ó Briain Committee whose terms of reference were to make recommendations as to whether and, if so, what additional safeguards were necessary for the protection of persons in Garda custody and for the protection of members of the Garda Síochána against unfounded allegations of ill-treatment.</P>
    <P>To simply suggest that the recommendations of the Ó Briain Committee have not been implemented is to ignore the factual position. Much of the Ó Briain report has been given effect. It was possible to implement certain of the recommendations it contained administratively. Other recommendations relevant to the treatment of arrested persons were largely given effect to by the regulations on the treatment of persons in Garda custody made by the Minister for Justice in 1987 under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984. Those regulations, in fact, go further than the Ó Briain recommendations in a number of instances &mdash; for example, with regard to medical treatment and with regard to special provisions for the young and the mentally handicapped. Similarly the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986, gave effect to the committee's recommendation for the establishment of an independent complaints procedure.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that the civil action by Mr. Kelly is still before the courts. The matter of alleged ill-treatment which has been referred to here tonight is <i>sub judice</i> and in those circumstances it would not be appropriate for me to make any comment at all on that aspect of the matter. I hope that that information is helpful to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Just one brief question. The Minister said that the advice of the Attorney General is being sought on the matter. Could I ask when that was <Col N="119" /> sought, when it is expected there will be a response from the Attorney General and when we are likely to have some movement from the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Based on the extra information which came to light recently, the case was referred to the Attorney General by the Minister for Justice, who has responsibility in this matter. I cannot say when the Attorney General will have <Col N="120" /> examined all the information and facts available to him and report. But as soon as the information and reports and recommendations of the Attorney General come to hand the Minister for Justice will consider them and in due course take them before Government if necessary.</P>
