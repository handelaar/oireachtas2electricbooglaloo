      <P>I have notice from Senator Neville that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to have all allowances in the nature of pay declared reckonable for the Superannuation Acts governing pension awards payable to members of An Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Neville as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Item No. 2, the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990, Committee Stage (resumed) &mdash; until 6 p.m. with a sos from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  We will then resume the Fine Gael motion No. 45 until 8.4 p.m.  At that stage we will take Item No. 3:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employment Equality Act, 1977 (Employment of Females on Under <Col N="1522" /> Ground Work in Mines) Order, 1989.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, first, on behalf of this group I extend to the Burke family our deepest sympathy on the tragic death at the weekend of their daughter, Vanessa Burke, who was a member of our staff on the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Secondly, we are all concerned at the situation regarding the Brooke talks and all on this side hope that progress can be made.  It is most important that no group or individuals would in any way obstruct the progress of the talks or use any excuse to ensure that the talks do not take place. I am sure the Leader of the House will join with me in that regard.</P>
      <P>Finally, on behalf of this group I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Justice of the allocation for the training of an extra 1,000 gardaí.  We certainly hope &mdash; it is a matter I have raised many times before &mdash; that they will appear on our streets very shortly.  I hope it is not just a pre-election announcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Cosgrave in the concern he expressed about the uncertainty now hanging over the Northern talks.  I am sure the House would like the Leader to convey the view to the Taoiseach that it does not matter and it is of absolutely no consequence where these talks are held from our point of view provided they get under way.</P>
      <P>Secondly, it would appear from the answer the Taoiseach gave this morning to questions in the other House that the formation of a foreign affairs committee is now imminent or more imminent, if you can use that phrase.  I make no apology for asking the Leader of the House once again to make sure, if it is a joint committee, that Seanad Éireann is represented on it.  It would be absolutely outrageous if Seanad Éireann was not represented on such a committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, in view of the depressing Bord na Gaeilge report published this morning on the rapid disappearance of the Gaeltacht and in view of the Taoiseach's masterly inactivity in this area, will the <Col N="1523" /> Leader of the House ask him why he is hanging on to this portfolio as he is doing nothing at all in the job?  I doubt very much if the Leader will ask the Taoiseach that question.</P>
    <P>Finally, I regret that no information is available to date on Item No. 3, dealing with the Employment Equality Act, etc. I could not find any copy of the order; in fact, Seanad Éireann did not meet on that date.  I am not sure what it means, whether females are going to be dispatched underground to work in mines, but it is a pity that we could not have some information about it beforehand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House if he will make time available for a debate on the services for the mentally handicapped and if he will treat this matter urgently, given the stalemate that now exists in relation to the services at Cheeverstown House, which continues to have 60 vacancies.  They have not been filled over a prolonged period of time and the talks broke down last week.</P>
      <P>May I further ask the Leader if he can give us an idea of what programme we will have before us next week.</P>
      <P>Finally, I, too, would like to be associated with Senator Murphy's call for a debate on the language, given the data that appeared in this morning's papers, even if I am not particularly well equipped to contribute to that debate in the language itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>May I just note that Senator Murphy is being his usual cynical self.  The fact is that the present Taoiseach has done more than anybody over a number of years to promote Irish music and culture and the language in general and it ill behoves Senator Murphy to make comments like that in the House. However, may I join with Senator Cosgrave in the hope that the way will be cleared for the very important talks on the North to get under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liomsa ceist a chur i dtaobh an Bhille do Ollscoil Luimnigh.  I raised this matter before.  It is in relation to the proposed Bill on the University of <Col N="1524" /> Limerick and the fact that as I mentioned previously, there is very little evidence of any reference to the Irish language and culture in the University Bill.  May I ask the Leader of the House if he would bring that to the attention of the Minister for Education to ensure that there is the ethos of culture and the Irish language in the proposed Bill in relation to the University of Limerick?  It is the least we would expect from a third level institution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House when the local government reform Bill will be introduced in this House and, secondly, to seek an assurance from him that every Member of the House will have an opportunity to speak on the Bill and an assurance that it will not be guillotined through this Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House when we will discuss Item No. 5, the Educational Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Bill, because it is of fundamental importance.  Now is the time we are negotiating the exchange of students and it is very useful for colleges such as we have in Donegal to have the facility of exchange of students.  I would welcome the opportunity of having this Bill in the Seanad in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if we could have a debate on the scandal of insurance costs in this country, particularly motor insurance.  For a young person to get insurance now the annual premium costs more than the price of a reasonable secondhand car.  Additionally, insurance costs are making our industry uncompetitive and our insurance companies are protected because of a derogation we got in the non-life insurance sector.  I think the rackets that are going on deserve to be exposed and I would like to ask the Leader of the House if we could have a debate on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my <Col N="1525" /> support to what has been said about the Northern Ireland talks and pass on to the Leader a suggestion I heard on the wireless this morning made by Deputy Proinsias De Rossa of the Workers' Party.  It seems to me to be an excellent one.  It is that one phase of the talks should take place in the British Embassy in Dublin, which would satisfy the unionists, and another phase should take place in the Irish Embassy in London.  That seems to me to be an eminently practical suggestion which would satisfy the sensitivities of people.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I would like to support what Senator McGowan said about the Educational Exchange Bill.  I would certainly welcome this because, among other things, I am frequently made aware of the fact that in America they have educational evaluators who evaluate Irish degrees, and they do it all wrong.  Irish University degrees do not get the kind of recognition they ought to get in the United States educational service.  I have raised this with the Minister for Education and she said it would be a matter requiring legislation and all kinds of research.  I would like to add my voice to Senator McGowan's request that this important matter should be taken as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>My final question is simply a matter of information.  I plead ignorance of Item No. 6 and I wonder if the Leader would be able to explain its purpose.  The item reads that Seanad Éireann resolves that certain sections of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, shall remain in operation.  I am not quite sure what it is, what its impact is or when it will be taken and perhaps the Leader would be able to give me some information on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House if he can clarify whether there is to be any alteration to the normal schedule of sittings of the Seanad in the month of June?  There are various rumours circulating in this regard and if this position could be clarified now I think all Members of the House would apprecite it.  As a follow on to that, if there is to be some alteration, perhaps the Leader <Col N="1526" /> of the House would discuss with the Taoiseach the possibility of this House at least returning in September this year.  I think it is a nonsense that we have to wait until the end of October, with only a matter of ten week or less left until the Christmas recess.</P>
      <P>Secondly, on the question of the foreign affairs committee, which I have raised on many occasions, I am asking the Leader if he could clarify whether Members of the Seanad are to be included on that committee.  I feel very strongly that that should be the case and I ask if he has any information on those matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like again to ask the Leader of the House when we may expect a meaningful debate on health.  I have in this House on a number of occasions referred to the urgency for a debate on the whole health services area.  Quite frankly, the position has worsened as time has gone by.  My question is: when can we expect a meaningful and in-depth discussion on the worsening health services in this country?</P>
      <P>Secondly, may I ask the Leader again when we can have a full debate on agriculture having regard to the fact that the position is again, unfortunately, worsening as time goes by.  May I remind the Leader and everybody else that winter weather has extended into spring and this has drawn severely on the reserves of Irish farmers and the position is extremely serious in that regard.  We need a debate on agriculture, even though I acknowledge and accept that we have had a discussion on this not too long ago in this House.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to inquire from the Leader when we can expect the establishment of the foreign affairs committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cosgrave raised the tragic death of Vanessa Burke and I, too, would like to sympathise with the family and with the Fine Gael Party on their loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also raised the question of the Brooke initiative and talks.  All I can do <Col N="1527" /> is repeat what I said previously, that we live in hope that commonsense will prevail in these talks and that they will be successful.  I noted that Senator Cosgrave welcomed the recent announcement regarding the training of gardaí and I can tell him that the date of starting was announced.  I would certainly like to put his mind at ease: it would never be a political pre-election ploy or anything like that.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy asked a question on Northern Ireland similar to Senator Cosgrave and he also raised the question of the foreign affairs committee.  I have been told and have been saying that this committee will be formulated this session. I can assure Senator Murphy that I have made repeated representations for Seanad representation on that committee. I have noted also what the Senator said in relation to Bord na Gaeilge.  If the Senator wants to ask the Taoiseach questions on that one, I will not do so.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton asked about a debate on the mentally handicapped.  Much indeed as I would like at this time, I have no proposals or plans for that.  The Senator asked about the programme for next week; we will have a busy week.  We will have the Foreign Adoptions Bill; a debate on the prison system, as promised to Senator Costello and others and we will have the local government reform Bill.  Those will give us a very busy schedule indeed.  I have no proposal for a debate on the Irish language, as I indicated.</P>
    <P>Senator McKenna asked about the University of Limerick Bill, which is a Bill which provides for the amalgamation of Thomond College and the University of Limerick.  As I pointed out last week to Senator Ryan, I have indicated to the Minister for Education the views and concerns of Senators regarding cultural aspects and the Irish language aspect of that legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten asked about the Local Government Bill.  I understand the Whips of the other House are still having discussions, so obviously the Whips of <Col N="1528" /> this House will meet to arrange a suitable and appropriate time for a debate on the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan asked when Item No. 5 would be taken.  It is not an Education Bill, but a Foreign Affairs Bill.  It is now completed in the Dáil and it will be taken, I hope, in this House within the next two or three weeks.</P>
    <P>Senator Raftery asked about a debate on motor insurance.  It is, of course, suitable for discussion in Private Members' time.  If it is not taken in Private Members' time, we could look at Motion No. 11, which deals with the report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EC on life assurance and motor insurance.  That would be one way forward, but the best way would be by way of Private Members' time.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris referred to the Educational Exchange Bill and also mentioned the question of the Northern Ireland situation.  Senator Cullen went on to talk about the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Excuse me.  I asked a question about Item No. 6.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the House should not be interrupted in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry.  On Item No. 6, my understanding is that unless we resolve this in time certain laws will lapse.  I will talk privately with the Senator on that matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Cullen asked about sitings in June.  All I can say on that is that the Whips will meet.  We are, of course, guided at all times by the legislation that comes to us from the other House and legislation that is initiated here.  I am aware that there is a certain event, but the Whips will meet to discuss June sittings.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senator Hourigan, I have no proposals for a debate on health or agriculture at this time.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 105 has already been discussed with amendment No. 99.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 105:</P>
      <P>In page 24, subsection (7), to delete all words after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in line 4 down to and including &ldquo;selected&rdquo; in line 7 and substitute &ldquo;nominate one person for appointment by the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an important amendment.  If it is not accepted the implication is that the Minister <i>de facto</i> can select his own people and I would appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I am not in a position to accept this amendment.  I think it would be far too restrictive if we were to simply restrict the number of people an organisation could put forward for nomination to one. As I said on the last occasion, it is important that the advisory committee, which is a relatively small one consisting of 11 people and the director general, should be a balanced one representing all the various interests that can have an imput into this Environmental Protection Agency.  Therefore, I think there might be a tendency to nominate the same kind of people &mdash; planners, engineers or perhaps architects, professional people of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to give the Minister the maximum flexibility to appoint a wide cross-section of people and to give organisations the possibility of putting forward for consideration the widest possible range of people, I am not in a position to limit that to one and I do not think that would be desirable.  I think there would <Col N="1530" /> be an inference, if each nominating body were to nominate simply one, that all the nominees of nominating bodies would be on the advisory committee.  Of course, there may be more bodies than there will be places available on the advisory committee.  It is a question of trying to decide as between the various interests so that we have a balanced and appropriate advisory committee, which is going to form a very important part of the operation of the agency.  As I said the last day, is going to be fully integrated into the operation of the agency.  I am afraid, therefore, that I am not in a position to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 107:</P>
      <P>In page 24, subsection (11), line 41, after &ldquo;reappointment&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;subject to the agreement of the organisation which selected him in the first place&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need for this amendment.  For somebody to be reappointed they would have to be nominated by the organisation, so I do not think the Senator's amendment is necessary. If they are not nominated by the organisation they could only be considered for the ministerial selection, that is, for the four positions the Minister has to select.  That is clear in subsection (11), subject to subsection (8).  If the Senator reflects on that he will see there is no need to put that amendment if it is to serve the purpose that I believe it is to serve, which is that organisations cannot <Col N="1531" /> be ignored when the committee is being reappointed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I am not in a position to accept this amendment.  I believe it would be far too restrictive.  It may well be necessary for the Minister to set by way of regulations notices that organisations will have to give before they call meetings to select a nominee and so on.  It may also be required from time to time to change the organisations that can nominate persons for consideration to the advisory committee. Therefore, I think that to delete paragraph (b) in section 25 (15) would place a Minister in a very difficult and restricted position.  This is not desirable.  The wording here is exactly the same wording that is used in relation to An Bord Pleanála <Col N="1532" /> and I think it is appropriate in this legislation that a similar facility would be given to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to keep this House indefinitely on the question of whether the Minister may make regulations, but I have a funny feeling that inside Government Departments, obviously with the support of Ministers, there are people who keep on imagining that they must put into legislation a catch-all phrase which covers every possible eventuality whether imagined or real, hypothetical or factual, and that you have to have this phrase &ldquo;any other matter which the Minister considers expedient.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Quite truthfully, this whole matter of conveying powers on a Minister &mdash; however specific an area &mdash; to do whatever he or she wishes to do at some stage in the future because it is &ldquo;expedient for the purpose of this section&rdquo; is, in my view, a relic of Stalinism, which has been buried all over eastern Europe; and we should forget about it, too.  Agencies like this should be left to conduct their own business.  Bodies like this advisory group should be left to conduct their own business. It is this fascinating belief that the centre holds in its possession a fund of wisdom that nobody else has which is, first of all, nonsense and, secondly, clearly unnecessary.  No responsible body is going to refuse to do anything or decline to do anything which that body perceives to be useful or necessary.  To give to the Minister the power, which I am quite sure will not be abused most of the time, creates a philosophical set of priorities about the wisdom of the centre, the wisdom of high office, which, in my view, has been proven to be untrue by the bureaucratic mess this country is in because of centralisation.  This is just a symptom of it.  I fully agree that the amendment is perfectly reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, when one is doing various things of this kind by way of regulations, first of all, they are the more minor aspects of the Bill and, as I said previously it would be impossible for us to put all housekeeping matters into <Col N="1533" /> the primary legislation.  That is why regulations are used so frequently to attend to basic housekeeping functions.  There will be whole host of organisations involved in submitting names for consideration for appointment to the advisory committee and it would be wrong of us to have legislation that is so restrictive that problem could arise in sending those nominations forward.  This provision is there to give the maximum flexibility in the event of unforeseen problems arising so that one does not have to come back with amending legislation to the primary legislation.  This is a relatively minor aspect of this legislation and it would not be right to totally tie our hands and not give flexibility to introduce whatever procedures might be necessary to make this workable.</P>
      <P>Many organisations will be sending names forward.  It will be a question of trying to balance one organisation against the other and select a group of people who make up a good balance for this advisory committee.  It may well be expedient for the purposes of this section for the Minister to make regulations in relation to the methods of the organisations selected to nominate a body, who they consult or the time they give to their members.  These things may well be relevant.  It is not necessary that they would be used but in the event of problems arising it is appropriate that a provision of this kind should exist.</P>

      <P>In page 25, subsection (16) (b), line 12, after &ldquo;ill-health&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or stated misbehaviour&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>With regard to this amendment Senator Hederman suggests the inclusion of &ldquo;or stated misbehaviour&rdquo; after &ldquo;ill-health&rdquo; but the copy of the Bill I have has a phrase in that paragraph which occurs a couple of lines further on which says: &ldquo;...has become incapable through ill-health of effectively performing his duties or has committed stated misbehaviour&rdquo;. I assume that the phrase &ldquo;has committed stated misbehaviour&rdquo; was added at some intermediary stage and failed to attract the attention of Senator Hederman because it seems to me it has precisely the same effect.  It is a slightly ugly phrase, &ldquo;has committed stated mis-behaviour&rdquo; but I am not able to suggest a better one so I assume the Minister will say she has already responded to this suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an amendment which is separate.  It is about the power of the Minister to remove from office a member of the advisory committee.  We are not talking about the environmental protection agency now, we are talking about the committee which is set up according to section 28, not to determine policy but to make recommendations to the agency or to the Minister relating to the functions of the agency.  It is a body <Col N="1535" /> which only has powers to make recommendations. The agency or the Minister, as may be appropriate, shall have regard to any recommendations.  If the Minister can give me a definition of &ldquo;have regard&rdquo; and what it means I believe they cannot take a decision without considering what is being recommended but do not have to do what is recommended.</P>
      <P>This advisory's committee's function is to make recommendations.  Those recommendations may well be controversial, they may not be controversial, they may well be based on the priorities of the advisory committee which, if it is as good as an advisory committee should be, there should be questions of challenging the agency to think more and to reflect on issues.</P>
      <P>If you have an advisory committee like this the appointments to which are effectively to a large extent controlled by the Minister &mdash; we can discuss this again when we come to the section &mdash; and then say that if it appears to the Minister to be necessary or desirable for the effective performance by the agency of its functions that any member of that agency or of the advisory committee can be removed from office that seems to me to be tying up the advisory committee to an enormous extent into the Minister's office.  This ought to be a vigorous independent advisory body free and able to speak as freely as it wishes, made up, I hope, of independently-minded people who feel free to comment publicly and privately about what they see as the limitations. Otherwise it is nothing more than a token to keep a lot of groups happy by giving them some sort of a nominal representation.  If it is going to be allowed to operate independently, then the Minister should devise specific criteria for dismissal or should leave out that last phrase.  To say that the Minister should be able to decide because it appears to him or her necessary or desirable for the effective performance by the committee of its functions is to give the Minister excessive power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It comes back to something that I believe will be a constant theme of both <Col N="1536" /> Houses of the Oireachtas for the next few weeks, the extraordinary burden of centralism in this country and its perception that somewhere in the centre of power, not necessarily the centre of the country, there is some extra fund of wisdom over and above what is available to the rest of the community.  It does not exist, it is a myth, and to suggest that you have to include these catch-all phrases in case there is a problem is a recipe for sloppy thinking.  It is sloppy thinking that is inserted into our legislation over and over again.  There is no point in telling me that it is in many pieces of legislation &mdash; this country is awash with sloppily drafted legislation.  It is no excuse for sloppy legislation.  That section is not necessary and should be taken out.  That is what my amendment suggests.</P>

In relation to this, I have given an undertaking at least to look at it for Report Stage.  We have to remember the people here are volunteers.  They obviously have rights of their own.  There may be matters that could be of a confidential or private nature that it may not always be desirable to actually state publicly.  Subject to that, I am prepared to look at it &mdash; that should be acceptable to the Senators &mdash; with a view to coming back to it on Report Stage.</P>

I suggest there could be almost an illusion of necessity or desirability and it could subsequently transpire that it was neither necessary nor desirable that this person was removed.  All that has to happen is the subjective judgment of the Minister that it might appear to her or to him that it was necessary.  That is an extraordinarily broad phrase to employ in a section of a <Col N="1537" /> Bill like this and I am very glad the Minister has indicated she will look at it again.</P>

I accept fully that the Minister will look at it again. Will she look a little bit beyond the Attorney General's office where precedent seems to be everything and where commonsense is a scarce commodity in the way legislation is drafted.</P>

      <P>The Minister may prescribe for the purposes of subsection (6)&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  organisations which in his opinion are representative of persons whose professions or occupations relate to environmental protection,</P>
      <P>(b)  organisations, which in his opinion are concerned with environmental protection,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The term &ldquo;his opinion&rdquo; is used five times in this subsection.  We had this discussion last week and I do intend to dwell on the matter.  It is in all our interests to get this Bill through.  There are a lot of sections in it.  I find the wording unacceptable because, as we all know, we have had female Ministers in the past and I am sure we will have them in the future.  The Minister is bringing in this Bill and of all the office holders she is more familiar <Col N="1538" /> with this Bill than anyone else.  I ask her to consider rephrasing that and to put in &ldquo;Minister's opinion&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;his opinion&rdquo; for Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I would go further than that.  I must express some mild surprise at the inconsistency of our zealous advocates to feminism that they do not suggest that at least half of the advisory committee shall be women.  I suspect that zeal is selective.  It has less to do with concern for the alleged oppression of more than half the human race, than with the fact that more than half the electors in the NUI constituency are women. Senator O'Toole's feminest zeal might be better applied to his own organisation where women notoriously are excluded from top posts.</P>

I have this problem perpetually with central Government because it appears to be increasingly a burden on people.  Contrary to what the Minister's party say, it is not the taxation part of it that is the burden, it is the bureaucratic delays, the sense of wisdom that is possessed of centralised bodies that the local communities do not have.  The best people to pick representatives to go on an advisory committee like this are not the Minister or her advisers but the organisation themselves. You can produce all the &ldquo;what if&rdquo; you like; &ldquo;what if they produce a Marxist-Leninist&rdquo; or, with my colleagues in the Labour Party in front of me, &ldquo;a militant&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an unnecesasry assault from the right.  There is a very serious question here, that is the presumption that the Minister somehow has some sort of special expertise and can pick from organisations or representative persons whose professions or occupations relate to environmental protection. There is the suggestion that the Minister can somehow make a decison about who is most appropriate, that those organisation cannot make or, similarly, about organisations which are concerned with environmental protection, the promotion of economic growth and development.</P>
      <P>Who said and where is the evidence that Government Ministers or their advisors have some sort of extra wisdom which say that they can make a better choice than the organisations themselves? That is what intrigues me about legislation like this and other legislation. What is the catch?  Why is it that you cannot say: &ldquo;Go ahead and pick somebody from your organisation&rdquo;?  It is bad enough that the Minister can designate which organisations are concerned.  My view is that it is the same way that the Clerk of the Seanad decides whether organisations or people qualify to various panels.  It ought not be the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has no fund of limitless wisdom.  Why the Minister should claim to herself or himself this wisdom, to pick from three nominees of these organisations, somebody he or she thinks is the best is a mystery to me if I did not think it was all to do with an altogether extraordinary obsessional determination that <Col N="1540" /> all power must be retained within the centre of power in this country.  It is utterly meaningless.  This is another job that will take up more time in a contracting public service and it will not be the Minister.  If the Minister had to do everything which legislation says the Minister has to do, the Minister will not escape from her office for one hour 24 hours of the day.  A lot of this could be done effectively by middle ranking members of her Department who are accountable to nobody and who will work according to regulations that will stifle creativity.  It is not the way to do things. These matters should be left to organisations. What is wrong with this section is the extraordinary belief that the Minister has some sort of wisdom that nobody else has.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty in relation to this is that at least 50 organisations made submissions in relation to the legislation. It would be impossible, therefore, to expect each of them to be able to nominate one person to an advisory committee. It would be such an enormous advisory committee that it would be virtually valueless.  Therefore it is necessary to limit the organisations and put them into different categories and to choose at least one from each category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seven come from organisations and four from other ministerial appointments. There may also be people from organisations.  Unless we are going to have a limitless committee I cannot see any other way of doing it.  It is desirable that the number overall would be small but representative of environmental interest, community interest, people involved in economic development and so on.  I cannot think of a better way, given the need to be restrictive in the sense that we want a small effective rather than a large one that rambles on because 50 or 60 are involved on it.  If we were to follow Senator Ryan's suggestion of allowing the organisations to designate themselves and nominate themselves I cannot think where we would draw a limit.  Somebody has to prescribe the organisations and somebody has to decide who will form <Col N="1541" /> the advisory committee.  The most appropriate person is the Minister of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan has grounds for concern.  I am absolutely with him.  I worry deeply at times about giving all power to any Minister.  With the greatest respect to the Minister of State, I have had this worry in regard to past Governments and I will have it, if I survive, in respect to future Governments. We are also talking here, as Senator Ryan did, about people who go voluntarily into a situation.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's explanation about the advisory committee and that it will not be more than 12 places.  I can see the worry about ministerial appointments to the 12 places.  I accept from the Minister that there will probably be nearly 40 or 50 organisations looking for the 12 places.  All elected people worry about a Minister in any Bill holding all power to himself or herself.  Here we have the Minister appointing (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e).  I would like if the Minister could come in again on this.  I have worries with this, too and we had better voice our worries here because it may well be changed in another place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept in this case the goodwill of the Minister and we have ample evidence of it.  If I argue with her it is not because I want an argument because I think she misunderstood me. There are five categories of organisations here.  My first problem is that I do not think it should be the Minister who designates organisations which are covered by each of those categories.  The Minister for the Environment does not, for instance, designate what is a political party.  I understand the Clerk of the Dáil does that.  He interprets the legislation and concludes who is covered by it and who is not.  In my view the first problem is who decides which organisations are covered by each of the headings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second problem is, who picks the representatives of those organisations?  I am not entirely sure that the Minister's intention was that there would be at least <Col N="1542" /> one person from each of those five categories. Maybe I am wrong but that was my understanding.  I cannot understand if those five categories can be relied upon to pick four people to give the Minister four names of which the Minister will choose one or perhaps two why they cannot be relied upon to pick one of their own choice.  That is the critical decision.</P>
    <P>I do not want a committee, I am not even arguing for an extension of the committee to have more members, I am saying two simple things; one, why not have the categorisation of groups as being eligible to be classified under one of those five subparagraphs be left independent of the Minister by some body with the expertise and the knowledge and, incidentally the time, to do it?  Secondly, if they can be trusted to pick four people from whom the Minister picks one, why not let them pick one?  It seems to me the Minister is reserving to herself the right to make sure that these organisations do not make mistakes about the people they pick because the Minister might know better about who is appropriate.  The presumption is that if they were left to themselves to pick one person they might make a wrong choice but if they have to pick four then the Minister, presumably because she has some wisdom the rest of us do not have, can overcome a foolish decision they would otherwise have made.  That is not true.  The Minister has no extra sources of wisdom available to her that are not available to the rest of society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to subsection (5) the generality of the language prompted me to ask the question.  I take the view that the whole area of environmental awareness is a function of education. It is quite clear here that the Minister may prescribe for the purpose organisations which, in his or her opinion, are representative of persons whose professions or occupations relate to environmental protection.  I would certainly like to hear the Minister confirm that that would include the teaching profession.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (e) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1543" /> organisations which in his opinion are representative of persons concerned with environmental education or research.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (e) states:</P>
    <P>organisations which in his opinion are representative of persons concerned with environmental education or research.</P>
    <P>This is a classic example where &ldquo;his&rdquo; could be dropped.  It seems to me that the group of professionals most concerned with environmental education are teachers.  I said on Second Stage that the whole question of environmental awareness as it is now known began with the introduction of the revised curriculum in primary schools in 1972 with the introduction of environmental studies.  We went through a generation before that when we did not know the names of birds or trees or were able to identify one from the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a long time ago but nevertheless that was the situation.  I would like to make the point of the need to have the whole area of environmental education addressed in a formal way.  The reason I am raising it is because people are concerned with the environment.  It is a cliché at this stage, but there are people who every day and every week have to devise a programme for the pupils under their control with the single objective of increasing awareness and concern for the environment.  I am not saying teachers are the only group doing this but it is part of their work on a day-to-day basis of educating people.  I would like to hear the Minister's views that they would be one of the groups who might be represented under that heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the teaching profession I can give the Senator the assurance that the teaching profession would be included under subsection (5); I am not certain about 5 (a) because that would probably have more to do with <Col N="1544" /> professions whose actual job involved environmental protection but certainly under subsection (5) (e) they would be involved as teachers are in education and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better explain what I meant because I think the Minister's first reply suggested a misunderstanding of what I was looking for in the section. Can she explain to me in simple English why she should reserve to herself the right to make the final choice of who represents a group of organisations under any of those sections rather than leaving them to make the choice themselves?  If they can be trusted to pick four people and get themselves organised to the extent of doing that I do not understand why they cannot be trusted to pick one who is their representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained earlier, every organisation that will have a nominating power to nominate members to the advisory committee will not have their persons selected.  There is an inference if you are asking organisations to pick one that you will select that one for the advisory committee.  It may well be the case that there be well in excess of 20, 30 or 40 organisations designated under subsection (5) for the purposes of making appointments to the advisory committee. Therefore, if you limit organisations nominee powers to one you are in some way indicating to them that that one person will be selected, which is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, organisations do not necessarily always send forward appropriate people.  Many of us are involved in activities where we know certain types of people might always dominate for the purpose of being appointed to these kind of committees.  Many organisations would welcome the suggestion that they would not be limited to one so that the choice would be made elsewhere because sometimes they may feel compelled to nominate one person because of the position that person holds in the organisation when, in fact, they might want to have <Col N="1545" /> a wider choice for consideration to an advisory committee.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, because the advisory committee is small and because we cannot facilitate every possible organisation it is important that the committee would be balanced and representative as between people with different disciplines with a different perspective and a different interest in the environment.  It is important that the balance would be fair between men and women and between the regions in the country so that the committee would be regionally balanced as well.  For all of those reasons it is wiser to have some flexibility given to the Minister when deciding who to appoint to the advisory committee.</P>
    <P>To refer to Senator Honan's point, the Minister will not dominate the advisory committee.  In fact, there are many advisory committees appointed by Ministers without any consultation with or reference to any organisations.  In this situation the Minister will only be able to appoint four out of 12 nominees.  That is a small proportion of the overall membership of the advisory committee.  The Minister's hands will be tied in relation to the other eight appointments, one being the director general and seven being from the organisations listed under subsection (5).  The Minister's powers in this respect are unusually limited and that is desirable.</P>

      <P>If they can nominate four why can they not nominate one as their representative?  The Minister states that they might pick an inappropriate person. The Irish people pick inappropriate people as their Government but I have to live with that because I believe in democracy.  I cannot appeal to a higher authority to pick somebody better for me <Col N="1546" /> because that would be undemocratic.  I do not see why we should not operate this at all levels of society.  If the group choose inappropriately that is their democratic privilege.  Higher authorities are not necessarily better, wiser or have more insight, but are different.  The Minister's view of who would be appropriate to represent environmental organisations may seem useful to her; it may appear entirely inappropriate to many of the organisations.  That is why I disagree.  The principle is that organisations should pick their own representative.  If we are going to enact revolutionary legislation in terms of administrative procedures, then we should stop having everything land back in the hands of the Minister, however elaborate the process may be by which things get there.  Ultimately the Minister will pick the people to represent all these organisations and they will not therefore be legitimate representatives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Under each of the groups listed under subsection (5) there may be 20 or 30 organisations and we are asking them to send forward at least four names; they could send forward 20 names.  It would be extremely restrictive to insist on one name.  I cannot think of a better way of doing it than the way suggested.</P>
      <P>To follow Senator Ryan's suggestion as many as ten organisations under this subsection would be asked to send forward one name which would be difficult. You would have all kinds of politics between organisations and so on.  Would you pick the engineers' representative or the architects' representative or some other professional body's representative? The Senator knows the reality behind that.  We are asking them to send forward a minimum of four and they may send forward ten, 12 or more names if they wish.  The same principal applies down the list so the Minister will be faced with a minimum of 20 names from which to pick seven and may well have a larger list of 50 or 60.  If we wish the advisory committee to be a small, balanced, representative committee composed of various national groups, interests and regions it is desirable to do it this way.</P>

There is nothing wrong with politics and there are other ways of doing it.  We all practise politics.  It is not sacred in here and wrong in other organisations.  It is the nature of all organisations.  If they have to pick a number there will be political maneouvring anyway.  I accept the goodwill of the present Minister on it that it will not be abused but the correct philosophical basis for it bothers me.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 114:</P>
      <P>In page 25, subsection (2) (a), between lines 38 and 39,, to insert the following new subparagraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(vii) the organisation and promotion of training conferences and related matters for the purposes of environmental protection,&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>My amendment is in response to Senator O'Toole's amendment and I hope it gives effect to what he has in mind.  It acknowledges the importance of the agency's functions under sections 54 and 55 in relation to the provision of advice and support to public authorities generally for the purposes of environmental protection, including measures relating to training and awareness exercises for persons involved in environmental protection. The provision of subsection (2) are wide enough to allow the advisory committee to make recommendations in relation to any of the agency's functions.  I accept <Col N="1548" /> that the raising of the standards of skills in environmental awareness is sufficiently important to merit a separate reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that the Minister has responded in such a positive way.  I phrased the amendment to make it clear that it was an issue that might be responded to rather than an amendment to be accepted in the language given.  I am disappointed the amendment does not contain the words &rdquo;environmental education&rdquo;; although it is slanted as I requested, to go beyond rules and regulations and into the preventative area to determine how we might increase peoples' understanding of environmental protection.  The Minister's amendment says that the advisory committee may make recommendations to the agency in relation to &ldquo;the organisation and promotion of training conferences and related matters for the purposes of environmental protection.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pushing the question of related matters which has to be formal environmental education.  The amendment has not stated that environmental education will be a formal requirement.  It is a formal part of what will be demanded by the agency.  I put this amendment down in the light of what will happened to the Health Advisory Agency which died because somebody decided they would no longer keep it there.  The only place I could find health education was in the context of the curriculum of primary education which is a fair place to have it.  Similarly, environmental education quite correctly, is an aspect of the curriculum of primary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was one of the people who pushed for it 20 years ago when the environment was a less popular issue than it is today. If there is a need to raise environmental awareness by inculcating love for and knowledge of the environment through education to create an innate sense of environmental protection that has to be set out in the context of aims with a clear objective.  This environmental agency would not be determining the curricula for schools at any level but it would be in <Col N="1549" /> a position to make certain recommendations for someone else to implement.  The formal words of &ldquo;environmental education&rdquo; would have been important and teachers would welcome that.  When teaching civics and environmental studies teachers may wonder if these subjects are tied into the greater scheme of things or to great national issues.  This would be one way of formalising the importance of environmental education, taking it in from the periphery as an answer to those who tell us that education should be about the core issues of reading, writing and arithmetic. This, too, is a core issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>This record is going to be very long.  The purpose of subsection (5) (a) is not to place a total ban on the advisory committee receiving specific information in relation to licence applications and reviews but to empower the agency to withhold information from the committee where it considers it appropriate to do so.  Should it be decided to withhold information during the application or review, it would be unwise to then oblige the agency to release the <Col N="1550" /> information after the application or review had been dealt with.  If there are good reasons not to give the information before a decision is made, the reasons may be just as valid afterwards.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered also that members of the advisory committee may also be members of organisations making representations to the agency about particular cases or objecting to licences being given.  It would not be appropriate generally that they should have full access to all aspects of the consideration of the case by the agency, including confidential documents, particulars of court proceedings, personal data, etc.</P>

      <P>The classic centralised Irish view about confidential information is that for fear we might release something that might be secret we will not release anything.  It is simply the words the Minister used that people might find out things that might be of use to them, therefore, we must not let them find out anything.  There is an intermediate phase. Senator O'Toole, as a senior trade union bureaucrat, subscribes to the Minister's view on this since they, too, operate a good secrecy law.</P>

      <P>It is perfectly reasonable that certain matters should be confidential but there should be a reason for confidentiality.  We have a freedom of information directive which may be implemented by this Act if the Minister sees fit but it does not have to be.  That directive specifies categories for confidentiality but the Minister says here that nothing about the processing of a specific application should ever become available to members of the agency for fear it may contain something confidential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I said it should not automatically become available to them as of right.  There is nothing to prevent it becoming available but there may be circumstances where it is not appropriate, particularly if the organisation is involved in lobbying the agency, <Col N="1551" /> in making an appeal to the agency or is against a particular application.  It would not be appropriate in those cases that because they are involved in the advisory committee that they would have access to information that would not be generally available to other members of the public.</P>

      <P>This is more appropriate to section 38 but the words used by the Minister provoked me because it was the classic defence of non-disclosure, that we might let out something that would be troublesome so we let out nothing.  We will come back to this at length on section 38.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am worried because the advisory committee is a responsible body and not to disclose information would require very serious and cogent reasons particularly after the completion of the processing of the review.  When it is completed, surely it would be of use to them to have information in almost all circumstances? It is not part of the function of the advisory body to advise in the light of its experience and the information in its possession?  To do so, it must have the widest possible access to information.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 117:</P>
      <P>In page 26, subsection (1), line 35, to delete &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;upon the initiation of the Agency&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important amendment and <Col N="1552" /> I press it as strongly as I can.  The difference between my amendment and that in the name of Senator O'Toole is not one of principle.  We are agreed about the issue here which is that in the legislation as framed the Minister is taking to herself the very unusual powers of being able to shift people round willy-nilly at any time in the future.  If the Minister looks at comparable legislation she will find that this power does not exist but that some phase is used &mdash; like the one that I or Senator O'Toole have used &mdash; to exercise this power once only and that on the initiation of the agency to be used only on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on the record one paragraph from a letter I received from the Services Industrial Professional Technical Union (SIPTU).  They say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In addition, the Bill differs significantly from such similar legislation in that the power of the Minister to transfer stock can be exercised at any time in the future.  Other legislation allowed the Minister to exercise his power only on the vesting day of the new organisation.  Under this legislation somebody could, in a number of years' time, join the local authority as a chemist and find him or herself transferred some years later to the agency.  This power is unprecedented.</P>
    <P>I believe that unprecedented measures require special justification by the Minister. This amendment, like some others that we may very well get to today, express the view of an important trade union body whose members will be members of the Environmental Protection Agency.  It is very important &mdash; I know the Minister will agree with me on this &mdash; to have good industrial relations right from the beginning.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to consider this amendment carefully and if she is unable to give a commitment on this, at least to indicate her precise reasons so that we can come back to it on Report Stage.  I will be urging acceptance of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of my <Col N="1553" /> amendment is to ensure that the question of transfer of staff to the agency would be sorted out before a date identified by the Minister; in other words to constrain the powers of the Minister to move professional staff from one area to another which would be unacceptable and unprecedented. The fact that it is unprecedented does not necessarily mean that it is bad.  The level of discretion allowed to the Minister at this point would allow her to move a professional working in Government or the public service at any time.  Such power would be excessive. Under the amendment a certain time frame would operate so that people would be able to plan.  My amendment is reasonable; that the Minister would determine a day before which any transfer of staff would have to take place. Redeployment of staff is always a difficult matter and I would like guidelines on it.</P>

      <P>No transfers will take place without the agreement of the trade union representatives.  My Department are having discussions with SIPTU and the other trade union representatives in relation to this matter.  Section 30 will apply only to employees whose principal functions will be transferred to the agency.  If the agency were to be assigned new or particular functions and people <Col N="1554" /> now carrying out those functions were in the employment of public authorities it would be sensible in a country with limited resources to transfer those people subject to the agreement of the official trade union representative body and so on.</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) a public authority may, with the consent of the Minister and so on, designate staff to be transferred; again one would need the agreement of the staff involved.  There is no question of forcing people to do something undesirable either from the national point of view or from the point of view of the functions they carry out.  If we were to limit the provisions of the Bill to Senator Norris's amendment then only at the time of the establishment of the agency could we transfer people.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the agency's functions would be phased in.  The agency will not be able to carry out the wide range of functions being assigned to it under this legislation from day one and it will take perhaps 12 months or more before all the functions can be transferred to the agency.  Therefore it would not be possible to transfer all the people on day one.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole's amendment suggests limiting a time into the future but that would mean predicting the future. Things are constantly changing in relation to the environment and some of the functions now carried out by other bodies may be transferred to the agency and it would be appropriate to transfer the staff with them.  The next section contains provisions so that nobody would be worse off and other reasonable matters.  There is no question of a heavy hand approach here; on the contrary, it is expected that these matters would all be done with agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome some elements of what the Minister has said.  It is very positive because as the legislation stands there would be powers to transfer people without any consultation.  That is not in the legislation yet, but perhaps it is indicative that the Minister says that she will consider the substance of a further amendment of mine regarding section 32, <Col N="1555" /> amendment No. 129, which would require the Minister to give notification of transfers to the trade unions and to consult with them.  It sounds as if the Minister is moving in this direction.  I welcome that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amendment No. 117, I use the phrase &ldquo;upon the initiation of the agency&rdquo; deliberately because it is vague; it does not say day one.  We would have a period of initiation which is unprecedented and would require justification, but is not bound to be wrong; when an unprecedented move is made one is obliged to justify it as the Minister has sought to do.  I agree with Senator Upton that it marks an erosion of the rights of the employees.</P>
      <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the popular newspaper phrase &ldquo;disturbance money.&rdquo;  The Minister will remember that people received disturbance money for moving as short a distance as 100 yards.  People may change the location of their employment under the provisions of this Bill and that could mean difficulties in re-arranging travel.  It may be impractical for people to remain living in the same area; a person transferred from a local authority in Wicklow to Dublin would probably have to make new domestic arrangements.  This could represent a serious intervention in people's lifestyles. I understand the Minister's argument for rationalisation for avoiding reduplication of professional expertise and so on by concentrating professional expertise within the Environmental Protection Agency but it is a far-reaching power.  I am satisfied that the Minister may prefer Senator O'Toole's amendment to mine or may come up with something different; my concern is for the principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister was prepared to include in the Bill that such changes will only take place following agreement with the trade union concerned, there would be no cause for concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister identified a weakness in my amendment.  None of us can presume that things will not change and that <Col N="1556" /> people would not want to be moved.  I have no principled difficulty with the reasonable transfer of responsibility from an area of the public service to this agency requiring the movement of staff.  The way in which that would be done, however, could create problems.  I have had discussions with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions concerning the workers at Eolas and I am sure that they have also raised this issue with the Minister.</P>
    <P>Eolas are now operating on a profit-making basis and could develop and take on more staff were they allowed to do so. The introduction of this agency will result in members of the staff of Eolas being transferred to the agency leaving a gap in a profitable operation which will benefit the private sector.  Apart from the principle there is a question of efficiency of employment.  Eolas are an example of competitiveness within the public services and the organisation should be developed rather than integrated into the agency. Discussions would be worthwhile on this subject.</P>
    <P>Consistency and precedent are really poor arguments; Dr. Johnston, 300 years ago, had nasty words to say about both of them but I remind the Minister that she introduced it in this debate during talk about the appointment of the director general and the deputy director general when she reminded us how various people have been appointed under other legislation.  I said at the time that because it was done somewhere else does not mean it has to be done in the same way now.  I am glad the Minister has taken my argument on board.  I wish she had taken the amendment on board with the same alacrity as she took the argument.  I would like to hear the Minister re-emphasise that she would be prepared to put into the Bill a sentence to the effect that a change of staff from one part of the public service to the other &mdash; the redeployment of professional people &mdash; would only take place following agreement with the trade union representative of that profession.</P>

      <P>I support the sentiments expressed by the previous Senators in regard to amendments Nos. 117 and 118.  Everything that has been said on those amendments is what I intended to say on amendment 119 which states &ldquo;after consultation with the employee/employees involved&rdquo; where staff is being transferred.  It is only right that consultation should take place with those staff.  Some staff may be appointed to a local authority or another public body and be working in that area.  I can understand precisely what is implied here, there could be duplication if this section was not in the Bill.  It is right that this should be in the Bill but where staff are being transferred it should be done by negotiation.  That is extremely important and I support the sentiments expressed.</P>

      <P>I am pleased that the Minister seems to be taking a conciliatory line on this and has indicated that negotiations are taking place with the trade unions.  However, I am not clear about what the difficulties have been with the precedents which have already been established in relation to this type of practice. I am not clear why they are not working well and why they have not been included in this legislation.  I repeat my concern.  It is spelled out fairly clearly in a letter from SIPTU which talks in terms of the possibility existing of people being compulsorily transferred from secure pensionable and permanent employment as officers, for example, of a local authority to a new agency as employees without security of tenure.  That is a radical <Col N="1558" /> shift, a fundamental change in the terms and in the manner in which people who worked in those agencies have been treated.  I am concerned that that possibility would remain in existence when this legislation is passed.  For that reason I am very worried about the whole matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

I am specifically talking about movement.  I am prepared to withdraw many of the amendments I have down on the basis that the Minister says these things will take place following agreement with the trade union representative of the employees.  I do not ask for any more than that.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 129 deals with the situation very clearly and I hope the Minister will come back on that.  I would like to correct one thing the Minister said.  She said that the legislation as it exists does protect people's rights, including the right of tenure, when it actually does not.  There will be a series of amendments put down.  I am glad the Minister put that on the record at this point because it indicates she understands what I am talking about.

      <P>I will read into the record this one brief sentence from a letter of SIPTU dated 13 March which states: &ldquo;The Bill, unlike previous Acts which provided for the transfer of staff from the Civil Service to new State Agencies specifically excludes guaranteed tenure <Col N="1559" /> of office from the conditions of employment retained by transferred staff.&rdquo; That letter was signed by Paul O'Sullivan, the branch secretary of the relevant branch of SIPTU.

      <P>Because of the extraordinary importance of the letter Senator Upton has just quoted from, will the Minister clearly state if she will take this on board, perhaps not those two amendments as they are, but specifically what Senator Upton has referred to in the letter from SIPTU?  As elected representatives we all know that there was trouble on other occasions when people were moved.  I am not asking the Minister to specifically accept those amendments in the names of Senators O'Toole and Norris but it concerns me that Senator Upton is quoting from a SIPTU letter. That is very serious for all of us in this House and I would like to hear the Minister's comments on that.</P>

I read one paragraph from the same letter into the record earlier but I specifically did not read that paragraph although I am very grateful that Senator Upton put it on the record and drew such a positive response from Senator Honan.  The Minister will have the opportunity to reply when dealing those amendments that relate to the question of tenure because that is not actually what the substance of these amendments is.  We we are dealing with here is simply the time at which the movement of troops is made.  Perhaps we should dispose of those first and then move on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reiterate a point I made at the outset.  Unlike the establishment of many other bodies it is anticipated that as time goes on more and more functions will perhaps be transferred to this agency.  Therefore, it is not possible <Col N="1560" /> to limit at the time when the agency is being established or initiated the transfer to just that point in time or to some point in time that we can foresee, like six months or 12 months.  It may well be that in two or three years from now it will be generally agreed that it is a good idea to transfer functions X, Y and Z performed by some other body to this agency.  Therefore, it would be appropriate, in the interest of economies, the limited resources the country has, and so on, also to transfer the people who work in those areas.  That is why it is not possible, unlike the establishment of other bodies, to have a finite limit to when exactly transfers can take place.</P>
      <P>Many of the problems Senators are concerned about in relation to people being worse off and so on, are dealt with under section 31 (1).  It is certainly the case that nobody will be worse off as a result of being transferred.  Their tenure of office, pensions rights or anything of that kind will not be adversely affected and that is appropriate.  My officials are having discussions with the trade union movement and I hope to be able to come back on Report Stage with a satisfactory amendment.  I anticipate we will be able to have satisfactory discussions on behalf of the staff involved.  It is not intended here to use the heavy hand or anything like that.  Obviously, it is intended that there will be widespread discussion and consultation before the transfers take place.</P>

      <P>In page 26, subsection (1), line 41, after &ldquo;request&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;after consultation with the employee/employees involved&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to take this amendment on board.  It is broadly in line with her comments earlier with regard to this section.  It is vital that the rights of employees who are being transferred are protected.  The Minister pointed out that they will not be requested to take less favourable conditions than they have already, but the fact that they are being transferred could create major problems and difficulties for employees of other bodies &mdash; employees of local authorities or whatever &mdash; who are being drafted in the agency for a year, two years or even for a longer period.  It is important that full consultation would take place with those employees or employee, as the case may be, and their representatives.  Very often decisions are taken without proper consultation with the employees involved in situations which could arise under this section.  This could cause major difficulties and problems and could lead to strike action.  If the Minister accepts the principle of amendment No. 119 and includes it under section 30, it will alleviate the fears of every individual involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the Minister does not intend to use the heavy hand or, indeed, offer less favourable conditions to employees who have been transferred but the transfer, in itself, could cause major problems, not alone for the employee but for his family as well.  That is why I put down this amendment and, unlike Senator Upton, I have not received a letter from any trade union about it.  I see this as one difficulty that could arise under this Bill.  Therefore, I appeal to the <Col N="1562" /> Minister to accept the spirit of amendments Nos. 119 and 120 and introduce them on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I am very heartened by what the Minister has said.  She seems to be indicating that there is a process of negotiation going on at the moment with the trade unions which will lead to the satisfactory framing of such an amendment. Obviously I would consider my own amendment to be the best because it obviates the necessity for a whole series of other small amendments.  It puts in a kind of governing clause that no order shall be made under section 30 of this section without the recognised trade union or staff representative being notified in writing and the representations being considered that would govern a whole series of areas so I think it is slightly tidier.</P>
      <P>Like Senator O'Toole, I do not intend to waste the afternoon by waffling on.  I commend the Minister for the undertaking she has given, that she will be looking at this area very seriously.  We will be back on Report Stage and I will leave the amendment in abeyance until Report Stage.</P>

      <P>It is with a view to proceeding with matters as quickly as possible that I am coming in again.  I want to reiterate what I said during the discussion on the last amendment.  It is my intention, following the discussions that are taking place between my officials and the trade union movement, to come back, if it is appropriate, on Report Stage.  All these matters were dealt with during the discussion on the last amendment and, therefore, I believe we are being rather repetitive.</P>
      <P>I accept the principle of what Senators are saying and it is my intention, too, that there would be maximum consultation, agreement and so on.  It is not the intention to use the heavy hand.  On the contrary, it is the intention to transfer people as smoothly as possible from existing public authorities to the agency.  Subsequent to this discussion I have an amendment which further clarifies the matter in relation to conditions, remuneration, tenure of office and so on, of the people so transferred.</P>

      <P>Again, I will not labour the point.  I am pleased with the attitude the Minister has adopted but I remain puzzled as to why there is a proposed change in procedures in relation to people being transferred to the Environmental Protection Agency as distinct from what happened when people were transferred to An Post, An Bord Telecom, Coillte and, more recently, the Health and Safety Authority.  I do not understand why there is a change.  I do not understand why it is now desirable that there should not be included in the Bill a requirement that the trade unions should be consulted, because that requirement appears to <Col N="1564" /> have been in the legislation which dealt with the trasfer of people to all those organisations.  I remain puzzled by the changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is simply for this reason, with the transfer of staff to those other bodies it was a finite transfer.  They were transferred and that was it.  There was no intention to further transfer people 12 months or two years later.</P>
      <P>This agency's job will be expanding all the time and I cannot say for certain what functions the agency might have transferred to it two or three years from now.  It may well be desirable to transfer to this agency responsibility for a number of matters currently in the domain of other public bodies.  It would, therefore, be appropriate since we are a small country with limited resources to transfer also the people who currently operate and work in those bodies and have responsibility for those functions.  Therefore, it is not desirable to limit the transfer of staff simply to when the agency is being established or to a particular date in the future. It is desirable in the interest of the environment and in the interest of having the best people placed in the appropriate job that we will be able, as we transfer functions, to also transfer the staff.  As I said, those transfers will take place following consultation with the public authorities involved and with trade union representatives and so on.  I do not envisage that there will be much difficulty and we would be very foolish if we were to tie our hands completely.</P>
      <P>The transfers to An Post and all the other bodies were finite transfers and it was not anticipated that other functions and other people would be transferred in the future.  I might add that when the Marine Institute were being established those same provisions existed in that legislation.  Despite the fact that precedents are not always a good thing and one should not always be tied by them, there is a precedent in the Marine Institute Bill for this kind of provision.</P>

      <P>The sentiments the Minister expressed are fine.  I cannot see how <Col N="1565" /> there would be any difficulty in achieving the objectives and the goals the Minister has spelled out if that was qualified by an obligation to consult the trade unions. My view is that the trade unions are quite sensible people, they are quite realistic and I cannot see how it would create any problem if Senator Norris's amendment was accepted <i>vis-à-vis</i> the trade unions, as they would have to be informed and consulted &mdash; and the employers would have to be consulted &mdash; before the transfer takes place.  I am not arguing that matters have to be, as it were, fixed at some moment in time and that they should never evolve.  Obviously they will evolve and I have no doubt in the capacity of the trade unions to put the welfare of the organisation and their own members &mdash; as a first priority.</P>

      <Col N="1566" /> Government amendment No. 123:</P>
    <P>In page 27, subsection (1), line 15, after &ldquo;concerned&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;; and if a dispute arises between the Agency and any such person as to terms and conditions prevailing immediately before his acceptance into the employment of the Agency, the matter shall be determined by the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>All these amendments relate to the tenure of staff transferred to the agency.  My amendment No. 123 is in response to those amendments and I hope it takes account of their intent. Section 31 (1) clearly provides that the terms and conditions relating to the tenure shall not be less favourable than those prevailing on the transfer to the agency from another public authority.  In the normal course of events any disputes will be referred to the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Finance and separate legislative provisions are not strictly required.  However, in order to allay any fears the staff interests may have in regard to tenure I am proposing this amendment for the resolution of disputes.  If the objective of amendments Nos. 125, 126, 127 and 128 to subsections (1) and (2) is to ensure that the staff transferred will not suffer a deterioration in their conditions relating to tenure save in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement, then the matter is already provided for in section 31 (1).  As such the amendments are not necessary.</P>
      <P>As the terms and conditions relating to tenure are provided for specifically in subsection (1) there is a need to exclude this matter from subsections (2) and (3) and this is the reason the words which the amendment seeks to delete appear there.  If the words were not deleted there could be confusion as to what terms and conditions would apply in so far as tenure is concerned.  The wording in this Bill is similar to the wording in other legislative provisions such as the Labour Services Act, 1987 and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for the explanation.  It arose out of a briefing by SIPTU and they obviously read it as I read it.  They put a sinister construction on the phrase in subsections (2) and (3) to exclude the protection of tenure because, it says, that a person &ldquo;shall not, while in the employment of the agency, receive a lesser scale of pay or be made subject to less beneficial terms and conditions of service other than those relating to tenure.&rdquo;  The exclusion of tenure appeared to make the employee vulnerable in the area of tenure.  Having being advised by SIPTU that this was the case I tabled my amendments.  However, I am reassured by the Minister's explanation that it was a technical exercise in drafting.  I will be happy to withdraw the amendments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is grossly unfair and interferes with the right of members of the agency that they cannot offer themselves for election without having to surrender their jobs.  The same thing happens in regard to some of our semi-State bodies; if a member of the board offers himself for election he is deemed to be no longer a member of the board.  That is interfering with the rights of those people.  I sincerely ask the Minister to amend this.  We all accept that people holding elected office should no longer be members of the board or indeed director general.  It is not unfair to ensure that they cannot be members of the board if elected.  However, the legislation as it <Col N="1571" /> stands prevents them contesting an election. That is unfortunate because it is the right of every citizen to offer themselves for election and, if elected, naturally they would cease to hold these offices.  They should, however, have the opportunity of standing for an election if they so wish, although I think it is rather unlikely that somebody of that calibre would be standing for election.</P>

However, when they are elected they get paid, which is a different situation from that of members of local authorities.</P>

      <P>My own amendment is to do with section 35.  However, the two amendments are quite clearly related so I will speak to my own first.  This is about an employee of the agency.  An employee of the agency could be anybody who is not one of the directors or the director general.  It could be the person who cleans the offices; it could be the security person who works there at night; it could be anybody who is an employee of the agency.  The section specifically says that if a person is even nominated as a candidate for the election they should stand seconded from employment.  Let me remind the Minister, because she has not had to go through this yet, that a Seanad election can last three months from the moment of nomination, particularly in the case of the six of us who represent the universities.  It may have changed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking at this stage about the directors; I am talking about the employees.  The provision in section 35, to which my amendment relates, is that somebody would have to stand seconded for three months in order to participate in a Seanad election.  That is a quarter of their annual salary gone for reasons that are not entirely clear. Let us get it sorted out.  If conflict of interests were to be an excluding clause then there are many areas where people would not be entitled to participate because they would have conflicting interests.  For instance, in private education should people be allowed to run on cultural education panels since there would be a conflict of interest <i>vis-à-vis</i><Col N="1573" /> the public policy as enshrined in the Constitution? I am simply saying that one cannot give conflict of interest as a reason for penalising people in respect of participating in elections.</P>
      <P>I am not nearly as enthusiastic about Senator Naughten's amendment as I am about my own because I think there are people in such positions of eminence where a conflict of interest is both visible and apparent and I would be worried about the directors in An Bord Pleanála, as with the directors here, being involved. However, to suggest that somebody who chooses to participate in an election by simply entering a nomination would lose their job on the spot has echoes of certain regimes in eastern Europe that are happily departed.  It suggests that the involvement in politics of itself, even the tentative involvement of running for office, for instance, would involve the loss of one's job.  There have been optimistic individuals who have run from time to time as Independents on panels other than the enlightened university panel, and have not done particularly well. Nevertheless, they have run as Independents, intending to run as Independents. I think that is in the realms of fair comment, whatever the Chair might think of my comment.  However, the director general would have lost his job in such circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied that a real proportion exists between the minuscule political activity of simply accepting the nomination to run for office and the penalty which is resignation from one's job? I am not entirely convinced that is fair.  I think if a director general or a director were to be elected then he or she should make a choice and it should be a definite final choice once and for all, but to suggest that they should not be able to explore the possibility of elective office, using the expertise they have and then clearly, if elected, resign is different from saying that if one as much as puts in a nomination then out one goes, seems to be excessively harsh.  What is excessively harsh is the suggestion that there should be a three months gap in earnings simply <Col N="1574" /> because for instance, one chooses the Seanad.</P>

      <P>Senator Naughten's amendment would allow a director to stand for election to the Houses of the Oireachtas and to the European Parliament while remaining a director of the agency but that if elected the directorship would cease.  Let me say generally that, given the nature of the work of the agency and the need for transparency in its objectivity in so far as the public is concerned, I do not think that board members should be actively involved in political electioneering. In addition, if it is considered inappropriate that a person should be a director once elected then there is logic in a person ceasing to be a director once he actively seeks election.  The effects of the provisions of this Bill are the same as those for the chairman and members of an Bord Pleanála and I see no reason why the members of the agency should be treated differently.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan's amendment would have the effect of allowing an employee to be elected to the Houses of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament while continuing to be an employee of the agency but if nominated to the Seanad or on becoming a member of the European Parliament through the procedure for filling vacancies, the employee would stand seconded from the agency.  I doubt if this is what the Senator had in mind but in any case I feel that we should accept the provisions in the Bill which are the same as those for employees in an Bord Pleanála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would stress again that in considering the provisions in this Bill we should have regard to the nature of the work being performed, including the agencies involved in the development process through the integrated pollution control licences, its input to the environmental impact assessment procedures, its supervisory functions and its advisory role to the Ministers and other public authorities. It is vital for the agency's success that its objectivity should not be open to criticism or become a matter for debate <Col N="1575" /> because of the political involvement of directors or employees.</P>
    <P>First of all, in relation to the director general and directors, I think it would be highly inappropriate that they would seek political office and once they seek it they would have to be seconded from employment. The important thing about the way we are establishing this agency is that we have set out to ensure that, above all else, it is independent.  If it is not perceived to be fully independent it will not be successful and will not have the kind of public credibility which is so very important. If any director or director general were to seek office on behalf of a political party of whatever persuasion it would seriously jeopardise that independence. I feel very strongly about that.</P>
    <P>In relation to Senator Ryan's comments, it is important that the employees of the agency should not be involved either in political activity of a party political nature.  The kind of provisions that exist here exist in the public service generally. Does the Senator think it is desirable that public servants should equally be free to seek nomination and stay in employment while they stand for election to the Houses of the Oireachtas or to the European Parliament?  I think on balance the system we have is a good one.  It does ensure that there is objectivity and that the public service does not become politicised in any way.  Impressions and views of a body are very much formed on the basis of the public persons that are identified with that body, and if a person is identified as having been involved in political party X it does give a view that that body is in some way associated with political party X and so on.</P>
    <P>I have some personal sympathy for the case made by Senator Ryan that if somebody is involved in the agency in a low key position it may seem a little unfair. If however, exceptions were to be made the question of where to draw the line would arise.  It is better to stick to what we have in the Bill which applies to the staff and personnel and directors of An Bord Pleanála and applies in the public service generally.  On balance it is a good <Col N="1576" /> system.  A person does not lose his job but is simply seconded for the time being once he is nominated to contest an election. We will be going on later to discuss local authority elections.  In relation to elections to the Seanad, to the European Parliament or the Dáil, these provisions will apply.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan made an interesting point when he asked if I knew how long a Seanad election goes on.  Of course I do.  An election campaign can go on forever.  One could be a candidate for a year or two, and it would be undesirable that if somebody were campaigning for a long period of time that they would remain and be seen to remain in the employment of a body that, above all else, has always to be perceived to be independent in every sense, to be above reproach and not to be involved in party political activities.  There is also the point that if somebody is involved in campaigning, they are being lobbied, and since this agency will have a function in relation to operating an integrated pollution control licence, I think it would beg questions about conflict of interests and objectivity and so on.</P>
    <P>On balance, while it may appear to be a little unfair if one takes a particular set of circumstances it is better in the interests of the objectivity of this agency that we stick to the norm for bodies of this kind, and that when people are nominated to stand for elections to the Oirechtas or the European Parliament that they are seconded for the duration of that election and on election that they remain seconded.  It also gives the agency an opportunity to fill the vacancy from the earliest date or to take somebody else in to carry out the work for the period of the secondment.  If the agency is involved in paying two people at the same time in order to facilitate one to run for election that would place an unnecessary burden on the agency from a financial point of view.  It is a more minor point.  The main point is objectivity and independence.</P>

      <P>One thing that strikes me about the director general and the other directors of the agency having to retire <Col N="1577" /> if they accept nominations for politics is that it is highly desirable that those people should be seen to have whatever political colour they have.  If they have reached a stage of political development where they are capable of getting a nomination from a political party, I would not like to see any of those people restrained from expressing themselves politically. One of the realities if Irish life is that it is always thrown at us that a certain person is a hack of a certain party.  If they are, then it is good&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know.  There is the odd exception as well.  If that is the situation then it is desirable that the public would know that.  In any case they are not prevented from fulfilling far better functions for the party of their choice by way of running campaigns, tossing in money, providing expertise, etc., which would give them, in many ways, far more political influence and involvement than would being an upfront political candidate. Certainly, if a director of this organisation has the capacity to get himself or herself nominated for any of the major parties then what we are talking about is a fairly straightforward and fairly accomplished political animal.  If that is the situation, those people should be encouraged to come out with it and let the public know it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the Minister is under a misapprehension about where power lies in this State.  If the director general of the environmental protection agency really wants to know where power resides he or she will join certain golf clubs in Dublin &mdash; although a female will not be allowed &mdash; he or she will join &mdash; the chamber of commerce, because power in this State does not necessarily reside within the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I wish it did.  The truth is that there are ways of exercising influence over the director general of the Environmental Protection Agency that are a lot less obvious than by the political route and which will be used and I am not <Col N="1578" /> casting aspersions on whoever the person will be.  However, the activities of lobbyists are not by any means either predominantly or exclusively confined to these Houses.  They operate in all sorts of other areas where perhaps the environment is more conducive, less transparent &mdash; to use the Minister's own phrase &mdash; and therefore all the more likely to be successful and perceived to be more likely to be successful.</P>
      <P>Second, I know very few people in high public office in semi-State or other bodies in this State whose politics are not, once one gets to know a little bit about them, fairly clear.  There are very few genuinely apolitical figures in senior positions in the Irish State sector.  Third, the numbers of people involved in the public sector are very large and quite rightly because I believe in a large public sector.  If one were to exclude all of them in a consistent way under provisions similar to any of these sections 34, 35 or 36, then a huge section of our society would be excluded from participating in politics except on conditions that would be, to say the least of it, quite draconian.</P>
      <P>I am not trying to encourage a campaign on the Minister's part to extend this.  In my own case, for instance, I am still an employee of the City of Cork VEC.  I am not a secondment.  The universities are, in name at least private institutions so they can carry on in their own eccentric ways if they wish.  I operate within a section of the public sector which is covered by legislation, the only area of education which is actually covered by legislation drafted in this State.  The problem about this is not the Minister's intent, but the inconsistencies, the lack of balance in it.  I put down this amendment to raise the issue and to give warning about it.  In regard to my own amendment, all I can say is <i>touché</i>, the Minister is quite right; it would have an effect that I did not intend.  Therefore, on those grounds alone, I shall have to withdraw my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I still think it is a bit much to suggest that if we have large agencies &mdash; some of which are much larger than this one &mdash;<Col N="1579" /> with large numbers of employees, everybody who happens to get a job inside the door of the agency is precluded in the fairly draconian terms of later sections from all political activities.  All it will do is guarantee a fair amount of covert political activity rather than people operating in the open.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>When I put down this amendment I intended it to cover not just the director general or members of the agency but also, of course, the statutory agency.  I reiterate the point I made earlier that I believe it is grossly unfair that a group of people are being deprived of the right to stand for an election.  That is how I see it.  I certainly accept fully that if elected &mdash; whether to Dáil, Seanad, European Parliament or indeed a corporation or county council &mdash; they could no longer be a member of the agency. That is their choice.  If they let their name go forward before the electorate and they are elected, they know the consequences. However, the fact that they have not an opportunity as a citizen to allow their names go forward for election, without putting their job in jeopardy means they are being discriminated against.  As I stated earlier, it is not just in this legislation. The Minister pointed to An Bord Pleanála, but the fact that those regulations exist in An Bord Pleanála does not necessarily mean they are right.</P>
      <P>I know a semi-State director who wished to run for the Seanad.  He had not checked it out and the day he was nominated for the Seanad he ceased to be a director.  He did not get elected to the Seanad and he had lost his position as a director of a semi-State agency.  That is grossly unfair and is depriving people of the opportunity to go before the electorate and to present themselves for elected office.  Whether we like it or not, more people are needed to take an interest in politics.  We do not want to put up a barrier depriving people of the right to go for election.  That is why I tabled this amendment and that is the spirit of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like to support what Senator Ryan said.  It seems to me to be a very swingeing exclusion of people, particularly people a little bit further down the pipeline.  I understand there might be an argument simply in practical terms that the director general of an agency of this kind will have his or her time so fully occupied by the responsibilities of that post that it would be impractical for him or her to take a principal interest in a political career.  That seems to be perfectly clear.  I do not see, for one second, how somebody could be director general of the Environmental Protection Agency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if he were in Strasbourg. It is not feasible or tenable.  It would be an absolute nonsense.  On the other hand, I do not see why somebody lower down the pipeline should not. Surely this would be a useful thing, to have somebody who was environmentally concerned, especially in the Seanad. After all, this is opposed to be the area of the Oireachtas to which persons with particular and special expertise come to bring that expertise to bear upon legislation. I remember, as many will, when Éamon de Buitléar was a Member of the Seanad and brought a very considerable expertise in that area.  I would very much welcome somebody like that who was a member of part of the functioning organisms of the agency if they stood for election to the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very practical point that Senator Ryan made is that Seanad elections cover a long period.  They take a couple of months.  It seems an unnecessary penalty to have somebody removed from the payroll simply because they dared place themselves before the electorate.  I would say, again, that I think this is so serious an infringement of the citizen's rights that I wonder if it is constitutional.  Perhaps the Minister could address that point. Has the Minister looked into this?  It is a right of every citizen to stand for election. Can this kind of legislation arbitrarily do <Col N="1581" /> away with the right to stand for election? I do not believe it can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, as to whether or not it is constitutional, I do not know if this provision in which there is a precedent in relation to An Bord Pleanála and the employment of public servants and so on, has ever been challenged in the Supreme Court.  I am not certain if that is the case, but obviously it is considered constitutional or we would not be doing it.  Sometimes things that are often considered to be constitutional do not stand the test of time when they are challenged. I do not know if it has ever been challenged.  I am not aware of whether it has or not.  Certainly there is a long list of precedents relating to it.</P>
      <P>When we talk about the need for the agency to be independent there is widespread agreement about that on all sides of the House and generally among all the groups that I have met.  What kind of independence are we talking about? Surely one of the most important areas where the agency has to be independent is in the whole area of politics.  Certainly if the director general or directors were to involve themselves with political parties and to seek election, that would seriously jeopardise not just the perception of the independence but the independence itself.  In relation to issues of this kind there are differences between political parties of a policy nature and matters regarding the jurisdiction of the agency. It would jeopardise the agency to have their director general or director involved in active party political activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of course which we discussed on a previous occasion about quorums and getting people to meetings and being able to make decisions.  If we were to delete these provisions, three or more directors could run for election to the Seanad at the same time.  I know the Senator will tell me it is highly unlikely, but as I said earlier, legislation has to cover all possibilities. If three or four directors were all to run and be involved in a Seanad election for three months, and the agency was to make a decision within two months <Col N="1582" /> on a licence application, there would be a difficulty.  Whilst there may be problems with individuals who are in low key positions with the agency by way of employment, on balance this legislation which applies to the public service generally and to the staff of An Bord Pleanála and so on, is the correct approach.</P>
    <P>In relation to State bodies, Senator Naughten said that perhaps there is too much emphasis on party political types. Senator Naughten almost advocates it as an advantage and as something that should be pursued.  I think that anybody taking employment with this agency will be aware from the outset that they are precluded from seeking nomination for election if they wish to stay in employment. If they want to seek nomination, they are not prevented from so doing but they have to take secondment from their employment.  I know in other areas of activity where people virtually have to give up their jobs and are unable to return to them.</P>
    <P>The provisions here are reasonable in all the circumstances.  In particular, the need for objectivity and independence and the reality that that has to be the case, but also the perception that that has to be the case, is very important for the credibility of this agency in the public mind.  Bodies are associated with those with a high profile in the organisations and if a particular person is associated with a political party, it will be assumed in the public mind that that body in general is in some way associated with a particular political party.  I do not think that is a good thing.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan said that he knew the politics of virtually every senior State employee.  I cannot say I share his knowledge because certainly in relation to the public service those whose politics might be identifiable are the exception rather than the rule.  The fact that it is the exception is a good thing.  It means that public servants can work freely and easily with Ministers of all persuasions; their objectivity and sense of purpose about what they are doing is never questioned and their advice is much more <Col N="1583" /> readily accepted as being objective.  That would be seriously jeopardised if political alliances were to be readily identifiable, particularly publicly identifiable.  That would make the relationship very difficult. Therefore, I think the same applies to this agency and, on balance, it is correct that on nomination for election the person would have to take secondment from employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has made a very impressive case and I agree with the position she is taking.  We cannot have it both ways.  If we want the agency to be independent, and be seen to be independent, it must be independent also of party political leanings, I would suggest.  It is very doubtful if the kind of person we want as director general, or as a director, would be the kind of political animal that is implied in a person who has political party affiliations.  Therefore I do not think there is any deprivation there of civil liberties or anything of that kind.  The logic of Senator Upton's intervention would be that ideally all candidates of this kind for the directorship of an agency should declare his or her party political interest, or whether she or he has one, which is absurd.</P>
      <P>Finally, I must say I doubt very much &mdash; I cannot claim Senator Ryan's widespread acquaintance with all these personalities in the semi-State sector, but I have known quite a number of them over the years and I can honestly say that the best of them kept their party political affiliations very close indeed to their chests.  You might glean their political philosophy perhaps, but that is a very different thing.  I think on the whole the Minister has made a very reasonable case.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the Minister's very detailed reply, I am sure there is a certain merit in what the Minister states.  My reason for putting down the amendments was simply to protect the rights of individuals, whether employed or members of the agency.  I <Col N="1584" /> believe that it is a right of every citizen to have the opportunity to seek election. I can see, as the Minister pointed out, the difficulty with the director general; but, as I said earlier to Senator Norris, I do not believe that a person of that calibre, receiving the sort of salary he would be on, would be in a big hurry to rush into the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Taking up another point that the Minister made with regard to my reference to members of semi-State boards, I did not comment one way or the other on the system of appointment; although, let me say, I do not think there is all that much wrong with it.  I think the people who were appointed to those boards over the last 60 years in very many cases did a very good job.  There were, of course, problems in certain areas; but in what walk of life is there not the odd black sheep?  The point I was making was the right of a citizen to stand for election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister a question?  Given what we have said on a couple of earlier sections, particularly on the conditions of service of the staff of the agency and particularly those who could be transferred from, say, a local authority to the agency, is section 36 not perhaps a unilateral change in their conditions of service, because many local authority employees are actually allowed to run for office in their own local authorities? I am not sure how the distinction is made, but I know that below a certain level of office they are entitled to run for office.  If they are transferred into the staff of the agency that right to participate in local authority elections is taken from them by section 36 without any consultation, without any prior discussion with the trade union and without any agreement by a union or staff association. That is an enjoyable little dilemma I want to put to the Minister, but it is not one that will necessarily take us too long. However, it does appear to me to be a problem.</P>
      <P>I really think that suggesting that no employee of the agency ought to be allowed run for office for the town commissioners of the small town in which he or she happens to live, which perhaps has no function, or the local urban council, which might have no function in the area of the issuing of significant environmental licences, is using the proverbial mallet to crack a nut.  It seems to me that there is a middle way here somewhere.  I would accept that there would be a certain incongruity if the agency happened to be based in Dublin, which I hope it will not, and the director general was a member of Dublin Corporation.  That is one thing, but to suggest that somebody who happens to work as a clerical officer or on the ancillary or support staff in many areas of an agency like this, cannot even run for his or her local authority is carrying the precaution much too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case there were any worries about it, it appears to me that the way to deal with the problem of transparency is, when we come to section 38, to make sure that the agency is transparent in <Col N="1586" /> terms of public access to its documentation and information rather than by imposing what is a fairly draconian provision on people.  I would be interested to know &mdash; I suspect there always are in the public service &mdash; if there are precedents for this exclusion of people who are not direct public servants from membership of local authorities.  It is a bit much to suggest that they are only going to have to go on secondment. Given that local authorities do not pay very well, to say the least, secondment effectively means unemployment for the period of four or five years.  I would be intrigued as to the view the Department of Social Welfare would take of somebody who signed on and claimed to be unemployed because they had lost their job with this Employment Protection Agency because they happened to be a member of a local authority.  The Department of Social Welfare would have an absolute ball with a matter like that.  I really think that this is a section which should be looked at again to make a distinction between the directors and perhaps people of a certain level of seniority involved in decision making and the rest of the staff.  Otherwise, it is out of proportion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to concur with what Senator Ryan said and I presume that he would join me in opposing this section.  I oppose the section because I think it is a real intrusion.  Surely at local authority level the kind of people who are environmentally concerned and who have expertise are precisely the people that one would like to see involved in issues concerning the environment.  I cannot think of anything more appropriate than that people who were employees of an environmental protection agency should run for their local authority.  Not only do I not think that they should be precluded from it, I actually think they should be encouraged. May I return to make the point I hinted at earlier in the afternoon, when we were discussing another section, members of local authorities are not paid.  I think there is a very significant difference <Col N="1587" /> between membership of the Oireachtas and membership of a local authority. Membership of a local authority is a function which is done in the interests of the community and voluntarily.  It is an extremely valuable service, in my opinion.  To remove the possibility from somebody of running for election to a local council or town commissioners or urban district council or whatever it is, simply because they were the employees of the Environmental Protection Agency just does not seem to me to make sense. I think it is most unfair.  I think it is grossly unjust.  I must say I had to smile a little when several people committed the spoonerism of calling it the &ldquo;Employment Protection Agency.&rdquo;  That is one thing it sure as hell ain't, if I may use the American expression.  It is not an employment protection agency, quite the reverse.</P>

      <P>It is to ensure that we have clean, green jobs.  Senator Ryan felt this was an infringement on people's existing rights and that it was in some way lessening their rights on transfer to the agency.  I am advised that local authority staff can run for office in a local authority that is not their own or adjacent to their own.  Perhaps we could have a look at it for some classes of local authority staff, if that would satisfy Senators. Generally, the same arguments apply in relation to the director general, the directors and so on and those in senior positions in the agency.  Local authorities have a development role and in that context they will be seeking to have as much economic development as possible in their area.  The agency will be adjudicating on integrated licences and so on. There is a conflict very often between the interests of a particular local authority and the agency's need to be objective in deciding on licence applications and so on.  Conflicts could certainly arise.  If Senators wish, I could look for certain classes of local authority staff, perhaps opening the position somewhat.</P>

      <P>In page 31, subsection (1) (d), line 10, to delete &ldquo;take no part in&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;absent himself from&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments are quite simple and hardly need much argument.  The view is that, if people have an interest which they are required to declare, the logic of that is that they should not be at the discussion. My own view is that, if you have the director general sitting in front of his directors and if he is the sort of forceful personality one would think he or she should be, and he suddenly says &ldquo;I have an interest in this which I am now declaring and I am taking no further part in the discussion&rdquo; he sits back, folds his arms and watches his other four directors discuss something in which he has an interest, that is not rational, sensible or logical.  The sensible thing is for him to absent himself and let them take a decision without having the however slight inhibition of his knowledge and awareness of what they say about a proposal in which he or she has an interest. That seems to me to be logical and reasonable, apart altogether from the question of whether it should be legitimate that a director general of the Environmental Protection Agency should ever have the sort of involvement that would result in these conflicts of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By definition, and in the light of the perhaps quite justified draconian provisions of earlier sections that they have at the same time accepted the possibility that the director general of the environmental protection agency would be the sort of person who might have a finger in the pie of a development over which the agency had a say, that seems to me to suggest a little about the director general which would suggest he was not the <Col N="1589" /> appropriate person to appoint to that office in the first place.  That lack of sensitivity about the possibilities of perceptions of conflicts of interest would be the sort of quality we could do without in a director general in such a sensitive post. If the person manages to walk himself or herself into that situation where he or she has an interest, the logical conclusion is not only should he or she take no part in the discussion but it should be clearly written into the legislation that &ldquo;take no part&rdquo; means absent himself.  That is the precise implication of the two amendments.</P>

      <P>I would be happy to come back on Report Stage and take on board what the Senator has just suggested by way of amendment No. 137 &mdash; in other words, that the person shall absent themselves from the meeting, although I have to say that the fact that somebody does not attend a meeting does not mean that those who want to seek to influence cannot do it through other means.  I accept the points made by the Senator and I will come back on Report Stage with an amendment along these lines.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful to the Minister, as she has been throughout this legislation, for being most patient and forthcoming.  Her patience is even more deserving of praise than her forthcoming attitude at this stage.  I would suggest, in the light of the Minister's acceptance of the principle of these amendments and also the general issue, that it ought to be written down somewhere, by regulation, guidelines or something, that the director general should be advised that it is not regarded as a good thing that he or she should be involved in areas where there might be a conflict of interest and that clear and specific guidelines to persons in those positions, and perhaps to senior people in other areas of the public sector, that a situation of conflict of interest, however carefully and sensitively handled, is not good for the image of any agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as making it clear that in the case of a perceived conflict of interest a <Col N="1590" /> certain procedure should be operated, the circumstances under which that could happen should be minimised and the person who gets that job should be the right person.  There may well be problems with technical services &mdash; consultative groups, a consultant adviser or other person.  A consultant may have a number of briefs going at the same time.  A consultant engineer doing a job for the agency may well be working for a body the agency are investigating or considering giving a licence.  That is one thing.  However, to suggest that the director general or a director of the agency would be involved in either the ownership of land or connected with the company &mdash; the family is different: you cannot be responsible for your family &mdash; that they would be directly involved and had an interest in a decision of the agency is not the way a person in that position should conduct himself or herself.  Therefore, as well as the most welcome agreement by the Minister to amend this section, I ask her to have a look at the whole idea of warning people like that, before they take on these jobs, about the need for a high level of ethics both in practice and also in perception.</P>

If the director general of the environmental protection agency or any of the other directors or bodies mentioned in subsection (1) have a pecuniary or other beneficial interest and if they are prepared to continue on with both that conflict of interest and their other work, the public should know about it.  It seems to me there is a case for publishing that.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 163 and 164 are related and may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 139:</P>
      <P>In page 31, before section 38, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;38.&mdash;(1)  All information other than confidential information obtained by the Agency shall be made available to the public.</P>
      <P>(2)  All environmental information in the possession of public authorities, other than confidential information as defined in this section shall be available to the public.</P>
      <P>(3)  All documents, other than documents or parts of documents containing confidential information, held by the Agency, shall be indexed and made available to the public.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 138 and 142 in my name are attempts to get around the extraordinary draconian wording of section 38.  There are two sections of this Bill which specifically relate to access to information.  One is section 107 which says:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, following consultations with any other Minister of the Government concerned...by regulations provide for the making available by public authorities of information relating to the environment or to any person or persons upon request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It uses the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; not &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  Let <Col N="1592" /> us not get ourselves confused between &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  There are specific provisions in this legislation where the Minister is obliged to make regulations. On the question of freedom of access to environmental information the Minister is accepting no such obligation.  It is something he or she is permitted to do on a timescale he or she wishes.</P>
    <P>At the same time section 38 simply says:</P>
    <P>A person shall not disclose confidential information obtained by him in his capacity as Director General, other director, an employee of the Agency, a member of the Advisory Committee or of a committee or consultative group established by the Agency, a consultant, adviser or other person engaged by the Agency, or a person whose services are availed of..</P>
    <P>Uncle Tom Cobleigh and all effectively are covered by the obligation not to disclose confidential information.  What does &ldquo;confidential information&rdquo; mean? Subection (2) says:</P>
    <P>... &ldquo;confidential information&rdquo; includes information that is expressed by the Agency to be confidential ...</P>
    <P>It is a case of words mean what I say they mean.  &ldquo;Confidential information&rdquo; means anything the agency says is confidential. It would be literally the menu the director general has in his private canteen.  It could be anything, if the group decides it is confidential.  It is limitless, it is endless and open-ended as far as the definition of &ldquo;confidential information&rdquo; is concerned.</P>
    <P>What I have endeavoured to do &mdash; I will be interested in the Minister's reply &mdash; is to say that all information held by the agency other than confidential information should be made available to the public.  In other words, that everything is public except what has to be kept private, not the other way around: everything is private except what has to be made public.  There is a fundamental difference. On one hand you can say everything must be kept private except what we let out.  The Minister can read the painful correspondence between Cork <Col N="1593" /> County Council and various environmental agencies about access to information, where they refused to even give a photocopy of an environmental impact study on the grounds that it would be to troublesome or that there might be a problem of confidentiality or of copyright, that really you must ask the person who drew it up, which is the applicant for a planning appeal, where Cork County Council said they will disclose nothing except what they are told to disclose. You realise that good intentions are not enough here.  Unless we give the public specific rights in regard to access to information, local authorities and other agencies will hold onto absolutely everything until they are forced to disclose it.  It is safer that way.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows more about the European directive on freedom of environmental information than I do. There are a number of principles involved in freedom of information.  One is the acceptance of the principle that the public have the right to know everything unless there are good reasons not to tell them.</P>
    <P>The reason for exceptions &mdash; and this is where my second amendment arises &mdash; is national security.  The mind boggles at the possibility of the environmental protection agency having information which would be genuinely a risk to national security.  There might well be a problem if the Department of Defence wanted to do something and was seeking environmental clearance for it, so we will accept that.  The major cases are those where there are reasons of confidentiality, privacy of the individual, trade secrets etc.</P>
    <P>Bigger countries than ours, with bigger companies, involving more secrets, more information and more trade secrecy, have far more sweeping freedom of information legislation than we have.  My own amendments are effectively taken from the United States Freedom of Information Act &mdash; Act, not Bill.  It works with a limited effectiveness, but it works quite well.  We have had ludicrous cases in this country of information connected with certain matters being refused by State agencies here and being obtained by the <Col N="1594" /> same body that was refused the information here via the United States Freedom of Information Act in the United States.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of philosophical background against which these amendments should be viewed.  My first amendment simply says:</P>
    <P>(1)  All information other than confidential information obtained by the Agency should be made available to the public.</P>
    <P>Arising directly from that is the necessity to make sure that it is not just information in the possession of the environmental protection agency, so paragraph (2) says:</P>
    <P>All environmental information in the possession of public authorities, other than confidential information as defined as this section should be available to the public.</P>
    <P>That is only logical and reasonable. Unless there is a reason to keep it private, it should be made public.</P>
    <P>All documents other than documents or parts of documents containing confidential information, held by the Agency shall be indexed and made available to the public.</P>
    <P>It is simply the requirement to keep documents organised.  If the Minister is surprised as to why I put in the reference to indexation, it is because it is the classic reason given by Governments and public services around the world as to why they cannot guarantee access to information is that the cost of indexing information to make it accessible to the public would be excessive.  The logic of that is, of course, is that there are mountains of information in Government Departments that are not indexed and nobody knows what is in them.  How they can decide information is confidential in the first place is beyond me; but, just to make it clear, obviously it must be indexed and must be made available.</P>
    <P>The first amendment is to simply make all the information that is in possession of the agency available to the public <Col N="1595" /> together with information in the possession of public authorities.  What is critical to this is the definition of &ldquo;confidential information.&rdquo; I accept there are areas of environmental information that need to be kept private.  The information I would accept as being necessarily kept confidential would be as follows: information the disclosure of which would constitute a serious breach of the privacy of an individual.  I do not want us to get involved in a situation where the privacy of an individual would be breached by the disclosure of information, or information which contains trade secrets, or information the disclosure which is likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of an individual.  People have to supply information which can often be extremely commercially sensitive but not nearly as often as many local authorities or public authorities in this country believe.  The Minister probably knows more about Toxnet than I do at this stage, but when the Toxnet data base was set up in the United States many people squealed about the possibilities of commercial sensitivity.  However, only a minuscule number of companies actually used the commercial secrecy escape in order to avoid making data available to the Toxnet data base, which gives people access to information about potentially toxic consequences of various substances.</P>
    <P>As regard the definition of &ldquo;confidentiality&rdquo;, if the Minister wants to talk about national security as in the directive, I am not going to argue with her about that.  If she wants to talk about the area of quasi-judicial activities and internal memoranda related to quasi-judicial activity, I am not going to argue about that.  The terms of the EC directive on freedom of environmental information would do me fine, subject to this: that it should not be the agency which has the final right of interpretation of what those words means.</P>
    <P>The Bill as it stands says that confidential information includes information that is said by the agency to be confidential.  I am perfectly happy to have <Col N="1596" /> the agency the first body to interpret this legislation, but it cannot be the final body to interpret it.  We cannot leave the interpretation of what is confidential information to the body that holds the confidential information &mdash; in other words, if there is a dispute, it must be resolved in the courts, not by the agency having the final say.</P>
    <P>That is where one of the great distinctions in freedom of information legislation around the world.  In the United States Freedom of Information Act it is the courts that resolve disputes between public bodies and the public about the meanings of words.  In the Australian Freedom of Information Act it is the government which says what is meant by national security, not the courts.  As far as I am concerned, if you leave the body which has the information with the final right to decide what the legislation means without any independent scrutiny, then they have <i>carte blanche</i> to keep everything under control that they do not fancy disclosing, whereas if somebody believes the legislation is being operated improperly and people have the clear right to have the courts adjudicate on the information by seeing the information, then we are in an entirely different situation.</P>
    <P>I do not want to get into a long argument with the Minister about the details of my amendments.  What I want is a very clear acceptance, that we are all on the same wavelength, that everything should be made public except where there is a reason to keep it private.  Secondly, the reasons for confidentiality should be only those that are envisaged in the European directive on freedom of information; and, thirdly, the interpretation of what is meant cannot be kept within the framework of those who hold the information. There must be an element of independence in adjudicating on what they mean and that must mean we cannot leave the agency as the final arbiter.  It must be the courts.  There are provisions in Canada in relation to occupational health and safety legislation where, if there is a dispute between employer and <Col N="1597" /> employees about the possible toxic hazards of a certain substance and the employer says: &ldquo;I cannot tell you all about this because it is a commercially sensitive subject,&rdquo; there is an independent agency of three people who actually adjudicate on that information and give the employee a reasonable picture without breach of confidentiality.</P>
    <P>It must be clear that where there is a dispute about disclosure of information the interpretation of confidentiality cannot rest with the agency or with the State.  It must be outside the brief of those who hold the information, otherwise the information would be defined according to their own criteria which are not necessarily in the public interest.  The truth is that the more the public sector says it would not be in the public interest to say something the more they are talking about something the public will desperately want to know about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with my amendment No. 143 which proposes to add the phrase &ldquo;but does not include any scientific or factual information relating to the environment or any information protected by section 107&rdquo; which, as Senator Ryan pointed out, provides for the possibility rather than the obligation of acess to public information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to narrow the offence of disclosure of confidential information.  It is much more general than Senator Ryan's amendment and I am fully in agreement with his amendment.  I am coming at it in a very broad way to make the simple distinction between the kind of confidential information which any sensible person would define as such and the whole area of knowledge which is the public's right to know and, particularly, in all the matters that this agency will be dealing with.  Here is a broad distinction between the need <Col N="1598" /> for discretion in the transactions of the agency on the one hand and the need for the public to have absolute access to information on the other.</P>
    <P>I agree with the spirit and detail of Senator Ryan's amendment which he has admirably argued.  As he has done on previous amendments, he points out again and again the dead hand of inertia and caution, not the intention to cover up things that are going on &mdash; frequently there is nothing of that kind going on &mdash; but the natural instinct to tell very little and only what you have to.  As a minimum, the Minister should take on board the broad distinction between the need to be discreet in transaction on the one hand and the absolute right of the public, especially in this area where we talk about openness.  To have access to information on the other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>All of these amendments are related to the matter of confidential information.  In order to accommodate some of the concerns underlying the Senators amendments I have introduced an amendment to section 38 which makes clear that the agency's power to declare information confidential will be subject to the provisions of regulations made under section 107.</P>
      <P>These regulations will have to comply with the requirements of the European Community directive providing for greater access by the public to information on the environment.  It is intended that section 107 will provide the statutory basis for the implementation of that directive.  Regulations to be made under section 107 will place obligations on public authorities to make environmental data available to the public, subject to a limited number of grounds on which such access may be refused and which are provided for in the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully appreciate the Senator's desire to delimit the scope of the agency's power to classify information as confidential and I understand the intent underlying these amendments.  As I have already stated, my amendment to section 38 clearly eliminates the possibility that the agency can evade the provisions of regulations under <Col N="1599" /> section 107.  I consider that the ministerial amendment will adequately meet their concerns.</P>
    <P>Section 107 provides a comprehensive framework for the introduction of a general requirement on public authorities to provide environmental data to the public. The European Community directive, which must be implemented by 31 December 1992, imposes certain obligations on member states but also allows for a number of safeguards and is, therefore, a reasonable basis for introducing new arrangements in this area.</P>
    <P>I would like to bring to the attention of Senators the grounds set out in the directive on which requests for information may be refused.  The grounds include information where it affects the confidentiality of the proceedings of public authorities, international relations and national defence, public security, matters which are or have been <i>sub judice</i> or are under inquiry including disciplinary inquiries, or which are the subject of prelimeniary investigative proceedings, commercial and industrial confidentiality, including intellectual property, the confidentiality of personal data and of files, material supplied by a third party without that party being under a legal obligation to do so, material, the disclosure of which would make it more likely that the environment to which such material related would be damaged.  The directive also provides that information may be refused where it would involve the supply of infinished draft documents or data or internal communications or where the request is manifestly unreasonable or formulated in a general manner.</P>
    <P>Senators will appreciate, therefore, that there are much wider issues involved here and I would be anxious to avoid any further amendments to this section which would prejudice the implementation of the criteria mentioned above and which would have general application throughout the Community.  I would stress here that not all the types of information to which I have referred would be declared confidential.  The decision will be one for <Col N="1600" /> the agency, to decide whether information falls into one of these categories and, if it does, in some cases they may still release it.  If it refuses to make it available there will be a system for review of such decisions.</P>
    <P>In principle I would not disagree with much of what was said by the Senators and I have looked at the provisions that exist in other countries, particularly in the United States.  Even where confidential information is limited to information that would infringe on the privacy of the individual or personal data, or where trade secrets have to be protected, that can often be used as a huge excuse to withhold a lot of information, so it is not possible always to get a definition that meets all the needs.</P>
    <P>I believe the agency is the appropriate body to decide in all the circumstances whether or not something is confidential. It may well be argued by commercial interests that lots of information falls into the category of trade secret when by no stretch of the imagination could it.  Therefore, on balance, an independent agency such as the one being established by this Bill is the appropriate body to adjudicate on matters relating to confidentiality.</P>
    <P>Obviously we are keen that the provisions of the EC access to information directive will not be in any way evaded by the agency and that is why I have introduced amendment No. 140.  In relation to that directive we can obviously discuss it further on section 107.  Senator Ryan made some comments in relation to that.  It will make environmental information that is in the hands of public authorities widely available to the public. That is appropriate.  I believe information should be made as available as possible.  I accept that there are often costs involved and that they should be met by the person seeking the information.  We have to have some control in relation to security-related matters, although that might not be a major issue in relation to this agency, but matters that relates to commercial or trade secrets or matters that relates to personal data.</P>
    <P>It would only be desirable that this agency would supply information that <Col N="1601" /> relates to the environment and not all information held by public authorities. There are many documents that would be in the possession of the agency in relation to proceedings they may be contemplating taking against somebody where they may feel they are in breach of the law in relation to environmental matters; the agency may be considering taking legal proceedings and may have to get information of various types from professional people in the field and while they are at an early stage, if that information were released to the public it could have serious effects on subsequent legal action.  There are times when it would be important that information would not be made available.</P>
    <P>The gist of what Senators Ryan and Murphy have said relates to environmental data.  Throughout this Bill we have many provisions to ensure that information would be made available, for example, section 64, in relation to monitoring, section 66 in relation to environmental data base and section 86 in relation to the register of licences and so on, and I have given a commitment in relation to the register of interests and making those public.  It is certainly the intention that the maximum amount of environmental data would be made available to the public.</P>
    <P>I believe, in all the circumstances, it is appropriate that the agency would be the body that would adjudicate on matters relating to confidentiality.  In relation to the public not being satisfied that information they sought was made available, under the regulations in section 107, there will be provision for an appeals procedure for people who are dissatisfied. Perhaps we could discuss that when we discuss section 107.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>For a Minister who has been able to defend difficult situations that is among the poorest defence I have heard.  I am really disappointed.  I do not know what the problem is with Irish Governments.  We have a directive of the EC Council saying very specific things that have to be done and the best an Irish Government can do is put into a Bill the <Col N="1602" /> enabling provision that they may do it. Why is there this resistance to giving rights to the public?  Why could we not at least have &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo; in section 107?  Even that would make an enormous difference.  It is not because of some sort of legal precedent because there are subsections referring to regulations in this Bill which say the Minister shall, but specifically in section 107 on the right of access to information the word used is &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The record of Irish Governments in terms of speedy implementation of EC directives is far from good, as is the record of local authorities.  I have before me copies of correspondence with Cork County Council about various matters to do with what could reasonably be regarded as environmental information, for instance, a copy of an environmental impact study which they said they would not supply.  Effectively, what they said, was they could not make copies because it would be too much trouble, that if they had to copy it for one person they would have to copy it for everybody.  A student of mine went to Eolas and he was told he could not have a copy of an environmental impact study because it was a private document.  We were trying to do some perfectly legitimate academic work on something to do with environmental effect studies and he was refused permission. It may have been the individual in Eolas dismissing a student because he did not have time to talk to him but the philosophy of privacy secrecy runs through all of our attitude to information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, I do not know why the technical report of a Bord Pleanala inspector on a planning appeal is not a matter of public record.  If Bord Pleanala choose to ignore or overrule the recommendation of an inspector they ought at least in the interests of proper accountability, have to say in public why they disagree with their own technical experts. I believe that about all State agencies, including the environmental protection agency, where the similar provision for an oral hearing is heard.  That sort of a report done by a competent professional, which makes one recommendation, <Col N="1603" /> should be a matter of public record and the decision of the agency in respect of that should also be a matter of public record.  Otherwise you will not have trust.</P>
    <P>I have found the United States Freedom to Information Act in my fairly considerable research in the area of freedom of information over the years to be perhaps the best in the world.  That Act provides for documents to be provided with what are regarded as confidential matters and matters covered by the exception clauses of freedom of information legislation taken out of those documents.  The problem with the Bill as it stands is that while there are provisions for disclosure of certain matters, monitoring data, etc, and one hopes that they will be as successful as we hope they are, there is still no fundamental and necessary change in the philosophical view about disclosure of information. The most specific statement and the most far-reaching is in section 38 which says you cannot disclose confidential information. I agree that confidential information should be properly preserved and what is genuinely confidential should be kept confidential.  The penalties for disclosure of information which is confidential for the reasons we all agree are valid should be quite severe. I have no problems with that.</P>
    <P>When you leave a body to decide what is meant by the legislation and allow it to interpret the legislation you will have problems.  Anything that is sticky for the agency will become confidential.  If the agency has made a mess of something, why not classify it as confidential?  If the agency itself has information at its disposal which suggests that an earlier decision was incomplete or inadequate, why not keep it confidential?  Environmental information as classified and as defined under section 107 may not necessarily carry into all sorts of other areas.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the willingness to appreciate the public view on many of these issues that the Minister has shown all through this is not evident in her response to these amendments.  I do not expect her to accept my amendments but <Col N="1604" /> the very least I expected was a commitment that there would be an obligation on the Minister to make regulations under section 107 and even that is not there.  Perhaps when we come to it we can talk about it.</P>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed with the Minister's response.  It does not meet any of the criteria.  To suggest that we are bound in some way not to go beyond the EC directive is a very new idea of EC directives because I have a fairly strong view that some of our partner countries in the EC, particularly Denmark, would have regulations about disclosure of information on the environment that would be well in excess of these requirements. I know some of the countries that are considering applying for membership of the EC, such as Sweden, would have regulations about freedom of information that would be revolutionary even by the standards of this directive.  If they join will they have to tighten up and make information confidential that is now public simply to meet the conditions of this directive or will they be free to exceed them?</P>
    <P>Let us remember what we are trying to do.  The Minister's stated view is not to make this country as good as anywhere in Europe in terms of environmental protection. Our view and our intent, and one I share with the Minister, is that this country should be the greenest country in Europe with the best protected environment, the best quality of environmental information, the best quality water, the best quality air.  Part of achieving that is the best informed public, who know more than anybody else in Europe about the quality of their environment.</P>
    <P>If we have these blanket provisions of secrecy, as we have in section 38, only partially balanced by a milk and water section 107 and by the provisions for disclosure the Minister has identified, then we will still have a situation where large public bodies will keep information secret until they see fit to change it or until circumstances suit them.  The Minister is aware that many of the bodies lobbying on the issue of environmental protection find the provisions of section 37 quite <Col N="1605" /> unacceptable.  My view is that failure to amend section 38 to enshrine the principle of access to information will completely undermine the confidence of the public in this agency.  It will be seen to be yet another large body keeping information from the public rather than making information available to them.  I am very disappointed with the Minister's reply.</P>

      <P>There is a misunderstanding between myself and Senator Ryan.  While I do not mind having a misunderstanding if it is appropriate, in this case it is not.  If it would satisfy Senator Ryan I have no problem in giving a commitment to put &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo; in section 107.  I believe we are talking about a technical matter there.  If Senator Ryan is of the view that we are trying to avoid giving out legitimate environmental information, then he is wrong.  That is not the intention.</P>
      <P>Throughout this Bill in a number of areas there is provision to give information, to do precisely what Senator Ryan asks us to do.  I believe, and it is generally the view of the Government, that the maximum amount of information should be given to the public.  In my experience in the past year and a half or so it is where groups and communities do not give information that problems arise rather than when they do.  Far fewer problems arise when information is given than when information is withheld. Therefore, it is the intention to implement fully the provision of the European Community Directive on Access to Environmental Information which requires that all environmental information held by public authorities, subject to the restrictions that I mentioned ealier about security, trade secrets and matters relating to personal data and so on, will be made available to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to much of what Senator Ryan has had to say, if he believes that substituting the world &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo; in section 107 will meet some of the requirements and difficulties he has I have no problem giving a commitment to <Col N="1606" /> come in with an amendment of that kind before we get to section 107.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may well be that I am putting more weight on &ldquo;shall&rdquo; then &ldquo;may&rdquo; but I know the Minister's goodwill on the issue is bona fides so I will not get involved in a long argument with her. There are two other issues connected here, one of which I hope will be covered by section 107.  The other is the agency's right to be the final arbiter of what in its possession is confidential.  The wording of the section &mdash; I accept the Minister's amendment subject to the provisions of section 107 &mdash; even with the Minister's amendment, means that subject to the provisions of section 107 &ldquo;confidential information, includes information that is expressed by the agency to be confidential.&rdquo; That is the sort of phrase that leaves everything that is not covered by section 107 open.  There may be areas to do with the work of the agency that are not confidential by any sense in terms of the EC freedom of information directive that the agency will be free to classify as confidential.  It seems to me that the reverse ought to be the case.  The case ought to be that the public should have the right of access to everything except where there is a reason not to let them know.  It seems to me the agency will be free to operate.</P>
      <P>The agency are not alone in this.  Virtually all legislation to do with a State agency that has gone through this House in which I have had a hand, has a draconian provision about the disclosure of confidential information.  The penalties are usually quite hair raising.  The Minister will make some progress by putting in &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo; and putting an obligation on the Minister to make these regulations.  I still think &mdash; I am saying this to the Minister more in sorrow than in anger &mdash; that the tone of section 38 as well as the content of section 38 will come back to haunt the State in terms of the protection of the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know, as far as the area of the country that I live in is concerned, that the environmental lobby will not go away.  If this agency does not manage to convince <Col N="1607" /> people in Cork city and county, where I know a little bit about the problems that have arisen, that they are in earnest and on their side then public trust will be lost very quickly.  Public trust will be never to be regained if we get any sort of nonsense from the agency, like the nonsense that Cork County Council come out with when they say that they cannot copy a document, from a file for instance on an air pollution licence, and lumps have been taken out of it, because &ldquo;there is nothing in the regulations which says we have to show you what we said to An Bord Pleanala about Penchemicals and their pollution licence&rdquo;.  They take all of that out and say they will not show it to you.</P>
    <P>There are local communities who have received one impression from a company about what they were going to do with an air pollution licence and then discover that something entirely different has been done.  They do not know who did it to them whether it was Cork County Council or the company.  Cork County Council, who are supposed to be defending those people and protecting their environment, will not tell them what they said to An Bord Pleanala about a particular air pollution licence because they say it is confidential.  What are people supposed to believe?  That is not the sort of information that is commercially sensitive. It is sensitive because Cork County Council do not want people to know what was going on.  That is the only conclusion that people can draw.  That sort of wording in a section in a Bill which is about openness and disclosure will confirm suspicions. With that, because I may come back to these at a later stage, I want to withdraw my two amendments.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>As I said earlier, the agency will be obliged &mdash; and this is why I brought in this amendment &mdash; to honour the spirit and law of the EC directive on access to information which requires environmental information to be made readily available to the public.  We have just passed an amendment the effect of which will be that the agency cannot use the confidential clauses as an excuse for not implementing fully the provisions of section 107.</P>

      <P>Will a person who discloses information within the agency, because he feels it is covered by section 107, have protection?  They have, for instance, in the United States legislation to protect what they call &ldquo;whistle blowers&rdquo;, people who work in the public sector and who disclose information that is being withheld and the person can justify it on the grounds of the public interest.  Such people are protected from disciplinary action by legislation in the United States.</P>

      <P>Obviously, if an employee of the agency discloses information that is regarded legitimately by the agency as confidential, subject to the fact that they have to implement the <Col N="1609" /> European Community directive, then that employee is subject to an offence under the Act.  Just like any other offence under the Act, the same penalties apply.</P>

      <P>I am extremely unhappy about the position of members of the advisory committee.  Given the constraints that already exist, and what can be told to the advisory committee, to suggest in addition to that that members of the advisory cannot even discuss what they are giving advice about with the bodies that nominated them without the permission of the agency, seems to me to be pushing confidentiality much too far. The wording is &ldquo;A person shall not disclose confidential information obtained by him in his capacity as.....a member of the Advisory Committee.....unless he is duly authorised to do so.&rdquo;  The agency, in other words, which is supposed to be taking advice from this independent advisory committee will be able to say, &ldquo;You may feel you want to talk to your nominating group about this but we will not let you because it is confidential information&rdquo;. If there is a very little information that the agency have that will be confidential, that will not be covered by section 107, then we do not need section 38.</P>
      <P>This is one of the catch-all phrases that turns up in all sorts of legislation.  It is the inability to think through and the unwillingness to write down in precise detail what is intended.  Catch-all phrases are thrown in and it means that everything the agency says is confidential and, therefore, there is no problem.  I do not like the idea of people who are supposed to be bringing their own individual talents or, more particularly, the individual talents or skills of a group, on to a committee, having to get the permission of the agency before they can discuss the views they should take on issues that come before the advisory committee. That would make their position extremely difficult.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion does not excite me though I will be voting for it.  It does not excite me because I prefer motions that say something, that contain arguments reasons relating to specific issues.  Given some of the things that have happened over the period of office of this present Minister in one specific area, the only way one can vigorously and actively represent one's disapproval of Government policy in a couple of areas is by voting for the motion.  I begin by acknowledging &mdash; and I say this in fairness to the Minister &mdash; some of the positive things that have been done in an area in which I have an interest <Col N="1611" /> which is homelessness.  Unlike his predecessors in office this Minister introduced legislation which made some provision for dealing with homelessness. It was inadequate legislation and some of the problems that I warned the Minister about have developed.  The lack of flexibility on the part of local authorities in using the powers given them, which he was warned about at the time, has resulted in the non-expenditure of funds allocated under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1989, on two consecutive years at least.</P>
    <P>Many of us warned the Minister that he was relying excessively on agencies that had shown no goodwill in the past to show a degree of creativity and imagination in the future.  They have not done so but that Act contains a number of specific things that are most welcome and for which this Minister deserves to be complimented.  He is assured a place in the future for his repeal of an offensive section of the Vagrancy Act of which others apparently could not see the significance.</P>
    <P>If the rest of his record were reasonable that would be enough to give me grounds for voting against this motion.  The trouble is that the good work done in aiding voluntary organisations in persuading, coercing, kicking and dragging local authorities into identifying their responsibilities in a number of areas has, unfortunately, all been buried under the appalling housing record he has presided over.  I have no desire, a Chathaoirligh, to see the homeless provided for at the expense of the slightly better off, nor to see money transferred from local authority housing programmes to be spread in impressive but, in terms of what should be the housing budget, tiny sums of money around the country.  That is the problem I have with this Minister, which is why I cannot vote confidence in him.</P>
    <P>It is not my habit, if at all possible, to abstain on motions and therefore I will be voting for the motion because the collapse of local authority housing provision over this Minister's period of office has been a disgrace.  It is building up <Col N="1612" /> enormous social problems for the future. It will put a strain on those very voluntary organisations that the Housing Act, of which he is in many ways justifiably proud, was set up to help.  Those organisations will be left with the consequences of his failure to provide significant and substantial numbers of local authority housing and low cost housing generally.</P>
    <P>On the issue of local authority housing, we all know that the bottom has gone out of that area of development.  The numbers of houses being built are miniscule relative to expanding needs; housing lists are shooting up at frightful rates and if significant and dramatic funding is not made available to provide low cost State housing we will have again a housing crisis of the scale of the late 1960s. The escape route of emigration, which may have protected the Minister, his Department and local authorities from the full pressures of housing demand, is now effectively closed.  Emigrants are returning and whether they are poor, rich, unemployed or otherwise, they are going to need accommodation.  This Government and Minister have failed completely, categorically and absolutely to make such provision for them.  It is regrettable because it must be known to the Minister and to the Government that this is a short term policy.  The good thing about cutbacks in housing is that they do not strike immediately and when they do, it is at those who are least likely to complain and who may be persuaded or coerced to remain in silence and await their turn in an ever-expanding queue.  A decision taken in 1987 to cut back on local authority housing dramatically and sustained for a number of years does not produce enormous immediate effects.</P>
    <P>It takes years for the queues to build up, for the stories of human misery to accumulate together with the various organs of public opinion.  When you are basking in the glow of the approval of the Establishment for what has been described by at least one major business organisation as the most stringent cutbacks in public expenditure undertaken in the OECD since the Second World War, when you are in a Government who <Col N="1613" /> regard that as a good thing, then cutbacks in housing in the medium-term seem like an easy option.  They do not immediately produce a huge public outcry but, as sure as night follows day, the Minister and the Government, on the issue of local authority housing, have sown the seeds of a multitude of human problems this country will live with for the next 30 years.  There will be problems of family breakdown, juvenile crime, educational non-attainment and so on.</P>
    <P>It was from Fianna Fáil people, including my own father, that I picked up the belief that housing was the fundamental bedrock of social change and to give people a decent house was the best thing you could do to help them escape from the cycle of poverty.  It was from Fianna Fáil that I learned the worth of public housing.  Fianna Fáil had a good record in the area of public housing so it is sad and shameful that they should be the party to decimate the public housing programme as they have done over the past five years.  It would be impossible for me to vote confidence in a Minister who has not only betrayed the poor and those in need of local authority housing but who has betrayed one of the basic values for which his own party stood.</P>
    <P>Anybody who reads the history of the 1920s and 1930s cannot be but aware of the dramatic change that took place in this country when Fianna Fáil decided to build large numbers of local authority housing.  I have seen families living in squalor and misery acquire dignity and pride because they were given a decent house.  In the past four years that record has been turned on its head and we will pay the price for that for the next 20 years.  It is tragic that money made available to fund all the good things in areas of extreme need like homelessness has effectively been taken out of the pockets of the poor.  It is a redistribution among the poor, with most of the undistributed part going back into State coffers to pay for tax cuts for the rich that this Government and their predecessor have been so good at providing.</P>
    <P>This Minister has other fundamental policies that are in need of reappraisal. <Col N="1614" /> He and his Department seem to have an obsession with roads that defies description at the expense of public transport and they ignore the European experience. As more roads are built into a city centre more cars will use the roads; demand cannot be met.  The only way to reduce traffic flow is to restrict use of private cars and expand public transport. The Government programme for development submitted to the EC is slanted in the direction of private transport and, for ideological reasons, hopelessly lopsided against public transport.</P>
    <P>The Minister lacks a proper environmental philosophy &mdash; not in the areas his Minister of State has dealt with so well in this House over the past number of weeks &mdash; but in the area of transport, resulting in the demolition of our cities to build bigger roads and car parks, providing more and more space for more and more people to do damage.  The collapse of social housing which was the bedrock of social justice in this country and the development of a policy which will cause the collapse of cities as places to be lived in, counter balance the good work this Minister has done in a number of specific areas and make it necessary for me to support the motion.</P>

      <P>I would like to share my time with Senator McGowan.  This Fine Gael motion is facetious and opportunistic and coming before the local elections it will be seen eventually as a reflection on Fine Gael rather than on the Minister.  Like a dying breed, they have one last kick and will lash out at anything in the hope of latching onto something, particularly when they are devoid of any constructive policy in the area of the environment.  Is it not comical to listen to Fine Gael calling for the restoration of home improvement grants? How short a memory they have.  Let us examine their performance.</P>
      <P>They provided £27 million for home improvement grants in 1986, yet the total cost of those grants in that year was in excess of £227 million.  It took three budgets to pay for that recklessness and lack of budgetary responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael have forgotten the innovative environmental action programme with which the Minister is trying to counter increasing damage to the natural environment.  He has tackled the problem of air quality, he has set about eradicating the pollution of inland waters and has brought about a responsible attitude to agriculture.  Industry and the environment are now beginning to co-operate, young and old are aware of the environment and there is an interest in recycling and disposal and particularly in the protection of the ozone layer.  Through this programme the Minister has shown himself to be innovative, constructive, far-sighted and imbued with a caring attitude for the well-being of society.</P>
      <P>I ask Members to note the following legislation: the Water Pollution Act, the Air Pollution Act, the Derelict Sites Act, the Local Government Planning and Development Bill and the upcoming Local Government Bill.  These are the achievements of a Minister who is active, involved, reforming and committed to the portfolio given him by the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>We have heard a lot about roads and potholes in recent times but I would like to put a number of figures before the House this evening relating to discretionary road grants.  For the period 1986, 1987 and 1988 the Government provided £89.8 million.  In 1988, 1989 and 1991 they doubled that amount to £182.4 million.  In 1986 the Coalition to which Fine Gael and the Labour Party belonged provided £23 million in discretionary grants.  Compare that with what the Minister is providing in 1991, £68.13 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth having a look at what is happening in local authorities.  In many instances where the Minister and his Department are increasing the amount of grants for county roads we find that local authorities themselves are withdrawing funding they formerly put into that area.  I will give two examples.  In Cork out of our own resources in 1991 we will be ploughing in £11 million and <Col N="1616" /> there is no great commotion coming from the Cork area.  Last year the Minister made an allocation of £2.914 million to Longford.  Out of their own resources in 1990 Longford put in £240,000.  This year they will be putting in £200,000.  Serious questions must be asked about certain local authorities on their commitment to their own county roads.  I ask the Minister to take up this matter with some of these counties and I ask Senators, particularly on the Fine Gael and Labour benches who are members of these local authorities, to take up the matter with their county managers to see what is their level of commitment.</P>
    <P>In the 1970s the State grant element for county and regional roads was 20 per cent; this year it is 56 per cent.  Surely this must be seen as one-way traffic with Big Daddy providing more and more while many local authorities are walking away from their responsibilities by not providing extra funding out of their own resources.</P>
    <P>I would like to use the occasion to pose a question to the Minister.  In view of the increased funding from the Minister's Department for roads, in general, is he satisfied with the cost effectiveness of local authorities?  Is he getting good value for money?  What criteria have been set to get good value for money?  Has he any qualms that road surfacing costs are prohibitive as at present constituted?</P>
    <P>There is another area where the Opposition are vocal.  It is very easy for people like Senator Ryan who are Independent to look for more spending; they have no responsibility for finding the money.  Talk is easy but action is not cheap.  The Opposition, while they are vocal, are advocating policies that are 20 years old with regard to local authority housing.  They have no regard whatever for the changing patterns in housing needs.</P>
    <P>Statistics from local authorities indicate that one person applicants make up 30 per cent of the total demand; families with one child, 31 per cent; a married person with one child, 13 per cent; and a married person with two or more children, 25 per cent.  Therefore, the Minister is sensible to tackle this housing <Col N="1617" /> problem using a range of options.  He has succeeded in doing this through the social housing action programme.  The Opposition are naturally going to belittle that programme yet voluntary bodies and the local authority officials are loud in their praise of it because when its provisions are put fully in place it is going to be extremely successful from a number of viewpoints.  It will give an opportunity to people who cannot otherwise own their own home to share ownership with the local authority.  It is increasing a range of loans and contains innovative and welcome ideas.</P>
    <P>How do those who say we should build more local authority houses propose to pay for them?  Are they suggesting that this Government impose extra taxation? Are they suggesting that we revert to the old syndrome of, &ldquo;borrow now and pay tomorrow&rdquo;?  We have seen and experienced the cost of that type of policy since 1987.  This Government are correct not to pursue that course again.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been most responsible seeing that it costs £80 million this year to maintain, manage and repair existing local authority houses and £200 million to service loans for building of local authority houses while rents from local authority houses amount to something like £40 million plus.  Where was innovation more evident than when the Minister introduced the building societies legislation which converted building societies into modern financial units? Where are the queues for mortgages? They are not a fact of life anymore.  Has anyone mentioned that the tenant purchase scheme was brought in by this Minister?</P>

This Minister for the Environment is a formidable character and a good target.  He is identified as one of the workhorses in the Fianna Fail Government.  He is able to handle the Opposition and is doing a marvellous job. The motion puts me in mind of a Sinn Fein councillor who spent 25 years drawing the dole in England.

We usually ask him where he was for the past 25 years.  It is time he got his feet back on the ground.  We have a housing problem in Donegal which we created ourselves because we did not build houses.  We had a county manager, who, when our housing engineer planned for 36 houses built 12, when we did not have financial problems.  He created other problems.  The Minister for the Environment has recognised this and has given us the second highest allocation in the country.  He has put more money into Killybegs for water schemes this year than the Fine Gael Party did in all their years in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment has given us three times the national allocation for county roads, yet he is lambasted from every quarter and on every current affairs programme on RTE.  Everybody who can get up on a soap box is lambasting him.  My county is getting a block grant of £6 million this year while in 1987 it got £1.2 million.  I find the Minister approachable; you can <Col N="1619" /> discuss and criticise and have a very practical down-to-earth discussion with him. He is one of the best and strongest Ministers for the Environment we have had. Others are entitled not to like him but we do.</P>

I listened to Senator O'Keeffe who is a very adept Corkman, and like all good Corkmen he was able to put the words together and compare Cork to Longford.  That is a wonderful comparison when one considers the population of Cork city and Cork county and the small county of Longford.

I asked the county engineer about this additional funding at the last meeting and all I got was sign language.  I asked the manager and he said he was sorry he could not answer. There is no additional funding whatever. That was misnomer and a misleading and mischevious article to fool the people.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Keeffe said that we are talking before the local elections.  I have been taking part in local elections for a long time and I can remember what was said in 1985.  Certain promises were made to the electorate at that time and they were forgotton about two months after the local elections when Fianna Fail swamped the country with broken promises.  I will not mention them because anyone here with a conscience knows what I am talking about.  I do not need to spell it out.</P>
    <P>This amendment emphasises the record of achievement in the environment. There is one particular aspect of the environment about which I am concerned.  County Tipperary is adjacent to one of the finest tourist areas in Ireland, the Shannon, and in 1987 the Pollution Act was passed on to the Statute Book but that is as far as it went as far as the people in north Tipperary are concerned.  Pollution officers were appointed.  However, in the last four years no additional money was allocated in the rates support grants to ensure that an effort would be made, which we would all appreciate, to resolve the pollution problem.  There was no genuine back-up of funds by the Minister or his Department to ensure that the people put in place would be able to carry out their duties as efficiently as possible.  We all know there are pollution problems but the money was not there to ensure that pollution officers could work to the full extent needed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1621" /> One Senator referred to the amount of moneys allocated for road development. A great deal of money was allocated but as far as I am aware it is only the city of Dublin and its environs that benefited. The further down the country one goes, the less money is allocated.  Cork, Limerick, Dublin and Galway and the rest of Ireland have to make do with very small allocations.  We had a meeting on Monday last and the manager was not in a position to indicate what our financial position would be beyond the end of June.  There are fears that there will be lay-offs and that services will be cut.  I am giving the facts as a local authority member.  As far as I am concerned our country roads system is on the verge of collapse and no matter what part of my constituency I travel in, it is the same story.  This may not be something we want to talk about but it will be an issue in the local elections and Senator O'Keeffe will not be able to avoid it.  I would not wish the Senator to fall into any of the potholes.</P>
    <P>I want now to deal briefly &mdash; it has been dealt with already &mdash; with the housing record of this Minister.  I knew him before he was Minister, I served in the House with him.  He was always a gentleman and I regarded him as a rural Deputy who knew the needs of the people.  However, the last four years have seen the worst housing performance in the history of this State.  At present there are approximately 22,000 housing applicants throughout the country and it is admitted that the maximum we will be commencing in local authority programmes this year will be 1,000.  Maybe that is another misquote.  In 1986, under the Coalition Government, 7,500 houses were built.  Some people only remember those figures that suit them, but that is one figure that sticks in my mind.  This year some 1,000 houses will be built.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Keeffe placed emphasis on social housing.  With all due respects to the Senator, in my humble opinion this new concept of social housing for 1991 is the biggest con job that was every pulled on the unfortunate people who are waiting for houses.  It is expected that this <Col N="1622" /> year 7,500 starts will commence through the social housing scheme.  What about the thousands of people awaiting rehousing?  Senator O'Keeffe admitted that there was need for additional housing but where will we get the money? That is a big change in the Fianna Fáil Party that I have known for 30 years because during my years in the county council, housing was always one of the top priorities.  He also referred to the few mortgages being taken out.  One has to go to a building society or a bank now before a county council will entertain one for a loan, so there can be a third refusal. Let us not talk about mortgages.  That is not what we are talking about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there is no queue. I can give figures from my own constituency and the town of Nenagh.  Thirteen houses are in the process of being built at the moment and there are over 120 qualified applicants.  In the county council in north Tipperary there are nearly 200 qualified applicants and between the houses being started this year and those in planning there will be about 40.  How can anyone stand up here and tell me that we have not got a housing crisis?  Who can say that this Government have not put one of the greatest social problems, local authority housing, on the back burner?  We are no longer concerned about housing the people who need it and as a result in my own town, what was never known in the history of Nenagh Urban District Council, there is illegal squatting.  People are breaking into houses in an effort to get possession of them and we have to get court orders costing thousands of pounds to have them removed.  Surely that is an indication of a housing crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the most bizarre amendment that I have ever come across.  The Senator is in cloud-cuckoo-land if he thinks that there have been achievements in the areas of housing and roads.  I can assure Senator O'Keeffe that, from now until 27 June in Cork and in north Tipperary we <Col N="1623" /> will hear all about the potholes and about the housing situation.  We will wait and see what the people say then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was unable to be present last Wednesday for the first half of this debate but I have noted the contributions of the Senators who spoke.</P>
      <P>I can only express amazement at the audacity and the carelessness of the Fine Gael Senators who have put down this motion.  Had they checked the record of my period as Minister with that for the 1983-87 period, they would not be here tonight attempting to prove the impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had the honour of serving as Minister for the Environment for over four years.  I am entitled to claim that each of those years has been marked by the launch of new programmes and initiatives, a legislative record second to none, concrete achievements and progress in traditional fields of endeavour, the development of new policies and services, continuous refinement and improvement of existing programmes and measures and firm leadership both in my Department and of the local government system generally.  The Fine Gael Party in this House, by putting down this motion, have given me and my colleagues in the House an opportunity to have some of these achievements written into the record of the House, and I am grateful to them for that.  It may have seemed to Fine Gael to be a good tactical move, in advance of the local elections, to set up a debate which would enable them to criticise me &mdash; and through me the Government of which I am a member &mdash; under a variety of headings.  They obviously believe the old maxim that if one throws enough mud some of it is bound to stick.  However, I am going to resist the temptation to engage in mud-slinging, enjoyable as that pastime can be.  I am not, for example, going to waste time describing the sorry state in which I found the local government system, its finances and its services, when I took over from a Fine Gael Minister four years ago.  The <Col N="1624" /> total indebtedness of the local authorities at that time, which were near bankruptcy, was in excess of £80 million.  I am sure Senators on that side of the House will be pleased to know that that debt has been brought under control and, in fact, the indebtedness has now been reduced to below £50 million.</P>
    <P>Instead, I want to concentrate on the positive developments for which I and my colleagues can claim credit, and on the further developments that are in prospect. Due to the limited time available, I will not, of course, be able to go through all the areas for which I have responsibility and in which there have been significant advances since 1987.  However, even a short selection will be enough to show that the motion put down by the Fine Gael Senators totally lacks substance.</P>
    <P>I will deal with housing matters first. Senators will recall the Fine Gael dominated Government of the mid-eighties which attempted to introduce legislation to deal with the problem of homelessness.  They introduced a Bill in 1985 and almost two years later left office with the Bill still not enacted.  So much for their concern for the homeless.  In little over a year of taking office, I saw to it that the Housing Act, 1988, was on the Statute Book.  This major piece of legislation revised and updated every aspect of the statutory basis for the local authority housing programme, provided extensive new powers to housing authorities to meet the needs of homeless persons, and went far beyond what was proposed in the 1985 Bill by effectively decriminalising homelessness.  On top of this, I made additional resources available to voluntary organisations and to local authorities to secure proper accommodation for the homeless.  At least the other Senator Ryan was prepared to accept my very good record in dealing with that matter.</P>
    <P>The only concrete suggestion from the Fine Gael side to deal with housing problems has been to advocate the reintroduction of a grants scheme of the kind they inflicted on the country in 1985.  The situation I found in regard to public <Col N="1625" /> expenditure commitments under this scheme, on becoming Minister for the Environment, was truly appalling.</P>
    <P>Grants approved totalled almost £230 million, with applications still coming in at a rate that was adding £5 million a month to this staggering figure.  This alarming legacy of public debt resulted from a crude attempt to buy survival by the then Fine Gael led Government; to court short term popularity they introduced a hastily conceived open-ended grants scheme under which expenditure could neither be predicted nor controlled. They gave large handouts of taxpayers' money to individuals, regardless of their means and in respect of often inessential or cosmetic works.  This scheme pre-empted resources which could have been put to far better use in other parts of the housing sector.</P>
    <P>I am still paying the bills for this extraordinary episode.  It has cost the Exchequer some £200 million to date. How can anyone in these circumstances advocate the reintroduction of grants on a similar widespread basis?  But that is what Fine Gael Senators seem to want. When they complain about the inadequacy of funds for other schemes, they should remember the irresponsible legacy of commitments which they left behind four years ago and which are still being paid off.  Fine Gael in this debate show no understanding of or responsibility for, the state of the public finances.</P>
    <P>On 14 February last, I launched the plan for social housing.  The plan is the most comprehensive response to social housing needs ever presented by a Government in this country.  The policies laid out in the plan will provide a more diverse and better targeted response to the housing needs of those households unable to secure adequate housing from their own resources.</P>
    <P>The role of the local authorities is being greatly expanded and enhanced and a range of new options to meet housing needs are being made available to them. Those new powers will enable local authority housing schemes of the future to be smaller in scale and more sensitive both to the needs of the tenants and to the <Col N="1626" /> needs of the areas in which they are to be provided.  Few would seriously advocate the building of large new local authority estates for single parents yet these represent one of the largest categories of need on the waiting list.</P>
    <P>The plan offers real hope of decent housing to meet needs such as those that have become more complex and more difficult to resolve satisfactorily.  The plan will develop the complementary roles of the local authority and voluntary housing sectors and will, in future years, be recognised as a major landmark in social thinking in this country.  The great regret is that some Opposition speakers in the House cannot or will not accept real progress in social housing when they see it.  They simply do not understand the new thinking that pervades social housing throughout the whole of Europe and which is being brought forward here in the most imaginative and futuristic plan ever conceived and brought to the House.  They simply do not understand it and I would recommend that it should be prescribed reading for every one of them from now until the elections on 27 June.</P>
    <P>I was taken aback at Senator Naughten's attack on the provision of funding to voluntary housing organisations.  Shame on Senator Naughten.  This is not surprising, given the level of funding by the Coalition Government in the eighties, which he supported.  I have increased funding in this area to £11.5 million in 1991, compared to £1.9 million in 1986. That is a real recognition of the role that voluntary housing can play and will play in this country.  They have recognised the usefulness of this social housing plan; they have commended me on giving them a budget line for the first time ever for voluntary housing.</P>
    <P>Among the specific initiatives in the plan for social housing are proposals to deal with some long-standing problems which previous governments were unwilling to tackle.  I am providing £2 million in 1991 for the provision of bathrooms in local authority houses which lack them. This has been demanded for 25 years but no Government were willing to identify that one particular area that needed <Col N="1627" /> special treatment but it is being done and it is being started this year by me.  I am going to make the concept of shared ownership a reality.  This has been frequently mentioned and often promised in the last decade but I am the first Minister to succeed in coming up with a viable scheme.  The rights of private tenants are being safeguarded with new requirements in relation to rent books, standards and notices to quit.  This is another item that was promised and suggested for many years but nobody had either the courage or the capacity to do it until I came along.  All of this, and all of the other housing measures I have not had time to mention, add up, I suggest, to a credible and effective response to social housing needs.  At the same time it is my intention to continue with the programme of local authority house building for those who cannot or never will be in a position to provide housing for themselves.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators commented on the state of our road network.  This gives me an opportunity to restate the Government's determination that Ireland should have a road network appropriate to the needs of a modern economy and to put on the record evidence that we intend to deliver on that.  The clearest indication to our commitment to the development and maintenance of the road infrastructure is the enormous sums of money which we have provided for this purpose. Total State expenditure on road maintenance and improvement has risen from £166 million in 1986 to £234 million in 1991.</P>
    <P>Since 1987 a total of £970.17 million has been provided in State road grants, over £300 million more than the amount provided in the five years before 1987. Within this total, discretionary grants for county and regional roads have been increased from £23 million in 1986 to £68 million in 1991, almost a threefold increase.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the enormous financial mess the 1983 to 1987 Government left behing, including the bills of over £200 million for the housing grant <Col N="1628" /> schemes I referred to earlier, how can Opposition Senators suggest I have not been successful in obtaining substantial funds from Government?  The figures speak for themselves.  The Government's response in the aftermath of the near-bankrupt state in which we found the State's finances can only be regarded as truly magnificent.  I will put on record now the exact position in so far as discretionary grants in county councils are concerned.</P>
    <P>In 1989 block grants given by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition amounted to £15.4 million; The western package brought in £2.6 million and a county roads strengthening &mdash; that magnificent effort on behalf of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition at the time &mdash; amounted to £5 million for the whole country, leaving a grand total of £23 million for that work in 1986.  In 1987 and 1988, my first two years was increased to £15.4 million, the western package to £3 million and county roads strengthening was increased from £5 million to £15 million, leaving a grand total of £33.4 million.  In 1989 the sum was increased in total to £47.4 million in 1990 to £66.88 and in 1991 to £68.13 million.  Let the record show the figures.</P>
    <P>Last December I launched the operational programme on peripherality, the most important transport investment programme in the history of this State. Road investment under the period of the programme will amount to £615 million, of which £416 million will be recouped from the EC.  When road expenditure under the programme is added to the non-programme expenditure, almost £1,000 million will be spent on roads in the five years 1989 to 1993.  Twenty nine major improvement projects are scheduled for completion and 28 for commencement during the period of the programme.</P>
    <P>Let us talk about the non-national roads.  Primary responsibility for funding works on non-national roads have always rested with the individual local authorities concerned.  Traditionally, work on those roads was financed from local resources with limited support from State <Col N="1629" /> grants.  Local authorities continue to provide local resources to help maintain those county roads.  They provided almost £50 million this year. That is good, although I have to say Senator O'Keeffe is right, some counties do much better than others.  Some counties can traditionally provide £3 million per year for the improvement of their county roads, others find that they cannot manage £300,000.  It is up to the Minister to top up these resources and provide the money that I have already mentioned and spelled out in some detail.</P>
    <P>Arising from concern about the deterioration of the network of county roads, the Government at my initiative provided significantly enhanced levels of road grants in the last few years to supplement local authority expenditure.  For the first time ever here, at my suggestion, the Government agreed in 1988 that they would commit themselves to £150 million over a three year planned programme. That had never happened before, it was dealt with year by year often the money coming to the local authorities half-way through the year.  Now they get it in advance of their estimates and they can plan their business.  I insisted on a threeyear programme, £150 million of discretionary grants to the county councils for the upkeep of their roads.  That was in addition to their own resources imput. This has been more than fulfilled.  It was no idle promise.  In fact, total grants over the three years will amount to £182.4 million.</P>
    <P>That is some indication, which even I recognised, that £150 million was not adequate to do the job despite the fact that the year before I took office the total sum was £23 million.  That is all the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government going out of office thought of the road network.  If there is any shortfall in the maintenance programme, if there is any shortfall in so far as the reconstruction of the roads are concerned, it is because of the legacy of poor management, mismanagement and neglect by my predecessors in office.</P>
    <P>The conditions governing expenditure of the grants were also changed at my <Col N="1630" /> discretion in 1989 to give more discretion to county councils and to allow more funds to be spent on surface restoration. That was never allowable by any other Government until I came along.  I gave the discretion and I will maintain that discretion by incorporating it into statute in the new local government reform Bill that will be coming before you next week, le cunamh De.  That will make it absolutely clear that local authority members will decide where and how to spend the discretionary money that I have given them in such great abundance over the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to a &ldquo;pothole blitz&rdquo;.  Let us settle this now. There have been suggestions that the 1991 discretionary grants will be spent before the local elections, leaving no money for essential maintenance for the rest of the year.  I am disappointed that Senators would trot out that line at this time.  Let us have a look at the facts.  On 12 April last I met the city and county engineers. When I asked for urgent action with regard to potholes caused by the couple of inclement winters which we had, and the severe frost that breaks up the roads &mdash; Senators know that these roads were laid down some 30 or 40 years ago for different weights and different types of usage than that which they are now committed to &mdash; the response I got was one that I was expecting, very positive and emphatic.  Whether this remedial action can be termed a &ldquo;blitz&rdquo; is a question people will have to answer for themselves.</P>
    <P>As regards funding, the 1991 road grant allocations were notified on 6 March.  Returns to my Department up to the end of April show that some £9 million of the £68 million allocated in discretionary grants for regional and county roads had been expended.  This is not surprising, having regard to recently improved weather conditions.  It leaves almost £60 million in grants for the remainder of the year.  When added to the sum of nearly £50 million contributed from local resources, this should ensure that sufficient moneys will be available for remedial work throughout the year. <Col N="1631" /> Even the casual observer, any kind of fair commentator, would have to be impressed at the level of finance which I have provided and I have arrangements in hand to achieve better value for the money by an agreement with the county and city engineers.  I am not saying that we are getting full value for the £120 million that Senator Ryan talked about but I am saying that it is a considerable sum to be expending on the maintenance and construction of our county roads network. It is far in advance of anything that was contemplated just a few short years ago before I took office.</P>
    <P>We will move to another item.  This is a different item but one that is of considerable importance to me, the matter of urban renewal.  The Government's drive to promote urban renewal in cities and towns throughout the country has been particularly successful in recent years.  Our economic policies have created the right climate for private sector investment.  The designated areas scheme for urban renewal which I have highlighted since I came to office, has increased the opportunities for investment and resulted in much worthwhile development in parts of our urban areas which had been derelict and has lain dormant for years.  Nothing was done in that regard until I took office.</P>
    <P>The scheme stimulates redevelopment of urban areas by the private sector through the provision of a package of taxation incentives and rates relief for development in specifically targeted areas.</P>
    <P>In 1988 I extended the urban renewal scheme to nine provincial centres, Athlone, Castlebar, Dundalk, Kilkenny, Letterkenny, Sligo, Tralee, Tullamore and Wexford.  The results in these areas to date have been most encouraging.  A total of £120 million worth of development is either completed, in progress, or in planning.  In 1988 I also designated an area of some 120 acres in Tallaght, a move which was directly responsible for promoting the development of the new Tallaght town centre as well as giving rise to other proposals in Tallaght valued at <Col N="1632" /> £10.4 million.  That involved hundreds of new jobs being created both in that area and in the other designated areas where the developments are taking place.</P>
    <P>With the success of the scheme in these areas, I extended it to a further eight provincial centres in May last year, as well as designating additional areas in the five county borough.  Already in these areas, just one year after designation, private sector development valued at some £37.4 million has been generated between projects completed, in progress and in planning.</P>
    <P>Since its inception the scheme has led to over £600 million worth of development. This is an addition to the Custom House Docks development in Dublin valued at some £400 million.  Much private investment has been attracted here because of the economic situation that has been brought about by the rejuvenation of the economy by the Government and there are thousands of jobs involved in that.  I did not hear much mention of that matter from the other side.  These facts clearly show that the charge made by Senator Naughten &mdash; and it is well to put it on the record now &mdash; that the urban renewal plan for 1986 for designated areas has suffered severely because of the Minister for the Environment is clearly without foundation and is unsustainable.  I wondered when reading the Senator's comments if he either lives in this city at any time during the year, and certainly if he lives in the country the rest of us inhabit.</P>

      <P>I cannot remember interrupting any of the Senators while they spoke.  It has never been my practice and I will not start now.  Certainly it would be an interesting exercise if I were to go through each county, but it would take too much of our time.</P>
      <P>Let us have a few words about the environment. <i>Promise and Performance</i> was the title given to a series of papers on Irish environmental policies published in 1983.  It concluded that, too often, policy seems to consist of throwing shapes, that, in effect, it was strong on promises but lacked performance.  That situation has changed dramatically since I became Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>I have often claimed to be the first Minister for the Environment who gave top priority to environmental issues and the Minister who ensured that the Department became a real Department of the Environment.  That claim needs to be sustained and I am prepared to sustain it here this evening.  Let me mention a few points to sustain that claim.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive environmental action programme, the first by any Irish Government, was published by me in January 1990.  This is a concerted and wide-ranging set of measures to conserve and enhance the quality of Ireland's environment.  It has been widely welcomed not just here but even among my colleagues throughout Europe.  Environmental legislation has been strengthened by a number of important new provisions &mdash; the Air Pollution Act 1987, the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Act 1990, the Environment Impact Assessment Regulations, 1989 and it will be greatly expanded by the Environmental Protection Agency Bill which we are discussing right now.  Dublin smog has been successfully tackled, as have fish kills.  The fish kills we all talked so much about in 1987 have been substantially reduced by increased local authority enforcement and advice and grants provided for farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Presidency of the European Communities was strongly supportive of <Col N="1634" /> the environment.  Its achievements included the first major declaration on the environment &mdash; the Dublin Declaration &mdash; by EC Heads of State and Government at an inaugural meeting between EC and central and eastern European Environment Ministers.  That was initiated by me, the first time ever the political environmental leaders not just of the Community but the eastern European states at my invitation came here for the first face-to-face talks on environmental issues that will affect us all until the end of this century.</P>
    <P>At home a new awareness and a new concern for environmental issues has been actively promoted.  A major programme of investment in water and sewerage treatment services in the present decade has been set out in the environmental action programme.  An investment of £1 billion will be involved; £300 million for improved public water supply schemes; £400 million for coastal sewerage treatment works and £230 million for inland sewerage treatment works. The figures I know are staggering because Senators opposite were never used to those kind of figures when they followed the leadership they followed up to 1986.</P>
    <P>Significant advances are being made in every area of my Department during my term of office.  We have increased housing output and launched the new plan for social housing.  Fresh thinking, the kind of thinking that has been around for a long time in other civilised democracies was never attempted here until I put it on paper.  All it requires is a bit of goodwill and a little promotion, and the money will be provided to enable it to work.  We have prepared and published five year programmes for roads and sanitary services and we are implementing them vigorously. The money says it all in those areas.</P>
    <P>We are pressing ahead with the environmental action programme.  We are actively promoting urban renewal in our major cities, removing dereliction that had never been tackled until I became Minister.  Provincial towns are also involved on a scale that was never thought about a few years ago.  We have <Col N="1635" /> revitalised the planning system by eliminating the compensation problems which bedevilled our system for over 20 years and by providing for environmental impact assessment.</P>
    <P>Against this background of solid achievement it is sad to see Fine Gael squander the time of this House with a motion that is nakedly party political and designed only to score a few cheap political points at this time.  Regrettably, I have to say, the motion is just another sad reflection, of the barren state of Fine Gael political thinking today and shows the paucity of political thinking within that unfortunate party today.</P>
    <P>This House already has before it the Environmental Protection Agency Bill and we will be dealing with the Local Government Bill next week.  In the past four years the House has seen the passage of the Air Pollution Act; the Urban Renewal Act; the Building Societies Act; the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Act; the Planning Act; the Derelict Sites Act; the Building Control Act and the Housing Act of 1988 and in the coming months the House will be invited to debate the Roads Bill, which has already been presented, together with the major electoral Bill; a planning bill; a new housing bill; a waste bill and a road traffic bill, many of which are at an advanced stage of preparation in my Department.  That I suggest is an impressive record by any standard.  Dare I suggest also that the time of this House could more profitably be employed in making progress with the important legislation that is before it than in debating sterile motions like this which are no more than an effort to gain political advantage in the run-up to the local elections.</P>
    <P>I am confident the House will recognise the motion for what it is, a sterile motion, and reject it.</P>

I support this motion and I reject this amendment because of the total failure of the Minister, and indeed of the Government, to honour their commitment to properly fund local government services and to fully compensate local authorities throughout this country in respect of the abolition of domestic rates in 1978.  I support the motion and reject the amendment because of the dismal failure of the Minister to deal effectively by way of a proper road fund allocation to deal with the potholed roads we have in every parish, town, city and, indeed, in every part of rural Ireland; Because this is the Minister and the Government whose long delayed local government Bill has raised such a chorus of disapproval, first, of the content of the Bill, many provisions of which display a cynical disregard for the democratic process and, second, the speed with which it is planned to put this Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister has just indicated that he hopes it will be before this House next week.</P>
      <P>This is the Minister who has quite clearly lost the battle at the Cabinet table. I believe that the councillors throughout this country and the public at large have lost confidence in the Minister for the Environment to secure an adequate and proper funding for local authorities and for the many programmes he has just outlined but for which he has been unable to get funds.  This is the Minister whose party in 1977 decided to abolish domestic rates and promised every citizen that local authorities would be fully reimbursed and compensated by way of Exchequer funding from the domestic rates support grant.  This, as we all know, has not happened.  This fact alone has strangled the independence and the funding capacities of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the urban renewal programme as if he was the Minister who initiated it, as if he was the Minister who succeeded in passing the Urban Renewal Act of 1985.  Of course, we all know it was John Boland who was <Col N="1637" /> the Minister who initiated that innovative programme of urban renewal.  The Minister talked about Limerick city and indicated that there was great success in some cities, but the rate support grant to Limerick city in 1991 is now only £2.2 million.  I would like to put it on record, a Chathaoirligh, that this represents a shortfall of £5.6 million in the domestic rate support grants to Limerick Corporation. That means that whereas in 1978 the domestic rate support grant accounted for some 25 per cent of total income, now in 1991 it accounts for a mere 11 per cent of total income.</P>
    <P>One of the major items impacting on the financial affairs of local authorities, especially in the larger cities and urban areas, is the cost of insurance, particularly public liability insurance.  This is a matter which has received little or no attention from the Minister or indeed from his Department.  In the case of public liability, the number of claims made against Limerick Corporation, a medium-sized county borough authority, is indeed alarming.  A total of 130 claims were made against Limerick Corporation in 1990 and it is estimated by the city manager that the overall claim against the corporation in respect of that year would be in excess of £2 million.  To put that statistic more strikingly, a public liability claim is received at the City Hall in Limerick every second working day. Of course, the vast majority of these claims arise because of insufficient moneys from Central Government in regard to the proper funding and maintenance of roads and footpaths.</P>
    <P>The road building programme and the road maintenance programme would bear close examination.  I know of no group of people who are so frustrated as the motorists because of the dreadful, potholed condition of our national, regional, urban and rural roads.  I know of no country in Europe where more money is collected from the motorist than in Ireland.  When one takes into consideration the amount of tax on petrol, the purchase price of a motor car, the amount of road tax and the level of insurance, there is no group in the whole <Col N="1638" /> of Europe as heavily penalised as the Irish motorist. There is, I suggest, no group in the whole of Europe who have worse roads to travel, whether they be urban or county roads.</P>
    <P>I did not hear the Minister make one single reference to urban roads, as if Limerick city, Cork city and all the urban areas did not exist.  In regard to my own local authority, Limerick Corporation, the roads department of Limerick City Council and the Limerick City Council itself unanimously adopted the following resolution &mdash; it was supported not alone by Fine Gael, but by Fianna Fail, the Progressive Democrats, the Labour Party and the Independents&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Limerick Corporation deplores the totally inadequate roads allocation received from the Department of the Environment and calls on the Minister for the Environment to make available an additional and supplementary allocation to enable the roads and footpaths to be maintained in a reasonable condition.</P>
    <P>That resolution was passed unanimously by the members of the Limerick City Council and the Minister's own party and the councillors in Limerick subscribed to that resolution.</P>
    <P>That resolution can be seen in the context of a comprehensive roads refurbishment programme which was submitted to the Department and the Minister in September 1987.  That programme modestly envisaged an average annual expenditure of £1.5 million on the urban road programme, an average annual expenditure of £9 million on the footpath programme and an average annual expenditure of £6 million on the public lighting replacement programme.</P>
    <P>What was the response of the Minister for the Environment?  Limerick has been very badly neglected in spite of all innovation and effort and drive in the urban renewal area.  We have been very badly treated.  The level of grants in no way reflects the fact that Limerick city is the regional capital of the mid-west, as I am sure Senator Honan will agree.  It is <Col N="1639" /> indeed the transportation hub of the Dublin, Cork and Shannon carriageways.</P>
    <P>We have been taken out of the priority for Structural Funds for the North Ring Road which, incidentally, met all the criteria set by the Minister and his Department. We received only £200,000, which is one-tenth of the £2 million required for this roadway and this £200,000 will only meet the costs of land acquisition and the archaeological work that must be done.</P>
    <P>We have received a block grant.  I would like the Minister and also the Leader of the House to listen to this.  We have received a miserable block grant of £193,000 to meet the cost of the total maintenance and repair of footpaths in the city of Limerick.  We are receiving not a single penny, no grant whatever, in regard to the national secondary roads such as the Dock Road in Limerick. Then, of course, there is the failure of this Minister to accelerate and to properly fund in the light of the Siney case in the High Court and in the Supreme Court, and in the light of the Coleman case against Dundalk Urban District Council, the refurbishment of houses in areas in Limerick such as Prospect, Kil-meedy and Sean Heuston Place which are without bathrooms, running hot water, and so on.</P>
    <P>This was the Minister for the Environment, it is useful to remind Members of this House, who abolished the Metropolitan Streets Commission which was set up to revitalise the hearts of this city and that was done for petty, party political reasons.  This was the Minister for the Environment who abolished the Dublin Transportation Authority which was set up to monitor and to regulate traffic in the city of Dublin, again done for petty, party reaspons.</P>
    <P>I believe this motion that Seanad Eireann has no confidence in the Minister for the Environment represents an accurate assessment and presentation of what a very large section of the public throughout this country believe and, what the councillors of this country believe, including councillors in Senator McKenna's party.  I have heard meetings <Col N="1640" /> of the general council, the party councils and other statutory agencies deplore the fact that this Minister was never accessible to his own council, and deplore the fact that he had no interest in the development of local government.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I note with total amazement and disbelief the amendment that has been put down by the Government.  I believe that Seanad Eireann should refuse to endorse this record of failure by the Minister.  It is not a record of achievement; it is a record of failure.  Otherwise this Minister, who at times comes down from heaven to <i>terra firma</i>, will continue on this road.  He will continue to provide this country with more potholed roads.  I cannot believe that the major Government party are either serious or credible in putting down this motion.  I hope all the Members of this House, for whom I have the greatest respect, will reject this amendment and will pass this motion.</P>

      <P>I would like to look at it from my own perspective on Dublin City Council.  I was elected in 1985 to the city council when people were leaving the city centre after 20 years of a Fine Gael and Labour controlled city council.  The city looked terrible.  There were 160 acres of derelict sites in the city centre and people were living in almost Dickensian conditions in inner city flats.  Since then we have had a Minister who has put hundreds of millions of pounds of private money into redeveloping Dublin's inner city.  The city has been cleaned up, it looks better than it did since he came to office.  Inner city flats are being refurbished and people have better living conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin's air has been cleaned up and people feel that it is much cleaner and healthier compared to the smog we had when the city council was controlled by Fine Gael and Labour for 20 years and when they did nothing about it.  In regard to Dublin Bay, the Minister has allocated <Col N="1641" /> money so that we can have proper sewerage treatment works.  It is outrageous that a motion like this should be put down against a Minister who, as far as I am concerned and as far as Dublin is concerned has done a lot of work.  Of course, we would love more money and we would love to do more work, but we understand that there must be restraint.</P>
    <P>As far as potholes are concerned, Fine Gael have fallen into a political pothole and will not get out of it for a long time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the points made by Senator Kennedy and other Members of the House on these benches this evening and last week.  It is very regrettable that the other side of the House are so adamant in their support of the Minister at a time when it is quite obvious that he has failed miserably not just on one front but in a variety of areas.</P>
      <P>Roads are the most urgent issue of all. We have roads that were built many years ago for transport and vehicles that were totally different to the traffic now on those roads.  Sight has been lost totally of the fact that there should be a massive injection of money put into these roads to bring them up to 1991 standards to accommodate the traffic they are carrying now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As was said, and it is worth repeating, there are enormous sums of moneys being collected from the heavy transportation vehicles, such as lorries and vans, from motor cars and so on.  There is no excuse for leaving these roads &mdash; and it would appear the Minister agrees they have been left &mdash; in the state in which they were originally built.  It is a very serious matter when roads, built perhaps 80 or 90 years ago for traffic of that time, are just covered over and are not given a proper foundation to carry the transport of today.  This situation needs urgent attention.  The money is coming <Col N="1642" /> in.  People using those roads are paying heavily for them and there is a very serious danger due to potholes.  Life and limb are at stake.  People have been injured and killed as a result of severe potholes on minor roads.  We must not lose sight of the fact that our major roads, which effectively have been financed from the EC, are in good repair and capable of carrying the vehicles using them.  In parts of Clare, Kerry, Roscommon and elsewhere where there are important industries and developments, we have a network of roads that is deplorable.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to refer to the housing situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the lecture we received from the Minister. In fact, one would even think he was questioning the authority of Members of this House to put down such a motion.  I must say I was appalled at the Minister, a man who has served in the Oireachtas for many years, questioning any political group for putting down a motion which they know is correct, with which many Members on the far side of the House genuinely agree and which many councillors throughout the country know is true because, day in and day out, they <Col N="1643" /> meet their constituents who are not housed, who have no proper roadways to their houses and many of whom are unemployed simply because this Minister has lost the battle at the Cabinet table to get sufficient funding for the programmes in his care.</P>
      <P>Take, for example, the situation I have outlined.  I noted the Minister in his reply picked a couple of points on which to reply.  However, he did not answer the question with regard to the diabolical local authoritty housing situation.  He managed to avoid that because his record on that is diabolical.  After successive Ministers for the environment reduced the housing list and tried to get people into proper accommodation, this Minister has stood idly by.  He has failed to get the funding and now the housing list is increasing again.  The Minister presided over the abolition of the house improvement grant scheme.  Need I point out to my colleagues here the tremendous improvements that were carried out throughout the country to our stock of housing, particularly our pre-1940 housing, under the scheme introduced by John Boland as Minister for the Environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the houses throughout this country were modernised, and the Minister knows that. It avoided the very heavy cost to the Exchequer of building alternative housing. Not alone that, it got people to spend their own money.  It created jobs but many of the small contractors who carried out that work are now working in London and Birmingham.  That is a fact of life.  It is happening in the Minister's own county and throughout the west of Ireland.  It is adding to the unemployment and to emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new scheme the Minister referred to is like something one would pull out of a hat.  It would result in the local authority owning one half of the house and the building society the other; the individual will be paying a loan for one half of his <Col N="1644" /> life to the building society and for the rest of his life, if he lives, to the local authority.  He will never own his house. That will not wash, and the Minister knows it.  The Minister will have to reexamine that scheme and introduce something more practical when it comes to legislation.  There is no question about that.</P>
    <P>We have the abolition of the SDA loans which again has had a devastating effect on many people trying to rehouse themselves throughout rural Ireland.  When we come to the road structure, my colleagues here have pointed out the diabolical conditions of many of our country roads.  Senator Ryan pointed out the newspaper headlines implying that there was another £124 million for our county road structure.  What the Minister did was call in all the county engineers throughout the country, told them go out and spend that money, spend it before the local elections and do not worry about the rest of the year, try to get a situation where we take the county roads off the agenda for the local elections. We all know that the amount of money being made available for our county roads is totally insufficient.  We all know our county roads are breaking up and are falling into disrepair.  Unfortunately, again the Minister has sat idly by and allowed this situation to develop. That is one area in which we could create tremendous employment.</P>
    <P>In regard to the social employment scheme, the Minister will agree with me that the county councils are the single greatest employer.  What has the Minister done?  He has allowed a situation to develop where these people are employed and could be doing very useful work but, unfortunately, he has not taken the initiative to have discussions with the unions, to get them to agree to allow the roads to be edged, clean up the water-tables, cut the bushes.  That part of the work is not being done&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That Bill is before the Dáil this week and coming into the Seanad in two weeks' time, three weeks before the local elections.

As has been pointed out by Senator Kennedy, the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission and the Dublin Transport Authority, all of which were up and running, were abolished.  As a result, Dublin and the country are all the poorer.</P>
      <P>The Minister has failed at the Cabinet table to get sufficient money.  Indeed, my colleagues on this side of the House and myself are not the only people who believe that.

      <P>This removal of discriminatory provisions from worker protection legislation where there is no longer justification for their inclusion is in accordance with the provisions of the EC equal treatment directive. The draft order before the House today will allow women in all occupations, including manual occupations, to work below ground in a mine.  As required by the Act, I consulted the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federation of Irish Employers about this proposal. I have also consulted the Employment Equality Agency and the Council for the Status of Women.  All organisations consulted agreed with the proposals.  The draft order requires the prior approval of each House of the Oireachtas by way of affirmative resolution and I strongly urge Seanad Éireann to express such approval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister for State to the House and thank him for taking my motion on the Adjournment.  I am asking the Minister and the Government to treat retiring Garda fairly.  They are being denied their full pension payments.  I believe the Government must include all pay allowances in calculating the pensions of the retired members of the force.</P>
      <P>It is a feature of superannuation in the Civil Service and in other public sector organisations that pay allowances are reckonable for pension computation. Gardaí are exceptional in that allowances in the nature of pay earned by them is not pensionable.  Gardaí receive these allowances regularly as basic pay and they are part of their normal living expenses and it is unfair to omit them from calculation for pensions.  The reduction in income which gardaí experience when they go on persion causes more hardship than would be the case if they were retiring from similrly compensating grades in other parts of the public sector.  In fact, they are entitled to 50 per cent of their pay as pension but they only obtain 40 per cent.  They have a net loss of 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>Gardaí, nurses, prison officers and fire brigade personnel all receive special allowances calculated in an identical formula in respect of duty at weekends, at night and on public holidays.  These allowances are pensionable in the case of all groups concerned with the exception of the Garda.  Members of the Garda Síochána are being treated unfairly and ina discriminatory manner because the allowances in question, when paid to them, are not calculable for pension purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give part of the history of this claim which goes back to June 1978.  The Association of the AGSI, which was then known as the representative body for inspectors, station sergeants and sergeants lodged a claim on 16 March 1978 with the Garda Conciliation Council <Col N="1651" /> seeking to have all allowances in the nature of pay declared reckonable for the purposes of the Superannuation Acts. The claim was discussed by the Garda Conciliation Council on 8 June 1978, 20 June 1978, December 1979 and March 1980.  It was discussed with the Garda Representative Association on 20 June 1979, 12 December 1979 and in March 1980.  In the course of these discussions a working party was established consisting of representatives of the official side, the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice, and the staff side, members of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and the Garda Representative Association.</P>
    <P>During these working party discussions the official side stated that they had been authorised by the Minister for the Public Service to make an offer on the claim which constituted the granting of 15 different allowances but excluded were 12 different allowances, including subsistence allowance, overtime allowance and rent allowance.  They stated that the guiding principle was that the allowances should be those in the nature of pay only. The staff side objected to the offer on the basis that it did not provide for averaging over the entire rank and entire force and rent allowances were not included as pensionable allowance.  The official side saw rent allowances as a disbursement allowance rather than in the nature of pay and, as such, could not concede it.  In relation to allowances being paid to individuals, the official side stated they could not entertain the concept whereby a member not drawing a particular allowance would benefit pensionwise in respect of same.</P>
    <P>Following regional meetings and in-depth consideration by the conciliation council, on 22 September 1980, 11 years ago, it was agreed a mediator from the Labour Court would be brought in to undertake mediation in the case.  Mr. Michael Corcoran, director of the conciliation service, was appointed mediator but no progress was made on 27 May 1981 when he chaired proceedings.  The staff association then stated a claim in accordance with the provisions of the <Col N="1652" /> conciliation and arbitration scheme through the arbitrator and the claim was heard.  Following the findings of the board further discussions took place to determine arrangements in regard to pension contributions in respect of allowances declared reckonable for the purpose of the Superannuation Acts.  A major fall-out of the findings was that members of the force who retired prior to 1 October 1982 had never had rent allowance taken into account for the purpose of calculating their pensions.  It has been a major point of bitterness for Garda pensioners and has always been seen by them as unfair and inadequate.</P>
    <P>Gardaí working the regular shift, the shift work that involves tours between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m., between 2 p.m. and 10 p.m. and between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. encompassing Saturdays, Sundays, Bank Holidays and night duty, also feel very unfairly treated.  They receive allowances in respect of working these unsocial hours.  They pay PAYE and PRSI on these allowances, yet they are not considered reckonable for pension purposes. The members feel very aggrieved especially on two fronts.  They see their colleagues, who work basically Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. with bank holidays off, and therefore at home with their families at Christmas and Easter, having to perform no night duty and in receipt of allowances which are pensionable, for example, instructors, radio technicians, clerical, <i>ex officio</i> weights and measures inspectors and so on.  The sense of grievance and unfairness has increased over time and these allowances have increased in value thereby giving rise to improved gratuities and pensions. The sense of unfairness is also experienced on a broader front.  Prison service personnel and fire brigade personnel have unsocial allowances taken into account for gratuity and pension purposes.</P>
    <P>As time goes on, the sense of grievance is deepening and the other pensionable allowances grow and become more valuable, thus widening the difference in pensions. Gardaí are becoming increasingly <Col N="1653" /> angered by the unfairness of the treatment as they see it and are putting tremendous pressure on the AGSI and the GRA to bring about a solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>Gardaí on the ground who face the gunmen, the burglars, the terrorists, the violence at all hours of the day and night, 365 days of the year, cannot accept that at the end of the day they are worth less in terms of gratuity and pensions than their colleagues whom they deem to be in much less vulnerable and hazardous conditions.  The members would further argue that things have changed fundamentally since arbitration findings in 1982.  We now have the Criminal Justice Act for treatment of persons on custody regulations and the Garda Complaints Act.  These pieces of legislation are the primary concern of the gardaí on the ground, requiring an increased expertise on his or her part as well as providing for a far greater degree of in-depth examination of his or her actions.</P>
    <P>A final aspect to this problem is that the Ryan committee of inquiry gave superintendents and chief superintendents a substantial increase in pay to compensate for not qualifying for unsocial hours payment.  This pay increase was reflected in subsequent pension and gratuity.  In the interests of fairness and justice, steps should be taken to rectify the situation at an early date. Surely if the Minister for Finance could see his way to accommodating claims in 1982, the present Minister can give sympathetic and positive consideration to the matter at this stage.  The Minister might claim that there would be repercussive effects.</P>
    <P>There are three groups who work around the clock and are in receipt of a rent allowance and of unsocial hours payments, namely, gardaí, prison officers and fire brigade personnel.  Fire brigade personnel have both rent allowances and unsocial hours taken into account for gratuity and pension services.  Prison officers have unsocial hours payments pensionable but do not have the rent allowance pensionable.  Gardaí have rent <Col N="1654" /> allowance pensionable but not unsocial hours pensionable.</P>
    <P>The repercussive claims arising from the concessions of pensionability of unsocial hours payment to gardaí would be concessions of pensionability of rent allowance to prison officers.  There are currently just over 2,000 prison officers. On the basis that 100 were to retire per year, the annual cost per hundred would be £300,000 in gratuity and £75,000 in pension costs.  This does not take into account the payment of pensions to persons already retired, neither does it take into account contributions to be paid by the members concerned in respect of pension: The calculation has not been accumulated over the years in terms of years spent in retirement.  Finally, one would argue that the next cost by the Exchequer would be minimal in repercussive terms when one takes away contributions, PAYE and PRSI deductions.</P>
    <P>The members of both the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors are becoming increasingly frustrated and angry with the failure to accommodate this very legitimate claim.  The sense of grievance is growing day by day. Members of the AGSI were in the Dáil last week during Question Time.  The full executive were there when questions were asked of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>I can see huge pressure building up especially since many of the gardaí spent 30 years working unsocial hours for which they received no recognition at the end of the day.  We boast, and rightly so, that we have one of the best police forces in the world.  They are a necessary arm of the institutions of the State.  With the Army they protect the institutions of the State.  I do not see why they should be singled out to be treated unfairly when other people in the public service receive gratuity and pension on their full pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to say that only last night in the Dáil I had an opportunity to put on the record of that House the Government's appreciation of the excellent work being done <Col N="1655" /> by the Garda Síochána in the fight against crime.  I am very pleased to have an opportunity here now to put that appreciation on the record of this House also.</P>
      <P>As Minister of State at the Department of Justice, working in close co-operation with my Minister, Deputy Burke, the Minister with immediate responsibility for the Garda Síochána, we are always conscious of the need to treat the members of the force fairly, in all matters affecting their conditions of employment.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it might be useful to the House, if I were to indicate briefly the formal procedures that are in place for dealing with claims relating to pay and other conditions, including the pensionability of allowances, of members of the Garda Síochána.  The Garda associations fought hard in the past for the establishment of the Garda Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.  The scheme, which is similar to schemes operating elsewhere in the public service, was established in 1959 and provides for a conciliation council and an arbitration board both of which are designed to deal exclusively with pay and other specified conditions of service for members of all ranks of the Garda Síochána up to and including the rank of chief superintendent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme was reviewed in 1977 and in the light of experience was refined and expanded to the satisfaction of all the parties to the scheme, which included the representative associations of various Garda ranks.  The scheme, I believe, works well at present, as is evidenced by the fact that the Garda associations have secured significant benefits under it for their members.  In the recent past those benefits included two special pay awards <Col N="1656" />&mdash; totalling 16 per cent &mdash; which are over and above the general pay increases.</P>
    <P>Pensionability of allowances is a matter which is appropriate for discussion under the Garda Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.  I believe Senators will agree with me that it was never more important than in the current industrial relations atmosphere that parties to agreed procedures and mechanisms respect and abide by those procedures and mechanisms. It would, I am satisfied, be wholly inappropriate for negotiations on this type of claim to be conducted across the floor of this House.</P>
    <P>I can, however, tell the House that a claim to have payments for unsocial hours made pensionable is currently the subject of negotiation at the Garda Conciliation Council.  Confidentiality of proceedings at the council is a feature of the scheme and it is a feature that must be respected by all parties to the scheme, including the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance, if the scheme is to maintain the confidence which is so necessary and if it is to operate efficiently and effectively.</P>
    <P>In view of the circumstances I have outlined, I am sure the House will appreciate that I have gone as far as I can in responding on his matter bearing in mind that, in so far as the matter related to specific claims which are before the conciliation council, I have to be careful not to breach the confidentiality of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I trust that the foregoing clarifies the situation and puts the matter in context for this House.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 9 May 1991.</P>
