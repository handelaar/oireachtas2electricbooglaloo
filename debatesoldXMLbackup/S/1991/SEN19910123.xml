      <P>Let me welcome back the Members of the House for the new year and wish everybody well.</P>
      <P>I have notice from Senator Liam Cosgrave that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism and Transport to review the availability of late night public transport, including the operation and availability of taxis together with the bus and DART services.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Dan Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that the new primary school approved for Kilcornan, County Limerick, is constructed in 1991.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to outline the criteria used in the distribution of national lottery funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Cosgrave, Neville and Ross as suitable <Col N="666" /> for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Cosgrave's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Neville and Ross may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take item No. 3, the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990&mdash;Second Stage until 6 p.m. to have a sos from 6 p.m. until 6.30 p.m. and from 6.30 p.m. until 8 p.m. to discuss the Labour Party motion, item No. 66.  In relation to No. 66 I propose, as on similar occasions, that the speech of the Senator proposing the motion shall not exceed 20 minutes and the speech of any other Senator shall not exceed ten minutes.  We will resume the debate on the Environmental Protection Agency Bill at 8 p.m. and continue until 10 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, there is a number of points. First, may I compliment the authorities on the extremely good job they have done in relocating the television cameras?  The two to my left are not obstrusive.  All credit is due to the authorities for making the change so speedily and so well during the Christmas period.  Second, may I thank the Leader of the House for responding so promptly to the request from the Opposition parties to have a debate tomorrow on the Gulf crisis?  We appreciate the opportunity to fully discuss that matter.  Third, may I offer the sympathy of my group to the family of the late Senator Bryan Alton, former Member of this House for the NUI panel?  He was an extremely distinguished physician, a man who made a great contribution to the world of medicine and the world of the university.  He was a very humane and fine doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>First, as I asked before the recess, will the Leader of the House outline the programme of legislation he intends taking in this House this session? Would he distinguish between what is <Col N="667" /> being initiated in this House and in another place?  Will he indicate any change he might see in the operation of the House?  We had a number of discussions on various aspects of the changes that might be made.  A matter of particular interest to us, which has been raised already by the Independent and other groups in the House, is the need to expand Private Members' time.  I wish to hear the views of the Leader of the House on that.</P>
      <P>There remains on the Order Paper a number of items which we raised during the last term and sought to have some movement made on them.  I want to refer specifically to Item No. 10: Intermediate Education (Amendment) Bill, 1989.  It is a</P>
      <P>Bill entitled an Act to amend the Intermediate Education (Ireland) Act, 1878, for the purposes of removing a statutory obstacle to free access to secondary education for girls and of deleting a discriminatory subsection regarding the education of girls.</P>
      <P>We have raised this issue time and again. It relates to a matter of discrimination.  I do not intend making a speech, but this issue must be addressed and it can be done by very simple amending legislation. I would ask your view on that, and on the matter of a nuclear free zone.  We discussed this on previous occasions and got commitments from the Minister for Energy at the time that the issue would be looked at.  We were aware there were some difficulties for medical institutions which might have to deal with certain substances which would need to be exempt from a nuclear free zone.  Now is the time to take action on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to the number of papers which are laid before the House today.  It is impossible for any Member, no matter how committed or how diligent, to deal with so many.  How are Members expected to deal with this?  Is it possible to raise issues arising from the papers laid before the House?  Is it possible to pick out one, and raise it and ask questions at <Col N="668" /> this stage or to ask for a debate on it? We should not have so many papers laid before the House at the same time.  I realise this happened because this is the first sitting day, but it is impossible to cast an eye over all of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me join in the expression of sympathy to the family of the late Dr. Bryan Alton.  I want to thank the Leader of the House for allowing the debate on the Gulf crisis tomorrow. Would it be possible to have a debate on the GATT talks at the earliest opportunity? Also, would it be possible to reconsider the arrangement for raising matters on the Adjournment?  Each day there are a number of items raised and it would be a great help if more than one item could be taken.  I would have no objection to a shorter period being given to each item, even as little as ten minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>May I join with other Members in expressing the sympathy of the Progressive Democrats group to the family of the late Senator Alton.  I agree with Senator Manning about the television cameras, because I was very critical of their location, and the fact that they were spawning offspring.</P>
      <P>I join with Senator Upton in asking the Leader of the House to provide time for a debate on the GATT and also on the whole question of the manner in which the Commission proposes to advance cuts in farm spending.  It is quite laudable to protect farm incomes but at the same time we must not remove the competitive advantage or the competitive base of the whole Irish agricultural industry and that is what is at stake here.  I realise that the Leader of the House has, in the past, frequently made time available for these matters but things are moving very rapidly and I would ask him to do so again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the debate on the Gulf I would ask the Leader of the House to bring the concern of the House to the attention of the Government about our troops in Lebanon and to tell us what plans the Government have to ensure the safety of the members of the 58th UNIFIL battalion in Lebanon in the <Col N="669" /> event of the war escalating.  I do realise Lebanon is far away from the main theatre of war but now that Israel appears to being drawn increasingly into the conflict, the families of Irish troops in Lebanon are very concerned about their safety.  I would ask the Leader of the House, in whose home town there must be concern too about this matter, to bring this concern to the attention of the Government. Perhaps we can have an answer tomorrow during the debate or maybe the Senator has an answer now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>You will recall that as we discussed the Companies Bill in this Chamber before Christmas there was a simultaneous leak of the inflation figures which resulted in some insider dealing on the Stock Exchange.  At that time the Taoiseach promised a full investigation and indeed a report on what actually happened. I understand that investigation has taken place.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House when we may know what this report holds and when it will be published?  I would also like to support the call for a full discussion in this House at the earliest possible opportunity on the GATT talks.  Could we add to that the most important issue of the recent attempts to reform the Common Agricultural Policy and the implications of that for all sectors of agriculture and agribusiness in this country.  The Leader of the House was gracious enough to concede a full day's debate, if I recall correctly, on agriculture during the last session but things are moving very quickly in this vital area and as soon as is possible I would request that we have the same facility again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I have your guidance in relation to item No. 66 on the Order Paper.  I assume this motion refers to the port access and eastern relief route. This matter is currently before Dublin City Council.  It is part of the draft development plan and that plan is on display to the public until March.  At this moment democracy is being implemented.  The people are having their say in relation to the port access and <Col N="670" /> the eastern relief route and I believe it would be untimely for the Oireachtas to interfere now with the democratic process of the local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to item No. 66 which was tabled by Labour, no doubt Senator Haughey will have the opportunity, if he so wishes, to address the motion when it is being debated later today.  That is the time to deal with it.  I would like to compliment the Leader of the House for setting aside tomorrow for a debate of the Gulf crisis.  That is very appropriate.  I trust the Senator will remember the reasonable promise he made to allow debate on current issues, one of which would be on the prisons, early in the new session.  I would also ask him to add to the list of current important issues that he might consider for debate, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  That programme will cover three years and has implications for the entire decade.  It would be most appropriate that the House have an opportunity of debating it because it has been agreed outside the House.  It is important that the Legislature have an opportunity of debating it fully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I start on a positive note by thanking the Leader, as many of my colleagues have done, for allowing a substantial debate on the war in the Gulf. I notice that a number of my colleagues used words like &ldquo;situation&rdquo; and &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; whereas what we have is a war.  Last week we had a crisis, now we have a war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Senator A Senator">
      <NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a crisis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think semantics are extremely important and I stand over my comments.  May I say also, in the context of what I have said, that it is a pity the Leader did not put down a motion which reflected the realities of today rather than the aspirations of ten days ago about what is happening in the Gulf.  He could still rewrite his motion to reflect on the fact that there is now a war in progress and that the consensus of the Western forces is that it will be a long, bloody and unpleasant war, that it will not be over quickly and that some of the aspirations are somewhat dated by the realities that now exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="672" /> One of the realities of that war is censorship. Therefore, may I ask the Leader in regard to No. 36, if my reading of Latin Roman numerals is correct, Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 (Section 31) Order, 1991 on the Páipéir a leagadh faoi bhráid an tSeanaid &mdash; Papers laid before the Seanad &mdash; if it is the order under section 31 of the broadcasting Act to censor our own media?  Given that this order has been in force for numerous years and is rarely debated in either House of the Oireachtas will he provide Government time to have a debate on the order under section 31 as it is laid before the Seanad so that this censorship of our media should at least come under the scrutiny of the Oireachtas?  It is a bit much to have many sections of our media tut-tutting about censorship, particularly the type of censorship that now exists in the Middle East, while we have an extensive and broadly ranging censorship.  A debate would be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I agree with many of my colleagues who seek a debate on the crisis in agriculture. May I add my area of interest to that.  I would like to have a debate which took a fairly strong look at the distribution of income within agriculture. When 80 per cent of the total income from agriculture goes to 20 per cent of those who earn that income there is an almost Third World level of maldistribution of income.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge the Senator to put a question to the Leader of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to have a motion on the GATT negotiations can we simply not talk about agriculture in global terms and talk about the Third World maldistribution of income which rewards the richest farmers and leaves the rest impoverished?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I join in sympathy to Dr. Bryan Alton's family and also in tribute to the man.  He was one of the leading figures in Irish and European medicine in the post-war world.  He was a larger than life figure in more senses <Col N="673" /> than one.  He was a great person, a great teacher, a great doctor and a former Member of the Seanad.  I would like to pay tribute to him and extend sympathy to his family.  I welcome the decision of the Leader of the House to have a debate on the Gulf War.  The crisis in the Gulf was raised at our last meeting before Christmas and I very much appreciate that tomorrow morning we will have a debate on the war.</P>
      <P>I should also like to express the hope that we will not have to have a debate on what is happening in Europe where the independence of three small countries is being greatly threatened.  Let us hope Mr. Gorbachev will relent so that the campaign which seems about to be instituted against those states will not be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to those who have called for a debate on the GATT negotiations and the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  There is a rather naive view abroad that this issue only concerns farmers but anything that will cut the flow of capital into this country by perhaps £400 or £500 million will affect the whole economy.  This issue is so important that it deserves an indepth debate.  We should have such a debate soon because the GATT negotiations are due to be completed some time in March, and, as I see it, part of the price to be paid to the United States will be reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House should express its thanks to Senator Brendan Ryan for informing us that there is a war in the Gulf&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;an event that might otherwise have escaped our notice.  I would have preferred if the Leader of the House had so ordered business that we were to take item No. 4 today, that is, the debate on the war in the Gulf, because important though the Environmental Protection Agency is &mdash;<Col N="674" /> and long we have waited for it &mdash; there is no doubt about which issue is uppermost in our minds.  It would have reflected that particular priority had we been able to debate that issue first. However I accept that these matters are otherwise arranged.  In fact, it was not until Senator Manning replied that I was aware that this item is to be taken tomorrow. Senator O'Toole asked that a general picture be given of the order of business of the term ahead, but I have a much more modest request.  When we meet on Wednesdays although the Leader does not have any commitment to do this, as a matter of courtesy he might inform us of what is likely to be discussed on Thursdays.</P>
      <P>May I congratulate the Leader of the House on the publicity he has achieved, not for himself but for the Seanad, in a newspaper report yesterday in which he said he hoped the forthcoming term would contribute to a higher profile for the Seanad, and in which he thanked the Opposition &mdash; by which I take it he also meant the Independent Senators who are not to be confused with the Opposition; in fact, I might suggest that not every Independent is to be confused with other Independents &mdash; and the Independents for their co-operation in the last session. I would wish sincerely to assure him that we reciprocate that intention and we would hope to continue with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for responding to my request last week to have a debate in this House on the Gulf war.  Now that the war is becoming far more complicated and difficult I believe that we as a nation will have more responsibilities and requirements thrust upon us under our membership of the UN and indeed within the EC.</P>

      <P>I am not fully satisfied that we are prepared to cope with the consequences of those responsibilities and I believe we will need to have a lot <Col N="675" /> more debate on this issue.  I look forward to tomorrow's debate during which many questions will be asked and hopefully some answers given on what will be required of us in the weeks and months ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I too should like to be associated with the expression of sympathy to the family of the former Senator, Bryan Alton.  I knew Bryan Alton very well, and not just when he was in the Seanad.  My wife and I were patients of his.  As a family we owe a lot to Bryan Alton for the medical attention he gave my wife when she was seriously ill.  It was with regret that I heard of his death.</P>
      <P>I was deeply distressed when I heard of the illness of former Senator John Kelly.  I knew John Kelly very well when he was a Member of the Seanad and, of course, when he was a Member of the Dáil.  In my experience in the Oireachtas very few people had the reputation John Kelly had or were as highly regarded by people of every political view throughout the country.  I understand that he is still very seriously ill.  Perhaps Senator Manning, would convey our wishes that he will be well again soon.  I believe he was an outstanding and a very courageous public figure.  He was never afraid at any time to speak against the views of his own party or anybody else and to stand up for what he believed was right.  We do not meet people like him that often in public life and when we do they should be respected.  I would like my views conveyed to his family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Murphy in saying that I wish item No. 4 had been taken today.  In fact, I wish it had been taken much earlier this month.  I think a number of people on all sides of the House indicated that they were concerned about the probable outcome we have now witnessed and hoped that we might have met before 15 January because it may appear to the wider public that we are positively Roman in our senatorial indolence &mdash; fiddling while Baghdad and now Tel Aviv burn, but I suppose <Col N="676" /> better late than never, but it does indicate that we do not imagine our words here will have any immense impact.  That may, unfortunately, be a realistic view particularly having regard to the Government's policy about which I will have more to say tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Leader of the House would ask the Government if, in the light of these unfortunate developments and their unfortunate attempts to lickspittle with people like Saddam Hussein, which compares most unfavourably with their refusal to have an embassy here from the state of Israel, they will take this matter back to the Government and ask them for a view on it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asking a question, and one which I hope will be answered. I would like to ask the Leader of the House to give an indication as to when item No. 52 may be taken.  It relates to the question of the harmonisation of asylum policy contingent upon the completion of the Internal Market in 1992.  It is directly relevant to the situation in the Gulf in the light of the fact that people of Middle Eastern origin are being expelled both from the northern part of this island and from the United Kingdom back to jurisdictions where they may meet a very unhappy fate.  I ask for this matter to be considered.  I am sure all Members of the House are concerned about it and it is not just a matter for individuals or for a section of a party.  I imagine many of us have been circularised.  Today I received a communication from Amnesty International saying that they are very concerned that no debate on this issue has taken place in either House of the Oireachtas.  Perhaps, Sir, it would be appropriate to have a debate in Seanad Éireann on this matter which is, unfortunately, becoming increasingly important.</P>

      <P>May I also avail of this opportunity to ask the Leader of the House if he will allow time for a debate on moneylending, legal and illegal, given the fact that many lower income families are finding it extremely difficult at this point in time to pay back the exorbitant rates of interest they are being charged? I raise this issue because I am aware that an EC Directive now exists which calls into question the idea of having one rate of interest throughout the Community. It would be an appropriate time to have such a debate and see what the Government have in mind by way of legislation in this area this term.</P>

      <P>I would like to be associated with the remarks concerning Dr. Bryan Alton, a former Senator whom I knew.  I do not want to repeat what has been said already except that he was a very good man.</P>
      <P>I would also like to thank whoever was responsible for removing the two cameras from in front of us.  I see they are now behind the drapes but, however, they have spawned a number of young and are now clinging beneath the lights.  I would like the leader's assurance that some day we are not going to see more of these little lads all over the place because we have enough of them now.</P>

He was held in very high esteem by the wider <Col N="678" /> medical profession and, indeed, was generally accepted as being a man of great wisdom.  I would like to join in sending condolences to his family.  I would also like very much to join with Senator Hanafin in sending good wishes to former Senator John Kelly, a very old friend of mine, who, I believe, is very ill.  I would like to wish him a speedy recovery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, I received requests last week from many Senators including Senator Manning, on behalf of Senators O'Toole and Upton, Senator Cullen and many of the Senators on this side of the House.  It is obvious that all parties were requesting a debate on this matter and hence it is on the Order Paper for tomorrow.  Many people have referred to the debate and, therefore, I will not mention them as I go through the list.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the late former Senator Bryan Alton, and I too on behalf of the Government side would like to express my sympathy with his family.  He was, as I understand it, a very caring and excellent medical practitioner and I am sure he will be sadly missed by his family and medical friends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole asked about a programme for the time ahead.  It is not possible to give a full list, but I can say that we will be dealing with the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, the Child Care Bill and the Appropriation Bill.  He also also asked about expanding Private Members' time, but there are no proposals to do that at present.  He asked about the examination of the Order Paper.  There is an ongoing examination of the agenda and that will continue.  The Senator also asked about an education <Col N="681" /> Bill and a nuclear zone Bill.  I have no plans to take those Bills at present and I have no role whatsoever in regard to the papers laid before the Oireachtas.  I agree with the Senator that the list is long today but I assume that is because this is the first sitting of the new session.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton asked about Adjournment debates and if the time could be broken down in some way.  Again, as the Cathaoirleach rightly pointed out, that is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It is not a matter for me to comment on.  The Senator also asked for a debate on the GATT negotiations and the Common Agricultural Policy. Obviously, this is a matter we should debate.  We had a debate recently on agriculture but I accept the need for a debate on the negotiations.  I cannot give a date for such a debate but it is something I will keep in mind.  We may get around to doing something about it in the next few weeks, but I cannot give any specific date.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis referred to the GATT negotiations, the cuts in farm grants and to the troops in the Lebanon.  I am sure the Senator will agree that that is a point for mention in the debate tomorrow.  In reply to Senator Doyle, I am not aware of the report on insider dealing that took place before Christmas.  I will make inquiries in the matter and will contact the Senator about it.  Senator Doyle also referred to a debate on the GATT talks and the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>Senator Haughey referred to item No. 66.  While the Minister will be in attendance this evening, he will probably say that there is a lack of ministerial responsibility in regard to that matter for the obvious reason.  Senator Costello referred to the Gulf war and the prison system.  I gave an assurance on that matter and I am not forgetting about it. I will certainly do something about it. The Senator also referred to the economic and social programme announced yesterday.  There is no plan for a full debate on that but it might be suitable for mention on the Appropriation Bill. However, I will think more about it. Senator Costello also asked about a <Col N="682" /> shortening of the Adjournment debate which, as the Cathaoirleach rightly pointed out, is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan asked about section 31, but I have no proposals to deal with that matter.  He also asked about the income of the Third World.  That is not a matter that is appropriate to the Order of Business.  Senator Conroy referred to the Gulf war and supported the idea of a debate on it.  Senator Raftery asked for a debate on the GATT negotiations and the Common Agricultural Policy. Senator Murphy referred to the Gulf and he also referred to me in relation to Independent Members.  I cannot recall, quite honestly, to what he referred but I would love from time to time to praise the Independent Members and I assure him they are very important people in this House. However, I cannot recall at any time praising them in any newspaper article.</P>
    <P>Senator Cullen referred to the Gulf debate.  Senator Hanafin referred to the death of the former Senator Bryan Alton and also to the illness of the former Minister, John Kelly.  We would all like to send our good wishes to John Kelly.  He is a very good character in every way and certainly was an excellent parliamentarian.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris asked about item No. 52; I have no plan to take any debate on that at present.  Senator O'Keeffe asked about money lending, a matter of much concern, but it seems there are no plans for a debate on that although it might be suitable for a debate on the Adjournment at some occasion and perhaps Senator O'Keeffe might consider this.  Senator Lydon and Senator Hederman referred to the late Senator Bryan Alton and she commented on item No. 66.  Senator Lydon also referred to the television cameras. I have noted what Senator Mooney said in regard to the debate on item No. 66.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin by saying how pleased I am that this Bill's parliamentary passage is beginning here in the Seanad and I look forward to a constructive debate on its provisions.</P>
      <P>In just a little over five years the environment and its protection has risen from the position of &ldquo;also ran&rdquo; on the political agenda to the very top.  Throughout the developed world, millions of people have come to accept the overriding importance of environmental issues.  The sheer pace of environmental degradation in western industrialised society has taken many by surprise.  In just a generation many countries have succeeded in turning clean rivers and green fields into industrial wastelands.</P>
      <P>The full horror of unfettered and unregulated development became apparent when the Iron Curtain fell just over a year ago.  In one province of Poland the number of cancer cases has nearly doubled in the past 12 years and over half of all children under ten years of age suffer from chronic illness.</P>
      <P>Western Europe has been luckier.  The EC in paritcular has been legislating to protect the environment since the seventies but much of this legislation is formulated in the context of ensuring that no further damage takes place in an already degraded environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in Ireland is different from much of the EC.  Luckily for us, heavy industry has passed us by and left us, almost alone in Europe, with a relatively unspoiled environment.  Much has been achieved already in our efforts to protect and preserve this unspoiled environment. The Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 and 1990 and the Air Pollution Act, 1987, contain very wide-ranging controls for the protection of the environment.  My Department are at present working on new legislation on <Col N="684" /> waste to complete this legislative umbrella over land, air and water.</P>
    <P>The 33 major local authorities in Ireland are charged with the implementation of this legislation and, by and large, they have performed this task well. Recently, however, difficulties have begun to arise.</P>
    <P>Environmental protection in the area of licensing of new and existing development has become increasingly complex and specialised.  It has become more and more difficult for each local authority to provide the expertise necessary to carry out their licensing functions.  Problems of public confidence and the need for a more uniform decision-making process have made it clear that these functions should now be carried out by one expert body. The idea of an Environmental Protection Agency has been born out of the need for such a body.</P>
    <P>When work on this Bill began, I had three priorities or essential characteristics which I knew the agency would have to have in order to be effective.  They were: independence from Government, public authorities or any other interested bodies; power to carry out their functions effectively and transparency in all their decisions.</P>
    <P>This Bill confers on the new agency all these characteristics and much more. What began as a simple idea for an agency to protect our environment has evolved, by necessity, into the most important and comprehensive legislation in the environmental area since the planning legislation of the early sixties.</P>
    <P>Right from the very beginning it was obvious to me that this Bill was being formulated in an atmosphere of public disquiet about the impartiality of public authorities in their decision-making on often controversial developments.  It, therefore, made little sense to retire into a vacuum to solve this problem, so I embarked on a process of wide-ranging consultations across both the public and private sectors.  In addition to meetings with individual groups and receiving over 50 written submisions, a full day seminar was held this time last year at which I <Col N="685" /> heard many different views on the role of the proposed agency.</P>
    <P>The result of this admittedly long incubation period is a milestone in environmental legislation in this country.  This Bill will allow the the establishment of a fully resourced, independent body with considerable powers to ensure the protection of the environment.  The agency have a budget of approximately £8 million.  Half of this annual budget will come from the redeployment of staff and from charges made by the agency.  There will, therefore, be a net additional expenditure of about £4 million when the agency are fully operational.</P>
    <P>The agency will be managed by a small executive board made up of a wholetime director general and four wholetime directors. The Environmental Protection Agency will have direct responsibility for the licensing, control and enforcement of specific classes of activities with potential for serious pollution.  Examples of these would be chemical industries, mining or intensive agricultural activities.</P>
    <P>The new licence will be integrated, encompassing controls on emissions to environmental media including air and water.  Contrary to some public misconceptions in recent months, the licensing procedure provides for full public participation in the decision-making process, with provision for third party objections and oral hearings where necessary. However, instead of appealing to An Bord Pleanála, objections will be heard by the agency in recognition of the fact that no other organisation will have the same high level of environmental expertise which will be necessary to deal with the complex issues involved in particular cases.</P>
    <P>The other main functions which the Bill assigns to the agency are those of: providing guidelines and back-up to local authorities and other public bodies concerned with the environment; co-ordinating environmental monitoring and reporting on the state of the environment, and co-ordinating environmental research.</P>
    <P>The agency will also seek to promote the implementation of environmentally <Col N="686" /> sound practices through a wide range of actions.  These include involvement in the procedures for environmental impact assessment, promoting the conduct of environmental audits for existing development, the establishment of a labelling scheme for environmentally friendly products and services, issuing or approving codes of practice and specifying environmental quality objectives.</P>
    <P>There is provision for a system whereby the Minister for the Marine will have to get the prior approval of the agency before issuing licences and other authorisations under marine legislation. The agency will also have an overseeing role in ensuring that drinking water quality, sewage treatment plant and landfill sites operated by local authorities meet the required standards.</P>
    <P>If the new agency is to have the full confidence of the general public it must be tough, independent and fair in all its dealings and it must be seen to be so.</P>
    <P>The independence of the agency is guaranteed by a number of important elements.  First, the executive board is selected by an independent committee. The agency will also have an effective and expert staff and the freedom to act of its own volition.  It will have sole and direct responsibility for licensing a wide range of activities and, lastly, it will be an offence under this Act to lobby any member of the board or employee of the agency with the intention of influencing improperly a matter to be decided by the agency.</P>
    <P>The agency will have wide-ranging powers including the power to prosecute summary offences, the power to hold inquiries and publish reports on pollution incidents.  It will have all the necessary powers and functions under the Air and Water Pollution Acts, for example, the power to seek a High Court injunction to prevent serious pollution.  Finally, it will have supervisory power over the performance by local authorities of their functions relating to the environment. This includes power to direct local authorities to take specific remedial measures, or failing compliance to have <Col N="687" /> these measures implemented and the costs recovered as a simple contract debt.</P>
    <P>The public will be entitled under the Bill to access to all of the agency's monitoring data as well as monitoring data collected by local authorities on its behalf.</P>
    <P>This provision on freedom of information is one of the most important.  This agency belongs to the people.  One of the main reasons for its existence is that the man or woman in the street can be happy that there is an independent watchdog, or guardian if you like, protecting the environment for all of us.  The agency will only gain that level of confidence if it is independent and accessible to the public.</P>
    <P>A detailed explanatory memorandum on the Bill has already been circulated to Senators.  I intend for the remainder of this speech to highlight only the most important elements of the Bill.  In my response to the debate I will be glad to clarify any other aspects of the Bill which Senators may wish to raise.  Much of the detail of the Bill will of course be more appropriate to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The text of the Bill, which has 109 sections and is in six Parts, can be summarised as follows:</P>
    <P>Part I contains standard provisions of a general nature dealing with such matters as interpretation, regulations, offences, penalties and other housekeeping provisions.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with the establishment, membership, staffing, financing and operational matters of the agency.  It also provides for the formal dissolution of An Foras Forbartha and the transfer of its staff to the agency.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with the functions of the agency.</P>
    <P>Part IV provides for the establishment of an integrated licensing system to be operated by the agency for activities listed in the First Schedule to the Bill i.e. those activities with potential for major pollution.</P>
    <P>Part V includes a number of general matters in relation to environmental protection including provision for powers under water and air pollution control <Col N="688" /> legislation to be operated by the agency in addition to or in lieu of local authorities. It also provides for special reports and inquiries.</P>
    <P>Part VI is a miscellaneous Part dealing with noise, improved access to information, control of genetically modified organisms and the increase of certain penalties under other legislation.  These matters are not directly connected with the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule specifies the activities which are to be subject to licensing by the agency.  The Second Schedule specifies existing enactments in respect of which functions can be transferred to the agency.</P>
    <P>Both Schedules can be amended by ministerial order, subject to affirmative resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides that the agency will consist of a wholetime director general and for other wholetime directors.  These will be appointed by the Government following selection by an independent committee for which provision is made in sections 21 and 24.  This procedure is broadly similar to the appointment of the chairman of An Bord Pleanála and the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The agency will be required to perform its functions as far as is practicable through a regional organisation and there is provision in section 27 for an advisory committee of 12 members.  This committee will be empowered to advise both the Minister and the agency in relation to any matter, other than individual licensing decisions affecting the agency's function.</P>
    <P>The agency will be funded by means of grants, by the imposition of fees for licences and by charges for services.  A provision of £1 million has been included in the Department's Estimates for 1991 for the agency.  This does not take into account whatever funds would be transferred to the agency in conjunction with the transfer of staff from other bodies for which budgetary provision has already been made.</P>
    <P>The agency will be able to recruit its own staff under section 29 subject to <Col N="689" /> whatever limits may apply as to overall numbers and grading.  It is the intention to transfer to the agency the remaining hydrometric and regional staff of An Foras Forbartha, which will be formally dissolved under the provisions of section 32.  Section 30 facilitates the transfer of staff of other bodies whose functions are transferred to the agency, subject to consultations between the bodies and the Ministers concerned.  To enable the agency to become established and operational at an early stage the Minister may provide staff and services and there can be agreement for secondment of staff from other bodies to the agency under section 43.  Finally, the agency may make arrangements under section 44 with other public authorities for the discharge of certain of its functions.</P>
    <P>Overall, the agency will have a wide range of direct staffing and other options, for the discharge of its functions.</P>
    <P>The agency will be independent from the Government, local authorities and vested interests in the performance of its functions.  This independence is underwritten by the selection procedures for the appointment of members of the agency to which I have already referred, by the fact that it will be a corporate body separate from the Department and by its autonomous licensing role.</P>
    <P>In the overall operation of the agency, it will also be essential that it should work within a broad public context and take a balanced view on the issues coming before it.  Provision is made, therefore, for a system of general policy directives by the Minister; these will not compromise the independence of the agency in dealing with specific issues or cases.  An example of the directive which could be given would be a directive, in accordance with Government policy, not to grant a licence for a nuclear power station. Directives must be published and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the functions of the agency in some more detail.  With regard to its regulatory functions the agency will have direct responsibility under Part IV of the Bill for operating an integrated licensing system and for <Col N="690" /> monitoring, control and enforcement of environmental criteria in relation to classes of activities with potential for serious pollution.  The activities involved are set out in the First Schedule to the Bill which will be capable of amendment by ministerial order to cater for changed circumstances.  The activities to be licensed by the agency are mainly those associated with heavy or largescale industrial processes but also include activities such as mining, peat extraction, the food industry and intensive pig and poultry rearing.  The agency will have regard to the best available technologies not entailing excessive costs for preventing or reducing emissions and to the polluter pays principle when deciding on licence applications.  The integrated licensing system will operate for the activities concerned instead of the system of separate licences and permits for air, water and waste as exists at present.</P>
    <P>The concept of integrated pollution control is a relatively recent one and is, incidentally, also a central feature of the British Environmental Protection Act, 1990.  It offers advantages both environmentally and administratively.  Environmentally, it will improve on the previous system of separate air, water and waste licences by allowing all environmental impacts of a proposed activity to be considered in a balanced and integrated way when dealing with the licence application.</P>
    <P>Administratively, integrated environmental licensing will offer developers the advantage of a one stop shop where all the environmental requirements of their proposal can be considered within a single statutory procedure.  This simpler and more streamlined administrative arrangement also of course benefits.</P>
    <P>Section 82 provides for a two stage public consultation process by the agency in relation to draft integrated licences, with provision for objections and, where necessary, oral hearings.  This arrangement reflects the need for meaningful public participation while also facilitating the more speedy processing of licence applications.  Any further appeal or <Col N="691" /> application for review of a licence will be a matter for the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 70 will enable the Minister to make regulations, subject to the consent of the Minister for the Marine, requiring the prior approval of the agency in relation to the environmental implications of activities coming before the Minister for the Marine for licences, permits or other authorisations.  These could include aquaculture, dumping at sea and certain foreshore developments.</P>
    <P>The agency will be empowered to investigate and publish reports on pollution incidents or other matters related to environmental protection if requested to do so by the Minister or on its own initiative.  Formal inquiries by the agency, following consultation with the Minister or by direction of the Minister, into a pollution incident or any other matter related to environmental protection are also catered for.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will continue to be extensively involved in environmental monitoring and control activities, and it is desirable that a mechanism should exist to guide standards of local authority performance and to encourage the consistent application of control procedures throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Sections 55 and 56 give the agency general powers of advice and assistance in relation to local authorities.  Section 60 provides for the taking of appropriate action by the agency if the environmental functions of a local authority are not being properly performed.  Under sections 57 to 59, the agency will set criteria for the management of local authority sewage treatment plants and landfill sites and will have a general supervisory role in relation to local authority obligations for the quality of drinking water.</P>
    <P>Under section 54, the agency will also have the right to provide advice or make recommendations to any Government Minister or public authority on environmental matters relative to their functions.</P>
    <P>Under sections 69 to 75 the agency are empowered to influence and promote the use of environmentally sound practices in a wide variety of ways.  The agency are <Col N="692" /> given an extensive involvement in the operation of the environmental impact assessment procedure.  In particular, this involves power for the agency to prepare guidelines on the information to be contained in environmental impact statements. Those preparing and assessing environmental impact statements must have regard to these guidelines.</P>
    <P>Under section 71 the agency will be responsible for promoting environmental audits through the specification of guidelines and criteria for this purpose.  Section 72 enables the agency to specify environmental quality objectives which must be taken into account by Ministers and other public authorities in formulating policy, setting standards or exercising their environmental protection functions.</P>
    <P>The agency will be obliged under section 75 to establish an eco-labelling scheme involving the use of a special symbol on the labels of products or in connection with services which meet specified environmental criteria. Senators may be interested to know that the EC Commission has recently prepared draft proposals for a Community-wide eco-labelling scheme.</P>
    <P>There is an increasing demand for reliable and authoritative environmental information and the Bill provides for a leading role for the agency in ensuring this demand is met.  Sections 61 to 67 set out a range of relevant activities to be undertaken or co-ordinated by the agency.</P>
    <P>The agency will prepare, publish and implement programmes for the monitoring of environmental quality including hydrometric data.  Much of this monitoring will continue to be done on an agency basis by local authorities and other public bodies but will be subject to co-ordination by the agency to ensure that comparable and comprehensive data are produced.  In order to provide a reliable supply of environmental information the agency will establish an analytical quality control programme and require laboratories which supply them with data to be properly accredited.</P>
    <P>Open and accessible environmental information is the cornerstone of this Bill. <Col N="693" /> The agency will be obliged under section 64 to facilitate public access to environmental monitoring results held by them. There is also provision for the agency to establish and maintain a data base on environmental quality.  Finally, the agency will prepare state of the environment reports at least every five years and will be obliged to report regularly on their operations and activities.</P>
    <P>The agency will have the role under section 68 of fostering and co-ordinating environmental research in Ireland.  A well developed cohesive network of environmental research linked to environmental monitoring, both of which are to a large extent interdependent, will be critical to our ability to respond positively and efficiently to environmental problems in the future.</P>
    <P>The agency will, therefore, co-ordinate environmental research and related programmes by public and other bodies and will prepare and publish registers of environmental research projects or operations. The agency will have power to carry out research directly, or through consultancy or commissioned work.  The agency will, as a matter of priority, liaise with the EC Commission and other international organisations so as to secure maximum funding for, and participation in, environmental research work in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Over and above provisions related to the new agency, the Bill deals with a number of environmental matters that are not adequately provided for by existing legislation such as noise, improved access to environmental information, the use of genetically modified organisms and the level of certain penalties in other legislation.</P>
    <P>To effectively exercise such a wide range of functions the agency require strong powers.  Offences under the Bill will carry the maximum penalties on summary conviction of £1,000 and/or imprisonment for six months, and on conviction on indictment of £10 million and/or imprisonment for ten years; fines on foot of summary convictions will be payable to the agency.  These fines are of a magnitude sufficient to reflect the gravity of <Col N="694" /> pollution as an offence and will act, I believe, as a deterrent to the enterprises or individuals who may be tempted to take the pollution option if it would result in a short term financial saving.</P>
    <P>I am determined that the agency should not be seen as anti-industry. However, it will be pro-environment, and if that means anything it means that it will be anti-dirty industry, anti-dirty agriculture and anti-pollution of any kind.</P>
    <P>This Government are committed to sustainable economic development. Essentially, that means that in the pursuit of economic development to meet the needs of the present generation we must not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their needs.  I have no doubt that the greatest legacy we can leave to future generations is a clean, unspoiled environment because that is our single most important natural resource.</P>
    <P>We do not have huge resources of oil or mineral wealth but we do have what is probably the cleanest environment in Europe, a natural resource which will never be exhausted if we take care of it. The decisions we make in future about what type of development we want in Ireland will have to take this into account. Much of our recent economic recovery can be attributed to industries which are dependent on a clean environment.  Food and agriculture, electronics and tourism all depend for their survival and growth on a clean, green environment.  Continued economic growth, I believe, will depend more and more on the perception abroad that Ireland is &ldquo;environmentally friendly&rdquo;.  It is no longer an issue of jobs or the environment.  In the nineties it is going to be an issue of jobs because of the environment.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency Bill is a radical and progressive step forward. It is truly legislation for the nineties. In safeguarding our environment, it will be in effect helping to safeguard our economic future.  It is solid evidence to the wider world that Ireland and the Government are serious about preserving our unspoiled environment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> I look forward to a constructive debate in the Seanad and at a later stage to responding to many of the suggestions and queries which I am sure will come from all sides of this House.  I look forward to a good debate and to the support of all the groups and Independents in this House on the general principles of the Bill now before us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree totally with the Minister in that I have absolutely no doubt that the greatest legacy we can leave for future generations is a clean unspoiled environment because that is our single most important natural resource.  Because of that I regret very much that this Bill did not come before the House much sooner.  I regret that the Bill introduced in the other House by Deputy Shatter was not accepted by the Government.  I contend the most effective way in which the Government might have proceeded at that time would have been to have amended that Bill if there were aspects of it with which they did not agree.  I give this Bill a limited welcome. It is now 14 months since a similar Bill was introduced in the Dáil.  I repeat, it was a pity that Bill was not accepted there.  By and large, all of us agree in principle with the provisions of this Bill. However, we will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage which, hopefully, the Minister will be able to accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of regret that a Bill such as this one was not introduced sooner.  I understand that in Denmark the provisions of a similar Act have been in operation for over 20 years.  Indeed we are lucky there has not been much more damage done to our environment because of the lack of a Bill such as this. We all recognise the damage done over the years by pollution of our fish stocks of one kind or another, some farm-oriented <Col N="696" /> and some emanating from industrial sources. No democracy can tolerate such pollution.</P>
    <P>This Bill is part and parcel of other legislation introduced in an endeavour to protect and improve our environment. One step was taken last year on the elimination or prohibition of the burning of bituminous coals in Dublin.  That endeavour has been partly successful due to the weather we have had this winter.  I should like to see us concentrate in all of our cities, towns and villages on the use of clean fuels whether peat, gas, or electricity. We must endeavour to encourage progress in that direction.</P>
    <P>It is my hope that the provisions of this Bill will not be used by this or any future Minister in this or the other House as a shield of their failure to respond to environmental problems.  It is important that responsibility for our environment should remain in the hands of the Minister who, in the final analysis, will be responsible for the implementation of such policy.  For example, I would hate to see circumstances arise in which parliamentary questions would be refused on account of lack of ministerial responsibility.  I would hate to see any Member of this House unable to extract such information for the same reason.</P>
    <P>There has been quite an amount of pollution of our rivers, some perpetrated by semi-State and State bodies and local authorities.  Very often this has occurred because local authorities were not allocated sufficient finance to carry out major sewerage schemes, build treatment works and plants.  We must acknowledge that that position has not changed.  I must cite the River Shannon which has been polluted to a very large extent by Bord na Móna allowing peat to drift in from their bogs, killing the fish life in large portions of the River Shannon, creating mud banks in certain parts of the river rendering it difficult for boating activities to be continued.  Indeed, I have heard people in the boat business contend that some of their cruisers had run aground in such mud banks on the Shannon.  A substantial amount of finance will have to be expended to redress this position, <Col N="697" /> something with which the Government will have to grapple in the years ahead.  I cite the example of the River Shannon, it being a river close to my constituency but I have no doubt that similar problems are encountered in other rivers.</P>
    <P>Many of our rivers are polluted by untreated sewage being discharged directly into them or by sewerage works operated by local authorities because they have been allocated insufficient finance to come to grips with the problem. I have no doubt but that, as a result of the implementation of the provisions of this Bill, the Department of the Environment will be inundated by applications from every small town and village for sewerage schemes or treatment works of one kind or another simply to protect themselves from prosecution under its provisions.  The only way in which local authorities can be assured of not being prosecuted will be to have an application lodged with the Department to update and modernise their treatment plants.</P>
    <P>We have also witnessed our domestic water supplies being contaminated. Gigantic sums of money have been invested by this country in major water or group schemes subsidised by Departmental grants and funding from the EC in addition to a large contribution on the part of householders and taxpayers.  It would be a tragedy if such water supplies were allowed to continue to be polluted. All necessary steps should be taken to prevent such recurrence.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a matter the Minister might address when replying.  It has come to my knowledge that a sizeable amount of chemicals are used in many of our treatment works.  Can the Minister tell us what, if any, adverse effect such chemicals can have on people's health.  We know chemicals are used in dental care to improve the quality of children's teeth and for the removal of the discoloration of water.</P>
    <P>After the Chernobyl disaster we became aware of the devastation it had caused all over Europe.  Only at such times do we realise how vulnerable we can be in this country.  I understand that tests are still being undertaken by the <Col N="698" /> Department of Agriculture to monitor the effects of the fall-out from the Chernobyl disaster.  Anything we do here in this direction is important but, unless it is part and parcel of an overall European package&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we may well be defeated or frustrated in our aim to endeavour to improve our environment. In that respect it is my hope that the Minister and her Department would declare that over the next five years it will be their aim to have a common European environmental policy whether under the aegis of an environmental protection agency or whatever thereby ensuring that a disaster such as Chernobyl and its effects on Europe will not recur.</P>
      <P>We are unfortunate in having almost on our doorstep the Sellafield plant which has caused much concern to many people here both on account of air pollution and pollution of the Irish Sea.  We must maintain the fight to have the Sellafield plant closed down.  It is located much too close to our shores.  We should be mindful always of the dangers for us in the event of a repetition of the Chernobyl disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is needed is an overall environmental development policy rather than piecemeal planning, with one set of plans for one county and a different set for another.  Public representatives travelling throughout the country over the past 18 months will have observed the different standards and practices being implemented from one local authority area to another.  What is acceptable in one county might be classified as ribbon development in another.  There are different attitudes among county councils, county managers and planning officers. There should be an overall plan in relation to our environment.  The Minister should consider the possibility of trying to streamline planning between local authorities.  The local authority of which I am a member have been very strict in relation to developments along national primary and secondary routes but the same stringent attitude is not <Col N="699" /> applied by other local authorities.  This is a great pity.</P>
    <P>I do not for one moment suggest that we should identify one pocket of land for housing and herd everybody into it. Policy should be carefully planned and we should have a good mixture.  We should try to retain as many rural houses as we can.  Very often local authorities encourage people to leave rural areas to live in urban areas because it is easier to control urban local authority housing. That is a great mistake.  If people want to live in rural areas, local authorities should be prepared to provide housing for them.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk from the Government about protecting our environment and the steps that have been taken.  I regret that the Government have failed to introduce environmentally sensitive areas.  We have them in the North but not here.  It is a great pity that we missed the opportunity of getting assistance from the European Community by not having an area earmarked as environmentally sensitive.  There are many areas throughout the country that would gain substantially from this classification.  I know one area very close to me, Senator Fallon and Senator Finneran, the Shannon Valley, which should have been classified as an environmentally sensitive area some years ago and, unfortunately, it has not been.  I appeal to the Minister, and the Department, to examine the possibility of defining environmentally sensitive areas throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister, dealing with finance, stated that it would cost £8 million to run the Environmental Protection Agency for a year and that it would only cost £1 million this year.  That prompts the question: when does the Minister envisage this Bill becoming law?  Will the Minister address that question when replying?</P>
    <P>This agency will be as good as the people operating it.  I would remind the House that four years ago we all became very conscious of a difficulty in Tipperary with regard to a major firm and landowner. The landowner, despite have appealed to all the State agencies, failed <Col N="700" /> to get satisfaction although his stock were dying and his health was suffering.  He went to the High Court and was defeated there and had to appeal to the Supreme Court before he won his case.  We must ask, what great experts we have to monitor and control this legislation?  We all know of the difficulties that family had trying to establish the problems this plant was causing to their farm enterprise and the health of the family.  Had this family not won their case they would have gone bankrupt.  Luckily they had the stamina to keep going and eventually justice was done.  Perhaps the people who will be monitoring the work of this agency are the people in the Department of the Environment who were saying that there was no problem for this farmer and his family.  That is a worry and the Minister when replying should detail what experts we have to monitor this.</P>
    <P>I note that new matters have been brought under the control of the Environmental Protection Agency.  One is peat extraction.  What have the Government in mind with regard to peat extraction? Will this be a hindrance to the development of Bord na Móna?  Will Bord na Móna have to go to the Environmental Protection Agency, or to some other private peat developer, to seek permission to utilise our bogs?  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.  I find it difficult to understand why peat extraction should be included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We are talking about making £8 million available to put these provisions into operation.  Over the past number of years legislation such as the Abattoirs Bill was passed, and the local authorities did not receive any finance to implement its provisions. That is farcical.  One local authority spent £20,000 in excess of fees collected to fill a post last year.  Local authorities cannot implement legislation where their finances are being reduced each year.  We had a similar situation in relation to water pollution.  Each year local authority funding is being reduced while additional legislation is being handed to them to be implemented.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill certain functions will be given to local authorities but will they <Col N="701" /> get the funding?  If not, we are wasting our time.  Local authorities will not be able to implement this Bill due to lack of funding.  The Child Care Bill was introduced last year but the health boards do not have the money to implement its provisions.  The nursing homes Bill was passed and health boards did not get a cent to implement its provisions.  What is the point in putting through legislation if the money is not provided to implement its provisions?  I hope the Minister can give an assurance that sufficient money will be provided to implement the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the best available technology, not entailing excessive cost and the Minister referred to it in her speech.  I would like to hear from the Minister how in God's name one decides on what is the best available technology, not entailing excessive cost.  Who is going to decide that particular definition?  I honestly think there will be a bonanza for lawyers deciding in the High Court what precisely that section of the Bill means. That is one section of the Bill that will have to be clarified on Committee Stage. It is wide open to various interpretations and I do not see how any legislation can go through this House with a section as vague as that.  It will have to be clarified and made more specific.</P>
    <P>In other sections of the Bill the Minister is referred to many times.  Is it necessary to have the Minister referred to on so many occasions?  What new legislation and what extension of powers is the Minister going to give?  The Minister is referred to in section 6, again in sections 52, 58, 62, 69, 70, 76, 78, 79, 84, 90, 91, 98, 99 and 107.  Is it intended that on a daily basis the Minister will be giving additional powers?  Why is it so essential to have the Minister referred to in all of those sections?  I find it difficult to understand and again I would appreciate if the Minister of State would deal with those particular sections.</P>
    <P>Sections 19 and 21 deal with the establishment of the agency and the appointment of the director.  Again it is a pity that the Minister did not follow the model <Col N="702" /> laid down by Deputy Alan Shatter in his plan.  It was much fairer and would have been along the lines of the appointment of the Ombudsman.  There was a considerable reluctance on the part of the Government to establish this agency in the first place and certainly in my view there is a reluctance on their part to have it truly independent.  I believe that our Private Members' Bill provided for the appointment of the director of the agency by way of Dáil resolution.  We do not believe the procedure contained in section 21 relating to the appointment of the director general of the agency by the Government guarantees that the person appointed will be truly independent of the Government and we regret the removal of the role of the Oireachtas from the appointment procedures.  It would be much better if the Oireachtas decided on the person to be appointed. We are particularly concerned by the provision contained in the Bill which allows the Minister for the Environment, by way of order, to change the personnel who can be appointed to the committee that it is proposed to establish to recommend to the Government names of the people who should be appointed either as director general or director of the agency.  I appeal to the Minister to look at this section of the Bill again as I believe it would be much better if appointments were made under the procedure I suggested. Another aspect of the Bill is that nominating bodies must submit not less than four names for appointment.  That is also a great pity because those bodies should be free to nominate the person, but nominating four really gives the Minister, whoever that Minister is, the power to select his friends or his people for membership of the agency.</P>
    <P>Section 42 deals with the establishment of regional environmental units.  Again I would like to know what is meant by a regional environmental unit.  How many is it intended to appoint?  Is it intended to appoint one for each county, one for each province, one, maybe, linked into each health board?  What are the criteria for appointment?  If we are going to have regional environmental units, we should <Col N="703" /> spell out precisely what we have in mind. We should not again accept a section like that that does not clearly specify what is intended and I would appeal to the Minister to specify that when replying.</P>
    <P>Control of water and sewerage is covered in sections 57 and 58.  Of course, the control of drinking water is very important and should be continually monitored, but I know and I am sure the Minister knows of water schemes which are not up to standard either because of colour or because of contamination of one description or another.  Yet the local authorities, many of whom have applied for funding to update and modernise the treatment plants or put in an additional plant, have not the funding from central Government to do it.  Again it is ideal to express the wish and to set down the aims and targets, but we must be prepared to put the money behind it.  I wish to point out examples where legislation some of which relates to the Minister's Department, and to other Departments was put through, although funding was not put through to back it up.  The same story applies to section 58, with regard to non-treatment of sewage, thus creating major problems.  My own local authority and others have had unfortunately at times, raw sewage making its way into rivers and into the Shannon.</P>
    <P>Section 91 deals with fees.  What precise level of fees are we talking about here?  For example, what fees will have to be paid by a pig producer with 100 sows, which is not a very big unit?  Again what fees will be paid in respect of a 100,000 poultry unit?</P>
    <P>Section 103 deals with noise.  How are we going to define noise?  What are the criteria for it?  After what length of time does noise become a nuisance under this section of the Bill so that a person can go to court or take whatever steps are necessary?  The provision is very vague and to my mind has not been clearly set out.  Peat development is also being brought in under this heading.  Section 60 of the Bill deals with the performance and statutory functions of local authorities. That is getting back to a point I referred <Col N="704" /> to earlier, that many of our local authorities have not got the necessary funding to redress the problems being created at present.  Legislation was passed but no funding was provided for the local authority to carry out their functions under the provisions of that Act.  We need clarification of what is meant in section 60.</P>
    <P>I note in the First Schedule &mdash; in the paragraph dealing with intensive agriculture &mdash; that a broiler is deemed as a unit, a turkey is deemed as two units and a sow is deemed as ten units for the purpose of the Bill.  I note also that under paragraph 7.4 of the First Schedule one could slaughter up to 300 cattle without having to get a licence &mdash; that is my interpretation of paragraph 7.4 &mdash; because each beast is deemed to be five units &mdash; and the Bill mentions 1,500 units. On the other hand, one could not have a 100 sow unit without getting a licence, or feed 100,000 broilers without getting a licence but one could slaughter 300 cattle. That is a contradiction.  I would like the Minister to clarify that point.</P>
    <P>I broadly welcome the Bill but regret that the Bill which was before the Dáil in December 1989 was not accepted or amended if the Government felt there were certain aspects of it with which they could not agree.  I sincerely hope the Minister's, her Department's and the Government's aim and priority will be to ensure that in the years ahead there will be a single environmental policy for the whole of Europe because what we do here is simply one part of the whole picture, we must get all our European partners, in concert, to protect the environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this very important legislation. First, I congratulate the Minister on her personal input to this Bill.  It provides for the establishment of a new agency and for improvements and additions to existing environmental controls on a number of activities.  A part of the Bill also includes higher penalties in place of the present outdated penalties. I would also like to compliment Senator Naughten on his contribution.  I think he <Col N="705" /> was unfair to the Minister but time will tell.  This legislation will go down in credit to the Minister because it is an outstanding Bill which provides a comprehensive legal framework for the establishment and operation of an independent agency.  It will have a wide range of new powers and functions to improve the existing environmental protection arrangements.</P>
      <P>I further welcome the statement from the Minister that the agency when established, will take over direct responsibility for licensing and controlling those developments listed in the Bill which can cause serious pollution.  Most of us who are members of local authorities are aware of the serious situations that have developed over a period of years.  We, in Kerry County Council, have a very serious dumping problem and no matter where it is proposed to site a dump, there are objections.  We now find that we have to abide by certain EC regulations before we can decide on a particular dump. There is a great deal of money involved and as a local authority we are not in a position to expend such an amount at this time, but we have no choice in the matter.</P>
      <P>The Bill also confirms that local authorities will remain responsible for issuing licences in the majority of cases, in particular those under water pollution legislation while planning control will continue to be a local authority responsibility. I would like the Minister to define &ldquo;local authority&rdquo;.  In the Bill it is defined as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  in the case of the administrative county of Dublin, other than the borough of Dún Laoghaire, the council of the county of Dublin,</P>
      <P>(b)  in the case of the borough of Dún Laoghaire, the corporation of the borough,</P>
      <P>(c)  in the case of a county borough, the corporation of the county borough, and</P>
      <P>(d)  in the case of any other administrative county, the council of the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> In my view it is unfair to exclude urban councils.  I hope this can be clarified because, as a planning authority, they also should be included.  The agency will co-ordinate the work of the many local authorities throughout the country dealing with environmental protection. They will ensure that the environmental protection action is cohesive and consistent and will encourage local authorities to continue to play a major role in relation to environmental protection.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the agency establishing a good relationship with the local authorities.  This is a must if the agency are to succeed, which I have no doubt they will.  The agency will consist of a director general plus four full-time directors who will be appointed by the Government from candidates selected by an independent committee following public advertisements and formal applications.  It is stated further that there will be a 12 person advisory committee to advise the agency and the Minister in relation to the functions and activities of the agency, and that these members will be appointed from representatives nominated by community, environmental, professional and other organisations.  I would like to see the RTCs and many local authorities that have developed certain structures involved if at all possible. I have in mind Kerry County Council who have, over the past two years, developed a very successful laboratory which the Minister visited on 5 January 1990 when she attended a seminar in the regional college.  That laboratory carries out basic tests on river water and drinking water for all forms of pollution.  They can also measure the ambient air for sulphur dioxide, dust and other parameters.  Tests include emissions from chimney stacks. They can also measure levels of sound. As I said at the outset, this has been done at considerable expense to Kerry County Council and they have a certain amount of expertise of which I would hope to see a new agency making use.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on the appointments and if possible specify the various groups involved.  I would like to see cross country representation with <Col N="707" /> regard to local authorities and RTCs.  I would like to see committees based in each local authority area with representatives from the regional units, and availing of the expertise at local level.</P>
    <P>As mentioned in the Bill, funding for the new agency will consist of Government grants plus fees and charges for other services.  That is reasonable.  The Minister has said very clearly that the overall cost would be in the region of £8 million, and I note in the Estimates for the current year for the Department of the Environment that a sum of £1 million is set aside.  I would, however, hope that this would not lead to a further financial burden on the local authorities who are not in a position at this time to meet their present financial commitment.  For this reason I hope the Government will guarantee sufficient funding for the efficient running of the agency as set out very clearly in the Bill.  In the Bill there is provision for the agency to be given additional functions in the future.  The agency will be fully responsible for regulations and control of activities which pose a high risk of pollution.  It is also pointed out in the Bill that there are separate provisions for making certain authorisations granted by the Minister for the Marine, such as aquaculture and dumping at sea licences, subject to the approval of the agency.</P>
    <P>Any conditions specified by the agency must be attached to the authorisation which finally issues where the Minister is concerned.  I should like to point out to the Minister that planning applications, especially applications in regard to proposed industrial developments, will mean a further delay.  Can a time limit be imposed?  Could it happen that an intending developer would have to pull out?</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the new agency will be involved in every aspect of environmental protection and will have the independence and resources essential to ensure they retain public confidence. The agency's main function will be the protection of the environment and they will embody a specialised and centralised competence in environmental <Col N="708" /> protection.  I referred earlier to the fines which are substantially increased in the new Bill.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with the establishment of an independent Environmental Protection Agency, their organisation, structure, staffing and financial arrangements.  The agency will have a full-time five member executive board appointed by the Government and there will be a separate advisory committee appointed by the Minister.  I have referred to this point already.</P>
    <P>Part III sets out the wide ranging functions of the proposed agency covering action functions, advisory and support functions, and overseeing and promotional functions.  The Minister in his speech said the agency will be independent of the Government, local authorities and vested interests in the performance of their functions.  I welcome this provision.  No doubt this independence will be underwritten by the selection procedures for the members of the agency.  If the agency are to retain the confidence of the general public they must be independent and fair in all their dealings, and must be seen to be so.  With regard to decisions, I would hope they will be made available to the public, especially where appeals are concerned.</P>
    <P>The agency are guaranteed to succeed as the executive board will be selected by an independent committee and, there is no doubt, there will be very effective and expert staff.  The agency will have very wide powers, including the power to prosecute on summary offences, to hold inquiries and to publish reports on pollution incidents.  These will be very important to local authorities, especially those who are very aware of pollution. Certain guidelines and back-up facilities will be available to local authorities and other public bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency Bill is a progressive step forward, It is good legislation which is long overdue. From a tourism point of view, our major boast has always been that our environment is clean and unspoiled.  This Bill <Col N="709" /> will guarantee the protection of the environment and the economic future of tourism. I again compliment the Minister on this excellent and comprehensive Bill.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House; I think this is the first opportunity I have had to do so.  This House is where she first drew parliamentary breath in a reasonably unpolluted atmosphere, and she is very welcome back here.  I congratulate her on her commitment to the issue of environmental protection.  I congratulate her on the Bill which, if it is not fair to describe it as a triumph for the Progressive Democrats over Fianna Fáil &mdash; I withdraw that as it is a bit naughty &mdash; is certainly a personal triumph for the Minister, and I am very glad that that is so.</P>
      <P>The Bill will be widely welcomed, even if its emergence is somewhat belated as all legislation of this kind seems to be &mdash; más maith is mithid is the appropriate Irish seanfhocal.  I am thinking, for example, of the Marine Institute Bill in which I had a particular interest and which went through this House a long time ago.  That Bill took a very long time to reach the House and, as far as I am aware, it has not been fully processed yet and certainly is not being implemented. Therefore, I hope that speed will be of the essence in this case.</P>
      <P>We are very glad that this issue has been forced on to the agenda in the front line of Government policy.  One of the most important things to be said about the Bill is that when it is implemented it will no longer be left to fringe groups to promote environmental protection and it will no longer be the sole conscience of certain parties to promote the issue of the environment.  That will be a very good thing.  Indeed it will be the concern of all of us to make sure that this Bill works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, there are obvious historical reasons that this country was slow in coming to terms with the general issue of pollution.  We were fortunate in one respect, if not in other aspects of our history, that we really did not have to worry about pollution for a long time. <Col N="710" /> We took it for granted that our rivers always sparkle, our fields would always be green, instead of, as we discovered to our horror in recent years it was our rivers that were becoming green &mdash; and that the air would always be pure.  That perception or time lag of the hazards of modern life was understandable in historical terms and maybe it is understandable why we were rather slow in coming to grips with the issue.</P>
    <P>The agency to be established must, above all, command respect.  They must command respect for their powers, their scientific expertise and their political or, if you like, non-political credibility.  That respect will be the essence of the agency. They must be seen to be above suspicion and any political pressure.  As I said already, the agency when established, will cut out the role of the self-appointed moral guardians of the environment.  On the one hand this will certainly reduce their importance and on the other will diminish the somewhat nefarious activities of the industrial cowboys.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten criticised the Bill in very great detail, in such detail that he, if I may say so anticipated the Committee Stage in many ways.  I would like to confine myself to more general points about the Bill.  The first thing to hope for is that this essentially enabling legislation will quickly take on the flesh of regulations and directives.  Unless it does so, and does so soon, it will not have that credibility we all wish for.  We are, as usual &mdash; and I think Senator Naughten implied this also &mdash; lagging behind other countries in this respect.</P>
    <P>It seems that what I might call the board of directors will be the essence of the agency.  The board comprises the director general and his fellow directors. They are the nub of the whole matter. Whatever resources are allocated to the agency, and no matter how expert the back-up advisory committee, they still are not as important as the core of the matter.  The committee after all is just that, an advisory committee, but the essence will be the board, if I may call them that.  I think Senator Naughten, and perhaps Senator Mullooly, already <Col N="711" /> suggested that the great danger is that the director general and his fellow directors will not be able to deal expeditiously with applications.  That is vitally important unless they can in some way delegate the applications.  I hope that inner structure is good enough for the decisions that have to be made.  What remains unexplained, and it was not made any clearer in the Minister's speech, is the general relationship between the agency and the local authorities. That relationship remains uneasy. On the one hand the agency are envisaged as the allies, co-operators and advisers of the local authorities.  They are fellow-adventurers in monitoring pollution and so on.  On the other hand they are envisaged in other parts of the Bill in a rather different role from the local authorities, as the policemen, the monitors, the watchdogs.  Sections 58 to 60 make it clear that the agency are going to keep a very sharp eye on the local authorities and, we may echo, rightly so in view of the fact that the local authorities have been considerable transgressors in this whole matter.</P>
    <P>The question remains: how is this uneasy relationship to be resolved and will it in practice give rise to conflict between the two areas?  If there is an uneasy relationship in the matter of the general ratio of the two bodies, it seems in the particular matter of functions there is also an overlap or a duplication.  Speaking purely as a lay person in these areas, I ask in all sincerity, are the processes of planning as we have known them up to now and licensing as we will experience it under the new agency to be dovetailed? Will their functions be simultaneous in time?  Will they be planned so that one will not lag behind the other?  If the agency work as intended, they may well undermine the local authority in the matter of planning.</P>
    <P>The Minister has explained in her speech that in the matter of appeals the licensing procedure provides for full public participation, with provision for third party objections and oral hearings where necessary.  She said: &ldquo;However, <Col N="712" /> instead of appealing to An Bord Pleanála, objections will be heard by the agency, in recognition of the fact that ...&rdquo;.  I take that to mean that if a licence is refused or indeed granted, an appeal may come from either the environmentalists or the industrialists, and that appeal will go to the agency.  Are the agency then their own appeals body?  I am not quite sure about that.  Are An Bord Pleanála still the appeals board for planning?  Are the agency to supplant An Bord Pleanála where the licences are concerned and are An Bord Pleanála still to be the appeals board for planning? Perhaps there are very obvious answers to these questions but I would like to hear them.  I would like to have the whole matter of the appeals system clarified and to hear what are the relevant functions of An Bord Pleanála and the agency.</P>
    <P>Are the agency powerful enough &mdash; we all agree they should be &mdash; in the range of their brief?  Instead of saying, if necessary the agency will be given further powers and further functions, I would like to see some of these functions spelled out in the Bill.  For example, there is the matter of looking after the living environment, the flora and fauna.  There is reference in section 4 (2) (c) (i) of the Bill to plants and animals, but it is only an incidental reference.  I would like to see the agency to be given specific functions in the matter of protecting the living environment, the flora and fauna.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, we in Ireland have entered into various conventions for the protection of plant and animal life, but they remain conventions and they are not part of the domestic law.  They do not compel us to preserve the habitat in the way they should.  As Senator Naughten very properly pointed out, the habitat and the whole environment transends national boundaries.  We have sad experience of that from Sellafield, but it applies also to the wider European environment. Although I have never been known as a great European, there is certainly a case here for maximising co-operation between our environmental efforts and what is or what should be happening at European level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> There is reference in the Bill to a liaison between a particular European agency and this country, but I understand the agency in question do not really have any power.  They are just a co-ordinating body, perhaps a talking shop rather than something corresponding to a federal environmental protection agency.  I would be happier first if the agency had a more specific brief as far as flora and fauna is concerned and, secondly, if that brief had some real application which would transcend a purely national level. As I have said already, I would like the agency to be given more functions in that regard.  Perhaps sections 52 and 53 provide for the extension of the powers and functions of the agency if that is seen to be the proper course.</P>
    <P>To come back to the independence of the agency and of their officials, reference has been made already to the necessity to have a director general and fellow directors who would be seen to be above suspicion.  I think it was Senator Naughten who referred to the selection process in this regard.  We should make that process as water-tight as possible. Again, I congratulate the Minister in this connection in striving to ensure that the appointments are made in a very impartial manner, a manner which is not influenced by the prejudices of the selection committee who are a kind of assessors board.</P>
    <P>Section 21 (2) deals with the composition of the board.  I understand this provision is more or less taken from the way in which the officials of An Bord Pleanála are appointed.  I notice there is a committee of six people, one of whom is Secretary to the Government and one Secretary of the Department of the Environment.  There is also the Managing Director of the IDA and the General Secretary of the ICTU.  They are four people out of six who, it is fair to say, could be described as conservatives in this regard, people who would not, environmentally, be very adventurous, and who would not be dying to preserve the environment as distinct from being very anxious to bring in industry and so on.  The secretaries of the Government <Col N="714" /> and the Department of the Environment would not be where they are today if they were not conservative people, that goes without saying.  The managing director of the IDA, while he may not obviously be guilty of industrial pollution or anything of that kind, we know from the cases he has to make that he is on the other side, so to speak.  He is the third person.  Naturally the concern of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is to maximise employment. I, personally, have a great deal of sympathy with that point of view.  If I had to state where I stood in the matter of the environment versus industry &mdash; though as the Minister very properly said, there should not be that kind of contradiction &mdash; I would have to say I am an employment man.</P>
    <P>I understand that point of view but, at the same time, I am looking at the composition of the committee, and I suggest that there are four out of six there who will say that the man to be appointed must not be airy-fairy in these matters and that he must have a proper concern for industrial development and so on.  We have two more &mdash; obviously by profession the chairperson of the council of An Taisce will be an environmentalist and I am not sure where the chief executive of the Council for the Status of Women will stand in this regard.  Maybe I am invoking an imaginary scenario.  Nonetheless, there should be a better way of composing this selection committee.  I certainly would have that criticism of the Bill.  I agree with Senator Naughten that I do not think it guarantees the kind of independence we are looking for that the final power of selection should be left to the Minister and the Government.  It is not too fanciful or too outlandish to suggest that the name of this most important official in this most important Act should be brought before the Oireachtas, as I understand is the case in the nomination for Ombudsman.  I support Senator Naughten that there should be ultimate Oireachtas approval for this kind of appointment.  I am not too happy about that particular section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the dimension of public input and access to information. <Col N="715" /> We must all be very happy about that, especially since it goes against the conservative grain, as it were, to put that kind of guarantee of access into a Bill of this kind.  The Minister is perfectly right; the thing will not work unless that kind of participation by the public and knowledge by the public is built into the Bill because that is also part of the credibility of the agency.  I welcome this open door approach to environmental information. It is a great step forward that we should have access to information, including results of environmental impact assessment and reports on specific incidents. All that strengthens the public right to know.  I wonder if that is somewhat at odds with the provision on confidentiality in section 38.  I may misunderstand that; it may be that confidentiality has a very narrow meaning here but it seems to extend to many people who have to keep their mouths shut about privileged and confidential information.  Is putting that in really necessary?  Is it the Official Secrets Act mentality, the censorship mentality, the closed doors mentality?  Is it really necessary?  At the back of our minds we have the suspicion about people closing up records and putting them under lock and key and so on but in the area of environmental control the maximum information is necessary.  That may well conflict with the guarantee of public access.</P>
    <P>Besides, there is a curiosity in the Bill &mdash; and I speak entirely as a layman &mdash; in section 9 which specifies these properly formidable fines.  I only hope that they are serious, that they are not like the £800 fine that was supposed to be imposed for dropping litter in the streets.  I hope that £10 million will not remain a dead letter. Section 9 (i) (b) says that a person guilty of an offence under this Act shall be liable on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £10 million.  I am not being totally facetious, Minister, when I ask if this draconian provision is applicable to those who break secrecy under section 38 because they are persons guilty of an offence under this Bill?  If that offers an <Col N="716" /> opportunity for mischievous exploiters of this loophole, then it should be removed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of licence and service charges as well as the payment of court fines to the Environmental Protection Agency.  It is a move towards the principle of &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; which is very welcome.  Of course, that policy reduces the financial burden on central and local Government at the same time and allows a greater percentage of budget allocations to be spent in environmental protection and monitoring, the purposes to which they should be devoted, which is a good thing.</P>
    <P>The two previous Senators spoke about adequate resources.  There is not much more to be said on that.  The Minister has quoted a figure here, which I accept, and obviously Senator Naughten is right in saying that the agency will not work without adequate resources.  It is an insult to the Minister's intelligence to labour that point any further.  Staffing, as well as resources, is important and I hope the whole business of staffing will not be a long drawn out process.  I greatly fear that this could be one area where the operation could be held up.  I read somewhere &mdash; maybe not in the Minister's speech &mdash; that the summer of this year was mentioned as a date by which the agency could be up and running.  That is very optimistic, but I hope there will not be any great delays in the staffing process.</P>
    <P>Finally, I welcome the Bill's strong and wide ranging powers and would like to again emphasise that its effectiveness depends on the independence of the agency, particularly of its chief officer, the director general.  Its effectiveness also depends on adequate budget allocation, staffing and resources and, of course, the fleshing out of the Bill itself, with the necessary guidelines and regulations.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on parts of her speech.  Generally, speeches we are presented with in this House tend to be pretty predictable and rather boring, but I was struck by the Minister's philosophy of environmental protection in which she says it is no longer an issue of jobs or the environment in the nineties, it is an issue of jobs because of the environment.  I <Col N="717" /> wish I had thought of that first.  That is a very good and striking way of putting it.  I am glad the Minister said she is determined that the agency should not be seen as anti-industry.  I fully subscribe to those statements of philosophy on the Minister of State's part.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, I could hardly be described as an environmentalist.  I remember getting into trouble on a &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme a couple of years ago, in the context of an argument about Sandoz in Cork Harbour &mdash; the Minister of State does not need to be informed that we in Cork are particularly pre-occupied with those arguments about the environment &mdash; when I confessed myself as satisfied with what I had heard up to then of the case being made for Sandoz.  I went to the briefing they gave to the local authorities and was impressed by what they said.  On the &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme I said: &ldquo;Yes, I am for Sandoz coming to Cork Harbour&rdquo;.  There was some talk from the audience about smells which they had endured &mdash; it is an area where I walk quite a lot, down around Passage and Monkstown &mdash; and I pointed out that life is not entirely odourless.  I may say that I received at least two letters promising me that two votes were gone for that statement.</P>
    <P>We should be prepared to put up with a certain amount of discomfort and inconvenience, provided it is no more than that, if it does guarantee employment. That is where I still stand.  As Members of this House may know, I have frequently advocated the benefits of developing tourism.  I am particularly strong on the dimension of hill walking and that kind of thing which remains untapped as an aspect of tourism.  Therefore, in the end I must be an environmentalist in that regard but the Minister of State's point is very well stated.  I greatly and enthusiastically welcome the Bill and wish her well and the Bill great success.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, to the House.  We <Col N="718" /> all agree that the Environmental Protection Agency Bill represents the most important development in environmental protection the country has ever seen.  It underlines the Progressive Democrats' unique record of achievement in the area of environmental protection&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As no one else is saying it, I might as well say, &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Miss Keogh Miss Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Miss Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the ending of the planning compensation scandal and the smog problem, the introduction of this Bill marks a third decisive achievement on the environment by the Progressive Democrats in Government and we are only 18 months down the road. While others in the past talked about the need for action on the environment the Progressive Democrats have delivered.</P>
      <P>The Bill should be welcomed as it marks the first comprehensive move away from environmental <i>ad hoc-ery</i> and strikes a balance between industry and the environment.  I am happy that it has been warmly welcomed by organisations such as Earthwatch, on the one side, and by the Confederation of Irish Industry on the other.  It has a wider significance than the structure being put in place.  It is responsive legislation which is built on the real concerns of people.  That should not be under-estimated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just a few years ago many people saw environmental damage as a juggernaut rolling over people which was unstoppable. The smog problem in Dublin was a very obvious example.  People could not see one foot in front of them and there were people on trollies in casualty wards who could not breathe.  It seemed as if there was no solution to the problem.  We had smoke control zones but that did not lead to the problem being controlled as there were vested interests eager to explain that nothing much could be done in the short term.  However, the Government, through the determination of the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, took clear and courageous action to ban bituminous coal and, in the process, gave us back the sky at night.  As the Minister <Col N="719" /> stated, this resulted in an improvement in air quality this winter of up to 80 per cent in some parts of Dublin.  We now have air fit to breathe and a city fit to live in.  The Minister of State has also stated that very few decisions made by the Government recently have had such a dramatic and positive effect.  To put it another way, it is amazing what &ldquo;a temporary little arrangement&rdquo; can achieve if we put our minds to it.</P>
    <P>The Bill, and the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency, are a continuation of the direction set, perhaps in a small way at first, by the ban on bituminous coal and the beginning of a system to ensure that environmental justice is not just done but is seen to be done.  That has not been the public's perception up to now.</P>
    <P>We often talk about our educated young people but people of all ages are well informed and are sceptical.  The protests which have been mounted to prevent the placement of chemical plants in particular areas have not been either ignorant or naive.  Given that we live in a global village, aware lay people not only know the poisoning of the Rhine but many of them can name the companies who have caused the poisoning.  The general public have experienced a total lack of faith in the forces of environmental law and order during the past few years. The rules and regulations might have been there but the will and the competence to enforce them was missing.</P>
    <P>The general reaction was that any industry which used or generated toxic materials had to go somewhere else.  That was called the NIMBY syndrome &mdash; not in my backyard, thank you.  We have already seen this operated internationally. For instance, ships carrying questionable waste were shunted from port to port and people in Ireland began not to trust industry.  They said, &ldquo;we do not trust the methods used at present for monitoring and control and until something changes radically we will not have particular types of industry in our area&rdquo;. Nothing could be more dangerous to our industrial base than this progressive loss <Col N="720" /> of faith in industry and in the semi-State bodies controlling the environmental behaviour of industry.</P>
    <P>We need to make that clear.  Indeed, the Minister of State stated this today. This is not an anti-industry Bill, it is proindustry and will create the framework for industrial development in the nineties and will give environmentally responsible industries a chance to prove that they are environmentally responsible.  In recent times many industries have been concerned that they will find themselves on the wrong side of public opinion, not because of anything they have done but because of the practices or problems of other companies in the same or related industries.  The Bill will change all that.</P>
    <P>The new agency will identify rotten apples in the barrel and prevent the contamination by them of law-abiding companies with a commitment to excellence. Law-abiding companies with a commitment to excellence will welcome the Bill because it is structured to make more coherent and comprehensive the entire interpretation of environmentally related rules and regulations here.  The EPA will be a unified, cohesive and effective agency with responsibilities in the areas of licensing, monitoring, control and enforcement.  Furthermore, from my reading of the Bill, it will function in the real world of industry and business. Phrases like, &ldquo;the best available technology&rdquo; have been utilised to ensure that what will be required of industry is realistic at the time but flexible enough to allow for constant improvement.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the Bill worries me a little.  Some attention has been paid to the size of the fines which may be levied &mdash; Professor Murphy touched on this briefly &mdash; but these are and must be seen as indicators of just how serious we are about implementing controls.  I feel a little like the apocryphal passerby who, when asked for street directions by motorists, has a problem in giving them and who eventually says, &ldquo;if I was going there, I would not start from here.&rdquo;  If we are to retain and enhance the marvellous environment we have in Ireland this will not be achieved by admiring the scale of <Col N="721" /> punishment meted out to those who will not abide by the rules.  That is starting at the wrong place.  By that I mean that those whose operations fall within the EPA's ambit should not look at the agency only as a policing authority to be specified by minimal obedience to the rules, or, in other words, obeying the letter but not the spirit of the law.  If industry, agriculture and local authorities were all just to keep out of trouble by obeying the rules and doing no more than that, we might just about be able to maintain our current situation, but we should be able to expect more than that.  This Bill highlights the opportunity we have to take on more responsibility for ourselves.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to this House previously about waste.  We are running into a problem at the moment because, individually and collectively we are generating incredible amounts of waste.  At the same time we are questioning &mdash; even opposing &mdash; the provision of further landfill sites to accommodate that waste.  We are not only running out of space to cope with our waste but also running out of willingness to have such dumps near us.  Ultimately this problem has to be solved. It is the irresistible force meeting the immovable object.  I look forward to the new legislation on waste on which the Department are working at the moment. The EPA will have an input on toxic waste and on waste improperly disposed of, but we have to have much more than that.  Industry needs to save itself money by reducing the amount of waste it generates. Individual shoppers need to become more ruthless about the amount of packaging they are prepared to pay for, knowing that this packaging must at some later stage either be burned, using up energy and adding to greenhouse gases, or be disposed of in some other way that costs land and the energy to transport it to the disposal site.  I hope, therefore, that industry in particular will not think the lowest common denominator is appropriate for this Bill.  It is too important and has a far greater significance than that.</P>
    <P>The EPA can help us to hold up our <Col N="722" /> heads internationally.  They can help us get a grip on the worst of our environmental problems and can change the time frame so that we are preventing disaster rather than mopping up after it.  In that sense the EPA will give us a base line, a foundation.  Environmentally friendly industry and environmentally concerned agriculture will build on that base line and go much further than meeting its bare specifications.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to the make-up of the groups who will advise the director of this new agency.  Senator Murphy has referred to this in a different context. The point has been made repeatedly that women are under-represented on our State boards.  Therefore, I welcome particularly the appointment of the Chief Executive of the Council for the Status of Women to the committee for the new agency.  Women have played a strong, assertive part in the environment movement and this is quite properly acknowledged at this time.  I would like other Ministers to take the lead from this and to acknowledge women's contribution by appointing more of them to State boards.</P>
    <P>We will have the opportunity on Committee Stage to go through the various aspects of the Bill.  Once again I want to say how much I welcome this Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on her pioneering work and her approach in inviting input from so many interested and disparate groups in the formulation of the Bill.  It displays an openmindedness which should be appreciated, and I hope it will mean the workings of the agency will be understood and supported by not only all those groups but all sectors of this society.  The Minister has given us a chance to get our act together environmentally speaking.  I hope we use it to the full.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>In general I welcome the Bill.  It is good and has many desirable aspects.  The idea behind it is excellent. I thank the Minister for facilitating the introduction of the Bill in the House and, of course, I thank Senator Fallon who did tremendous work in organising the introduction of the Bill here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="723" /> Regarding the organisational structure of the Bill, I share a good deal of the concerns expressed by Senator Naughten about the independence of the members of the board.  I accept that the organisations nominated to select these people are independent but I see no great reason why those organisations simply would not be allowed to nominate one person rather than having to nominate four and continue, therefore, to give the Minister a choice as to who should be on the board. If independence is the first priority then I would have thought that the nomination of the people who are going on to the board would be left to the organisations just like that.</P>
    <P>It is rumoured that the agency are to be located in County Wexford in Johnstown Castle.  In many ways that is a worthwhile suggestion.  Johnstown Castle has a long and very good tradition in agricultural research.  Some of the finest agricultural scientists that the country produced made their names in Johnstown Castle, for example, the late Dr. Tom Walsh and the present Director of Teagasc, Dr. Pierce Ryan.  A very large body of expertise is at present located in Johnstown Castle in County Wexford and it will be very appropriate if the agency is located there.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the environment in Ireland is by international standards very clean.  We also have an image of having a clean environment in Europe.  That is a very valuable asset and it is vital that we leave no stone unturned in seeking to protect that reputation. That reputation is an accumulating asset and, I think that as the years unfold, it will be worth much more than at present. Many of the powers of the Bill relate to things like recommendations, producing codes of conduct and advising the Minister and local authorities.  These things, while very desirable in many ways, have no legal force.  The legally enforceable aspects which will have a direct impact on the environment seem to come in relation to the licensing powers defined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to the environmental impact assessment I would like to see the <Col N="724" /> Bill expanded considerably.  The agency should have definite powers to make input into environmental impact assessments. They should have power to veto certain developments.  They should have power to veto certain projects that the organisation itself consider to be deleterious and unacceptable for the environment. The agency should have a much greater role in planning.  They can be reined in by the provisions of section 76 of the Bill wherein the Minister can give policy directives to the agency.  The agency may not be absolutely obliged to accept those policy directives, but in the real world there is no doubt that those policy directives will determine what will and will not be done.</P>
    <P>The powers of inspection are confined to offences committed under the Bill.  I see no great reason why it would not be desirable that these powers of inspection be expanded to cover the whole range of problems with the environment, for example, problems under the planning code, the Wildlife Act and so on.</P>
    <P>The cultural environment is not dealt with at all in the Bill.  It has been completely left out of the picture.  For example, the protection of historic monuments and listed buildings is not at all enhanced by what is contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Of course, the provisions of the Bill will not apply to existing industries.  That is a pity.  I would like to see a transitional period whereby the provisions of the Bill would cover the activities of existing industries say, perhaps, over a transitional period of two or maybe even five years.</P>
    <P>There are no provisions for appeal against the decisions the agency will reach.  That is unacceptable to large numbers of the public.  In Ireland we are very anxious to have the capacity to appeal against decisions of various planning organisations, and I would like the Minister to reconsider that so that people who feel aggrieved and dissatisfied on either side of the case can appeal.  They should be accommodated in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed there are no criteria laid down in respect of oral hearings and the circumstances in which such hearings <Col N="725" /> will be held.  Some guidelines should be established as to the circumstances in which oral hearings can or cannot be held.</P>
    <P>The penalties outlined for offences committed are comprehensive: for example, a fine of £10 million is a large amount of money even to the biggest organisations but I would contend it is an unsophisticated way of dealing with the problem.  I should like to see the Environmental Protection Agency having the capacity to order polluters to remedy the problems they have created and to clean up the damage done by their pollution.  I should also like to see the agency play a role in the formation and development of environmental policy by them establishing clear criteria and standards rather than guidelines.  The agency should have a wider role in ensuring the adequacy and acceptability of environmental monitoring.</P>
    <P>Many of the provisions of the Bill will be dependent on Ministerial regulations and orders being made.  For example, extra functions of the agency, including the adoption of international obligations, will be dependent on Ministerial orders as will the setting of effluent standards; general environmental monitoring programmes; information on environmental impact statements.  There will be various regulations to be made, in conjunction with the Minister for the Marine in relation to aquaculture, dumping of waste at sea and so on.  It is to be regretted that general policy directives will also be dependent on the making of Ministerial orders.  The obligation on agencies to consult the Environmental Protection Agency will also be dependent on the making of Ministerial orders as will procedures for application of review of licences, changes in relation to emissions, standards and so on and the payment of fees to the agency.  It will be seen that a large number of the provisions of this Bill are indeed dependent on the making of Ministerial orders.</P>
    <P>That dependence raises a number of questions, the first of which is will the agency have the capacity to cope if all such orders are made rapidly?  The <Col N="726" /> second question that arises is whether there will be a temptation in certain circumstances for the Minister to refrain from making such orders when it may not be politically suitable for him to do so. There are also a number of matters of considerable concern in relation to the funding of the agency.  First, it is desirable that the agency would have the capacity to generate their funds, allowing them to be independent of Government.  One concern arises therefrom, which is that if in some circumstances the agency is run inefficiently, it could be contended that, in a way, we are giving them a licence to be inefficient because they can strike their own fees and then continue to perpetuate that inefficiency indefinitely.  I do not know whether there is an easy answer.  I suggest the costings of the agency should be compared with those of their internatonal counterparts and that some costings be undertaken on the basis of unit costs.</P>
    <P>If the agency is to be effective we are talking about a very large investment in our environment.  I have read through the environment programme published around this time last year.  From a quick perusal I observe that that programme contained commitments to spend something of the order of £1,000 million over the next ten years or so.  If that investment is not carried through the whole programme will be defeated.</P>
    <P>With regard to the BATNEECs and so on, it would have been my wish that the Minister would have left it at that, in other words, that the agency would operate on the basis of the best available technology.  There are a number of reasons for that, one of the most important being that, when things go wrong, when pollution problems arise, ultimately it is the public, the ordinary taxpayer, who must pick up the tab. Therefore it is a pity it was not left to the best available technology rather than BATNEEC.  It would be my concern that this may well provide lawyers with a field day because the definition of &ldquo;best available technology&rdquo; is open to a wide range of interpretation.  For example, one of <Col N="727" /> the definitions talks in terms of the technology being suitable for the purpose.  I wonder who will ultimately determine whether a given technology is suitable for the purpose?  That will be very much a value judgment.  It would be my fear that those types of value judgments will be made by the courts involving excessive legal costs and may also provide people with a means of delaying decisions and so on.</P>
    <P>There is reason to be concerned about the matter of finance to be invested or expended which is the key issue here.  I believe there are problems being encountered already in relation to the water and air pollution Acts because of inadequate finance having been made available to police the implementation of the provisions of those Acts.  I predict problems arising in relation to how the new agency will relate to local authorities in that the latter may well find themselves being prosecuted or pursued by the new agency for not having fulfilled all their obligations in relation to environmental matters. Of course the reason such local authorities may be unable to fulfil those obligations may well be lack of finance from Government.  That would appear to me to have the makings of a delightful environmental Catch-22 situation.</P>
    <P>I would be anxious that the results of the monitoring of environmental activities, analyses and so on be made available to the public so that they would not be dependent on regulations and orders being made by the Minister.  I would be anxious also that data relating to public organisations and private companies likewise be made available to the public.  I should like there to be a mandatory waste audit to determine where waste emanated and where it should be disposed of. There should also be an obligation, where appropriate, on companies to carry out research on reducing the amount of waste they generate, obliging them to attempt to produce a cleaner environment by the investment of an appropriate amount of money in research and development.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to make is in <Col N="728" /> relation to the possible unconstitutionality of section 82 (8) in that it has been suggested to me that the two months time limit on seeking a judicial review of a licence may be unconstitutional. I believe there are precedents relating to an earlier judgment on the part of Mr. Justice Costello in relation to a case heard in 1987 which would give one reason to believe that that may be a possibility.  I would request the Minister to have her legal advisers review the position in the context of that judgment to ensure that the provisions of that section are not deemed to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill to establish the Environmental Protection Agency has been hailed by critics of official policies, groups like Earthwatch and An Taisce, as an important milestone in environmental protection.  The fact that it contains 109 sections and two Schedules is evidence of the amount of work that has gone into its preparation over the past 15 months or so.  It is clear that without the personal commitment and tenacity of the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, the legislation would not be as impressive as it is.  This does not mean that it cannot be improved and I am sure the Minister will be the first to admit this.  I know the Minister will welcome constructive debate on the provisions of the Bill and I am sure that worthwhile amendments will be taken on board.</P>
      <P>I am impressed with the Minister's determination to ensure that from the outset the EPA will be independent of the Department of the Environment and of the Government.  Without that independence we would have a revamped version of An Foras Forbartha.  It is generally agreed that if the EPA are to be effective in restoring public confidence in the monitoring and control of pollution they must be independent.  This independence has been assured in the Bill by the adoption of an arms-length approach, similar to the approach to An Bord Pleanála, by the Minister in the appointment of the EPA director general on the full-time board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EPA will have regard to the need <Col N="729" /> for high environmental standards and sustainable development.  The principle will be that the polluter will pay.  They will have to achieve a balance between the need to protect the environment and the need for infrastructural, economic and social progress and development. This legislation is clearly marking the agency's cards in striking a balance between what could be seen as conflicting objectives.  The argument as to jobs versus a clean environment will always follow in a debate on the environment. Jobs are vital but the question to be asked is, do we want jobs at any price?  Do we want jobs at the price of air pollution and the pollution of rivers and lakes?  We must move very slowly on this.  Indeed, the Minister in her address this evening made the point that the Bill is not anti-industry, but pro-environment.</P>
    <P>Apart from regulating pollution from a range of industries both existing and proposed, the EPA will have sweeping powers to supervise the environmental protection role of local authorities even to the extent in some cases of taking over their functions.  In this respect it has become a sort of bureaucratic busy-body type of scheme, different to An Bord Pleanála who have performed in a relatively passive way.  That will be one of the big differences between An Bord Pleanála and the EPA.</P>
    <P>It is vital that good relations exist between local authorities and the agency for the success of the scheme.  One of the problems we always run into where local authorities are pursuing polluters, is ensuring that local authorities are not polluters.  In Athlone, and in many other parts of the country, we have had raw sewage going into the River Shannon while the council were suing polluters in other parts of the county.  Local authorities have a very important role in the success of this Bill.  The Bill which has a comprehensive range of proposals affecting public authorities, industry and so on, requires detailed examination.</P>
    <P>The Bill can impose huge responsibilities, without control and unspecified costs on sanitary authorities.  I would be very interested to hear from other <Col N="730" /> Senators their interpretation of the liability of elected councils.</P>
    <P>The new agency will be directly responsible for licensing and the control of activities in areas affecting a total range of economic activities and will significantly affect the current role of local authorities.  On close examination of the wide powers and functions of the agency, and the ideals contained in the Bill for the protection of the environment, I find some difficulty in appreciating how a central body can effectively perform at arms length from the problem areas.  That is one of the worries I have about the Bill. I am sure the provisions can be implemented; time will tell.  I am sure the Minister will address that when replying. That is a reservation I have about the control over local authorities and the resultant costs to the agency in relation to many aspects of the proposed activities.</P>
    <P>I will be asking questions on various sections in order to get clarification and information so that I can have a greater understanding of the role, functions and effectiveness of the agency as it affects our lives and activities.</P>
    <P>Section 3 indicates that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;local authority&rdquo; means&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in the case of the administrative county of Dublin, other than the borough of Dún Laoghaire, the council of the county of Dublin,</P>
    <P>(b)  in the case of the borough of Dún Laoghaire, the corporation of the borough,</P>
    <P>(c)  in the case of a county borough, the corporation of the county borough, and</P>
    <P>(d)  in the case of any other administrative county, the council of the county,</P>
    <P>Why exclude urban district councils?  It does not seem right that Westmeath County Council, for instance, should have to answer for Athlone Urban Council, when at the moment the urban council provide services of an environmental nature to approximately 10,000 people in the environs of the town.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="731" /> Section 4 includes, in the definition of &ldquo;environmental protection&rdquo;, the term &ldquo;preservation of the quality of the environment&rdquo;. This latter aspiration should be defined to avoid some group seeking a direction in the courts at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Section 5 speaks of not entailing excessive costs to acquire best suitable technology to prevent, limit or eliminate emissions.  Who is the best gauge of excessive costs, the agency, the public, industry or the courts?  I am aware in my county of a requirement of the council to have a local industry instal equipment which cost £1.5 million, to reduce emissions from a factory.  It must be said that remedial work like this costs money.  This reference should be further clarified.</P>
    <P>Section 8 refers to offences by the body corporate and lays down that the guilt can extend to the director, manager, secretary and so on.  This means that under section 9, a county manager or county secretary because of delays outside their control in dealing with this Bill could find themselves in very serious trouble if not in jail.  If the neglect is a consequence of unwillingness by a council or its staff this can then reflect on its manager or secretary. Section 9 outlines pretty harsh penalties.</P>
    <P>The proposed agency comprises of a director general with four full-time directors and an advisory committee of 11. It is recognised that the expertise of the director general of the EPA, and of his other full-time directors, will be crucial to the success of the new agency.  It has been suggested to me that the person be head-hunted at home and abroad.  If this is what has to be done to get the right person for the job, this is what should be done.  As I have said, this will be the key person to this whole operation.</P>
    <P>The advisory committee consists of 11, seven of whom will be nominated by community, environmental, professional and other organisations.  I do not know what groups will be eligible to nominate to the advisory group.  In so far as the other four are concerned I assume the Minister will have the power to appoint the balance.  I suggest that local authorities, through the <Col N="732" /> General Council of County Councils, should have some members on that advisory committee, perhaps two, three or four.  I would make a very strong plea for members of the General Council of County Councils to be nominated to this important advisory committee which has a very important role to play.  The functions of the advisory committee are listed in section 28, and are very impressive.  It is their duty to make recommendations to the agency and to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 29 deals with staffing. Redeployment will take place but will the transferred staff from other public agencies be on contract or what will the terms of employment be?</P>
    <P>Section 40 refers to the appointment of committees and consultative groups. It can be said, however, the Bill is silent on the make-up of these groups.  Section 42 establishes regional environmental units for the performance of functions handed down by the agency.  No reference is made as to how these units are to be selected and what areas of the country they will cover.</P>
    <P>Section 44 refers to agreements between the agency and public authorities and that entry into such an agreement by the local authority shall be a reserved function but the section does not mention who ultimately has the legal responsibility for delivering the service undertaken in the agreement.  The functions of the agency are referred to in section 51 which states:</P>
    <P>(1) (a)  &ldquo;the licensing, regulation and control of activities for the purposes of environmental protection;</P>
    <P>(c)  the provision of support and advisory services for the purposes of environmental protection to local authorities... in relation to the performance of any function of those authorities,</P>
    <P>(2) (a)  keep itself informed of the policies and objectives of public authorities whose functions have... a bearing on matters with which the Agency is concerned;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="733" /> (d)  ensure, in so far as is practicable, that a proper balance is achieved between the need to protect the environment and the need for infrastructural economic and social progress....</P>
    <P>This is very important.  The EPA should not be operating aloof from the political realities of life.  It is vital that the agency at all times keep themselves fully informed of the policies and objectives of the relevant authorities notably the EC and the Government.</P>
    <P>Section 55 states:</P>
    <P>The Agency may, and shall when requested by the Minister, give information or advice or make recommendations for the purposes of environmental protection, to a local authority or to local authorities generally in relation to the performance of any of its or their functions.</P>
    <P>It is noted that regard shall be paid to such information, advice or recommendations.</P>
    <P>Section 57 states that the agency may require a sanitary authority to submit such information as required, &ldquo;about the monitoring of the quality of water... pursuant to the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988,&rdquo; and (b) &ldquo;The agency shall carry out, cause to be carried out, or arrange for, such monitoring... to verify information&rdquo; submitted by local authorities.  It is encouraging that an annual report will be provided to the Minister and that each report in turn will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 58 (8) states:</P>
    <P>The agency shall, from time to time, prepare and publish reports on the quality of effluents being discharged from plant, sewers or drainage pipes.</P>
    <P>That is very important because we are not preparing enough reports to be made available to the public.</P>
    <P>Section 59 refers to the landfill sites.  I have a particular interest in this section. It refers to site selection and design.  It <Col N="734" /> goes on to make the point that local authorities shall carry out such monitoring in connection with the management or operation of the landfill site as the agency shall direct, and results must be sent to the agency who must verify the results.  The agency from time to time shall publish reports on the management and operation of the landfill sites and include recommendations.  The Minister knows that Westmeath County Council recently engineered a landfill site at Athlone to serve the town and the entire south Westmeath area.  It was engineered in such a way to meet all known international and EC standards at a cost of £1.25 million.  That is a huge cost to meet the environmental standards of today. While the State meets fully the capital costs for water and sewerage schemes it is strange that no grant is available for solid waste management.  Consideration should be given to grant-aid landfill sites as constructed to the standards that are required by EC directives and now by legislation.  The type of landfill site we have in Athlone should, I believe, have qualified for a grant.  I know the Minister intends to look at this site.  Should she get an opportunity to be in Athlone she should examine this because it is a very fine engineering feat.</P>
    <P>Section 60 states: &ldquo;Where the Agency is of opinion that a local authority has failed to perform a statutory function... in relation to environmental protection ...the Agency may request a report ...from the authority...&rdquo;.  It states that having considered any report of the local authority the agency may issue such advice and recommendations to the local authority or provide assistance or support on terms to be agreed.  It goes on to make the point that any of these directions shall not be given unless the local authority has the necessary funds to comply with the direction or those funds can reasonably be made available by it.</P>
    <P>Section 60 (3) (c) states:</P>
    <P>The agency shall not give a direction ...unless the local authority, with due regard to its other statutory functions, has the necessary funds to comply with <Col N="735" /> the direction or those funds can reasonably be made available by it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to confirm that this exemption applies to all dealings of the agency with the local authorities, particularly under sections 58, 59 and 65.  The question of the environmental impact assessment has taken on new importance in recent years.  Section 69 refers to this item and goes on to indicate that the agency may and shall, if directed by the Minister, prepare guidelines on information to be contained in the environmental impact statement and the local authority must have regard to the guidelines in considering any environmental impact statement submitted.  The Minister may require a copy of an environmental impact statement to be sent to the agency.  The agency may make a submission to the local authority on statements submitted and the local authority must have regard to such observations or submissions.  The agency shall, subject to terms being agreed, provide assistance to a local authority in relation to the assessment of an environmental impact statement.  The local authority must consult the agency and regard must be had to their views on the different points and particularly in relation to the environmental impact assessment regulations under the Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act.  The agency can exercise general supervision over the monitoring carried out by local authorities in this area but what effect will this have on the role of sanitary authorities?  How can a centrally located agency effectively police the workings of so many authorities?</P>
    <P>Section 71 is important in that it seeks to implement environmental audits and this is to be commended.  The intention to organise to promote, to assist by conferences, seminars and lectures will highlight the importance of such an audit and help to minimise the impact of any project on the quality of life.  Under the provisions of section 72 the intention to prepare guidelines setting out environmental quality objectives will assist all development bodies to undertake their <Col N="736" /> function in the light of the best information.</P>
    <P>Sections 101 and 102 cover special reports and investigations into circumstances surrounding any incident of environmental pollution and can arrange for an inquiry.  What role, if any, will the sanitary authorities play in the future management and control of its functional areas and, more importantly, from whom will the public and the elected members seek information and satisfaction?</P>
    <P>Obviously much of this Bill is more suited to Committee Stage during which I anticipate a very lively debate because there are many queries which will obviously be answered by the Minister.  I appreciate the importance of our environment and the necessity to maintain our high standing all over the world.  The provisions of this Bill set the standards to be maintained.  I will listen carefully to other contributions and particularly, I would be interested to hear the contributions of local authority members who are members of the Seanad and would like to be assured that there will not be any overlap between the duties and responsibilities of sanitary authorities and the role and function of the new agency.</P>
    <P>As in so many other countries the environment in Ireland is coming under increased pressure.  This has led to growing public demand for the application and the strict enforcement of environmental protection standards based on the best available technology.  It is clear that unless local groupings and local communities can be assured that such standards will prevail, the attraction to Ireland of industry and modern industrial plant in particular localities will become increasingly difficult.  It is clear also that there would be advantages for industry, as well as for the environment, in the application of standards on a uniform and consistent basis across country and in the existence of a mechanism in which there would be full public confidence in monitoring and enforcing compliance with standards.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  As I indicated there have been queries which will be answered <Col N="737" /> by the Minister on Committee Stage.  A good environment is an incentive to attracting good industry; it is good for tourism and it is good for our way of life. As the Minister said, it is evidence that we are very serious about preserving our unspoilt environment.  Other speakers have suggested locations where the agency might be situated.  I come from Athlone, a most progressive town in the centre of Ireland, a town that this year celebrates its third centenary year and it would be a major boost for the town if it were selected as the venue for the agency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is true to say that environmental issues will play a prominent part in national and international political debate in the last decade of this century.  It is therefore particularly appropriate for us in Ireland to begin the decade with this Bill.  Whatever the arguments about the relative merits of the various proposals, this Bill will provide us with a basic framework for much pollution control well into the next century.  The Bill has six Parts, 109 sections and two Schedules covering much territory but they are united in one goal, a safer and cleaner environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the establishment of an environmental protection agency and an integrated pollution control licensing system in respect of a very wide range of activities contained in the First Schedule to the Bill. Tying together these provisions are common threads.  There is encouragement for individual citizens to act to protect their environment not least through improved access to environmental information.  There are greater powers of enforcement and tougher penalties for lawbreakers.  This Bill must be seen in the context of the adoption by the European Community in 1987 of the Fourth Environmental Action Programme, a programme which is to run for the six year period 1987-1992.  That programme emphasises that environmental protection has a central role to play in the whole corpus of community policies and that environmental protection needs to be taken into account <Col N="738" /> as a fundamental and basic factor when economic decisions are taken.</P>
    <P>In putting forward the fourth programme the European Commission expressed the view that the establishment of strict standards for environmental protection was no longer just an option but had indeed become essential, thus the need for high standards of environmental protection has become an imperative and an economic imperative at that.  The fourth programme of 1987 was pre-dated by two events of considerable significance in the development of the community environmental policy.  The first was the recognition by the European Council of Ministers in March of 1985 that environmental protection policy can contribute to improved economic growth and job creation.  The second event was the decision of the European Council of Ministers, on the recommendation of the Inter-Governmental Conference, to propose the inclusion in the amended Treaty of Rome of a charter on the environment. That decision was a plain recognition of the need for a developed Community environmental policy at the heart of the Community's other policies.</P>
    <P>Articles 130r, 130s and 130t of the Single European Act are, of course, particularly and immediately relevant to the environment.  In addition, the Treaty recognises that environmental protection actions may be important for the achievement of the Internal Market.  The thinking and approach of the European Community to environmental policy is well summarised in the following statement contained in the Fourth Programme of the Community, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Community environment policy is entering a new and crucially important phase.  With the agreement of the Governments of the Member States to the amendments to the Treaty of Rome contained in the Single European Act, the Community has given a new status and impetus to its environmental policy.</P>
    <P>The European Council has underlined that environmental protection can contribute to improved economic <Col N="739" /> growth and job creation; and it has called in stronger terms than ever before for the integration of environmental requirements into the economic, industrial, agricultural and social policies implemented by both the Community and its Member States.</P>
    <P>It was Lord Clinton Davies, European Commissioner charged with responsibility for transport, the environment and nuclear safety for four years, who said during the passage of the British Environmental Protection Act, legislation similar to that which we are now considering, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Environmental policies go to the heart of what today's European Community is all about.  It is not only about market refining; it is about society improving.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, only recently that we have seen most important and indeed one could say utterly remarkable changes affecting the development of environmental policies throughout the world. Until recently the environment was regarded as largely the interest of the slightly eccentric.  Happily, that view has changed very drastically.  I believe there has been a massive change in the perception of the environment and its importance.</P>
    <P>The driving force for this change, however, has not been Governments but the public throughout the European Community and indeed the world at large, a public who have become more aware, more concerned and more determined that the environment should be defended and protected.  That public is much more sceptical of experts, some of whom had been very patronising over the years.  Yet, on so many occasions these experts have been proved wrong.  Unfortunately, Chernobyl illustrates tragically and vividly that pollution does not stop at frontiers and that international and global action is required on an increasing scale to deal with regional and global environmental problems.</P>
    <P>The environment is today at the very <Col N="740" /> top of the political agenda in most civilised countries.  It is right that that should be so and that it is the case in this country also.  A very useful check list for all environmental legislation is the Fourth Environmental Action Programme adopted by the Council of Ministers in 1987, together with the principles as set out and adumbrated in the Single European Act.  The first guiding principle is designed to prevent irreversible damage to the environmental heritage of the 330 million people in the European Community. That principle involves tackling pollution at source, underlines how much more desirable is the anticipation of problems rather than crisis management and appreciates how costly crisis management can be.  Of course, there is the principle enshrined in the Single European Act that environmental requirments must be an essential component of all other policies, particularly transport and energy policies and such vital issues as vehicle emissions and emissions of sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide.</P>
    <P>As other speakers have said 1990 will certainly rank as a milestone year for environmental management here in Ireland.  In January 1990 an environment action programme, EAP, was published by the Department of the Environment and all those associated with the publication of that document deserve credit and congratulations.  I think it is also true to say that Ireland's Presidency of the European Community provided an opportunity and a stimulus to secure support both in this country and internationally for such a programme.  In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency Bill was published in December 1990.</P>
    <P>With regard to the EAP, I welcome in particular the decision of the Government to ensure that stringent standards for drinking water which are set by EC directives will be fully and consistently met in all areas in the country and that in the ten year period from 1990 to the year 2000 up to £300 million will be spent on new improved water supply schemes. I would also like to warmly welcome the decision by the Government to eliminate <Col N="741" /> by the year 2000 all pollution of inland waters by sewage discharges and also the decision to eliminate untreated discharges of sewage from major coastal towns in this country.  These decisions will involve, respectively, the investment of some £230 million and £400 million over the coming decade.</P>
    <P>The environmental impact assessment system is mandatory in this country since 1 February 1990.  Requiring formal studies of the environmental effects of major categories of development and requiring that such studies should be publicly available, the EIA system will ensure the fullest consideration of environmental issues in the making of decisions about major industrial proposals.  The new environmental protection agency will have an important role to play in this process.</P>
    <P>The basic purposes of the Bill are set out in the long Title.  These are to make further and better provision for the protection of the environment and the control of pollution; to establish, as has already been said, an environment protection agency, and to increase certain existing monetary penalties.  The Bill is divided into six Parts and two Schedules. I should like to join with the other Senators in paying tribute to the Minister of State for the enthusiasm and dedication she has shown in ensuring that this Bill is, first, so comprehensive and, secondly, that she has facilitated, in conjunction with the Leader of the House its introduction in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Part I deals with the question of interpretation and definitions and it introduces the concept of BATNEEC which requires the application of the best available technology not involving excessive costs, as is indicated in section 5. However, the problem with BATNEEC is that it could too readily be interpreted as putting cost above environmental protection. When this concept, which is not new, was discussed in the House of Commons and the House of Lords a much more simple and clear concept, the idea of the best practical environmental option, BPEO, was suggested by Lord <Col N="742" /> McIntosh in the House of Lords.  This phrase was also used by the Minister who introduced the Bill in the House of Lords, Lord Hesketh, when he introduced similar legislation there in May 1990.  Section 9 of Part I gives a strong warning to polluters who mess up the environment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber. I am sure he will be, as usual, understanding and willing to co-operate with any request we make on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion is extremely important dealing with an age old problem in the city of Dublin.  It is unfortunate that it <Col N="743" /> should rear its head at this time.  There were a number of years when there was tremendous emphasis on the development of Dublin as an attractive, vibrant, cultural capital and in the Millennium year of 1988 tremendous strides were made.  I would like to pay tribute to the then Lord Mayor, Carmencita Hederman who is now a Senator, for focusing so strongly on the whole issue of the environment in the city of Dublin and indeed in the nation generally.  Certainly there was tremendous focus on the city at that time.</P>
    <P>In the years 1989 and 1990 we debated in this House the Derelict Sites Bill and the Building Control Bill.  We put in place legislation to protect our city.  This year, 1991, Dublin has been designated cultural capital of Europe.  In the last couple of years we felt that the tide was turning in relation to prioritising the culture, the environment and the community of the city and that things were moving positively rather than negatively.  In the same period the Custom House Docks development took place, a desirable development in general terms.  In its structure there were plans for the development of a very attractive marina going down to the Liffey.  This is one of the major causes of this problem with the eastern by-pass.  In developing the marina, access to the port and docks on the north side of the Liffey was cut off.</P>
    <P>Presumably it was in that context that the Government, in co-operation with the European Commission, decided to agree to allocate £96 million to the Dublin port access route which stretched from Whitehall, the junction of the northern motorway from Swords, the airport and the North, down as far as East Wall.  That gave birth to the extension which became the eastern by-pass.  There were further proposals to cross the Liffey, proposals made at the time of the Dublin transport study in 1971.</P>
    <P>What was proposed, and what we had thought had been killed off in 1980, was that a multi-lane highway would go right across from Whitehall, tunnelling under houses in Griffith Avenue, across <Col N="744" /> grounds in Drumcondra partly owned by the Archbishop of Dublin and through the football grounds of Rosmini community school, a school for the partially blind.  It was intended that the laneway would cross the football pitch of that school before going through open cut and tunnelling underground past Fairview and the flats in Ballybough.  Imagine having a four lane highway and all the noise it would generate underneath one's house.  You would need one of Saddam Hussein's bunkers to escape all that noise.  That highway is to continue along the Tolka river.  How it will take place we still do not know.  It will then go into Dublin Port and there is a feasibility study as to how it will cross the Liffey.  It crosses over then to Sandymount and there is now a change from a previous proposal for an undercut which was originally there to keep it out of the view of passersby to new proposals for a tunnel.  It changes all the time.  There is a proposal for a further tunnel under Sandymount Strand and then a further feasibility study as to how it will go through Booterstown. This proposal has been made by Dublin engineers, not by Dublin planners.  The planning section in Dublin Corporation had almost no say in the Eastern by-pass project and the plan went from the engineers to the General Purposes Committee in Dublin Corporation &mdash; not the planning committee &mdash; which would have been the normal and proper body to have dealt with it.</P>
    <P>The original plan was amended to include the present plan incorporating the total length from Whitehall down to Booterstown; the only provision was that it would be subject to a feasibility study and an environmental impact study.  The ludicrous situation now is that the plans are before the public who have until 8 March to make their submissions objecting to these plans.  At the very same time, this month, we are embarking on a feasibility study which does not cover the entire route, only part of the route, and an environmental impact study, neither of which can be completed, even if they were comprehensive.  We all know they are not intended to be completed until <Col N="745" /> the exhibition is taken back to City Hall. Any objections were made subsequent to us possibly seeing the broad nature of the environmental impact or of any other feasibility issues.  The studies will come out in the middle of summer, July at the earliest, and the plans will be taken off exhibition by 8 March.  What a ludicrous set of procedures.  How could any decent planners with concern for the city, particularly when you think about the quantity of area, the extent of the possible problems that could arise and the number of communities that will be affectd by a highway going right through the city centre of Dublin, operate in that fashion? These are not just bad procedures, they are illegal.</P>
    <P>This is not something that the corporation should be doing because section 69 of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill that we were discussing today makes a specific reference to procedures that have to be adopted in relation to environmental planning.  It specifically refers to two Statutory Instruments to which I refer the Minister. Statutory Instrument 349 of 1989, the environmental impact assessment is a general Statutory Instrument in relation to planning and environmental impact. Statutory Instrument No. 221 of 1988 specifically deals with the European Community environmental impact assessment on motorways.  That instrument, which I took the opportunity of perusing in the Library, is very specific. Section 3 says that section 4 of the Act should be amended by the following section: Before making a scheme under this section a road authority shall have regard to the preservation of scenic and natural amenities and shall prepare an environmental impact study of the proposed motorway which shall identify, describe and assess the direct and indirect environmental defects of the construction of the proposed motorway before making the scheme.  What are the areas to be covered by the environmental impact study? First, human beings, fauna and flora; secondly, soil, water, air, climate, landscape; thirdly, the interaction between the matters referred to above; fourthly, <Col N="746" /> material assets and, fifthly, the cultural heritage.  It goes on to describe in considerable detail the proposed motorway and refers to the emission of pollutants and the creation of nuisance.  In relation to the environmental impact study, it states that when the scheme is being prepared a copy of the scheme and the map referring to the environmental impact study may be inspected and submissions can be made to the Minister and so on.</P>
    <P>Clearly the intent, both the spirit and the letter of that Instrument, is that feasibility and environmental studies would be made prior to possible objections being lodged because it is simply impossible to lodge comprehensive objections, with the full knowledge of what may be the nature of the objections, until the legislation, as prescribed by the European Community in 1988 and which is the law of this land at present, has been adhered to.  This development by the corporation, with the support of the Government because of their initial decision to put taxpayers' money and Structural Funds into it for this purpose, is not just a white elephant, it is in flagrant breach of the law of the land.</P>
    <P>It is intended that this roadway will have the capacity to take 70,000 cars, each car can, in the course of one year, produce approximately four times its own weight in pollutants through exhaust and gas omissions.  That is a frightening consequence and at the same time the public do not have available to them a scientific properly researched study of its impact. The Minister must immediately address this very serious matter.</P>
    <P>The second part of the motion relates to the amount of money to be spent, estimated at £200 million; indeed many commentators estimate it to be at least £300 million or £400 million, it could easily be double the original costing.  Is there an alternative?  We have a problem with Dublin Port which must be addressed.  A number of proposals have been made and they should certainly be the subject of an independent study.  That is what I mean when I talk about a feasibility study.  I am not just talking about a feasibility study that covers parts of <Col N="747" /> the motorway to see whether they are feasible in terms of the routes and so on. I am talking about the feasibility study which is required to see what is the best way of dealing with the problems that the corporation and the Government have identified in relation to access to the port and in relation to the gross congested overcrowding that takes place in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>A major contribution was made to the debate by the Electricity Supply Board with their set of proposals to transfer Dublin Port to a location at Lough-shinney on the north side of Dublin at a cost of £160 million, which would have ready access to the various areas to which the traffic goes.  Dublin Port conducted their own study and found that the cost was approximately double that proposed by the ESB.  Whatever the cost there is a feasible proposal meaning that all the problems created in relation to the development of Dublin in terms of transport problems and in terms of access to the port and heavy containerised traffic could be dealt with very simply in that fashion.  That proposal was made by a major body and costed by them.  It deserves an independent assessment.</P>
    <P>It is also possible that a tunnel could be constructed under the quays because, according to the plans, much of what we are talking about is going to be underground. Therefore, why not build a tunnel along the western, southern cross or northern by-pass routes?  How come this option was not considered in the feasibility study?  Can the existing railway line to the port be examined to see if it could be used to transport cargo to a central depot on the outskirts of the city from where it could be distributed nationwide as required?</P>
    <P>Those possibilities have not been the subject of any study and have not been considered.  We have decided to follow the straightforward policy which has existed for the past two decades and which has been revamped with a few minor alterations in relation to tunnelling. It has been dropped upon us again two decades after it was initially <Col N="748" /> proposed and one decade after it was rejected out of hand by the city council. Now, because of a majority on the city council, it has been accepted.</P>
    <P>On the issue of commuter traffic, we have to examine whether what is being proposed will lead to an increase or a decrease in traffic.  On the one hand, Dublin Corporation say this will be a fast lane for container traffic heading for the port and straight out on the southern side while, on the other hand, they tell every community in the city it will get rid of the problem of commuters cutting through small areas in East Wall, Ballybough and on the south side.  They are pretending that it will solve the two problems.  On the one hand they say only through traffic will be allowed while on the other they say it will relieve congestion.  It will not solve both problems.  What is going to happen?  Nobody seems to know.  All we know is that the old plans have been brought in again.</P>
    <P>The only effective commuter transport system we have designed so far in Dublin is the DART system.  Indeed, it has been so successful that more than 50 per cent of the workforce in the areas in which it operates use it whereas in other areas roughly 28 per cent of the workforce use public transport.  If we are to solve the problems in the city we must use a rapid light rail system, but this has not been considered either by the Government or by Dublin Corporation.  Approximately £27 million of taxpayers' and EC funds has been put aside for the development of the public transport system while approximately £300 million has been put aside for the construction of roads in the city.  This is ludicrous and anti the development of a vibrant city.</P>
    <P>This city could be developed like Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool where all the old buildings were knocked down and highways constructed or we could develop the city as other European cities have been developed, where inner cities and their communities have been preserved intact and restrictions have been placed on commuter traffic in and out of the city.  That is the choice we have to make.  Either we are going to have a <Col N="749" /> living, attractive city or a city of bricks and mortar and roads.  We have now reached the critical point.</P>
    <P>If this development goes ahead a highway will run through the centre of Dublin, traffic congestion will worsen, there will be an increase in the number of private cars in the city, resulting in heavier pollution and emissions, a decrease in the quality of life and the environment of the city, and an undermining of the city as a cultural capital. These are matters we have to address.  It is not only a matter for the local authority, the Government must also accept some responsibility.  I ask the Minister for the Environment to look at this matter again and tell the local authority that they must have a proper exhibition, subsequent to the feasibility study and the environmental impact assessment.  This road scheme and its purpose should be reviewed and all the other possibilities should be the subject of an independent examination and review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding the motion, I wish to state that it must be obvious to everyone that traffic in Dublin is chaotic and inordinate amounts of time are lost commuting relatively short distances. This problem has plagued the city for the past 20 years or more.  In addition, in recent times we have seen a new disorder, that is the new phenomenon of rat running. Indeed, Senator Costello mentioned a number of rat runs in the north of the city.  I can tell him and the House that there is no shortage of rat runs in the south of the city; it is a dull day when one does not receive representations about some rat run in some part of Dublin south.  This morning I was at a meeting attempting to solve one such problem in Harold's Cross.  Problems are also being experienced in Rafters Road, Drimnagh, Rockfield Avenue, Wainsfort Avenue, Wainsfort Crescent, and the list goes on and on.  I will not bore the House by listing them all.  This is one of the side effects of the traffic chaos in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that there is a need for some initiative to be taken to eliminate this chaos.  It seems that the <Col N="750" /> approach of Dublin Corporation engineers and the Government is to build more and more roads which in turn encourages the use of cars.  There is a chain reaction in that as one builds more roads more cars use them and invariably the volume of traffic exceeds the capacity of the roads.  In many ways this society is addicted to cars getting to and from work and travelling relatively short distances. One of the reasons for this addiction is the inadequacy of the public transport system in the city which is unreliable in that people are left standing at bus stops for long periods waiting for buses.  This is not the fault of the bus companies, as buses cannot run on schedule because of the traffic chaos.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is an alarming lack of hard data on which to base firm decisions in relation to the development of a proper traffic policy.  I understand that the last survey of heavy goods vehicles in the Dublin area, with both origin and destination specified, with particular reference to the port area, was carried out in 1977.  I believe there are no recent data on traffic levels in Dublin outside the city boundary.  The last land use survey data in relation to the city were collected in 1966 and 1974, and land use is a vital aspect and component of traffic management.  Therefore, we have relatively little hard data and relatively little research on which to base decisions. At the same time, as Senator Costello has outlined in considerable detail, we have now, as it were, a <i>de facto</i> plan for a huge motorway to run right across Dublin Bay to some of the areas of greatest amenity not just in this city but in any city in the world, areas that have immense historical and literary connotations, Joyce's connection with Sandymount and so on.  In addition, we have something like £96 million apparently allocated for this from the EC and various other sources.  The estimated cost is of the order of £200 million.  That figure would seem to be based on the most optimistic assumptions.  Another school of thought indicates that the figure could be of the order of £400 million or even <Col N="751" /> greater.  There has been a tendency in the past for many of these construction works to overrun their budget and when they do, to paraphrase Macbeth, &ldquo;When you are steeped in blood so far you should wade no more&rdquo;.  Certainly once you are in you are in until the thing is complete and it does not matter much at what the cost works out.</P>
    <P>There seems to be an attitude at large among the people who really call the shots and make these plans that one should try to cope as best one can. Invariably they have coped very poorly with peak traffic levels.  It would seem far more sensible that the planners endeavour to encourage reduction in the peak level of traffic rather than try to cope with it.  A fundamental flaw in the whole approach to this problem is that the attitude seems to be one of attempting to cope with and cater for maximum levels of traffic flow instead of taking the sensible course and trying to discourage traffic from coming onto the road, especially private commuters most of whom would readily take public transport to work if there was a proper public transport system available.  That is well illustrated in people's attitudes in those areas served by the DART.  If I understand the data properly, something like a third of the people who live in the areas served by the DART take their cars to work whereas the remaining two-thirds who have cars opt to leave them at home and use public transport simply because the DART is an excellent system for the areas it serves.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Costello and I urge the Minister to think again very carefully before this plan is implemented. There will be enormous problems of noise, vibration, and air pollution from the exhaust fumes from cars.  In this connection an interesting figure has been quoted, namely, that the amount of pollutants produced by a car in a year amounts to four times the weight of the car.  That is alarming.  There will be damage to amenities and I have already alluded to the effect on the amenities derived from the historical connections <Col N="752" /> between Sandymount Strand and Joyce and that whole area.  There will also be the effect these developments would have on wildlife.  Some very interesting wild birds have habitats along Dublin Bay.  There are interesting ecological phenomena around Dublin Bay and those eco-systems will be destroyed if this plan goes ahead.  Enormous chaos will arise during the construction of such a motorway.</P>
    <P>A rapid light rail system should be examined carefully to see what possibilities are there.  The answer is in a proper public transportation system.  The people I am involved with and represent in areas like Crumlin and Drimnagh, many of whom cannot afford cars, will not have their problem solved by big motorways and they would benefit greatly from an improved public transport system which at present is badly needed in those parts of south Dublin.</P>
    <P>For that reason I am happy to second the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out that the proposal was agreed on, I think, a three to one margin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" /> The problem with this motion is that it shows clear lack of understanding of the proposal.  First, it is not a multi-lane motorway running through the centre of Dublin.  In Dublin, Westmoreland Street, O'Connell Street and the Quays are the officially designated national primary routes which go through the heart of Dublin.  That is the route at the moment.  This proposal will, it is hoped, when the report comes back, take much of that traffic out of the centre of Dublin. As the title suggests, it is a port access and eastern relief route.  The inclusion of this route is clearly to enhance the economic prosperity of this city with the maximum benefit and the minimum damage to the environment and community life of the city.</P>
    <P>Dublin Port is the largest industrial complex in the country.  Its growth and development are vital to the economic life of the city and there is duty and obligation on the part of central and local Government to pursue the objectives of maintaining a thriving port in Dublin. Even the harshest critics of the proposal admit there is a genuine problem with port traffic in Dublin but they have not come up with practical solutions to the problem.  The idea of shifting the container traffic element of the port to a north county location would still leave mini port to be serviced elsewhere and as bulk ore, bulk feed, coal, steel, timber, car imports etc.; in other words, moving part of the port activity would need a mini port to be serviced elsewhere and would not reduce significantly the existing activity in the port area.</P>
    <P>The second point of this motion refers to the need for Dublin Corporation to conduct a feasibility and environmental impact study.  The need for this study has been accepted and Dublin Corporation have commissioned consultants to carry out the work.  Progress on the proposal is, of course, conditional on this report. The question of adopting the plan before adopting the report is irrelevant and indicates a lack of understanding of Dublin Corporation's role both as a planning authority and a roads authority.  As a planning authority the corporation have <Col N="754" /> a duty to plan in outline form their objectives and designs for the city.  This process is currently under way and the final amendments to the current plan, including this road proposal, are on public display at the moment in the Irish Life Centre on Middle Abbey Street.  The corporation's role as a roads authority is entirely separate and the details of major road proposals will be adopted only after the appropriate feasibility and environmental impact study has been adopted. It is, therefore, entirely incorrect to imply or suggest that detailed road proposals will be adopted or proceeded with prior to the appropriate studies being carried out.</P>
    <P>The final point made in this motion concerning road proposals versus road transport proposals is totally incorrect in its assumptions and generalisations.  It is obvious that Senator Costello has not read the development plan of Dublin Corporation Planning Committee which is at present on view.  The Dublin Corporation plans call for public transport, traffic management and roads improvement as the solution to Dublin's transport problems.  It is not a question of options in that there must be investment in all of these areas of traffic and transport needs. I might add that the city plan so states. It is also a fact that public transport needs in Dublin primarily are road-based and are likely to continue to be so in the foreseeable future.  Our present road-based public transport needs relief to allow it operate more effectively and efficiently and this should be done in conjunction with traffic management; in other words, if we widen a road one part will become a bus lane and the remainder will be for commuters.  That is traffic management and what is taking place in other parts of Europe.  I have with me here a list of 37 cities in Europe, many of them beautiful, like Madrid, Rome, Paris, Berlin, Barcelona, Birmingham, Milan, Vienna, Stockholm and so on, a list of motorways and inner ring roads; many of those cities have both but the only city that does not have either is Dublin.</P>
    <P>The city of Dublin at present faces <Col N="755" /> serious traffic congestion problems, public transport congestion, difficulties of access to the port and general stagnation of city streets.  There is another problem associated with this congestion which is pollution and intolerable living conditions for people in areas such as Sandymount, East Wall, Marino, Fair-view and similar regions.  There is no use in our attempting to evade such problems. There is no benefit to the city of Dublin in procrastinating or in creating unnecessary fear and anxiety.  The port access and Eastern relief route is a genuine attempt to ease Dublin's transport problems.  Its benefits far outweigh its drawbacks and all reasonable people in Dublin will welcome a commitment to implement this proposal.</P>
    <P>I might refer now to some points made by Senator Costello.  Perhaps I am misinterpreting what he said but I have never heard that the reason for building the road was a marina.  The Senator spoke about tunnelling.  Is he seriously telling me that people in London, New York, Paris and other cities with an underground rail system are upset because they live above such a system, because it is exactly the same if there is a road built beneath?  If we were building an underground rail system is the Senator telling me he would be opposed to it because people have to live above it?  It just does not make sense.  The planning committee of Dublin Corporation have discussed this matter <i>ad nauseam.</i>  Since the draft development plan was put on view on the last occasion we have received 15,000 submissions; there were 23 meetings of the planning committee to discuss it, four meetings of the general purposes committee, two meetings of the City Council and some on-site meetings.  If one could not make up one's mind after all those meetings, all I can say is that one needed to be committed.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello maintained that communities were being affected.  I would say to Senator Costello that he must be aware that communities are being affected already by the traffic which is diabolical at present and will not be relieved by a <Col N="756" /> public transport system.  We must remember there is a public transport system obtaining &mdash; the DART goes right along this route and relieves the problem to a certain extent only.  I contend that if the DART ceased to operate tomorrow there would be further chaos.  I agree with Senator Costello there.  However, it has to be said that there is an existing public transport system.  If Senator Costello believes the present proposal is illegal he has a responsibility to do something about it.  The Senator implied that any decision thereon would be taken behind closed doors.  I might add that everybody was given a commitment that, when this road plan is drawn up, it will be put on public view when the public will have the right to examine it and lobby their representatives on whether they want them to vote for or against it.  We have clearly stated that fact on numerous occasions.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton said we have had a plague of traffic for the past 20 years; he is correct in that assertion, but what have the Labour Party done about it?  The answer is they have done absolutely nothing; in Government their commitment to public transport has been nil. It was the Fianna Fáil Party who implemented the DART system while the Labour Party did nothing about it. Indeed, they have done nothing about public transport when in Government. Therefore it will be seen that their commitment to such is not sincere.  They have never done anything about it when in power which is a reflection of their commitment to public transport.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the same way members of the City Council were muzzled on the night this proposal went through the City Hall Chamber.  Senator Eoin Ryan spoke of this debate and the way people vote being so democratic.  I want to alert Senators to the position in City Hall, which is totally dominated by the Fianna Fáil Party with a Fianna Fáil chairman and where the reality is that the proposers and seconders of motions on the roads were not even given an opportunity to speak.  There was a time constraint imposed.  This meant that many of the motions on the draft proposals to the development plan &mdash; those affecting roads being the principal ones &mdash; were simply steamrolled through.  Councillors did not have an opportunity of speaking. What Senator Eoin Ryan says may be true in that there were a great many meetings of the planning committee but it is the City Council who take the final decision.  There are 18 members only on the planning committee and 52 members on the City Council.  They need to be given an opportunity to hear the debate, to hear the points made on both sides before making up their minds, an opportunity which I am sorry to say was denied them.  As Senator Costello said, this road plan came before the City Council in 1980 when I was a member of the council.  It was thrown out, lock, stock and barrel by a democratic decision of the City Council.  Two years later, Dublin Corporation commissioned outside consultants to reconsider that proposal.  In spite of that consultancy it was not incorporated in the 1987 draft plan but, I would contend, was introduced by the back door, not in the planning committee <Col N="758" /> but at the general purposes committee, denying planners input.</P>
      <P>I know, and I am sure Senator Eoin Ryan knows, there are many planners in this city who are very happy about the preponderance of road proposals put forward. Senator Eoin Ryan referred to a balanced approach to roads, public transport and traffic management.  The reality is that roads constitute the option constantly favoured and public transport is the poor relation, the amount of money allocated to public transport in comparison with roads being quite pathetic. For example, in the National Development Plan there were £212 million &mdash; although on another occasion I saw a figure quoted of £300 million &mdash; dedicated to roads and £36 million only to public transport.  How Senator Eoin Ryan can speak about a balanced approach to traffic I simply do not understand.</P>
      <P>I accept that we have a traffic problem in this city &mdash; nobody who travels around this city can deny that &mdash; but we have a problem because the policies we have been implementing have been lamentably wrong.  The sooner Senator Eoin Ryan and his colleagues wake up to that fact and begin to put in place some new policies the sooner we will have some progress in that direction.  The continuous chant of Fianna Fáil councillors is we must have more roads; we have not had a proper road building programme; we have not had road widening.  I do not expect the Minister to know this because she is not a Dubliner and has not occupied her portfolio for a long time but I would like to give her the facts.  I have brought with me the relevant pieces of paper containing the statistics.  I am frequently told I am exaggerating or misleading &mdash; which, of course, is a polite way of saying I am lying &mdash; and, on one occasion, I was told I was misleading the council when I quoted these figures.  The reality is that in the 1971 plan there were 47 major road proposals, major roads coming into this city were widened.  The list is there &mdash; I am not going to read them &mdash; but places like the Navan Road, Finglas Road, Ballymun Road &mdash; 47 major roads into the city were widened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="759" /> In the 1980 plan there were 61 major proposals in the five year category and 115 in the long term category, that is in the ten year or longer category.  In our present draft plan there are 33 roads included in the five year plan and 29 in the long term plan.  How can people maintain that what we need is more, bigger and better roads when that is what we have been doing and the position has been deteriorating all the time?  What we need is a change of policy and thinking. I appeal to the Minister, who is a most enlightened Minister, to look at this aspect and review it so that we will not continue down the same dreary unimaginative route.  I beg the Minister and the officials to look again and realise that it is time for us to wake up to what some of our neighbouring countries are doing.</P>
    <P>With regard to this port access road, Senator Eoin Ryan gives the impression that this road will be built, that the traffic will miraculously be taken from the city centre and will all go onto this road.  That is not the case.  McCarthy and Partners who did a study for the port authority said that less than 8 per cent of the traffic on the route will be port related.  The corporation in their report said that it will only cater for 50 per cent of port traffic, so the scene painted by the previous speaker does not bear any relationship to reality.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the port as is every other councillor, but there are other enlightened measures which could be taken.  What concerns me more than anything else is that this eastern by-pass will not be built in the next five or seven years.  It will probably be ten years before it is built.  What will happen to the port in the meantime?  There should be some imaginative proposal, a commitment on the part of the Government to contain commuters coming into the city.  There should be a genuine attempt to promote schemes such as car pooling or a whole range of policies which could be implemented, but nothing has been done in these areas.</P>
    <P>There may be some small argument in favour of the northern leg of the route but with regard to the southern leg of the <Col N="760" /> route, it will simply be a very attractive new road for the commuters.  Senator Ryan is misleading the people of Dublin 4 and the people of Dublin 2 whom he represents by pretending to them that their lifestyle will be improved.  The reality is that this will be a bonanza for the commuters.  They will be able to come in from the southern side of the city along this route and there will be a large junction near the Glass Bottle Company.</P>

      <P>In relation to the other aspect of the motion I will simply quote from Deirdre Kelly of the Living City Group as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 17 January who in a few sentences summed it up when she said:</P>
      <P>The corporation claims that the Eastern Bypass would be a relief road to take traffic out of the city centre, yet for the past 20 years the engineers have been building roads and widening streets to bring traffic into the city centre.</P>
      <P>With regard to another item she said:</P>
      <P>Just imagine the Corporation's reaction if someone lodged an application to build a house and said they would explain how and where it would be built after they had received planning permission?</P>
      <P>That is precisely the point Senator Costello was making.  What we were asked to do and what we agreed to do is put this eastern by-pass proposal into the draft variations of the plan without knowing the implications, without knowing where it will cross the Liffey and without having an environmental assessment done on it.  How can the public possibly make a mature judgment?</P>

      <P>This matter is presently before Dublin City Council which is democratically elected.  If one went into it in detail it is possibly more democratic than this Chamber but that is an argument for academics on another day. However, they decided to include this proposal in their draft development plan. This plan is now on public display until 7 March.  In effect, the people are now having their say.  They are being requested to make representations and to outline their views in relation to the plan.  An environmental impact study and <Col N="763" /> a route feasibility study will shortly be prepared in relation to this road.  This will be completed in July.  Again, the public, because of the legislation, will be involved in this process.  The proposal will then go back to Dublin City Council and they will again adjudicate on the issue.  When any road is being planned the public have their say in how it should be planned.  There is no question of this road being forced on anybody.  We are now right in the middle of the democratic process.  It is both premature and inappropriate, even irresponsible, for this House of the Oireachtas to become involved particularly when the public are having their say.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan said that perhaps the Labour Senators in this Chamber should have consulted with their colleagues on Dublin City Council.  I would reinforce that.  In particular, they should consult with Councillor Michael O'Halloran.  I do not want to attribute views to him. That is a matter for him at an appropriate time.  The main argument in favour of this road is economic.  The economy of Dublin is in decline.  An essential ingredient in that economy is the role of Dublin Port.  Ireland is a small open economy. The central ingredient in that economy is the role of Dublin Port.  Ireland is a small open economy with a high dependence on foreign trade.  We are an island nation. We depend on shipping and port facilities for our economic survival and the opening of the Channel Tunnel will further increase that dependence.  We will then be the only country in the Community which will have no land link with the EC. At present Dublin Port is being strangled. Commercial traffic cannot get in and out because of traffic congestion.  The port is losing more and more trade each year and a large percentage of jobs in the Dublin area are dependent on the port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Ryan mentioned, Dublin is the only city in Europe where port traffic has to travel through the city centre.  When I was Lord Mayor of Dublin last year I was concerned about the decline of the economy of Dublin and on 19 February, 1990 I called a special <Col N="764" /> meeting of the City Council to discuss this.  At this meeting several groups, including the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, the IDA, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Dublin Council of Trade Unions and the Dublin Port and Docks Board, put forward their views in relation to the economy.  Dublin Tourism also made a submission.  I will quote from the submissions to that special meeting of Dublin City Council.  Dublin Port and Docks Board said:</P>
    <P>The question of Road Access is of supreme importance and Dublin Port welcomes the inclusion of the North and South legs of the Port Access Route in the Dublin Draft Development Plan.</P>
    <P>In their submission the Dublin Chamber said:</P>
    <P>First under infrastructure is the need to create a road system which will provide much needed relief to the central tourism/business core of the city and which will allow the port at last to win back its lost business... The Western Ring will not solve this decongestion problem... This, therefore, must become a first priority for infrastructure development and will, if accompanied by a fully integrated transportation policy, bring a solution to many problems including allowing an efficient, centre-city public transportation system to be developed.</P>
    <P>The IDA presented a paper to that meeting and in their extract on transport they &ldquo;emphasise the requirement for an efficient public and private transport system within the city and county.  Access to seaports, airports and the efficient movement of goods and people through these ports is key to the growth by the economy.&rdquo;  Finally, the Dublin Council of Trade Unions and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions put forward a very good paper to that meeting also.  They stressed the role of public transport and the need to develop it, with which we all agree. They conclude:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> So far as road infrastructure is concerned, the priorities in our view are the completion of the western ring road and the provision of improved access to Dublin Port.  The latter will become all the more urgent if the present proposal to close off the existing access along Custom House Quay is implemented.</P>
    <P>I mention the series of articles in <i>The Irish Times</i> last week in which the Confederation of Irish Industry and in particular their director of transport policy also came out strongly in favour of the port access road and the eastern relief route.  Every group responsible for the management of the economy of Dublin has now come out in favour of this road. Every one of these groups has said that this road is crucial and essential for progress.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have mentioned that the traffic in Dublin at present is chaotic. We all agree with that but we disagree on how to solve the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will continue to outline my views, the views of Dublin Corporation and many other agencies. There is a three pronged attack to solve this chaotic traffic problem in Dublin. Road widening and construction is one element; the improvement of public transportation is the second element and the third is traffic management.  It is the view of Dublin Corporation and the other groups I have mentioned that we need to improve public transportation alongside these other two elements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public transport in Dublin involves roads.  Senator Eoin Ryan mentioned this.  There is room for the rapid rail system but practically and economically in the short or even the medium and long term, roads are going to play a vital part. The argument is that the port access route and the eastern relief route will free the roads for public transport development. Traffic management is essential.  Illegal <Col N="766" /> parking must be stopped.  We need stricter enforcement of parking regulations. Road works co-ordination and the different elements of traffic management need to be looked at very seriously as part of the overall package.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned that certain communities in Dublin will be affected.  The great emotional argument is that running motorways through communities is wrong.  In fact, this roadway will enhance communities.  Senator Ryan will be aware that the residents in Sandymount, Irishtown, Ringsend and small Dublin communities complain their areas are being clogged up with traffic, which should not be there in the first place.  This road will remove the commercial traffic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  I and some of my colleagues were surprised to see a motion on the Order Paper dealing with a specific matter which we felt would be more appropriate for discussion in our respective local authorities.  Some of my local authority colleagues here have outlined various things that happened in relation to Dublin Corporation.  I am not free to comment on them because I do not know about these claims and counterclaims but there are procedures that have to be adhered to.  We will have to account for our stewardship either in a few months time or when the local elections are held.  I could understand the reason for having a debate in the Seanad on a specific item if it related to transport and road policies.</P>

      <P>People have raised points on Adjournment debates about as <Col N="767" /> to how money is provided.  Most of us &mdash; and I am speaking as a member of Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation &mdash; have spent many hours debating various problems relating to the transport policy for Dublin.  Part of the difficulty is that three authorities are affected by this motion and there is not enough dialogue between them.  This could be a matter for local government reform where bordering local authorities from time to time would have a joint forum to discuss matters that are common to their desires and objectives. When local government reform is dealt with we should ensure that one authority is not acting without the knowledge and co-operation of another authority.</P>
      <P>We are aware of the chaotic traffic situation in Dublin.  A 3 per cent increase in traffic is forecast.  Last year there was an increase of the order of 6 per cent in the number of new car plates in the Dublin area.  The reality is that a person who a couple of years ago left home at 8 a.m. to get to the workplace at a certain time now has to leave at 7.40 a.m. approximately.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the chronic problem that will have to be tackled by the local authorities by adhering to the carefully constructed rules and regulations. Following that we want a commitment from the Minister and the Department. I should say to the Minister that there have been complaints of lack of timely response in relation to giving information and responding to local authorities.  I ask him or his officials to respond more quickly when giving decisions and answers in future.  We are all aware of Dublin's chronic problems which will have to be solved.  Extra housing will be needed for people coming into the area. The DART has solved certain problems but even the DART is beginning to get overcrowded particularly between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to respond positively. I do not think the Seanad is the appropriate place initially to discuss specific problems and specific plans which have been dealt with by Dún Laoghaire <Col N="768" /> Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation.  There are set procedures and if people do not like what has been happening there there are means of changing plans and regulations. Local authorities must plan for reform of transport for the next century and must get it right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this motion.  Indeed, I am surprised the issue involved is being raised in this forum and at this time when the movers of the motion must be well aware that the issue raised is under consideration at local authority level.  I am also surprised to find that elements of the motion are not based on fact and for that reason I intend to set the record right and, above all, straight.</P>
      <P>The motion condemns the decision of the Government to include a multi-lane motorway from Whitehall to Booterstown in their transportation plans for Dublin city.  The fact is that there is no such Government decision.  What Members may be referring to is the fact that a section of road from Whitehall to Dublin Port, which would form part of a possible route from Whitehall to Booterstown, has been included in a list of individual projects which are expected to receive EC assistance under the approved operational programme on peripherality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would recommend to the Members who have raised this motion that they read the programme document fully.  If they do so they will find that it points out that the inclusion of an individual project in the list does not necessarily indicate that it has been approved for assistance. Decisions on the projects to be assisted will be made in accordance with specific selection criteria applicable to each of the proposed measures to implement the objectives and strategies of the operational programme.  I will detail the background and present position in relation to this scheme in a moment but I can tell the House that, as this road scheme is not as yet part of the statutory development <Col N="769" /> plan for Dublin city, it is entirely premature to be talking about it as if there was an absolute commitment to its implementation.</P>
    <P>Let me now deal with the background and current position as to the status of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In December 1987 my Department requested Dublin Corporation to undertake a traffic study of Dublin Port and the Custom House Docks area.  This study, which was finalised in October 1989, includes recommendations relating to road construction projects, public transport and parking.  The main recommendation, in so far as road construction is concerned, was the construction of a port access, to motorway standard, from the airport road to North Port together with a study of the location of an extra river crossing, and the extension of the road along Sandymount Strand to form a full eastern by-pass of the city.</P>
    <P>In January 1990, the Dublin City Council agreed to include the recommendations contained in the traffic study as amendments to the Dublin City Draft Development Plan, 1987, which went on public display on 7 January 1991.</P>
    <P>The draft of the plan will be kept on public exhibition for three months until 8 March 1991.  Objections or representations may be made to the planning authority with respect to the draft and these must be taken into consideration by the authority before the plan is made so there is some time yet to go before we can speak even of the corporation being fully committed to this scheme.</P>
    <P>The motion condemns the failure of the local authority to conduct a feasibility study or environmental impact study of the proposal prior to adoption.  As I have just explained, there is no plan formally adopted as yet but I can tell the House that the corporation have made significant progress towards commissioning a feasibility study and an environmental impact study relating to the line of the entire route.  Both the feasibility and environmental impact studies will be integrated and carried out simultaneously.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="770" /> The corporation intend to engage consultants to carry out the study and terms of reference for it were approved by my Department on 31 July 1990.  At the closing date for receipt of tenders &mdash; 3 October 1990&mdash;over 30 tenders had been received.  These were shortlisted and evaluated by the corporation who have now made a recommendation to my Department for the appointment of consultants. The study itself will take about six months to complete and will be fully funded from State road grants.  I see no reason, therefore, to condemn Dublin Corporation in their handling of this matter to date.</P>
    <P>I would like to address the issue of the estimated £200 million cost which has been spoken about and its diversion to other uses.</P>
    <P>There is at present simply no £200 million available for the port access route which could, even if it were desired, be diverted to public transport.  The only commitment envisaged at this stage is to the northern section of the port access route and that is subject to the outcome of the environmental impact study and technical feasibility study as well as to the usual statutory procedures relating to motorway construction.  The operational programme on peripherality envisages work commencing on the northern port access in 1993 with the bulk of the estimated £96 million cost falling outside the programme period.  So even if we were to abandon the project the only funds to become available for reallocation at this stage would be any grants allocated in 1991 &mdash; and these have not been allocated as yet.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of ill-informed comment about the supposed imbalance between road and public transport investment and figures have been quoted from the national development plan to support this contention.  The facts are that the various commentators are not comparing like with like.  The proposed expenditure on rail will largely be devoted to improving passenger transport services in the Dublin area, while the vast bulk of the roads expenditure is being devoted to the development of the strategic national <Col N="771" /> networks and not to roads to facilitate urban commuter traffic.  A lot of the money earmarked for roads under the Operational Programme on Peripherality is going to the construction of the Dublin ring road, which is the single most important road project in the programme.  This fulfils a vital strategic need, linking seven national routes radiating from Dublin and allowing long distance and commercial through traffic avoid the city and residential areas.  The new road construction will also facilitate bus-based public transport.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to transportation in Dublin.  The Minister has been concerned for some time at the need for a coherent transport strategy for Dublin, and for this reason phase 1 of the Dublin Transportation Study was announced last year. Phase 1 will look at where we stand now &mdash; what has happened since we had our last major study in 1971, what has been the impact of the major demographic changes, the growth of the new towns, the introduction of DART, the construction of new roads, improved traffic management and so on.  A sub-group with Phase 1 of the DTS will look at bus-rail options along the old Harcourt Street line and to Tallaght.  Phase 2 will develop a strategy for transportation in Dublin which will carry us well into the 21st century.  Consultants to carry out phase 1 have been selected and their appointment will be announced shortly.  The task facing the consultants and the study team is a major one.  They will have to look at a range of difficult issues and I want to take this opportunity to mention a few.</P>
    <P>They will have to look at the reciprocal influences of land use and transportation policies.  Land use decisions clearly have transport implications and we only have to look at DART and the Dublin ring road to see that transport decisions influence land use.  While much land use is already determined &mdash; nobody would suggest knocking down a residential housing estate and replacing it with an industrial estate &mdash; there are a number of issues we can look at and a number of land use and transportation options we <Col N="772" /> can test.  Access to the city centre has important land use implications.  Rapid transit links would clearly influence residential housing densities and location preferences.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transportation Review Group &mdash; the steering committee for the study &mdash; have established a special working group to consider land use issues and to arrange a special workshop to debate the topic before the terms of reference for phase 2 of the study are prepared.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programme on Peripherality makes it clear that continuing major road construction is not the solution to traffic problems in major urban areas.  Apart from committed investment, especially on the strategic national routes, the Minister does not envisage further significant new road development in Dublin within the canal ring.  Instead we will have to look more to strategies which optimise the use of existing road space.  We will all have to face difficult choices.  Are we prepared to constrain car use to a greater extent so as to facilitate public transport?  How do we ration road space and ensure that it is used for movement rather than parking?  How do we ensure that future transport systems are fully consistent with our environmental commitments, including the need to minimise air pollution and greenhouse emissions?</P>
    <P>We will have to look especially to the needs of those who do not own cars.  How will we improve transport access to the new towns and mobility within them, especially in low income areas which depend on public transport?  We must not forget that bicycles and feet are very energy efficient and environmentally friendly forms of transport.  How can we make greater provision for them in a total transport strategy, taking account also of safety factors?</P>
    <P>The Minister is committed to ensuring that there will be a full assessment of the environmental impact of future transportation strategies and of major projects as well.  He is also most anxious that there should be adequate public participation <Col N="773" /> in the process of transportation planning for the future.</P>
    <P>The wider the degree of consensus on a future strategy, the more politically acceptable and implementable it will probably be.  I am glad to say that the request for submissions on phase 1 of the study has had an excellent response.  Over 120 submissions have been received, about 70 of them from individuals.  These submissions will be fully assessed by the steering committee and consultants and arrangements for follow-up on them are being considered.</P>
    <P>Phase 2 of the study, which looks to the future, will also have a substantial provision for public participation and I have no doubt will generate great interest.  The phase 1 consultants will advise just how this should be done.</P>
    <P>Even though I am from the Midlands I know the Dublin area extremely well and I am glad to see the improvements being made to the road network here.  I believe many people from the country welcome these improvements especially on the roads out to the airport, etc.  This is part of the Government's programme. I want to point out that the Government have been improving the road network over the years.  There may be difficulties and perhaps different views on how this work should be done but I think it can be said that the road improvements in the Dublin area will be of great assistance to all our people, especially commuters.</P>
    <P>This motion has been put down prematurely. Far be it from me to say anything in regard to the members of the Labour Party but I think they got it wrong this time.  Dublin Corporation and the consultants have to look into this matter first. It has been said to the Government and Ministers that they are taking away powers from the corporation.  We are not; we are backing the corporation who will have to decide what they want and how they are going to do it.  We must improve the system, which is what the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party are going to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a rousing finale by the Minister.  I am glad he has clarified <Col N="774" /> certain points and given some commitments in this area.  The contributions of other Senators were interesting, constructive at times and worth hearing.</P>
      <P>A number of points were raised by Fianna Fáil Senators.  Obviously I cannot refer to all of them but the major point which came through all the time was that it was not appropriate for us to raise this issue in the Seanad.  I categorically reject that point.  It is entirely appropriate that the whole question of what is being done or what it is proposed to do with Structural Funds and taxpayers money in the Dublin area should be raised in this House.  It is appropriate that all of us should be concerned at what is going to happen to the capital city of this country. Therefore, I make no apology for raising this matter in this House, not only in the context of the local authority but also in the context of the Government.</P>
      <P>Both the Government and the Department have responsibilities in this area.  I want to quote from the National Development Plan in order to show how the Government balance their responsibilities between transport, roads and the rest of the infrastructure.</P>
      <P>There are four provisions: improvement of the national roads in the Dublin area and of the non-national roads which contribute to economic development; provision of a peripheral ring road to link main national routes to facilitate long distance traffic; provision of a port access route which will keep heavy traffic from the centre city and improvements in the existing network of public transport services, including the provision of diesel rail commuter services.  Three of those four provisions relate to motorways which are road routes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the money that will come from the EC and taxpayers, there will be £190 million plus £22 million for roads, national and non-national, in the Dublin area; access transport &mdash; relating to the port area &mdash; £182.75 million and rail and bus, £36 million.  That is what I call a balanced distribution of funding from the EC and our taxpayers.  It is totally out of order to say that it is not proper or <Col N="775" /> appropriate for us to discuss this matter in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>If the proposals regarding the Structural Fund, and the seven regional areas in respect of which proposals were submitted initially, had been allowed to go through according to the European Commission's instructions, community groups would have made their submissions on how the money would be spent much sooner and we might not be at the stage we are at now.  The Government disbanded the regional groups at the time they were making their proposals and that is the major reason for the present position.  Members have been saying across the floor of the House that the community groups will have an opportunity to become involved but this might not have arisen if those groups had been consulted in advance in the context of the expenditure of the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>I should have said at the beginning that I want to give two minutes of my time to Senator Harte and two minutes to Senator Norris.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>My second point relates to the procedures that have been developed by the local authority.  The city council have endorsed a plan, and it does not just deal with an access road that the Minister and Senators referred to again and again.  Structural Funds have been made available for that purpose.  The local authority have now gone a step further and have made proposals not just for the north side of the Liffey, where there was to be an access road to the port, but also for the south side.  They have done this out of the blue.  It was not in the original draft plan presented to the council but was included in the variation afterwards.  They did not have the courage to include it in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having got the draft plan through in January there is now a proposal for an environmental impact study and feasibility study.  In the meantime the plan will be put on display for the public who <Col N="776" /> must reply before 8 March.  Subsequently, the results of the studies about which we have heard so much will be published but we are expected to put forward our submissions and objections in advance.  That is crazy.  It is putting the cart before the horse.  As I have said, it is contrary to the spirit and the letter of the European Community Environmental Impact Assessment Motorways Regulations, 1988.  It is improper for that procedure to be adopted.  I would have liked the Minister, or some of the Senators who sit on the city council, to address that point, but they did not.</P>
    <P>We are all concerned about the port, and I am particularly concerned about it because I live in the area.  I am concerned about employment in the port, access to it, the heavy traffic that passes through it and the inner city community that surrounds it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Senator now give way to another Senator?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It has been admitted by the port authorities that 50 per cent of the goods landed at the port go to the inner city while another 30 per cent go to the outer environs of Dublin.  That means that 80 per cent of the imports end up in Dublin and 20 per cent go outside. Therefore, we are still not solving the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, Senator, I will have to ask you to conclude if you want to share your time with the other Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We need an independent examination of the plan rather than revamping the old plan that was rejected almost 20 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say a lot in two minutes but the main point I would like to make is that the Labour Party have a transport policy, despite what other speakers have said.  It is necessary to point out that when there is an agreed programme, as has been devised by the Coalition, it can only include certain <Col N="777" /> objectives.  We were not able to persuade any of the parties with whom we were in power, including the minority Fianna Fáil Government we supported in 1932, to accept all our views.  That is why we have not been able to do anything about many of the objectives we have in mind.</P>
      <P>The second point I would like to make is that a bright young man like Senator Eoin Ryan should know well that a party with an ideology must have policies.  They cannot afford the luxury of being pragmatic in the same way as are the major parties.  That is something that should be borne in mind.  As far as we can see, consideration is being given to many road improvements.  With access to the western by-pass &mdash; this could be developed to lead onto the Dublin-Belfast road and the Dublin-Rosslare road &mdash; the whole question of a feasibility study may not be necessary.  One of the dangers of building motorways close to the inner city is that at the intersections hypermarkets and so on will be built, and the inner city will be affected.  Therefore, social planning has to be taken into account.  We cannot plan a road without also planning socially.  I am sorry I have not the time to develop this argument.  Perhaps we should have worded this motion better, but our main concern is the spending of money on consultants' fees.  I do not want to be cynical about consultants.  I have had experience of them down the years.  They recommend one thing and then tell you how to get rid of it five years later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not think £300,000 should be spent on a feasibility study because there are many other considerations to be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator Costello for giving me this small amount of time.  With other representatives from this House I attended a series of meetings organised by Senator Costello, principally in the north Dublin area, at which the views of the residents were made <Col N="778" /> perfectly plain.  They were unambiguously opposed to this development. At the heart of this matter is a feeling about democracy.  It has been well said that what we have here is a classic three card trick.  The people of Dublin are offered three options: a motorway, a motorway or a motorway.  This was voted down ten years ago by Dublin City Council and reinserted under a new name, that is all.  We get the figleaf of a different description.</P>
      <P>It is not even clear to me what the impact of this by-pass would be.  It was suggested that it would take the heavy traffic away from the port but the Dublin Port and Docks Board, through their consultants, discovered that only 7.4 per cent of the traffic generated by this new road would be traffic from the port and the rest would be largely commuter traffic. What we are doing is once again making the mistake that all the European cities have made, developing a road infrastructure that will have the effect of complicating road traffic in the city, and that is regrettable.  If we want to see what the impact will be we should have a look at the corner of Summerhill and Gardiner Street.  Despite an improvement scheme for the area financed by European Structural Funds it is still an absolute eyesore and a disaster.  There is not one reasonably decent building in sight, which is a pity.  Sandymount Strand, with its echoes of James Joyce in literary terms, will be destroyed.  The Williamstown salt marsh, an internationally known and valued bird reservation will also be destroyed.  By and large, the impact of this will be major and negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an interesting comment on the democratic process that the road plans will be exhibited until 8 March but that the environmental impact study will not be completed until July.  That seems to be an extraordinary order in which to place them.  It is perfectly clear that this is being rammed through by the road engineers.  It is highly significant that although it is a considerable amendment to the development plan it did not go through the planning committee but <Col N="779" /> through the general committee and was steered through by the road engineers.</P>
    <P>Question put and declared lost.</P>

    <Title>Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, section 9 of Part I of the Bill gives a very strong warning indeed to polluters who harm the environment.  That warning is that you face massive fines and-or years in jail if you violate in a major way the provisions in this Bill.  Thus, a person found guilty of an offence under the Act shall be liable on conviction on indictment to a maximum fine of £10 million and-or ten years imprisonment and, on summary conviction, to a maximum fine of £1,000 and-or six months imprisonment. Daily penalties for ongoing offences will involve a maximum fine of £100,000 per day on conviction on indictment and a maximum fine of £200 per day on summary conviction.</P>
      <P>Part II of the Bill deals with the establishment of an environmental protection agency, its organisational structures, staffing and financial arrangements.  In so far as it is possible to do so, this Bill seeks to secure the ability of the agency to make independent decisions on such matters as licensing, monitoring, research, etc.  This is achieved by the manner in which the director general and the board of directors are appointed and by the ability and responsibility of the agency to publish information and to provide public access to categories of information.</P>
      <P>Part III of the Bill sets out the functions of the proposed agency and these range from direct action functions, which include licensing and control, to advisory support, overseeing and indeed promotional functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill introduces the concept of an integrated pollution control licensing system.  This, of course, will be <Col N="780" /> operated by the agency for those activities which are specified in the First Schedule of the Bill.  The introduction of integrated pollution control, IPC, is welcome but, of course, it is very long overdue. It was recommended by the British Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution as far back as 1976 and it is contained in the British Environmental Protection Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill enables the Minister to extend to the agency powers under existing air and water pollution legislation and to make air and water management plans on behalf of local authorities.  The various problems facing local authorities have been outlined by the Leader of the House and I do not intend to go into them at this stage except to say that he raised many matters which need to be considered and perhaps to be amended.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill deals with certain specific environmental problems, including the very real problem of noise and, of course, the question of genetically modified organisms, GMOs.  Section 105 of the Bill provides that any person affected by a nuisance caused by noise will be able to complain and to apply to the District Court for redress.  I welcome this provision.</P>
    <P>Section 104 of the Bill gives new powers to local authorities to require that measures be taken to prevent and to limit noise.  Section 103 of the Bill enables the Minister to introduce, by regulation, further controls for the prevention or limitation of noise.  All these provisions must be welcomed by those of us who serve on local authorities.</P>
    <P>Under section 108 of the Bill, power is given to control the use of genetically modified organisms and section 107 provides for greater access to environmental information held by public authorities, including the implementation of the EC directive on this issue.  However, as was pointed out by Viscount Mills during the debate on similar legislation in the House of Lords in Britain, developments and techniques in the scale of bioengineering operations are likely to continue to increase rapidly.  As public <Col N="781" /> awareness of the issues involved increases, so too will public debate on possible ethical, moral and legal problems of genetically modified organisms. Thus, the provisions in this Bill may be only a first step.  Further legislation could well be required in future to address some of the wider issues associated with genetic engineering.</P>
    <P>I share the concern expressed recently by Frank Convery of the Environmental Institute at University College, Dublin, in a paper presented to the first Irish environmental researchers' colloquim which was held at Sligo Regional Technical College on 11 January 1991.  I congratulate all associated with that colloquim.  The extent and the comprehensiveness of the papers presented deserves the commendation of this House.  He stated: &ldquo;The lack of an appeal mechanism and the absolute discretion on the part of the agency to hold an oral hearing on a licence does limit the scope of public involvement in the decision making process and for development interests to get a review of a negative decision&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On a similar vein, An Taisce, in a press release dated 1 December 1990, stated:</P>
    <P>An Taisce is concerned about the looseness of the discretionary power which the proposed agency has in relation to the holding of an oral hearing prior to the granting or refusal of a licence.  Since the licensing function of the agency will not be open to appeal, the basis of the agency's decisions on the holding of oral hearings must be unambiguous and transparent.  The present wording of the Bill gives no indication of how and when the discretionary power might be used and leaves the agency exposed in controversial situations.</P>
    <P>It may, therefore, be necessary on Committee Stage to look again at the necessity and the desirability of having a more definite appeals mechanism and greater assurances regarding the holding of oral hearings.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it is clear that the policymakers face daunting challenges in <Col N="782" /> this area.  As has been stressed by the Leader of the House and others, there is a need to strike that often elusive balance between building and sustaining an industrial society while at the same time preserving an environment rendered all the more fragile by that very industrial process. There is a place for sensible regulations which are tight enough to guarantee conservation and flexible enough to permit growth.  Good environmental management is now an imperative and, as has been well proved, is a good investment.  I would like to welcome this important Bill and compliment all those associated with its preparation and presentation and welcome in particular the fact that it has been introduced in the Seanad in the first instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State for introducing this legislation in the Seanad in the first instance.  I trust it will be the first of many such Bills to be introduced in this House.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House tonight is perhaps one of the most significant and necessary pieces of legislation to appear in a very long time.  The establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency is long overdue.  In contemporary Ireland the preservation of the environment and the country's natural assets are assuming ever increasing importance.  There is a well defined public awareness of the need to take a more caring and respectful approach to the natural and built environment. We have identified the need to be much more sensitive towards the environment when it comes to commercial, industrial and agricultural activities. The establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency will play a meaningful role in acting as an independent objective invigilator in seeking to achieve managed and sustainable protection and conservation of our physical environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agency will be charged with the responsibility for overseeing, controlling and regulating various activities which may be regarded as prejudicial to the quality of the environment.  The agency will also provide the supporting advisory <Col N="783" /> function for the benefit of public authorities. I absolutely endorse the fundamental philosophy in hand in this legislation as it is now imperative, through the effective operation of the Environmental Protection Agency, that a rational balance and an informed approach be taken to matters relating to the environment and its overall protection.</P>
    <P>The operative word as far as I am concerned in this increasingly topical debate is &ldquo;balance&rdquo;.  I have already referred to increased public consciousness in the area of environmental protection.  Man is the greatest destroyer of the environment, he poses the single most menacing threat to the ecology.  However, I believe in many instances most of the public's concern and anxieties, which have been voiced so stridently, are ill-informed and emotionally charged.  Much hysteria has been introduced in an effort to scare-monger. Objections have been voiced, but the scientific data to substantiate many fears and concerns have in some cases not been produced, or are of dubious validity.  Of course, we have a responsibility to act as conscientious custodians of the environment, but we must also be pragmatic in our approach to development.</P>
    <P>The single greatest duty which the Environmental Protection Agency could discharge is that of reconciling the interests of the environment and industry. These interests need not necessarily be competing or mutually incompatible. Mature and sensible assessment is crucial and will play a dominant role in resolving an alarmingly high number of disputes. The scenario should not be industrialist versus the environmentalist.  I believe it is totally wrong that we can credibly argue that all environmental concerns must take precedence or must be paramount in a developmental context.  It is very foolish to assume that we can all aspire to the idyllic existence of organic farming, important as that is.  This is not the real world but, unfortunately, many would have us reach for such a lifestyle. We live in an age, unfortunately, where <Col N="784" /> man's propensity is to be environmentally unfriendly, where we can be reckless with regard to the environmental consequences of our operations.  Thankfully, we are now somewhat more enlightened, but a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing.</P>
    <P>I am fearful of accelerating public disquiet being generated.  To my mind, there is an urgent need for public dialogue, for informed public debate where issues affecting the environment are addressed in a comprehensive manner based on sound scientific data.  We have to have regard to man's well being, but we must also be mindful of economic realities. There is a possibility that extreme reactions can have devastating implications for man's livelihood.  Industrial development and job creation in this country must also be a priority.  However, there is evidence to suggest that much industrial activity could be stifled or prevented in the absence of rational and balanced public policy parameters.  Extreme sensitivity towards industrial development, the raising of spurious opposition for whatever reason could have detrimental consequences for employment potential in the long term.  It is only through a process of balanced dialogue and educated debate that we can set about creating a situation where industrial prosperity and environmental integrity can co-exist harmoniously.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency is momentous in that we will now have an independent assessor, comprising a bank of expertise which will have due regard to all processes which will impinge on the environment. The Environmental Protection Agency will be in a position to offer objective appraisal and to reconcile seemingly conflicting objections.  It is absolutely vital that appropriate regulatory controls be put in place, that monitoring be conducted on a consistent basis and that the twin national desires of our environmental conservation and economic prosperity be encouraged in tandem with the proper over-view procedures.</P>
    <P>Having fully endorsed the thrust of the Bill in its broader control, I would now <Col N="785" /> like to give closer scrutiny to some provisions of the proposed legislation.  The concept of environmental protection encompasses control of a broad spectrum of activities which impact on the environment, for example, offshore oil, farming and agri-business, forestry, land drainage, local authority operations, mariculture, aquaculture, industrial activities, mining, peat extraction, energy, farming, etc.</P>
    <P>At present this range of activities is controlled through a combination of planning permission procedures, discharge licences, waste disposal permits, etc.  In specific cases the planning licensing procedure involves and includes the formal environmental impact assessment process.  Currently, the onus rests on the relevant local authority to administer all these procedures subject to the right to appeal planning or licensing decisions to An Bord Pleanála.  In the case of some activities, for example offshore oil or mariculture, they are subject to control by the appropriate Government Departments. The Bill proposes to divide the environmental protection functions between local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency. Additionally, the functions of some Government Departments may become subject to approval of the Environmental Protection Agency provided the agreement of the relevant Minister is forthcoming. The Environmental Protection Agency will effectively be excluded from the EIA procedure.  The role of the Environmental Protection Agency will be confined to submissions of observations to planning authorities in similar fashion to that currently obtaining for bodies such as An Taisce.</P>
    <P>First Schedule activities comprise of major industrial projects. and the Environmental Protection Agency will operate an integrated pollution control licence for such activities.  The integrated licence may contain conditions relating to air, water, noise, waste and other unspecified aspects.  However, it appears that a clear separation of Environmental Protection Agency and local authority functions is not achieved: for example, <Col N="786" /> the integrated licence could include conditions which conflict with conditions attached to a planning permission.  Equally, the integrated licence is excluded from controlling First Schedule or any other waste waters connected to a local authority sewer.  Consequently, the Environmental Protection Agency will not be empowered to control domestic or industrial waste waters in sewered areas.</P>
    <P>In relation to all other activities, the <i>status quo</i> prevails; local authorities and Government Departments will be responsible for controls.  Thus, the control powers invested in the Environmental Protection Agency would appear to be very restricted in terms of the range of activities which affect the environment. I stress that this could be a major shortcoming; moreover the proposed role of the Environmental Protection Agency introduces an additional layer of complexity to this situation which currently exists and could potentially have the capacity in certain circumstances to dilute rather than consolidate current environmental controls.  For example, the First Schedule activity applies for an integrated pollution control licence from the Environmental Protection Agency. The same activity applies for planning permission from the local authority.  An EIS is required and submitted to the local authority.  The local authority assess the EIS and issue their planning decision. However most of the contents of the EIS will relate to omissions which will be under the control of the Environmental Protection Agency and not the local authority. The Environmental Protection Agency, which will be preparing their integrated pollution control licence, will not be involved in the EIA process.  The result will be that the EIA will be carried out by the wrong authority.  It is almost useless to the local authority who must do the assessment.  Conversely, the Environmental Protection Agency who need to be involved to prepare their licence are excluded from the assessment. I gather from the Minister of State's speech that she has identified this as one of the problems and hopes it can be sorted out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="787" /> A formal appeals structure, through An Bord Pleanála, is currently in place for decisions pertaining to applications for planning permissions and licences. The proposed Environmental Protection Agency integrated pollution control licence has no provision for a formal appeals process and the developer or third party is entitled to lodge an objection with the Environmental Protection Agency.  However, the Environmental Protection Agency, or an agent nominated by the Environmental Protection Agency, will process the objection.  This self-assessment may not be in the interest of the developer, third parties or, indeed, overall environmental protection.</P>
    <P>In an attempt to demystify the process and to lend public confidence to the Environmental Protection Agency in terms of the exercise of their functions in this regard, I welcome the Minister's placing an obligation on the Environmental Protection Agency to give public access to any records or files connected with any decision issued on the self-assessment basis.  In my view affected parties are entitled to know the grounds on which a decision is made.  By lending greater transparency to the process greater public confidence can be achieved and sustained.  The appeals system regarding planning permission is still vested in An Bord Pleanála and it appears that the board will be confined to dealing with matters relating purely to planning. The effect will be to exclude the board from handling appeals relating to emissions to the environment.  In the absence of our right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála on environmental issues the only judicial resort for any objector is the High Court.  This could inevitably place a substantial financial burden on the applicant.  Equally, I believe the High Court is not the appropriate forum for resolving such disputes given that it would lack a certain amount of scientific expertise in this area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the comprehensive monitoring powers vested in the Environmental Protection Agency under this proposed legislation. This capacity will be of <Col N="788" /> extremely significant benefit.  I also welcome the long overdue increased penalties for offences committed under this legislation.  This reinforces the deterrent and preventive nature of our environmental legislation.  The monitoring powers include right of access to emission sources and emission records.  This is indeed a welcome development.  Such powers to enter the plant should greatly enhance public confidence in the State's ability to identify and successfully prosecute transgressors.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency will be empowered to monitor the activities of local authorities in so far as their activities impact on the environment.  This includes a requirement on local authorities to execute monitoring of their own activities under the direction of the EPA.  This is a welcome departure and I need hardly point to the advantages inherent in that provision. In the past some local authorities have been the worst culprits in the flagrant disregard for the environment.  It is absolutely vital that the powers of the EPA in this regard be rigorously enforced.  This discipline to be imposed on local authorities is progressive and timely.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency will have various miscellaneous functions including the production of state of the environment reports, promoting environmental research and environmental audits, and providing data bases, general environmental advice and advisory functions to Ministers.  While these are obviously necessary and important functions they are only of value if they can be used by the EPA to effect real environmental protection.</P>
    <P>Effective environmental protection is the ultimate goal of this legislation. However, I ask the Minister to consider a number of amendments which would greatly augment the operations and scope with the Environmental Protection Agency in accomplishing their expressed aims.  The existing arrangement whereby applications for planning permission licences and permits are currently directed to relevant planning authorities or <Col N="789" /> Government Departments could continue to operate.  However, these applications could then be referred by the local authority or Government Department for the attention of the Environmental Protection Agency.  It should also be necessary for local authorities and Government Departments to submit their proposals for developments which would potentially affect the environment. It would then be possible for the Environmental Protection Agency to assess such applications, including the conduct of the EIA procedure where appropriate.  The Environmental Protection Agency could prepare all relevant environmental licences, permits and conditions. Equally a system of licensing and permitting of farming activities should be introduced and could be under the control of the Environmental Protection Agency who would issue them to the local authority or relevant Government Department.  These Environmental Protection Agency conditions, licences and so on need not be subject to change by the local authority or Government Department, who could simply attach their appropriate conditions not relating to environmental emissions or other environmental aspects within the remit of the Environmental Protection Agency.  It would be possible for the normal independent appeals procedure to operate on the issue of notice of intent to grant planning permission by the local authority or Government Department.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer in some detail to section 10 which enables the Minister to regulate any process or action involving a genetically modified organism for the purpose of preventing or minimising any damage to the environment or any danger to health arising from the planned or accidental release of such organisms. Provision is made for the making of regulations for the purpose of the section and for the control function to be assigned to the Minister or any such person or body as may be prescribed.  This section requires the person in charge of any process or action involving a genetically modified organism to use the best available technology not entailing excessive <Col N="790" /> costs for the purpose of environmental protection.  While I recognise that reasonably stringent systems of over sight governing genetically modified organisms must be put in place, I urge the Minister to exercise caution with regard to the nature of persons or bodies whom she may prescribe to implement this provision. This aspect of bio-technology is incredibly complex and sophisticated. Consequently it is of paramount importance that persons or bodies have the appropriate expertise and scientific resources to properly assess the environmental implications of any such bio-processes and to make correct decisions in enforcing these provisions.</P>
    <P>Bio-technology, and the incredible advances in its various applications, represent one of the most revolutionary techniques in the production of goods and services.  Some discussion of bio-technology and the material benefits which accrue to mankind is germane particularly in the context of environmental protection.  It is essential that due regard be taken of this dynamic process in establishing regularity controls under section 108.  It is important, if the growing bio-industry is to be encouraged and fostered and if we are to harness the accruing benefits, that regulations not be unnecessarily cumbersome or stultifying. Moreover, it is vital that any decision made in the exercise of the functions granted in section 108 be based on sound scientific data while all the time being mindful of safety, prudence and progress. Bio-technology products and services have been successfully applied in three primary sections, health care, agriculture and food, and environmental management. Benefits have undoubtedly occurred and will continue to occur as developments continue.</P>
    <P>Let me outline some of the well documented areas in which significant and practical progress has been achieved.  In the area of health care, the production of interferons used to treat cancer and leukaemia, the production of tissue, plasminogen, activator used in treatment following heart attack, human insulin which is used to treat diabetics and blood factor <Col N="791" /> to treat haemophilia.  Factor 8 is noteworthy in this regard.  All of these products of which many of us have been beneficiaries are based on recombinant DNA, technology which replaces traditional technologies based on extraction from animal organs.  The appalling tragedy of HIV infection among haemophiliacs treated with Factor 8 arising from blood transfusions is well documented. It should be emphasised that Factor 8 produced by bio-technology methods has no attaching AIDS risk.  The enormous benefit to humanity as a result of the production of this blood factor are manifest and indisputable.</P>
    <P>The second area where achievements are occurring is that of agriculture and food.  Significant international research is now concentrated towards improving the environmental value of food crops.  Work is currently being undertaken in developing crops with the greater ability to tolerate drought and high soil content. Predictions are that crops will be developed which will withstand higher temperatures.</P>
    <P>Currently many crops produced suffer from viral, fungal and other infestations. Bio-technology has the potential to develop crops which process inbuilt resistance to insects, fungi and viruses. In the area of animal reproduction bio-technology techniques have been successfully employed to improve animal breeding programmes.  The area of particular relevance to today's debate is that of environmental management.  Biotechnologies offer enormous potential in actively preventing widespread destruction of our country by waste products. We are all painfully aware of the pernicious effect of synthetic fabrics such as non bio-degradable plastics.  Bio-technology has a highly positive contribution to offer in terms of development of bio-degradable products.  Equally, biological processing of toxic chemicals should greatly improve hazardous waste management.</P>
    <P>Changes in agricultural techniques potentially will reduce agricultural waste. Bio-technology systems are already <Col N="792" /> applied in the purification and treatment of water.  Scientific indications are that the use of biological processes in industry will reduce overall air pollution by as much as 15 per cent.  Agriculture uses a significant portion of two of the earth's most natural resources, land and water not to mention carbon dioxide.  The single greatest cause of loss of top soil is excess tillage.  New means of weed control reduces the need to till, so this loss can be cut significantly.  Environmental quality depends to a large extent on our ability to develop and foster agricultural systems which produce efficiently while sustaining our natual resource base.</P>
    <P>Bio-technology represents one of the few opportunities available to improve agricultural systems while simultaneously protecting the environment.  Instead of relying only on chemical pesticides, herbicides and fertilisers there is now the ability to introduce these properties directly into plants through recombinant DNA technology, or by micro injection. The development of new varieties of crop's resistant to disease and pests can be achieved by way of a reduction of noxious chemicals.  The impact of such developments is profound.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill is a significant move in comprehensively addressing environmental considerations in a modern context.  We must be prepared to take on board any innovative or creative methods by which the overall integrity and character of our environment can be maintained while seeking to encourage and promote industrial development and sustainable employment. In the overall decisions on environmental protection in which the new agency will serve as a powerful instrument we must have regard to the advantages new and evolving techniques can give to proper management of the environment. It is interesting that this Bill should contain provisions to govern the process of genetically modifying organisms. If prudently and practically regulated this process should be recognised as offering outstanding potential to those actively concerned about environmental protection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="793" /> I reiterate my endorsement of this Bill and the positive initiative it represents. Like any other Bill of this nature we will have to await its implementation before determining the efficiency of the new agency.  Given the necessary expertise and resources I am confident that the new agency will be the primary force in striking the balance so necessary in achieving proper environmental management. In order to achieve this balance the agency, in its composition, must be representative of the views of industry as well as those of the environment.  The need for the agency to view issues coming before them within a proper, balanced perspective is vital.  I would recommend that the Minister allow some time for the agency to become fully operational at which point we will be in a position to assess their efficiency.  When all of the necessary mechanisms and procedures are in place and functioning it will be necessary for us to review the provisions of this Bill to ensure that the agency is functioning satisfactorily and its primary objectives being achieved.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the work she has done in having this Bill introduced. I know that personally she has put a lot of hard work into it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I have great pleasure in welcoming the Minister to this House and complimenting her on having introduced this highly complex, lengthy Bill.  I am pleased it has been introduced in the Seanad and that we are being given an opportunity to give it the consideration it deserves.  It must be heartening for the Minister to hear the compliments from all sides of the House.  There are no Members who do not believe that its introduction was the result of the Minister's input, tenacity and determination. I should like also to compliment the Progressive Democrats on their input, in having made it a plank of their participation in Government that there would be a commitment on their part to an environmental protection agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that I would add that the Bill is somewhat overdue.  When the <Col N="794" /> Government opposed the Fine Gael Bill brought forward by Deputy Shatter, the Government promised that the agency would be in place before the end of 1990. I notice that the same promise was contained in the environment action programme &mdash; that as a matter of urgency the agency would be established with a view to having it in operation in 1990.  I regret the delay because we cannot afford to be complacent.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister was assisted in her endeavours by the fact that at the time of the last election the electorate made it clear they were concerned about the environment and about pollution.  We saw the election of the first Green Party Deputy to the Dáil, Deputy Roger Garland. Indeed many of the other Green candidates did extremely well, which showed the determination of the public to bring home to Government, to the powers that be, their wish to have clean air, water and soil in this country.  Ireland has had a very clean, green environment. I suppose one could say it has been the envy of our European partners.  Sadly, in recent years that image has rapidly changed in that in some quarters we have destroyed our image as a very green country.  Indeed in her introductory remarks the Minister made the point that the situation in Ireland was different from that of many of our EC partners because, luckily, we had avoided heavy industry; it had passed us by, leaving us almost alone in Europe with a relatively unspoiled environment.  I suppose the word &ldquo;relatively&rdquo; could mean anything, but because heavy industry did pass us by to a large extent, we should examine what are the factors that have led to our rapidly deteriorating environment.  Later in her remarks the Minister said that recently difficulties had begun to arise, the Minister having given a little pat on the head to local authorities on their having performed well.  I do not suppose everybody would agree with that but I will come to that matter later.  It is some time since those difficulties began to appear.</P>
    <P>I always take the view that a clear environment primarily is something we <Col N="795" /> want to have for our wellbeing, selfrespect and health.  Of course there are other factors, one being tourism and the image of our country with regard to tourism. The number of tourists who visit this country is a major economic factor, and we must ensure that they continue to perceive Ireland as &mdash; somebody described it &mdash; the daylight playground of Europe.  That is what we could be but I have heard it said that the nearer tourists get to Ireland the less they perceive the green image; the further away they are from it the more Ireland is thought of as green.  I suppose we have done quite a bit to foster that image ourselves by way of the good policies and advertising of Bord Fáilte.  But very often when people spend a holiday here they go away with a rather different picture. In many instances they see a great deal of litter and environmental pollution.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore the fact that, on many occasions recently, we have breached EC environmental directives on air pollution, on bathing water and on toxic waste disposal.  I will not give the relevant figures but merely say that we have breached those directives regularly.</P>
    <P>One serious problem of concern to myself as a Dublin city councillor as well as a Senator was the question of smog in the city.  Once again the Minister present played a significant role in getting to terms with the smog problem.  Personally I regret that the Minister did not forbid the burning of bituminous coal. However, I am hopeful that the measures introduced will be effective and that the smog problem in the city will be eliminated in the not too distant future.  Not long before that the Taoiseach said that the whole question of smog in the city was an awful lot of rubbish, contending that it was part of the modern, industrial world.  Happily the Minister's contribution prevailed and hopefully we will solve that problem in the near future.</P>
    <P>Another matter of extreme importance to me was that of the pollution of Dublin Bay.  We were constantly reassured by city officials that there was no cause for alarm, that the sea was able to absorb <Col N="796" /> vast quantities of sewage, industrial discharges and effluent of one kind or another and that there was no hazard to health.  On both sides of the Irish Sea there are huge amounts of discharges into the sea and we have done much less to counteract that than has been done in, say, the Mediterranean or in the North Sea.  I hope that problem will be tackled in the not too distant future.  I read recently that it was estimated that no less than 1,200 million cubic metres of sewage was dumped annually into the Irish Sea. That is a horrendous figure which I am sure will be looked at.</P>
    <P>Our rivers are extremely important for fishing and amenity purposes in tourism terms.  Here, we have no cause for complacency. Senator Naughten mentioned the Shannon, but one could mention many other rivers.  The Boyne Estuary is in a very sorry state.  The collecting of mussels there has been banned because of pollution.  The Avoca River is also in a very unsavoury condition, because of mining and the fish and plant life has virtually gone.  In the west &mdash; I go there regularly &mdash; I heard last year of a horrendous incident where a lorry load of cement was dumped into the Ballinahinch River.  It is horrendous to think that these things are still happening in our beautiful green Ireland.  We all remember the fish kills in 1987 which alarmed everybody, and we do not want a repetition.  It is estimated that approximately a quarter of our rivers and a third of our lakes are polluted, some of them heavily polluted.  That is not a situation any of us can allow to continue.  The Central Fisheries Board were doing very good work but I heard there were considerable cutbacks which made it more difficult for them to bring polluters to court &mdash; it is a fact that in many instances the polluters were the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Toxic waste is another area where we simply have not got to grips with the problem.  We do not have toxic waste incineration for the chemical industries. It is estimated that over 50,000 tonnes of toxic waste are produced yearly.  One has to ask how much of that is disposed of. The same applies to the CFCs.  There is <Col N="797" /> little or no control of CFCs in Ireland. There is not an adequate recycling service for old fridges, etc.</P>
    <P>Another area which concerns me greatly is the pollution of our seas as a result of fish farming.  I am pleased to see in this Bill that some of the powers of the Department of the Marine with regard to the issuing of licences will be taken over by the agency.  I know that fish farming has been developed in a very haphazard manner, with very little control over the undoubted pollution which is subsequently caused.</P>
    <P>Having given the Minister a litany of some of the ills, it is fair to say that last year was in many ways a good year for environmental management.  At the beginning of the year, the Environment Action Programme was launched with a great fanfare of trumpets setting out the policy of the Department of the Environment to be implemented over the next ten years.  We also had Ireland's Presidency of the EC.  The Taoiseach declared that that was to be a Green Presidency. That was a very enlightened move on his part.  I only hope that it is backed up by solid policies with solid progress flowing from it.  I endeavoured to encourage Dublin Corporation to support the activities put forward by the Government, by declaring a Green week.  They did so in a halfhearted manner, but as other speakers have said, there was always the problem of shortage of money.</P>
    <P>The EC's environmental impact assessment directives were very important. Last June the Environmental Information Service, ENFO, was established and I must compliment those involved.  I have heard very loud words of support for the service they provide &mdash; for the efficiency of the service and their whole approach.  I understand that service is working extremely well.  In July we had the amendment to the Water Pollution Act which increased the fines that could be imposed on offenders.  We hope that the implementation of that measure will help to reduce some of the problems.</P>
    <P>The EPA Bill, in conjunction with the Environment Action Programme, to a <Col N="798" /> large extent shows a co-ordinated approach to environmental pollution.  I welcome that approach.  The most important thing the EPA need to do is to help restore confidence among the public in the ability of Government, both local government and national Government, to get the environmental problems sorted out.</P>
    <P>In Cork we saw what happened with Sandoz, Merrell Dow etc.  These and other incidents caused great but genuine fear among the local population.  It is not right for Senator Ryan to speak about scaremongering and hysteria.  The public have genuine fears about the chemical industry.  Since Ireland is, I understand, the twelfth largest exporter of chemicals in the world, the public have genuine cause for concern.  They were very much aware of the conflict between the IDA, whose primary job is to bring industries into this country, and environmentalists. There were occasions when the IDA gave assurances or guarantees to local communities that a particular industry was &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo; but that was subsequently shown to be very far from the reality.  This caused people to lose confidence in what they were being told and to reach a stage where they were inclined to question everything.  I hope that the setting up of this agency will sort out that problem and that we will be able to achieve a balance between the requirements of a clean environment on the one hand and the obvious need to attract industry on the other.  The setting up of the EPA should not be seen as anti-industry. I know that in the United States there is a very powerful and very independent environmental protection agency and it has not been seen as inimical to industry.</P>
    <P>As many speakers have said today, we have to try to find a balance between the environment on the one hand and social and economic progress on the other.  We have to consider attracting jobs, particularly jobs needed in those parts of the country where emigration has been a festering sore for so long.  In many instances, these are the parts of the country which are the most environmentally sensitive. <Col N="799" /> The Minister put it well in the last paragraph of her speech when she said:</P>
    <P>It is no longer an issue of jobs or the environment.  In the 1990s it is an issue of jobs because of the environment.</P>
    <P>That sums up a great deal.  If we went forward on that basis we could make a lot of progress.  There are sound reasons companies and industries should pursue, or try to pursue, environmental excellence. They should welcome this Bill.  It has been shown that the public want to purchase environmentally friendly products and they are switched off by the dirty image of some industries.  Indeed, we had a classic example of that in what I mentioned earlier, the whole question of the smog in Dublin, CDL's role in it, how the public felt towards CDL's for the pollution and their severe reluctance to take effective steps themselves until the Minister virtually forced them to do so. There is a growing market for clean products.</P>
    <P>It is important for industry to remember that legislation, here and internationally, is tightening all the time. Industry needs to achieve higher environmental standards.  These standards will have to be met in the future and when industries are researching new products, they need to bear in mind what the legislation will be like in five or ten years time. There is also the question of law suits for damages to the environment and these are growing and are expensive.  We have had one or two of them here, but there has been a great number of them in the United States and in Europe.  Insurance costs are growing and there is a great number of reasons why industry should get the message that pollution prevention pays in the long term.</P>
    <P>The more modern attitude or approach to pollution is to try to prevent it at source rather than adding on equipment such as better waste disposal or better stack filters.  That is the old-fashioned approach of cleaning up the mess.  The more modern, far-reaching attitude is to <Col N="800" /> try to prevent pollution.  If we can eliminate the negative aspects at source, we will, in the long run, go a long way towards sorting out our problems.</P>
    <P>The attitude which was farily prevalent, say, 15 years ago when I was first in politics, was &ldquo;a job at any price&rdquo; mentality. Communities welcomed multinationals because they brought jobs and they did not, in those days, think of what the downstream impact would be.  That mentality has changed very dramatically now and industries that damage the environment are simply unacceptable.  The cavalier attitude of many of these large firms both to their workforce, firing them with impunity, not considering the health of their workforce and their attitudes to toxic waste are simply not acceptable any longer.  We had an instance only last week of a planning application from a company to set up in Ringsend.  Indeed, the company was to make an environmentally friendly coal product creating 40 jobs or more but the local people simply did not want to consider the proposal unless they could be given absolute guarantees that there would not be smuts and pollution into the air.  This change is very good.</P>
    <P>There needs to be a positive relationship between the community and good business.  Another factor which is worth mentioning is the anxiety of many firms nowadays to be sponsors of various environmental projects.  Many firms are looking for environmental projects to sponsor because they know it is good for their image.  Having said that about industry, and pollution from industry, we must recognise that we all, each and every one of us, contribute to pollution. It is not alone industry, but agriculture, intensive farming or the local authority sewerage systems.  A whole range of issues are involved and each and every one of us is responsible.</P>
    <P>I mentioned aquaculture and there are problems also with forestry and domestic waste disposal.  One which has not been mentioned today, and I do not think there is anything in the Bill to cover it, is the whole question of pollution from transport, emissions from private cars in <Col N="801" /> the city and from trucks; the whole problem of noxious air, lead and catalytic convertors.  I urge the Minister to turn her attentions to that area and to make both lead and catalytic convertors compulsory as soon as possible.  The other side of it, of course, is that we could have more environmentally friendly public transport and such things as cycling, which I indulge in myself for both environmental and many other reasons.</P>
    <P>Another matter I would like to mention &mdash; it is one we should not lose sight of &mdash; is the importance of, so to speak, cashing-in on the enthusiasm of young people for the environment.  That is something which is very obvious and which I am sure many of us are aware of.  The young are extremely concerned about the environment and they want to take their responsibility seriously.  Perhaps the Minister would ask her colleague in the Department of Education, to emphasise to schools the importance of civics in the school curriculum.  In many instances if something else has to be pushed in, the civics class can be squeezed out.  We need to encourage in young people an individual sense of responsibility.</P>
    <P>I speak very often to schools on the question of the environment and I often notice that they seem to be more interested and concerned about environmental problems which seem a long way away, things like acid rain or global warming, but when you talk to them about something as simple as the litter in the school grounds they are not always as enthusiastic to get involved.  It is important to make them realise the contribution which each and every one of us can make.</P>
    <P>I do not think new laws alone will suffice. We have a plethora of new laws. We have had anti-litter laws and, indeed, somebody mentioned this afternoon the £800 fine we heard about when the Litter Act was introduced.  It would be interesting to know how many times the £800 fine has been imposed.  We also have the laws, I mentioned earlier, under the water pollution and air pollution Acts. However, all the laws in the world will not protect us from undisciplined, careless, unscrupulous and ruthless <Col N="802" /> materialistic people who are simply on the make.  It was mentioned that environmental awareness, information programmes and promotional campaigns were being intensified in the environmental action programme so that we will all know individually how we can help to protect and enhance the environment.  I would like to hear from the Minister what exactly is being done on that score because we need to change people's attitudes. We need to change their hearts and their minds if we are going to solve this problem.  We need to be positive towards the environment.</P>
    <P>One of the provisions in the Bill which I will be coming back to at a later stage is that on public involvement and public discussion.  It is something that should be welcomed.  Earlier Senator John A. Murphy said that self-appointed environmentalists would be out of a job after the Bill is passed.  I do not believe that for one moment and it would be very tragic if they were.</P>
    <P>We all know that no matter how far we go we will not go far enough and the job of the many excellent environmental groups is to be the conscience of the country and to aspire to achieve a better and a cleaner environment I know the Minister is very highly thought of in environmental circles and does not see environmentalists as weirdos, cranks or wayouts.  The Minister listens to them and got as many of them as she could together in Kilmainham for a day long seminar before putting this Bill together. This was greatly appreciated and there has been widespread support, with reservations, for the Bill.  We need to emphasise that a clean environment is in everyone's long term interest because we share this planet and share a common fate, and the more we encourage public involvement the better.  We should be aiming higher because we should live up to the very high perception people from other countries have of Ireland.  We should see if Ireland can be a model in ecological and environmental terms.  I was in Switzerland recently and I hear that in 1988 workshops were introduced in each of the 14 districts of Basle to see how they could make Basle a model, ecological city.  We need to do that and <Col N="803" /> not rest on our laurels.  We need to encourage local authorities, towns, cities and villages to get involved in that debate so that they can understand the positive benefits of being an ecologically and environmentally good city or town.</P>
    <P>The reform of local government and the need for genuine local democracy are important.  I will speak about that when that Bill comes before this House, soon I hope.</P>
    <P>This Bill will be a major tool in our fight against pollution, provided the public have confidence in it and in its ability to control pollution.  There is an important role for the IDA in the Bill because they have one of the six members of the committee who will put forward names for the director and members of the board.  The Government obviously support the Bill and the trade unions and the Council for the Status of Women are accommodated.</P>
    <P>With regard to the environmental groups, I am glad to see that An Taisce is one of those represented on this committee, but would it have been advisable to include some of the other excellent environmental groups such as Green-peace and Earthwatch?  They have all made important contributions to our understanding of the importance of the environment.  This is in no way to denigrate An Taisce &mdash; I have been a member of it for a very long time &mdash; but it might be seen by some of the other organisations to be more conservative, solid, respectable and responsible.  Those are all good things but I do not think we should leave out the other environmental groups.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the agency appears to be relatively independent and free of political involvement; it is separate from the Department of the Environment and the Government.  The Bill secures as far as possible the ability of the agency to make independent decisions on licensing, research, monitoring and the various areas of responsibility, but a great deal depends on the calibre of the members of the board and the staff.  To this end salaries will be extremely important. Under the provisions of the Bill I note there can be a transfer of staff from Government Departments and An Foras <Col N="804" /> Forbartha.  I thought An Foras Forbartha had been abolished two or three years ago and that the staff had been redeployed, but I see from this Bill that they are to be abolished yet again.</P>
    <P>I caution taking on too many staff from existing Government organisations, not because they are not excellent people who have done a very good job but, in my view, this agency would benefit from outside fresh young thinking.  That is what is required.  This is in no way to denigrate the very talented and dedicated personnel in the Department and in An Foras Forbartha.  The funding of the agency is vital.  It must be adequate and it must be guaranteed so that the agency will not be dependent on industry or anybody else to carry out their functions.  An Foras Forbartha was an excellent body and did very good work but I do not think anybody seriously believed they were independent of government.  To that extent they did not have the same clout I hope this agency will have.</P>
    <P>As mentioned by Senator Kennedy, there are a great number of sections in the Bill and there are at least 14 sections where we will be relying on the Minister to make regulations or to do various things.  As long as the present Minister is there we will be very happy with that, but she may not be there forever.  She may be transferred to higher office or there is the possibility that the Government may fall or there may be a Minister from the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure it is a good thing to rely so much on the Minister making all these regulations.  I will be putting down amendments on Committee Stage.  There are certain areas where the Bill says that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; and I will be pressing that it be changed to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of this Bill depends on the relationship between the agency and the local authorities.  I have said on previous occasions &mdash; and I do not mind repeating it as often as I can &mdash; that I regret the relationship which exists between the Department of the Environment and local authorities.  I have been a member <Col N="805" /> of a local authority for 16 years and I find the Department's attitude to local authorities abysmal.  It does nothing to boost local authorities; it does nothing to encourage them to be responsible.  The Department have a very stultifying controlling influence.  I am not talking about the area of finance, where we know the local authorities are starved; I am talking about the Department's attitude to local authorities which is that they are incapable of doing anything efficiently. Of course they are incapable of doing things efficiently because they are not given and have never been given the opportunity to be responsible.  This matter more pertinently should be left to the local government Bill when it comes here for debate.  I am aware that in some instances local authorities have had a poor record in regard to their concern for the environment but I am not sure that has always been their fault.  I welcome the areas where the agency will be able to assist the local authorities by setting standards giving advice and laying down guidelines.  Neither do I resent the power being given to the agency to monitor the performance of local authorities.  This is necessary and desirable as local authorities have failed in their duties in some instances but I wonder whether it is a good idea to remove the granting of licences from the local authorities who grant them at present.</P>
    <P>At present local authorities make planning decisions which, of course, can be appealed to An Bord Pleanála and they issue licences under the water pollution and air pollution legislation.  I have a great apprehension that the division of those functions will lead to many problems.  I would favour the agency giving all possible advice and support and laying down guidelines and the issue of licences being left to the local authority in the final analysis.  I do not think one can divorce planning decisions from the other areas and they should be integrated.  If there is conflict in this area between the local authorities and the agency it will spell doom.  If it reaches the stage where the local authorities resent the agency and are unco-operative, it will not be of advantage to the environment in the long term.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="806" /> I would like to stress to the Minister and to Senators that I am not elected by the members of a local authority.  If I was, they might believe I was only endeavouring to carry favour with them. That is not my purpose.  I have always believed we will never get things right in this country unless we have 27 local authorities who are independent, responsible, buoyant and that can do a good job.  Local authorities should be given all the help, advice and encouragement they need because they are the bodies who, in the final analysis, understand the special conditions pertaining in different areas. There will be considerable problems if an industry is lost to a locality.  It will be blamed on the agency and there will be antagonism towards them.  I was going to say it would be blamed on Dublin again but, of course, we hope this agency will be sited in Wexford.  I am genuinely concerned about this issue and ask the Minister to reconsider it.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the Bill because I had heard the Minister favoured allowing the local authorities to grant the licences.  Knowing the Minister, I know he would not easily allow himself to be deflected by the officials in his Department so I am sure he will be able to put forward very cogent reasons why he changed his mind, if he did change it, on this issue.  As other Senators have said, it would also mean that appeals procedures would be similar to those in the planning appeals board.  At present people can only appeal to the courts which is, as we all know, a very expensive and unlikely course of action for most people.  What will happen is that the agency will be judge and jury in its own case.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether part of the Minister's thinking is that the money received from the licences will assist in funding the agency.  It would have been no bad thing if the income received from the licences had gone to the local authority. I also would urge that there be as much public consultation as possible in the whole licensing process.  I would like to see changes made in regard to oral hearings.  Under the Bill it will be the agency who will make the decision completely at their own discretion.</P>
    <P>The provision in regard to access to <Col N="807" /> information has been welcomed by many speakers.  By and large I find these provisions satisfactory.  However, like Senator Murphy, who I think referred to it earlier, I have reservations about section 38 which deals with confidentiality. It should be spelled out a little more precisely in the section what is meant by confidential information.  We should not allow the Bill to go through the House if it contains a section which would virtually allow the agency not to give information simply on the basis that it was confidential and might be of significant industrial importance.  Section 38 needs to be amended and I will be putting forward amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I was interested to see in the Environment Action Programme a reference to the principle of precautionary action even when there is no definite scientific evidence to link emissions or discharges with detrimental environmental effects. I cannot find any reference in the Bill to the principle of precautionary action and it would probably be appropriate to insert such a reference in 51 (2) (c).  We can discuss this point at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The setting up of advisory panels is a welcome move provided they are given the opportunity to make a proper input and are not just talking shops.  It will be a good way for the agency to keep in touch.  However, I know that other advisory committees of a similar nature met only once a year and were nothing more than a sop to public opinion.</P>
    <P>I suppose in the final analysis, it comes down to a question of finance, and how much we are prepared to pay.  We know that all environmental ills can be cured and all environmental problems can be solved if we, by which I mean the consumers and the taxpayers, are prepared to pay.  I know that in the Netherlands where environmental problems are extremely serious they have put together an integrated and very strong plan to clean up The Netherlands by 1994 which they estimate will cost £12.2 billion.  We should not underestimate the finances that will be involved.</P>
    <P>I support the argument made by other speakers that unless local authorities are <Col N="808" /> given the finance to undertake the environmental protection works required they will not be able to carry them out effectively.  I want to refer to section 63 (1) (c) which is of particular concern to me.  I welcome the provisions in section 63 which deal with the statutory functions of the local authorities, their obligation to carry out these functions and the extent to which the agency can issue advice, provide assistance or support and direct the local authority to carry out certain actions or functions.  When a local authority fails, without reasonable cause, to comply with such a direction the agency will be able to carry it out and bill the local authority for the cost.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that the agency shall not give a direction unless the local authority, with due regard to its other statutory functions, have the necessary funds to comply with the direction or those funds can reasonably be made available by them.  It seems that that provision will undo everything that has gone before it.  If the local authority only have to plead lack of funds &mdash; that will not be difficult &mdash; it will be extremely difficult for the agency to put on the necessary pressure to get them to carry out these functions.  We do not intend to allow other polluters simply to say they have not enough funds.  Even though the Bill envisages the BATNEEC principle, we should not allow them to get out of their responsibilities because they have not the necessary funds.  That is a matter that certainly needs to be considered.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter of concern to me, but I am not sure whether it should be included in the Bill.  I would ask the Minister when the Bill has been passed to address the whole area of the built environment.  Sadly this country has failed dismally in its determination to conserve our built heritage, our towns, cities and villages which are very unique. Although many of our villages are of great simplicity, they are very well laid out and very beautiful.  However, there is enormous decay and dereliction.  For example, in Dublin vast tracts of the city have been demolished to accommodate the motor car.  In the countryside there is haphazard and uncontrolled development. There is ribbon development, <Col N="809" /> urban sprawl and bungalow blitz.  Many of the great Irish houses have fallen into ruin and decay.  There is not much time left if this problem is to be addressed.  We must see our built environment as part of the development potential of this country.  Sadly there is very little being done in regard to this.  When An Foras Forbartha were in existence they made some contribution in this regard.  While An Bord Pleanála decide on planning appeals, they give very little guidelines in this direction.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on setting up the agency.  It can be, and I hope it will be a very effective watchdog.  We have left behind us the attitude that environmental concerns must always conflict with economic progress and that they in some way impede progress.  The Minister has turned that idea on its head. We need more long-range planning and less short term greed.  We need to act decisively if we are to turn our environment around.  Above all we must not rely totally on legislation or on Government agencies.  We must look to each individual as to what they can do.  I have always said that the solution to the environmental problem is a multitude of mini solutions and not one macro solution. The cleaning up of the environment falls on all of us, and this Bill is certainly a good start.</P>
    <P>I would like to outline very briefly some of the provisions I would like changed.  I will not go into them now; I am only summarising them or giving the headings on them.  I am not happy with the licensing role of the proposed agency.  It means that neither the developer nor any third party can appeal a decision.  I am not hopeful that the Minister will change her mind on this matter, although I will do everything I can to persuade her to do so.  We need to ensure that the agency will hold public hearings in advance whenever possible and will involve the public as much as possible.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the lack of definition of the role of the agency with regard to the scoping of the EIAs.  For major developments the agency should be involved in scoping of EIAs and EISs and should also ensure the involvement of the public in these exercises so that the <Col N="810" /> concerns of everybody will be addressed and decisions will have across-the-board support.  I am not clear about the relationship between the agency and An Bord Pleanála, the relationship between the agency and EOLAS with regard to environmental research and liaison between Irish and EC researchers regarding EC grants and so on, but I will come back to that later.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the dissolution of An Foras Forbartha.  I would like to know what roles previously assigned to An Foras Forbartha have not been taken up either by some other Government Department or in this Bill.  I am not happy with the sections on the ETAs and EISs on motorways and roads.  Is it possible that policies on transport and road development could be subject to environmental impact assessments?</P>
    <P>Those are my main concerns about the Bill.  I am sure the Bill will continue to be constructively debated in this House. I hope it will have a relatively smooth passage and that the necessary amendments will be accepted so that we will see the agency in place as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State must be very pleased to come into the Seanad and hear the honours being showered on her in this debate.  I too welcome her to the House.  I would like to take this opportunity to compliment her on her commitment to the environment since taking up her portfolio.  I would also mention the success of the Minister of State on issues such as the smog in Dublin.  I compliment her on her resourcefulness in bringing many environmental matters to enactment particularly in regard to air pollution, water pollution and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other speakers, I welcome the Bill.  While there may be a number of minor matters which could be improved, everybody has to accept that this is an extremely open and honest attempt, in an independent way, to ensure that our environment is protected in a proper manner.  As a Senator from Cork, it is appropriate for me to set the background to the Bill.  I acknowledge there were certain problems in the past in relation to the environment and industry which <Col N="811" /> could be said to have caused &ldquo;clouding&rdquo;. In Cork in particular there was a sustained period of difficulty with a number of industries in the harbour area.  Emissions from some factories caused a lot of concern to residents.  The smells from these factories were extremely uncomfortable and nauseous.  It was a major concern that many of these companies were not working within the remit of the planning permission that was granted to them.  While it would appear that these emissions in themselves were harmless it brought about a situation where there was a lack of confidence, certainly in the local authority, the perception was that the local authority were not dealing with it in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>It would be appropriate for me as a member of the local authority involved to mention a number of items extremely pertinent to this case, including the law as it related to local authorities and the treatment of a pharmaceutical firm in that area, which was wrong.  It is only in recent times, with the introduction of the Air Pollution Act and the Water Pollution Act, that local authorities have been given proper powers to take offending industries to task.  The furore that resulted from the emissions has brought everybody to their senses in relation to the environment and particularly their responsibility to people living in those areas.  To coin a phrase, many of these companies have now cleaned up their act because they have been forced to do so and I have no doubt that, but for the introduction of the Air Pollution Act and the Water Pollution Act, this might not have happened.</P>
    <P>The environmental section of Cork County Council are probably one of the most efficient and professional in the country.  During all this time their job by way of monitoring or reporting was always carried out to a T; anybody who has recently looked at the Cremer Warner report or indeed the Enviro report will see quite clearly that the council have been vindicated in everything they have done by way of monitoring in the past.  It would also be appropriate to mention the Merrell Dow <Col N="812" /> controversy and to make two points relating to this proposed industry.  One is that those opposed to it were genuinely concerned on health grounds and no issue can arouse the emotions to a higher pitch &mdash; as those of us in Fianna Fáil who dealt with health matters in the last general election will know &mdash; than difficulties that might arise in relation to the well-being of residents arising from the location of a pharmaceutical industry in their area.  However, many of the statements made at that time had absolutely no foundation and indeed the press did not do Irish industry any service by ensuring that the negative vibes from people who did not have the facts were given so much prominence.  When facts were made available for some reason those facts seemed to be put into second place.</P>
    <P>My second point relates to the location of industry; the local authority are not alone a planning authority but a development authority and most local authorities are involved in development plans.  The idea of a development plan is that the planners working in the area, in combination with the local authority representatives from those areas, put together a plan of action for their particular local authority area.  They do so with regard to housing, roads and industrial development. In the case of Merrell Dow, the IDA were directing a pharmaceutical industry out of an area which was zoned for that particular type of industry into what I would call a rural hinterland of excellent quality agricultural land.  That type of industry would have been totally alien to the area and certainly would not have been included in the county development plan.  A similar situation could again arise and the relationship between the IDA, the local authority's development plan and the new agency will be extremely important.  What is the point in having a development plan which identifies particular areas for industrial development suitable for pharmaceutical development when the IDA, because they have a landbank, because certain land becomes available or because an industry indicate they will locate there, allow them to set up in that location which may not be suitable for that type <Col N="813" /> of industry?  While I appreciate the Minister's assurances in relation to planning laws, environmental impact studies and now the agency, there will still be apprehension among residents that something like that could occur again.  Will the Minister look at this particular element so that we can avoid a recurrence of the type of thing that happened with Merrell Dow in Killeagh?  It is important to say that the chemical industry is not the major polluter in Ireland.  In many ways the local authorities have been major polluters in their own right over the past number of years and it is gratifying that as part of this Bill the local authorities will not have an overseer under the auspices of the environment agency.</P>
    <P>Should the local authority determine the industry location according to its development plan and should the Environmental Protection Agency have an input into county and city development plans as a duty and as a role?  Perhaps the Minister, in replying to Second Stage, might advert to that fact.</P>
    <P>Anybody reading the Minister's speech and looking at the Bill will welcome the independence of approach to staffing, particularly at senior level.  Every effort is being made by the Minister to ensure that the best personnel are chosen.  I compliment the Minister for ensuring that the people who will recruit the director general and the four directors are not all drawn from the environmental or the scientific area.  We will have a balanced board who will select the best people for the job in hand.  They will look for people with what one would describe as diverse specialist expertise.  This is both warranted and merited and is an extremely good idea.  I have no doubt the advisory committee will be equal to the job.</P>
    <P>I would now like to comment on section 30 of the Bill which deals with the transfer of staff and to pose the question as to how cohesive this will be given that the staff of An Foras Forbartha are to be transferred and it is likely that staff members from the Department of the Marine, perhaps from the local authorities and even from the Department of the Environment will also be transferred. I am aware that the pay structure for An Foras Forbartha personnel is different <Col N="814" /> from those in the local authorities.  I would be concerned therefore about the extent to which those working in the agency are motivated and satisfied if the same pay structures were to be carried forward.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has pointed out, quite rightly, that the intention is to decentralise the agency.  Given the Government's commitment to decentralisation and the fact that they are now establishing a new agency, it is only right that it should be located outside of Dublin.  I should say, as a Corkman, that we are crying out for decentralisation and have always maintained, having regard to the fact that the chemical industry is mainly concentrated in Cork, that Cork should be the location chosen for this agency.</P>
    <P>In relation to recruitment, would it be preferable to recruit directly for the agency rather than take staff from other Departments and allow staff who would like to join the agency apply of their own volition for positions with the agency?  It is my view that if they are recruited on this basis they will be fully committed to the agency from day one.  I would also ask the Minister of State when replying to inform the House if staff of various Departments will have the option of transferring to the agency.  A section of the Bill, the number of which eludes me at the moment, states that the agency will be able to identify staff within the local authorities.  I have to say that the word &ldquo;identify&rdquo; does not appeal to me as it seems to imply that there will be an element of coercion involved.  I hope we will take a look at the wording of that section on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Having said that, the Bill has been well thought out and the Minister of State is to be congratulated for taking into account submissions from all quarters.  I was not aware that environmental groups had a day-long session with the Minister of State who has taken the submissions of at least 40 groups, if not more, into consideration. This is reflected in the Bill which set out to be as all-embracing as possible.</P>
    <P>In a way, the Minister of State sought in the Bill to avoid duplication of executive functions as between national and <Col N="815" /> local agencies.  I concur with the view that the agency should be encouraged and required to evolve national standards and where expertise is not available within a local authority, the agency should make this expertise available.  Whether this should be sought from other local authorities or from consultants is a matter for the agency.  The evolution of national standards by the agency will be crucial to their success and acceptance.  If the agency succeed in doing this, the so-called self-appointed protectors of the environment to which Senator Murphy referred, will be able to shout no more that standards around the country are not comparable.  It is also vital that our standards are comparable with the standards in other countries to ensure that we will not be placed at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a number of other issues with the Minister of State on which further elaboration may be needed.  The first is the monitoring of agriculture, of rivers and lakes.  From my reading of the Bill, it appears the agency will have responsibility of monitoring rivers and lakes while the local authorities will have the duty to monitor agricultural land.  In many instances, it is my experience that pollution in rivers and lakes emanated from the land.  In my view this will make interaction between a local authority and the agency difficult.  This matter is worth looking at.</P>
    <P>Let me take up one point made by Senator Hederman about rivers and lakes.  She gave the impression that there is a major problem but it is only fair to say that two years ago there was a major problem.  However, the progress which has been made, by means of a process of education, legislation, coercion in some cases and grants from the Department of the Environment, has been quite extraordinary and a significant improvement has been achieved in that area.  I would like it to go out from here that the vast majority of farmers are making a determined effort to clean up their act in relation to pollution.</P>
    <P>In this instance the Minister of State should consider giving the responsibility to monitor land and water either to the agency or the local authority.  As a <Col N="816" /> member of a local authority I should say that, given that the local authorities will have responsibility for monitoring agricultural land, it would seem sensible to also give them a role in relation to rivers and lakes with the agency continuing to maintain a supervisory role.</P>
    <P>In relation to planning, this element will be left to the local authority.  Where an environmental impact assessment is required the local authority will be required to give their decision on a planning application within the statutory eight week period.  In the case of licences, this function is now to be given to the Environmental Protection Agency.  It is quite easy to envisage a scenario where a local authority, having examined the planning application and environmental impact assessment, grant permission and the Environmental Protection Agency do not grant a licence.  It could be said we are adding another layer of bureaucracy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the House I propose to give some of my time to Senator Martin Cullen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I welcome the Minister to the House.  I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this important matter of the availability of late night public transport particularly in the Dublin area and the availability and operation of taxis and the timing of the DART service and late night buses.  I raise this issue as a result of quite a number of complaints from constituents and other people including <Col N="817" /> hoteliers and public house owners etc. in the city.  The end of last year saw a most successful anti-drink driving campaign. All the people involved in that, the relevant Ministers, the Garda and the general public, responded in a most responsible manner to the question of not drinking and driving.  The Minister knows the Garda have indicated that the campaign will continue.  There must be a response from the various Departments connected with this.  The Minister knows her Department are only partially responsible in this regard; other Departments are involved, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Transport.  These Departments must consider the availability of public transport late at night particularly during holidays, special events, weekends and Christmas.  The question needs careful attention and review and I ask the Minister and her colleagues in other Departments to review the situation.</P>
    <P>Various aspects must be examined in regard to the availability and operation of taxis.  I understand that in the Dublin area just over 1,800 plates are available. This number has obtained since 1979 and obviously, the population of Dublin has increased since then.  Plates which cost a couple of thousand pounds about ten years ago are now realising about £47,000.  Some of the people buying these may have received redundancy payments, have reached middle age and might not get another job elsewhere.</P>
    <P>If one phones for a taxi, one has to wait sometimes for an hour or an hour-and-a-half. Some taxis do not have radios.  Spare taxis may be available but because they have no radios the drivers do not know where people are seeking taxis and where the demand is.  There have been many complaints about this. People have been left waiting hours or had to walk home late at night.  This is intolerable.  These are not just people who normally drive and are responding to the drink driving campaign.  Many people in our cities and towns cannot afford to run a car.  We are all aware of the enormous cost of running a car <Col N="818" /> between keeping it on the road, insurance, road tax, petrol, etc.</P>
    <P>The question of operating the DART service and buses late at night also arises. The last DART train mid-week runs at about 11.25 p.m., certainly well before the last public house closes, particularly in summer time.  While public houses should not necessarily be the guiding light, obviously they are a barometer. There have been problems in running late night buses due to drivers being attacked. There is a duty on the Minister here and the Minister for Transport to consider whether the DART and the bus service should be extended to run later at weekends, particularly at Christmas and times of special events.  If there is a demand and a need, then I suggest the Minister here should direct that a full investigation be made into how the service is being provided at present and whether at weekends the DART and bus services should run later.  There have been many complaints. I know of one unfortunate person who contracted pneumonia and is still quite seriously ill because he had to walk a couple of miles and got soaked to the skin after waiting several hours at a taxi rank and no taxi arrived.</P>
    <P>The drink driving campaign was successful partly because of the responsible attitude of most motorists.  Obviously, some did not heed the warning of the Minister and the Garda.  That campaign must be maintained all the year round, not just for a couple of weeks prior to Christmas.  Hand in hand with it, if it saves lives there is an onus on the Minister here and her colleagues to look at how the taxi service is run, whether plates and licences should be issued for a limited period at certain times, costs and so on. Taxis constitute a big industry valued at approximately £100 million.  The last licences were issued in 1979 and if there is a demand for more licences Dublin Corporation should examine the possibility of issuing them.  It is for the Minister to consider whether there should be different types of licences during special times.  Much needed employment could be provided if the licences applied to operators for a given period of time for certain months of the year or for certain <Col N="819" /> hours of the day.  For special events, holiday or party times we should provide a public transport service.</P>
    <P>When replying I would ask the Minister to respond to the matters I have raised. I know she represents an area in which at times taxis have been difficult to hire. The anti-drink-driving campaign should be uppermost in our minds to eliminate further carnage.  There may be many people, not necessarily those returning home at five o'clock in the morning who, if they miss a DART at 11.25 p.m. during the week or the last DART from Bray into town on a Sunday night at 11 o'clock may have to walk back part of the way either because they cannot avail of the DART service or have missed the last buses.  CIE have got to be flexible in this respect.  I condemn strongly any attacks on late night bus drivers and conductors particularly those perpetuated by drunken people.  That is a worry for CIE.  If necessary special squads should travel on buses.  I would ask the Minister, when replying, to respond to the continuing problem.  It would be my hope that she will institute an investigation into the difficulties that have evolved.  That would be a positive response.  CIE and the Taxi Federation must also investigate the difficulties being encountered.  I am not saying there is a Utopian answer but a response is warranted and it is up to the Minister and her colleagues to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cosgrave for allowing me some of his time to speak on this important matter.  At the outset I might declare my involvement in this area as chief executive of the Federation of Transport Operators representing 1,100 private companies.  The federation are widely known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter that has been raised tonight is one of deep concern to all of us with an interest in public transport.  Undoubtedly, it highlights the need for the Minister to introduce legislation on which I know he has been working for the past 12 months.  More than that, it highlights the need here of an integrated public transport policy involving all the different elements involved therein.  We tend to deal with matters in isolation, talking of the buses and coaches in the State sector, <Col N="820" /> then the private sector and lastly the taxi-hackney position as if they were all separate entities.</P>
    <P>If we look at the experiences of many of our EC partners who have deregulated and liberalised their systems over recent years &mdash; we will perceive the key to their successful deregulation policies, recognising the interdependence of all of these services in the provision of an excellent public transport service.  That is the point I want to make.  That is what we should be about and its net result would be beneficial to fare-paying public.  It is not a matter for the vested interests of any one group, be it State or private sector but rather the combination of all of those assets to devise a system that will benefit all.  That is what we should be about.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion of this new licensing policy recently and the new bus competition Bill about which the Minister has been talking.  I must make the point strongly that there has been a suggestion on the part of non-representative voices in the private sector and elsewhere that one could take the late night bus service problem and hand it over to the private sector who would solve it.  That would be a disastrous way to approach this problem.  Indeed, if that were to be the approach to the public transport system in general equally it would be a disaster.</P>
    <P>The future direction of transport here is not reliant on the private sector only or on the State sector only because no one sector can provide the answers.  Rather it should be done by a combination of the best assets and there are some excellent assets in the State sector as there are in the private sector.  Recognition of that will bring about the type of system that we want to see evolve here.</P>
    <P>I condemn out of hand the acts of vandalism perpetrated on personnel in Dublin Bus, in particular the attacks perpetrated over Christmas which have highlighted one other important fact, that is the need for flexibility within the public transport system.  This problem is exacerbated at peak times, around Christmas, on bank holiday weekends or whenever there is an increased need for public transport particularly late in the evenings.  I hope the campaign of the Minister for the Environment to stop <Col N="821" /> people drinking and driving will continue all-year round, this should be a permanment feature of Irish life.  If that is to be the case what we need at such times is a public transport system that can respond to those needs.  That is possible. It is here that the different arms of the private sector can make a contribution. Smaller, more flexible companies, of their nature, can respond to such needs. It is more difficult for any company in the State or private sector &mdash; extremely large and bureaucratic &mdash; to respond to sudden needs or have that flexible capacity.</P>
    <P>What has happened in country after country throughout Europe bears out the contention that such is possible with the evaluation of a deregulated system that directly involves the private and State sectors.  All the figures indicate that there has been a substantial growth in the number of members of the public using public transport.  Those are the facts.  I am not saying this purely because I am involved in the private sector operations. The combination of all of these resources will solve our problems.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to introduce the Bill that he has clearly signalled over the past 12 months as quickly as possible.  I expect that Bill to be quite detailed and I have no doubt but that it will necessitate much discussion.  However, the implementation of its detailed provisions will be another matter.  It is easy to set parameters but an assessment of how these resources will be deployed is infinitely more difficult.</P>
    <P>The other point I would make is that there are too many Departments here involved in transport operations.  It is ludicrous for an island nation so dependent on delivery of its transport system to expand into the haulage sector.  We need a Department in full control.  It is unfair that responsibilities are spread between the Departments of the Environment, Tourism and Transport and Education.</P>
    <P>Referring to some recent reaction to the difficulties confronting late night transport in Dublin over the Christmas period it would be incorrect to suggest that the private sector is champing at the bit to operate exclusively late night services in Dublin.  There have been some ludicrous suggestions such as a door-to-door <Col N="822" /> bus service.  These are not possible and it is extremely unfair to raise the expectancy in the public mind that the private sector can deliver such service because it cannot.  The private sector can deliver what it is allowed deliver within a cohesive transport policy but not only by way of some of the airy fairy suggestions advanced.</P>
    <P>I want to knock these types of utterings on the head at this point because it does not benefit either the Department of Tourism and Transport, or the public to raise these expectations.  It does a disservice to all of the bodies interested in developing a public transport system in this country.  I would urge the Department of Tourism and Transport to consider those points and to bring forward the Bill as soon as possible to start a full debate on public transport policy.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Transport and Tourism, Deputy Brennan who, because of a pressing engagement, cannot be here this evening.  He has asked me to deputise on his behalf.</P>
      <P>I share the concern expressed by both Senators Cosgrave and Cullen about the need for improved transport facilities here particularly in the Dublin area and especially late at night.  As the Senators are probably aware &mdash; and Senator Cullen referred to this &mdash; the Minister for Transport and Tourism said on many occasions that he is preparing legislation which I understand he is now finalising, to have a significant liberalisation of bus services in the country and to allow for greater competition between bus operators. Liberalisation of the transport system and the deregulation that will follow will have a significant impact on improving services generally throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to compliment, as Senator Cosgrave and Senator Cullen did, the efforts of the Garda Síochána over the Christmas period in instilling in all of us, the need to be ever vigilant when taking drink, and not to drive with drink on board.  It was an extremely successful campaign.  It substantially reduced the number of deaths.  It is unfortunate that the very bad weather after Christmas <Col N="823" /> almost cancelled out the number of lives saved before Christmas in that vigorous campaign which was so well put in place by the Garda.  The campaign also had a significant effect on insurance companies, in that they had a significant take up of car insurance during the period in which that campaign was under way. Long may that continue.  The public response was very responsible.  Virtually everybody responded very well and people going out to drink left their cars at home.</P>
    <P>It was that fantastic response, although not only that response that led to many of the problems to which Senators Cosgrave and Cullen have drawn attention and which they have succeeded in having raised here this evening.  Certainly the long queues at taxi ranks during that period were extremely frustrating.  I am not sure how one can deal with short term problems of that kind.  Senator Cosgrave called for the issuing of temporary licences.  I am not certain how that would work and how the people who would have such licences would be able to live for the rest of the year.  There are possiblities for, perhaps, granting temporary licences during such periods, to hackney drivers and so on.  I certainly want to be positive about the suggestions put forward.</P>
    <P>As Senator Cosgrave said, responsibility for this rests in a number of different areas.  Dublin Corporation are the responsible body for licensing taxis in the city.  Despite that, the Minister for the Environment has said that he intends to carry out a comprehensive review of taxi and hackney services around the country including the Dublin area, and that any gaps, difficulties and temporary problems that exist will be rectified following that comprehensive review.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say, and as a Dublin Deputy I am more than aware of this, that as the population of the city has moved out to the suburbs this has put increased pressure and increased expectation on the transport system.  In the sixties about 150,000 to 160,000 people lived in Dublin's inner city.  That figure has almost halved, to 80,000 people.  Many of my constituents have told me it was not until they moved to Tallaght or Clondalkin <Col N="824" /> that they realised the gaps that existed in the public transport system.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to and condemn the vandalism that has taken place on some of the Dublin buses and which has resulted in the curtailing of services to many parts of the suburbs.  Such areas as Finglas and, in my own constituency, Clondalkin, Neilstown and other areas have had to have service curtailed from 7 p.m. because of the assaults and robberies on bus crews and the throwing of stones at buses.  CIE tell me that, for example, 32 bus staff are currently out of work on sick leave because of attacks on them by vandals.  The cost of this kind of vandalism according to the last figures available, in 1988, was £1.1 million.  This is adding significantly to the problem of Dublin Bus in the Dublin area.  I condemn the hooligans who get on buses, terrorise passengers and do a great disservice to the public transport system for the area in which they live or may be travelling through at any time.</P>
    <P>Dublin Bus have 700 buses on 159 routes.  The last bus leaves at about 23.30 hours in the evening.  That is relatively early.  There may not be a huge demand to have buses running all through the night, but there is a demand in the city to have a skeleton transport system available, certainly during peak periods like the Christmas period and so on.  The review that is being carried out by the Minister for the Environment in relation to the taxi and hackney service and the proposals that are emanating from the Department of Transport by way of significant liberalisation of bus services should lead to a greatly improved service for the consumer and for the users of public transport, particularly in the city and county of Dublin, but in so far as it is possible and practicable, throughout the country also.  As Senator Cullen said, it is a question of having an integrated approach, not just a question of having a State or a semi-State involvement.  There is a significant role for the private sector in this whole area.  What we need is an integrated approach that will allow an efficient and effective service to be available to the public when required.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 24 January 1991.</P>
