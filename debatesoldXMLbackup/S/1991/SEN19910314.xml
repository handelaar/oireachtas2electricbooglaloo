      <P>Could I ask the Leader of the House to clarify the position in relation to the Sugar Bill?  He said it is going to conclude Second Stage today.  Is the House going to rise at 4 p.m.?  Is there going to be a guillotine if there are still speakers offering?  We are talking about a two hour debate.  Could we have an indication of how long this debate will be allowed to go on, if there will be restrictions on speakers and, indeed, if all the speakers who are offering will be allowed to have their say on Second Stage today?</P>

      <P>In reply to the query raised by Senator Manning, I have to say that the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990, has upset our plans somewhat. As I have probably indicated in the past, we had hoped to take Committee Stage of that Bill before Easter.  What has happened, as of ten minutes ago, is that we have had 125 amendments from the Independents and the Labour Party.  The Government side have not yet put in their <Col N="127" /> amendments.  Neither have the Fine Gael Party.  In fact, what is happening is that with so many amendments obviously the Minister wants a little time to examine them.  He wants time to think, to analyse and to group them, if that is what is required.  We can now say that it will be after Easter before we have the Committee Stage of that Bill.  I pressed very strongly for that Bill to come to the House.  I am very pleased that it is of such great interest to Senators.</P>
      <P>On the query raised by Senator Upton, I said we hope to commence debate on the Sugar Bill at 2 p.m. and to conclude Second Stage today.  That could be 8 p.m., 9 p.m., 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. tonight.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to extend to members of the Judiciary and to specific court officers, namely, the Master of the High Court, taxing masters and county registrars, certain pension benefits which are already available to most other groups in the public service.  The Bill, which is broadly similar to one which was <Col N="128" /> introduced in 1984 but which lapsed with the dissolution of the 24th Dáil, would honour a commitment made by the Taoiseach of the day, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, to a member of the Judiciary who vacated office for the purpose of taking up a position with the European Communities. The commitment has since led to threats of legal action if not put in place.</P>
      <P>I propose to take each proposal in turn as it occurs in the Bill, set out the background and explain, as clearly as I can, its implications.  The first proposal appears in section 2.  The purpose of this section is to enable temporary service to reckon for pension purposes.  Temporary Circuit Court judges may be appointed under section 14 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936 and temporary District Court justices may be appointed under section 51 of the same Act.  As the House will be aware, the need for temporary judges and justices has arisen frequently over the years to meet unusual increases in the work and commitments of the Circuit and District Courts.  The section provides that a judge of the Supreme, High or Circuit Courts who has served as a temporary Circuit Court judge may have this service reckoned for pension purposes.  Similarly, a justice in the District Court who has service as a temporary justice may have such service reckoned for pension purposes.</P>
      <P>The principle of allowing temporary full-time service to count for pension purposes was conceded in the Civil Service as far back as 1967.  It was applied to other public sector groups in the 1970s.  I am satisfied that extension of the concession to members of the Judiciary is timely.</P>
      <P>The next proposal is in section 3 which would allow part of a year, rather than, as at present, full years only, count for pension purposes.  The principle of reckoning part years for pension purposes was one of a number conceded in the Civil Service under the conciliation and arbitration scheme in 1975.  Again, I suggest that extension of the principle to the Judiciary and court officers is not unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> I should like to emphasise that failure to reckon temporary service and part-years can result in serious short-changing. I should like to give one example, which is neither hypothetical nor unusual.  A member of the Judiciary retired with total service of 13 years and 362 days.  Temporary service which accounted for 115 days did not reckon for pension purposes and neither did the balance of 247 days because of the fact that full years only could be counted.  This meant that pensionable service was taken as 13 years only.  If temporary service and the other &ldquo;odd&rdquo; days had been allowed to reckon, the value of his pension would have been 7 per cent higher.  I suggest that it is quite inequitable to deprive any pensioner of such an amount on what can only be described as a technicality.</P>
    <P>Section 4 proposes to give power to the Minister for Finance to make regulations setting up a formal spouses' and children's pension scheme on the lines of the informal, voluntary scheme which has been operating on an adminstrative basis since 1969.  The scheme would be similar to that operating already for other public service groups.  It is a contributory scheme, the level of contributions having been established on an actuarial basis to make it self-financing.  Basically, the scheme provides that in the event of death in office of a contributor a pension becomes payable to the deceased's spouse and children based on the number of years service the deceased would have given had he survived to normal retirement age.  It also provides for payment of a pension on the death, subsequent to retirement, of a person who was a contributing member while in office.  A deduction is made from the lump sum of appropriate contributions for any notional years' service and for any years for which no contribution had been made during temporary service, for example. For all persons appointed to office subsequent to the making of the regulations membership will be compulsory.  Nothing out of the ordinary is proposed in this scheme and I am sure the House will see the merits of formalising it.</P>
    <P>I come now to sections 5 and 6 which <Col N="130" /> propose that the Minister for Finance may make regulations providing for preserved pension benefits for members of the Judiciary and certain court officers. This proposal gave rise to an amount of controversy when the 1984 Bill was published.  However, I am prepared to continue with this.</P>
    <P>Determination of retirement age is dealt with in section 6.  Normally benefits would be payable in no case earlier than at age 65.  In the case of Supreme and High Court judges the age could be anywhere between 65 and 72 and in the case of Circuit Court judges between 65 and 70.  The only exceptions would, as I have said, be in the case of death or permanent disability.</P>
    <P>Before leaving sections 5 and 6, I should draw attention to the proposal under which the Minister for Finance may make regulations to provide for the purchase, at full actuarial cost, of notional years' service for pension purposes. This proposal would enable persons who would qualify for a pension in the normal course, but who would not have the potential for enough service for a full pension by normal retiring age, to buy additional years of notional service to enhance their pension.  Purchase would be at full actuarial cost so that, overall, the proposal would not be an additional cost to the Exchequer.  The usual means of purchasing notional years is by periodic contributions from salary or by reduction from the retirement lump sum payment.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the laying of regulations, when made under sections 4 and 5 of this Act, before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Subsection (1) is confined to &ldquo;judicial&rdquo; regulations and in accordance with normal practice, does not provide for power of annulment.  The provisions at subsection (2), which will apply to &ldquo;court officer&rdquo; regulations, are the usual ones requiring that regulations be laid before each House of the Oireachtas for 21 sitting days during which they can be annulled by a resolution of either House.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 would have the effect <Col N="131" /> of abolishing the requirement for a minimum of five years' service to qualify for a death gratuity and so bring this group of people into line with the rest of the public service.  At present, judges and justices must, under section 2 of the Courts of Justice and Court Officers (Superannuation) Act, 1961, have served for at least five years before a death gratuity becomes payable.  The same rules applies to court officers under section 4 of the same Act.  By abolishing the minimum service requirement this section would contribute towards the alleviation of distress in the vent of the untimely death of a judge, justice or court officer.  The amount payable as death gratuity would, of course, continue to be equal to the yearly amount of the salary of the judge, justice or court officer at the time of his death.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for retrospection for various provisions in the Bill.  The dates chosen are related broadly to the dates on which similar changes were made for other public sector groups.</P>
    <P>These, then, are the changes to pension arrangements proposed in this Bill.  They are quite limited in extent and are in line with arrangements already in force for most other groups in the public sector. There are no changes in the broader provisions for pensions for the Judiciary and the specific court officers which are contained in the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961 and the Courts of Justice and Court Officers (Superannuation) Act, 1961.  Judges of the Supreme, High and Circuit Courts qualify for full pension after 15 years' service.  The pension amounts to a maximum of two-thirds of remuneration. However, pension is reduced to one-half remuneration for the purpose of providing for payment of a gratuity on retirement. District justices and court officers qualify for full pension after 20 years' service and the manner of calculating maximum pension, with and without a retirement gratuity, is otherwise the same as that for judges.  As I have said, no change is proposed in relation to these entitlements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="132" /> I regard the limited measures proposed in this Bill as fair and reasonable and, accordingly, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  On the last occasion he was here he was wearing his Communications hat.  There was, maybe, more heat than light at that time.  The atmosphere is cooler here this morning.  The Minister has shown himself to be a reforming Minister in an area which affords unlimited scope for reform &mdash; the whole area of prisons and the administration of justice and so forth.  He has also been very responsive to requests from members of my party who have come to him with individual cases.  That is much appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nub of the Bill is very simple.  The Minister has explained it in his speech, which, while delivered at some speed, nonetheless gives a clear indication of what is involved.  The purpose of the Bill is, as the Minister said, very simple.  It is to extend to members of the Judiciary and specific named court officers superannuation benefits which are already available to most other groups in the public service.  The central position, as I understand it, is that civil servants who leave voluntarily before normal retirement age have their pensions and superannuation rights deferred to normal retirement age.  There is statutory provision for this to enable those, for example, who go to serve in international bodies, or in the European Community, or, indeed, go to work elsewhere, to get their deferred pension rights at the normal retirement age.  We would all like to encourage the practice of mobility, and especially to encourage people in senior positions to move on in order to give them the opportunity in their own interest and in the interest of the country, to serve in international fora.  It is important that we make it possible for people to do this without damaging their pension rights.  Up to now, these rights did not apply to judges.  Under this Bill they will. There is nothing exceptional in that.  As the Minister said, it is a very limited <Col N="133" /> Bill which, in effect, is bringing certain categories within the normal ambit of what applies in the Civil Service.  The Bill is clear and straightforward in that.</P>
    <P>May I trespass very briefly on the opportunity this morning to impress on the Minister, while this is not specifically within the Bill, the urgency for major reforms within the whole administration of justice?  There has been much discussion in recent times, at various levels, among the professional bodies, the general public and politicians about the need to tackle the main sources of concern. These are the inordinate delays which occur so often, the archaic method of the administration of justice, and the cost. These, in particular, are the three main areas of concern.  There have been very many proposals put forward, for example, from my own party, for a court of civil appeal which would certainly help ease the number of appeals that can be taken by parties so that when there is the possibility of parties taking appeals to delay the conclusion of a case, these could be referred to a court of civil appeal which could sift through much of the work there.</P>
    <P>Likewise, there have been calls for more comprehensive pre-trial procedures, especially dealing with expert witnesses.</P>
    <P>A proposal was put forward by the Committee on Court Practices and Procedures, as far back as 1972, to extend the role of the Master of the High Court. There is a need for even further changes in the whole area of family law tribunals and for a consumer tribunal.</P>
    <P>These proposals are outside the scope of what we are dealing with, but I believe very strongly that a Minister for Justice who takes on, in a major and serious way, the whole question of the reform of the administration of justice in this country, will go down in history as one of the great Ministers for Justice.  I believe such a Minister will find a much more ready response today from the legal profession and from the judges themselves who are aware of some of the problems.  The Minister will certainly receive from the long suffering public a great deal of gratitude if <Col N="134" /> he could produce a White Paper covering these and other areas and begin in a serious way to amend the procedures for the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is a simple straightforward Bill.  It was explained clearly by the Minister and I have pleasure in supporting the Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speaker, I welcome the Minister to the House and I concur with the remarks of Senator Manning to the effect that this Minister, in his portfolio, has shown foresight and diligence.  Indeed, as mentioned by Senator Manning, he is a reforming Minister.  He should be complimented for this.  I also agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Manning to the effect that the whole situation in relation to the administration of justice is one where there is much scope for manoeuvre.  In complimenting the Minister on his excellent work to date, I would urge him to continue that work so that the public demand for more law reform can be met quickly.</P>
      <P>This legislation is, in effect, amending legislation which extends to members of the Judiciary and specific court officers, such as taxing masters, the same pension rights as apply to other members of the public service.  This is to be welcomed and is most desirable.  There was some pressure for court action to be taken to compel the Government to bring in this legislation arising out of a situation in the previous administration in 1984.</P>
      <P>As a member of the legal profession, I would like to welcome this amending legislation which allows the Minister for Finance, after due and proper consultation with the Minister for Justice, to make appropriate regulations.  This Bill will apply right across the board from district justices, to Circuit Court judges and to High Court judges.  It also includes certain other court officers, as already mentioned, such as taxing masters and county registrars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to point out that the concepts and principles contained in the Bill are not entirely new.  What is being done by this Bill is to amend, update and <Col N="135" /> modernise existing legislation.  The whole principle of the Bill is based on the 1961 Act &mdash; the Supplemental Provisions Act &mdash; which set out the premise of pensions for judges.  The legislation here merely updates that.  People might say that the costs involved are extreme.  This is not true.  The total cost in any given year is estimated at £100,000, which is not a huge sum of money.  I would also welcome the provisions of the Bill whereby temporary service of a judge in the Circuit or District Court can now be added on to permanent service and reckoned as pensionable service. This is a defect that did exist.  The Minister quoted an anomaly whereby in one given case a person could lose seven per cent of his pensionable income.  That clearly outlines the vacuum that existed.</P>
    <P>Sections 4, 5 and 6 allows the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Justice, to make certain regulations.  It concludes pension schemes for the spouses of children, judges and court officers.  This is desirable. It also includes provision for the payment and pension referred to if there is retirement sooner than normal retirement age in the event of permanent disability or otherwise.  I welcome that aspect.  Prior to this, if a district justice, a taxing master or a Circuit Court judge did not have the minimum five years' service they were placed at a severe disadvantage. This has now been deleted, and the provision updated.  There is a provision where a judge or court officer can purchase notional years' service at an actuarial cost value.  There would be no additional cost to the State.  It is an aspect that must be welcomed and appreciated.</P>
    <P>Justices from the District Court, judges, county registrars and taxing masters play a very important role.  Certainly, they must be treated in the same manner as other people in the public service.  In many instances, district justices who are appointed are going into situations less remunerative than if they stayed on in private practice.  This applies also to a High Court judge.  In many instances, eminent senior counsel are slow to accept appointments to the Bench on the basis <Col N="136" /> that there are more lucrative pickings in private practice.  Consequently, when people are appointed to these positions of great esteem and honour, they must be respected.  Anything that this legislation can do to improve their situation must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The position has been clearly outlined by the Minister.  Again, it is amending legislation.  The concept and principles involved are not entirely new.  It is something that was initiated in or around 1984, under the administration of Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  Due to the lapse of the 24th Dáil, this Bill was left on the back burner.  It has now been re-introduced. I would urge the Seanad to accept the provisions set out by the Minister so that this Bill would become law as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming to this House and for his excellent work in his portfolio.  Certainly he has performed extremely well in the Department of Justice. Now, with the shackles of the Department of Communications removed, I am quite sure we will see a lot of reforming legislation along the lines pointed out by Senator Manning.  It would be most welcome.  There is a quagmire out there.  There is a minefield where there is a need for much reform and new legislation.  Now that the two portfolios have been separated, the Minister can certainly concentrate on this need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to join in the remarks in relation to the Minister.  He has been approachable and courageous in the actions he has taken so far in the portfolios he has held.  The Department of Justice portfolio is a particularly difficult one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is basically similar to the one introduced in 1984, and which lapsed with the dissolution of the Dáil.  If anything, it is overdue.  It is a humane and necessary Bill.  I am pleased that the Minister has made allowance for spouses and children. The Minister is aware of one or two rather sad situations.  It is a very sensible Bill.  It also tackles the question of temporary service.  It was very much an anomaly that while this service should be recognised in <Col N="137" /> the Civil Service, members of the Judiciary fell outside the provisions of this principle, which the Minister and his predecessors have very rightly decided to follow.  It raises the whole question of temporary service.  It was once a feature of appointments.</P>
    <P>I can remember dispensary doctors in years gone by being appointed on a temporary basis and being seven, ten or 20 years in such a situation.  It has largely been cleared up now in relation to Civil Service and Government appointments, but there is an increasing tendency at the moment in private institutions and industry to appoint people on a temporary basis for, perhaps, 12 months, and renewable then perhaps for another 12 months, renewable for yet another 12 months.  The situation of such people can be severely compromised as regards pension rights.  Pension rights should relate to any service, any work that somebody is doing.  Provision should be made and those same pension rights should be transferable.  I am glad that in this Bill one particular anomaly in that respect is being covered.  I particularly welcome section 4.  There was already a voluntary scheme and an involuntary scheme, but it was high time that that was part of the full, formal scheme and that people coming into it would have compulsory membership in it.</P>
    <P>With regard to pensions generally, at a time when it is easy to do something about them very often it is the last thought in people's minds and then at a later stage, when it is much more difficult, perhaps they tend to turn their attention to them not only from a pension point of view but from the point of view of the implications for their wives or children.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have said and the Minister has shown already that he is very much a reforming Minister.  He has also shown, by his willingness to take on the communications portfolio and put a Bill through under very difficult circumstances, that he is capable of tackling necessary reform.  I think that is the difference between a legislator, a states-person and someone who is simply a <Col N="138" /> politician.  Full credit to the Minister for that.  But we do have in this country an extraordinarily complicated situation as regards law and indeed we must be very grateful in a number of ways to these people for whom we are passing this Bill today.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to criticise the Judiciary and the legal system but we are very fortunate in this country that we have a legal system upon which we can rely. There are relatively few countries in the world in which that is the situation.  We were talking yesterday about the relatively few countries in which there is democracy.  In very few countries is there a free, able, reliable and fair judicial system.  I think we have cause for pride in that regard but a great deal of reform is needed within the law.</P>
    <P>The Minister will remember the situation in relation to ground rent.  It seemed a very simple matter.  Yet, when we look into just one aspect of law, property law, we find we have to relate to the 1922 legislation in this country since we got our independence, legislation in the United Kingdom from 1800 until we got our independence, and then the preceding legislation, some of the books of which are alongside the approach to the Dáil Chamber. Legislation here relates to a written Constitution but in fact much of our law is on the principles which governed United Kingdom precedent.  We still take case precedents from the United Kingdom as well as precedents in our own courts and now, particularly important to us all, and I am sure the Minister is more than aware of this, there are the implications of European Community law which is often based on a totally different legal system, the mainland, Napoleonic, or whatever you like to call it, legal system, which is beginning to have effects of very considerable magnitude in this country.</P>
    <P>A Minister for Justice always has many difficulties.  His is a difficult, unpopular job.  It is one which I know this Minister will be looking at very carefully to see what reforms can be brought in and I am sure that, if he does, he will bring them in both with compassion, as shown in this Bill, and with vigour and thoroughness <Col N="139" /> as shown in his other work.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who have contributed to the debate and welcomed the Bill.  I would also like to thank them for their very generous comments in relation to my own performance and to touch on the main points that were mentioned by the Senators.  They were the need for reform within the justice area and in particular in the courts area, the need to make the courts more accessible to people and the need to tackle the problem of costs and delays and the need to bring legislation forward.</P>
      <P>I can tell Senator Manning and Senator Conroy that much work has been carried out in the Department on this.  Within the next couple of weeks I will be publishing a new Courts Bill which will increase the levels of jurisdiction of the District Court from £2,500 to £5,000 and of the Circuit Court from £15,000 to £30,000 and that will do much to speed up the procedures and the handling of cases and it will do much for the costs because obviously the costs in the District Court and the Circuit Court are a lot lower than they are in the High Court and the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>I am also committed to a Bill in relation to civil appeal because so many of the cases before the courts are civil type cases it is essential that we have a court of civil appeal.  I hope to introduce that before the end of the year.  I am also looking at the concept of a small claims court and how that would operate.  I am not 100 per cent sure yet in relation to that, so I do not want to make an overall commitment to it.  It is something I am examining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will also be publishing a new Solicitors' Bill before the summer and hopefully that will be very much on the lines of the Fair Trade Commission's report.  Much work had been done on a Solicitor's Bill prior to the publication of the report and I have now taken on board many of the points in the Fair Trade Commission's report.  There is a lot of work under way.  I fully accept that there is a lot more to be done.  I believe we can <Col N="140" /> improve the quality of the life of our citizens in a very special way in the justice area by increasing and improving the operations of our courts and increasing their efficiency.</P>
    <P>I take the opportunity here to echo what Senator Conroy said in relation to how fortunate we have been in this country in having such a Judiciary since our independence.  We are truly blessed as a nation in the quality of the men and women who have given up lucrative careers in private practice and were prepared to serve their country by taking on onerous appointments to the Bench from Supreme Court to District Court levels. We are very fortuante in that.  I believe they are entitled to recognition and protection for themselves and their families and that is included in this Bill.  That is vitally important.  It is a measure of reform.  It is not an earth-shattering one that will grab public attention, it is a small but very important piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>

    <Title>Sugar Bill, 1990: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important piece of legislation, the purpose of which is to enable Siúicre Éireann c.p.t. to be partially privatised. I am satisfied that this is the only way that the company can expand and develop commercially.  At the same time, the proposed legislation provides that the restructuring will be carried out in such a way that it will safeguard the continued existence of the Irish sugar industry, that <Col N="141" /> the Exchequer will receive a satisfactory return on its investment, and will ensure that beet growers and employees of the company can fully benefit from its growth.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been prepared following an in-depth examination of the future of the company.  Consultants were appointed by the Government early in 1989 to carry out a detailed study of the company and to report on any restructuring or other developments considered necessary to ensure its long term commercial viability and growth.  Following careful consideration of their report, the Government set up a small <i>ad hoc</i> group in September 1989 to examine all the options for the company's future. This group was representative of my Department, the Department of Finance, the Industrial Development Authority and Siúicre Éireann itself.  The group examined three options for the future of the company.</P>
      <P>Before commenting on these options, I would like to give you some details concerning Siúcre Éireann.  The company is, as of now, a public limited company with an issued share cpaital of £66 million comprising 65.5 million ordinary shares of £1 each and 0.5 million 6 per cent cumulative preference shares of £1 each.  The Minister for Finance holds all the ordinary shares save a small number of qualifying shares held by directors. The 0.5 million preference shares are held by various investors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Its main activity, accounting for almost 50 per cent of its turnover, is the processing and distribution of sugar.  It has almost 100 per cent of the market for sugar in the State, 70 per cent of the market in Northern Ireland and a small market for industrial sugar in Great Britain.  The company is also involved in the food sector and in the recent past has made a number of acquisitions in this area, the most significant of which was a 50 per cent share in Odlums Ltd. with options on the purchase of the remaining 50 per cent.  Agri-trading, with 24 per cent of turnover, is the principal other activity of the company, which is also involved in recently commenced joint <Col N="142" /> ventures with private companies, notably in Thurles.</P>
    <P>The company has reported net profits on ordinary activities since 1986 and had a record after-tax net profit on ordinary activities of £18.2 million in the year ending 30 September 1990 compared with £15.4 million in 1989.  Extraordinary charges of £5.9 million reduced the retained profit in 1990 to £12.3 million. During the period of recovery, profits were applied in reduction of borrowings and large accumulated losses which had been incurred prior to 1986.</P>
    <P>Turnover in the year ending September 1990 was £271 million, made up as follows: Sugar Division, £133 million; Food Division, £74 million; Agri-Trading Division, £64 million.  The turnover consisted largely of Irish sales with only £46 million accounted for by sales outside the State.</P>
    <P>In the year to 30 September 1990 the company employed 1,757 people compared to 1,556 in the previous year.  This increase, the first in many years, was essentially as a result of acquisitions during the year.  I am happy to report that at the end of 1990, 187 new jobs had been created in the joint venture replacement industries in Thurles and the target of 384 for the end of 1992 is very clearly realisable.  I am glad to say, as regards the old Tuam sugar factory site, planning permission has been sought for the building of a 20,000 sq. ft. advance IDA factory which will bring a new industry to the area.  The Sugar Company will contribute to the cost of this factory in the context of its commitment to the establishment of new industries in the area of following the closure of the sugar factory there.</P>
    <P>The improved results have been achieved as a result of restructuring in the company and by diversification. However, apart from the excellent work of the board, management and staff, a major factor in turning the company around was the significant capital investment by the Exchequer, amounting to £59 million between 1982 and 1987.  This brought the total Exchequer equity holding up to £65.5 million.  There has been and continues to be a considerable cost <Col N="143" /> to the State arising from the provision and servicing of these funds.  No dividend has been paid because of the legal ban on any such payment until accumulated losses have been cleared.  In addition, because of protracted loss-making, the company has paid little corporation tax.</P>
    <P>Following flotation, the State will at last obtain some return for its investment. This will be achieved both through sale of shares and the payment of dividends on the residual Exchequer shareholding.</P>
    <P>I would now like to return to the different options considered by the <i>ad hoc</i> group.  The first option was to continue the present activities and structures of the company.  On the basis of the company's excellent performance in recent years, it is expected to continue to operate profitably in the medium term.  The shareholder could expect a reasonable dividend this year and for some period thereafter.  However, this is not really an option as the long term growth and expansion of the company would not be ensured.  The need for the company to diversify and expand its base is highlighted by possible future changes in the Community sugar regime, the outcome of the GATT negotiations and the fact that in European terms the company is a moderately-sized player in a market tending to be dominated by the large.</P>
    <P>The second option &mdash; total privatisation of the company &mdash; was not considered as suitable.  It could ensure that the Government would realise a short term Exchequer benefit on its investment in Siúicre Éireann.  The company would, however, be particularly attractive to other EC companies which would anticipate maximising economies of scale and/or rationalisation.  A sale on that basis could have particularly negative effects on employment and on the future of beet growing in Ireland.  In addition, there would be no guarantee that any of the profits from future sugar operations would be invested in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of the company on the basis of partial privatisation and commercial development while retaining <Col N="144" /> a degree of control over its sugar operations and the sugar quota was the final option examined by the group.  They chose this option as the best one for the future of the company.  They took the view that the company's commercial development should be undertaken largely by means of acquisition and/or joint venture so as to minimise the risk for Siúicre Éireann.  However, they recognised that while the development of the company cannot be solely financed from internal resources or by borrowing, the Exchequer should not be required to provide additional equity capital for development purposes.  Such equity should be raised by the issue of new shares on the stock market following flotation.</P>
    <P>The Government, while recognising that partial privatisation would represent a fundamental change in the status of the company, accepted the group's recommendation. They considered that the conditions which originally existed and justified exclusive State control, no longer apply.  Already Siúicre Éireann is in the top flight of agri-business entities operating within the State.  I am confident that following partial privatisation, it has the requisite ability to meet the demands of investors and as a result of access to market funding will develop in time into a very substantial food company.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the employees and the suppliers of raw materials to the company, in particular the beet growers, will be anxious to ascertain if the flotation will have significant implications for them. Neither group has anything to fear.  On the contrary, the overall strengthening of the financial base of the company which will ensue can only be to their advantage. Indeed, it is the Government's intention that beet growers and employees will be asked to subscribe for shares in the new holding company and this is, I believe, an imporant development. These groups, as shareholders, will have an active interest in the company and benefit from its development by way of expected dividends and capital appreciation of their holdings.</P>
    <P>Concern had been expressed regarding <Col N="145" /> the rights of employees following flotation.  The position is that workers' interests are protected under the European Communities (Safeguarding of Employees' Rights on Transfer of Undertaking) Regulations, 1980.  However, in order to further re-assure workers on this point the Minister for Agriculture and Food has inserted, by way of amendment on Committee Stage in the Dáil, section 6 in the Sugar Bill, 1990, which underlines the rights of employees.  This specifically provides that the rights which employees of Siúicre Éireann, or its subsidiaries, hold before the date on which the Minister for Finance transfers his shares in Siúicre Éireann to the new holding company will continue to be held by them on that transfer date.  Provision has also been made to ensure that employees will not suffer any less favourable terms under their pension or superannuation schemes on that transfer date.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am pleased to see that a Siúicre Éireann/Union agreement has been drawn up and lodged with the Labour Relations Commission and registered with the Labour Court.  This agreement relates, <i>inter alia</i>, to employees' conditions, pay, continuity of employment, recognition of trade unions and continuation of existing procedures.  I fully endorse the contents of this agreement which I have no doubt will constitute the major protection for the rights of employees.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the particular provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 is the standard definitions section and requires no specific comment.  Section 2 allows the Minister for Finance to exchange his shares in Siúicre Éireann for shares in the new holding company, which will be called &ldquo;Greencore plc&rdquo;.  It also enables the Minister for Finance to acquire further shares in the holding company with the required funds being advanced from the Central Fund.  He may also, following consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Food sell or dispose of shares in the holding company as he sees fit. Funds received in respect of share sales and dividends must be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="146" /> This section also allows the Minister for Agriculture and Food to acquire a special share, which he may not dispose of, in the holding company.  This share is analogous to the &ldquo;Golden Share&rdquo; issued in privatisations in other European countries in recent years, notably in the UK and France.  The purpose of the special share is to ensure that the State can effectively exercise certain specified control over the sugar operations of the company while reducing its own shareholding below 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>The special share is designed principally to ensure that none of the following events can arise without the prior consent in writing of the special shareholder: any change in certain specified articles in the articles of association of the company; the winding up of the company, the sale of more than 49 per cent of Siúicre Éireann which, following the Stock Exchange flotation, will be a subsidiary of the holding company; the disposal of specified sugar assets including the Irish sugar quota held by Siúicre Éireann; the creation of a new class of shares in the company; the building up by one shareholder or a consortium of shareholders, other than the Minister for Finance, or more than a 15 per cent shareholding in the company after flotation. These points are dealt with in some detail in the Articles of Association of the holding company.</P>
    <P>I should mention at this stage that it is the intention of the Government that the Minister for Finance will only dispose of sufficient shares on flotation to bring his holding down to 45 per cent.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the special share is a device to (i) prevent the disposal of the controlling interest in Siúicre Éireann or the sugar assets; and (ii) prevent a shareholder or group of shareholders acting together from gaining control of the holding company.</P>
    <P>I should add that it was as a result of discussions with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and representatives of the beet growers, that I specifically included in the Bill a provision that the special share, which I have already referred to, may not be sold.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> A further provision in section 2 which I should mention is that enabling the Minister for Finance following consultations with the Minister for Agriculture and Food to sell or dispose of his shares to such specified persons and on such terms and conditions as he may prescribe by regulation.  The intention of this section is to facilitate the sale of shares to employees and beet growers &mdash; the Minister for Finance will dispose of some of his shareholding to these groups.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that the two ministerial shareholders may exercise, including by attorney or proxy where applicable, all their rights attaching to their shares in the holding company.  Section 4 deals with the allotment of shares and empowers the two ministerial shareholders to appoint nominees and to transfer shares to such nominees to act on their behalf.  It sets out the rights and duties of nominees and the power of the Minister to issue directions.  Section 5 grants relief from stamp duty on any agreement, transfer, conveyance, assignment or lease whereby any business, assets or liabilities of Siúicre Éireann, or shares held in or by it, are transferred to the holding company.  This relief is a common feature of group reconstructions.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that the rights &mdash; including pension rights &mdash; of employees of Siúicre Éireann or its subsidiaries enjoyed by those employees before the transfer date will continue to be enjoyed by them on that transfer date.  Section 7 provides for the repeal of the Sugar Manufacture Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is a standard provision relating to any expenses arising under the Act. Section 9 is another standard provision and deals with the laying of regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The section provides that regulations made under the Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they are made and may be annulled by either House within 21 sitting days.  Section 10 contains the usual citation and commencement provisions. The Act will come into operation on such <Col N="148" /> day or days as the Minister for Finance may determine following consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>As I stated at the beginning, this is a very significant legislative measure which will be welcomed by all of us who wish to see the development of a major, Irish-based food company, which will be able to compete and expand in the European Single Market.  I will be happy to respond to any particular queries in my reply to the debate.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I begin by welcoming this Bill.  For too long in this country we have had too much socialism on the one hand, too much capitalism on the other hand, and not enough realism. Realism is beginning to set in, and it is a good thing too.  Fortunately, one of the latest converts to realism is the Taoiseach. This Bill is a far cry from the stance which he took about four or five years ago when he was Leader of the Opposition and when he was opposed to any form of privatisation.  It is a pity he is so late coming around to it because we lost a lot of time, wasted a lot of money and opportunities went abegging.  I refer to his stance, which was expressed in a letter to Peter Cassells back in 1987, on 20 January 1987.  In it he says:</P>
      <P>As you will be well aware, the record of Fianna Fáil, whether in Government or Opposition, has been one of consistent support&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It had already been quoted in the debate in the other House. I will quote from the letter, if I may start again without interruption:</P>
      <P>As you will be well aware, the record of Fianna Fáil, whether in Government or Opposition, has been one of consistent support for our state bodies, most of which were created under Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
      <P>I have on many occasions made my views known on privatisation.  For example, in the Adjournment debate of 14 December 1984, I stated: &ldquo;To close down, sell off or devalue a State company seems to have been turned to by the economists and other spokesmen of the New Right as a demonstration of political virility... If this process of dismantling the State sector is brought much further, the Government [the former Coalition Government] will get to the point of dismantling the State itself&rdquo;.  But I can assure you that Fianna Fáil have no intention of privatising established State bodies...</P>
      <P>I welcome the change but it is a bit late in the day and opportunities have been lost.  The company should and could be much further down the road now and we could have been selling at a better time; but better late then never.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was necessary to do something about this company.  It was losing money heavily up to the mid-eighties.  I played my own part in suggesting at an early stage, at a talk in Salthill, Galway, that the Tuam factory should be closed.  My argument then was roundly denounced by the Deputies and Senators present, and indeed almost every other politician <Col N="150" /> west of the Shannon.  My argument was simple.  We either would have fewer beet factories or no beet factory.  The message eventually got to the politicians who were against it and Tuam was eventually closed.</P>
    <P>The Government changed and there was a question of two factories rather than three factories.  The present Minister for Agriculture was not the slightest bit interested in it; in fact, he was quite unhappy about that suggestion.  In his literature distributed before the 1987 election he made it quite clear where he stood on the issue.  The document which he circulated talked of the Government closing Thurles and of Fianna Fáil development for the Sugar Company.  It went on to state that the Coalition Government &mdash; the Coalition Government of that time under the then Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald &mdash; and the board of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann talked of closing down the Thurles sugar factory.  The document urges people to change the Government so that Fianna Fáil could change the board.  In the meantime the document states: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil will insist that the present board review their so-called two factory plan&rdquo;.  Whatever about changing the board, fortunately the chairman and the chief executive were not changed.  The plan went on and fortunately the Taoiseach &mdash; who is, as I said, a recent convert to fiscal rectitude and good management &mdash; disagreed with the Minister for Agriculture. We now have two factories instead of three and we now have turned the State-owned company from a heavy loss maker to a situation last year where it had a significant profit.</P>
    <P>One might well ask the question, if it is now so healthy why are we privatising it?  It is necessary, facing into 1992, for the company to expand its base and to prepare itself for the competition after 1992.  It is only right that taxpayers should not be expected to put up that money. When the company was in serious trouble the taxpayers already contributed £59 million in equity, which actually took the company out of that serious trouble.  I would not agree we should have gone <Col N="151" /> back, as many people said to the taxpayers expecting them to cough up again to prepare the company to do better things, to expand its operations and to prepare for 1992.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this plan of privatisation &mdash; the Government do not like to call it privatisation, but it is privatisation &mdash; was brought forward.  I agree with it.  It will enable the company to make the acquisitions it wants to make and to make the modernisation it wants to make.  I have every confidence that under the present chairman and chief executive it will be a first rate company because their performance since they took over in the mid-eighties has been first class.</P>
    <P>I am particularly happy to note that in the Bill there is provision for workers and farmers to become shareholders and, above all, I am happy that an amicable agreement was reached between the workers and the company and that the Labour Relations Commission was involved in it also.  In that document the agreement provides for no interruption in continuity of employment.  Current rates of pay and conditions of employment will continue to apply.  The company will continue to recognise the existing trade unions and existing procedures for determining rates of pay and conditions of employment will continue to apply.  The current redundancy terms being paid by the company are those which emanated from the 1981 conciliation conferences. The company acknowledges that this is the current position and it has no plans to change these terms.  Privatisation will not give rise to changes in continuity of employment in subsidiary companies or to existing procedures for determining rates of pay or conditions of employment in those companies.</P>
    <P>The final paragraph states:</P>
    <P>Within 30 days of vesting day, moneys to be transferred into the manual pension scheme to cover pre-1984 pensions are determined by the scheme's actuary.  Pre-1984 service in the manual scheme will be funded on a phased basis over a five year period <Col N="152" /> from 1981 in accordance with the advice of the scheme's actuary.  This agreement will be registered with the Labour Court under section 27 of the 1946 Industrial Relations Act.</P>
    <P>I am very happy about that amicable agreement that was reached with the workers and I am even more happy that, in addition to that, there is provision for having workers participation in the shareholding of the company.  I was sorry, therefore, to read in the Dáil Official Report such vehement opposition from certain sections of the Left towards this Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the shareholding &mdash; I want to say something later on about workers' representation on the board &mdash; it is very fortunate that the company decided to allow £250 worth of shares without payment per worker.  Had that not been there, workers might be reluctant to get involved in shareholding; but that is a temptation for them and I hope they will invest some of their own money also.  Unfortunately, there will be some income tax consequences as the receipt of shares will be classified as an emolument of employment.  That matter will have to be taken up with the Revenue Commissioners.  It is not a fault in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I regret that there will be taxation consequences for the workers arising from the £250 worth of shares.  In addition to the gift of £250 worth of shares there will be discounted shares.  Four per cent of current shares will be reserved for workers and a number of shares will also be provisionally reserved at approximately 20 per cent discount on the full price.  This is a progressive step.  It has long been my ambition to see companies &mdash; some of them like Kerry Co-op have already gone down that road &mdash; encouraging their workers to invest in the company and participate in the profits.  There is also a scheme for farmers to invest.  I should add that in addition to the discount on the shares the company has, as the Minister said, a holding company, Greencore, which will introduce a financing scheme to offer loans to <Col N="153" /> workers who wish to purchase shares in the company.</P>
    <P>For farmers, things are not quite as generous and I suppose that is only right. There is no gift of £250 per head but for qualifying beet growers there is a provision for 20 per cent discount on shares. A certain proportion of shares are set aside for that and they can avail of excess shares also.  This will provide for the interests of growers and workers as well as other shareholders in the company. It is a progressive step which I highly commend.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that the Government or the Minister for Finance will hold a 45 per cent golden share and this will help to protect our national sugar quota. That is only right because we could well have a raider like the Giardini di Ferucci organisation, the biggest manufacturer of sugar in the Community.  He is looking for quotas and could buy out our company, take the quota out of the country and manufacture the sugar elsewhere.  I am not a legal eagle but I am sure some legal eagles will try to find a loophole in that clause in years to come.  I sincerely hope they will not be able to find a way around the golden share and take the quota away from us.</P>
    <P>With regard to worker representation on the board, I am not exactly sure how that is going to work out.  Provision is being made for some kind of representation. The workers would like to put one of their own members on the board.  That is admirable in its own way but one can imagine the tremendous pressure a worker on the board would be under from his colleagues in the work-place. It might be more prudent to have workers represented by some member of the professional staff in their trade union who would not only have more experience of dealing with these matters but also would be less subject to pressure from working colleagues.</P>
    <P>I gather there is great urgency about getting this Bill through to allow the matter to go to the share market in April. I reiterate how pleased I am that the Government have changed their mind on these issues, have come forward with this <Col N="154" /> progressive idea and have brought this Bill forward quickly.  I look forward to its speedy passage through this House.  I wish the new company every success and, above all, I hope that workers continue to increase their shares in the company and, hopefully, their profits.  I wish this Bill well.  We will be supporting it on this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Raftery, I welcome the Bill.  Regardless of whether the Government have changed their mind on privatisation, it is important now in view of the circumstances obtaining that this line of action be taken.  We all know that Governments change their minds from time to time and they have every right to do so because they are the people who are in charge and they have to make up their minds according to the conditions prevailing at the time.</P>
      <P>This Bill will remove the exclusive State control of the company and will allow them develop in a way which will be most beneficial to themselves, the State, the employees and suppliers.  It is being done in a way that will guard the sugar industry and, at the same time, give a reasonable return to the State on its investment.</P>
      <P>The Sugar Company have made a major contribution to the economic life of this country and have been a major source of employment particularly where their factories were located.  The value of sugar extracted from beet amounted to £6.5 million last year and 1,757 people are employed in the company.  Some 187 new jobs were created in 1990 and the target for 1992 is 384.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company have been making progress in recent years.  The improved financial position has been brought about by the significant capital investment by the Exchequer and by the good work of the board, the management and the staff. Since 1982 a considerable amount of money has been invested in the company. In 1982 £30 million was invested, in 1983, £20 million and in 1987, £9 million.  This was a major injection which brought the total equity holding up to £65.5 million, a considerable sum.  Profits for the year <Col N="155" /> ending 30 September 1990 amounted to £26.7 million compared to £21.1 million the previous year.  One can see that much good work has been done.</P>
    <P>I remember some years ago being in very close contact with the Sugar Company because of the situation in Tuam. Senator Raftery referred to this in his opening remarks.</P>
    <P>Every year we approached the Sugar Company to try to save the factory in Tuam and we were told that the factory was costing the Sugar Company about £4 million every year.  They said they were losing money and could not afford to maintain that factory there.  It is great to see that at last they have got their act together and are making a profit.  Projections for the next couple of years show an increase in employment in the region of 384.  That is very good.</P>
    <P>When the factories were built many years ago in the Lemass era things were very different from what they are today. Factories were located in poor areas, not just for economic reasons but, especially in the case of Tuam, for social reasons as well.  They did a very good job.  Tuam's association with the Sugar Company has been a rather sad one because it started off with great hope and provided a valuable source of income for many small farmers in the western region, in the late thirties, forties and fifties and right up to the eighties when it closed down.  I have memories &mdash; not very happy ones because it was not a very nice job &mdash; of thinning beet after coming home from school, with my brothers and sisters.  That was common in rural Ireland at that time and in the Tuam area because machinery was scarce and the work had to be done by hand.  The factory gave great encouragement and support to all the small farmers in that area and it gave valuable employment.  There was a time when it employed 700 people.  In the harvest season it provided part-time employment to local small farmers who were beet growers and who got seasonal work in the factory.  That was great for them and for business people because there was <Col N="156" /> quite a substantial amount of money in circulation.</P>
    <P>However, things started to go wrong and it is hard to know where to lay the blame.  There was great support for the factory.  Farmers stopped growing beet and the acreage started to fall.  That sounded the death-knell of the factory. At that time also Gowla Farm was very much in focus.  Grass meal was produced there and it was one of the first in the country.  It gave employment as well. That ceased just when feeding meal to cattle was coming more into play.  If that had been maintained, maybe there would have been a future for it.  I believe it went at the wrong time and along with it went jobs.</P>
    <P>The factory closed in Tuam and with it went the hopes and aspirations of people. Nothing has replaced it and this is sad as far as I and the people of that area are concerned.  Not one extra job has been created in that area since.  The Sugar Company gave commitments to Tuam. They promised to invest £2 million in Tuam to replace the factory.  They are involved in the building of a 20,000 sq. ft. advance factory and I hope that will encourage some industry to set up there. I hope the Sugar Company will honour their commitment and pay the balance of the £2 million.  It is badly needed at present.  However, the advance factory is not the total answer as it will be rather difficult to get industry to locate there.</P>
    <P>The same happened in Thurles although they fared better than Tuam. They did not have the same social problems. They got a replacement industry and were not as badly affected as Tuam.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the turnover of the Sugar Company.  In 1990, it was £271 million.  The sugar division was worth £133 million; the fruit division, £74 million; the agri-trading division, £64 million; and £46.6 million for sales outside the State.  I hope the new company will improve on this.</P>
    <P>The interests of the growers and workers are also very important.  Concern has been expressed about the rights of the employees following the flotation.  The workers have every right to feel uneasy <Col N="157" /> but the guarantees given by the Minister will look after the interests of the workers. The workers' interests are protected under the European Community (Safeguarding of Employees' Rights on Transfer of Undertaking) Regulations, 1990.  The Minister has strengthened that further and has reassured the workers on this point by inserting, by way of amendment on Committee Stage in the Dáil, section 6 which underlines the rights of employees.  This is very important.</P>
    <P>Employees cannot be blamed for looking for guarantees.  This section specifically provides that the rights which employees of Siúicre Éireann or its subsidiaries held before the date on which the Minister for Finance transfers his shares in Siúicre Éireann to the new holding company will continue to be held by them on that transfer date.  Provision has also been made to ensure that employees will not suffer any less favourable terms under their pension or superannuation scheme on that transfer date.  That is a very important guarantee and it should ease the worries of employees.</P>
    <P>The golden share is very important. The special share is really a device to prevent the disposal of the controlling interest in Siúicre Éireann or the sugar assets and prevent a shareholder or group of shareholders acting together gaining control of the holding company.  It is important that the Minister still has control and, although the company is being privatised, he still has a say in the disposal of shares and so on.</P>
    <P>By and large, the fears expressed by the growers, workers and the members of the board are taken care of in the Bill.  I am very happy with it.  I hope this company which has done so much to improve the living standards of people in rural Ireland will develop still further under this Bill.  There is a market to be exploited.  I am sure the company will diversify into the production of vegetables and so on.  I wish them every success in this new venture.  It is great to see that after all the years of bad debts, they are now getting their act together and can look forward to the future with <Col N="158" /> confidence in their ability to gain new markets and create further jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally, I would be instinctively in favour of a measure of this sort for reasons which, if I am honest, would be ideological rather than practical. This Bill and the way it is being approached by the Government are abso-lutelly unacceptable.  What is behind this Bill is confused thinking, camouflage, obfuscation and a lack of information which is an insult to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister's speech, as often happens, bears a very close relationship to the speech made on Second Stage in the Dáil by the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, and is only distinguished by the lack of information it gives about the privatisation of Irish Sugar.  The vital questions are not answered in the Minister's speech and were not answered in the other House. The most important question about the privatisation of Irish Sugar is how much is it worth?  How much do the Exchequer expect to get from the privatisation and how much is acceptable to the Exchequer? Nowhere is that mentioned and no indication of price was given in the Minister's speech.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not give one convincing reason why Irish Sugar should be privatised.  The problem that the Government have on this issue is that their commitment to privatisation is purely piecemeal.  Fianna Fáil have always had ideological difficulties because they have no ideology.  Their problem is that a few years ago they set their face against privatisation and now, in Government, they are in favour of selective privatisation. The party are not ideologically committed to privatisation.  The party, as on so many other issues, are pragmatically committed to privatisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Government are doing is disreputable. They are picking out one or two companies and deciding to sell them. There are not very many companies that can float on the stock market.  Irish Sugar is one of them and Irish Life is undoubtedly another.  There were efforts in the <Col N="159" /> recent past to sell ICC.  They were totally unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>We have never been given a good reason why these companies are being prepared for privatisation and why others are not.  The reason is quite simple &mdash; it is totally opportunist &mdash; they are selling whatever companies they can sell and the rest of the semi-State sector can stew.  It would have been far more honest and acceptable if, after six months in Government, they came forward and said they had changed their minds about privatisation and would prepare the semi-State sector for privatisation because they believe it was an acceptable policy.</P>
    <P>There are very few companies which are suitable for privatisation and for which they can raise the money on the market.  They have decided to put their hands in the semi-State till and run with whatever money they can get.  It is unacceptable that we have not been given any estimate of the company's worth.  Will they say they are selling it at the market price regardless of what it is worth?  They are very lucky, and it is not to the credit of the Government, that the stock market has taken off since 25 January and they will get more money.  It was quite obvious that this Bill would go through willy-nilly regardless of that.  If the stock market had not taken off the company would have been sold at a knock-down price. The same would have applied to Irish Life.  That is not an acceptable privatisation policy.  It is piecemeal, opportunistic and not in the interests of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>We have a real problem here.  What is in the interests of the taxpayer is not in the interests of the Government.  It is in the short term interest of this Government to get as much money as possible into the coffers.  Taxpayers will suffer if Irish Life or Irish Sugar are sold at a knock-down price but the taxpayer does not know that and certainly the taxpayer does not know what the company is worth.  It is unacceptable for the Minister to ask us to support a measure of this kind without giving that sort of detail. There is no strategic privatisation policy. <Col N="160" /> No indication has been given of what other companies will be privatised.  No preparation has been made for privatisation in the semi-State sector unlike the UK.  For those reasons I do not intend supporting this Bill, although in normal circumstances I might be in favour of doing so.  It is insulting to the House to produce such a Bill without this detail.</P>
    <P>We do not know what will be done with the money after privatisation.  Different signals have been given to us by the Government.  It is not good enough to pass this Bill when we do not know how much we will get or what we will do with it.  The Minister did not outline any long term strategy nor did he say why the Government changed their minds on privatisation in the time between being the Opposition and being in Government. What extraordinary event happened that brought about this conversion to what are Thatcherite economics or Reganomics, as they were known?  Did the Government change their ideology in terms of privatisation?  If they did, well and good, but let us hear that they have decided that privatisation is an economical and profitable way of earning money.</P>
    <P>Do the Government believe that privatised companies are more efficient?  Do they believe that privatised companies give more employment or less employment? There are varying views on that and they are not the traditional ones.  Is it simply &mdash; I lean towards this point of view &mdash; that privatisation became an acceptable fashionable fad in the western world sometime between 1981 and 1988 and while Fianna Fáil in Opposition did not believe in it when they took office they saw it as a very useful form of revenue? Did they decide that since it had become fashionable and trendy they could do it and would not have to take too much political flak because it was done throughout Europe, in the United States and, in particular, in the United Kingdom?</P>
    <P>I do not think the Government went through any of those thought processes. In fact, I do not think they went through any thought processes at all.  It is quite simple.  They saw one or two valuable <Col N="161" /> companies in the semi-State sector and they simply decided to sell them in order to raise as much money as possible, as quickly as possible and put in their own coffers.  That is the unfortunate reality of what is happening today.  It is not an ideological commitment to privatisation because if it were the rest of the semi-State sector would be preparing, as was the case in the UK, for privatisation. Unprofitable companies would be turned into profitable companies by the Government. There is no indication of such a strategy.  There is simply an indication that they want to sell off whatever good companies they have.</P>
    <P>I think it is appropriate, having mentioned that, to ask the Minister's view of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Semi-State Bodies.  I have been a member of that body for some years and it seems absurd that the Government did not ask that body to do a report on Irish Sugar and Irish Life and to suggest the preparation that should be made for privatisation and whether privatisation would be appropriate in these cases.  It should then have considered that report and we would have had a full Dáil and Seanad debate on it.  That committee has been sitting for many years, reporting regularly on semi-State companies, including Irish Life and not a single report, to my memory, has ever been debated in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many of the recommendations of that committee have been adopted by the companies concerned but I suggest they are very few.  The reality is that the semi-State sector is a neglected sector which stumbles along on its own until it needs rescuing by the Government or is eventually privatised if it is making money.  A serious strategy is necessary for that sector, a strategy which would indicate the Government's commitment and ideological belief regarding that sector.</P>
    <P>The Government may believe that wider share ownership, for instance, is of great benefit to the companies, and this was one of the great Thatcherite reasons for wholesale privatisation in the United <Col N="162" /> Kingdom.  It is not a belief which I share but I would like to know whether the Government share it.  If so, let them say so; if they believe that wider share ownership is a good reason for privatisation, let them say so.  It is insulting to have a Bill of this sort put before us without good reasons.  What is happening within the semi-State sector in these two cases of privatisation is of historic interest.  It makes one suspicious that no good reasons exist for this proposal, but that it is motivated by bad reasons connected with Government opportunism.</P>
    <P>Maybe what the Minister could consider as a result of this debate is that more issues of this sort might be referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies or the Minister should consider abolishing that committee which takes up an enormous amount of the time of Members of this House and of the other House; it presumably costs the State a lot of money and nobody appears to take any notice of its reports.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about the golden share.  I think what we have to realise about this privatisation proposal is that it is not a case for wholesale privatisation at all.  This is a sort of half-way house.  What the Minister is introducing is what he calls partial privatisation which only indicates his lack of commitment to the ideology in question and reveals halfheartedness and lack of conviction.  The Minister wants to have it both ways by retaining the golden share; he wants to present Irish Sugar as a fully privatised company competing on the stock market with other companies for investors funds while he retains 45 per cent initially, together with such extraordinary powers that the company will trade with its hands behind its back.</P>
    <P>Irish Sugar will not be competing in the market place either domestically or internationally on equal terms with other companies or on a level playing field because the golden share retention, despite the protection it gives to employees, will restrict the company's freedom of movement and freedom to trade.  It restricts the company's right to dispose of certain specified assests.  It <Col N="163" /> obviously protects the sugar quota but it inflicts very serious restrictions on shareholding. It means that nobody can buy more than a 49 per cent shareholding which will obviously prevent a takeover, but it also restricts a holding of 15 per cent or more.  What this is going to do is ensure that the price this company gets in the market is going to be a lot lower than it would otherwise have been.  It is difficult to estimate what this company is worth because many factors go into that particular equation.</P>
    <P>The golden share will guarantee a heavy discount on the market for this company.  It should be noted by the Minister that the golden share measure was discarded in the UK as not being to the benefit of the launch of a company flotation. Irish Sugar may be the first of many privatisations; we do not know how many, as the Minister has given us no information on it.  It is coming before the privatisation of Irish Life so it is probably going to go cheaply to ensure that the bigger Irish Life flotation will be more successful in raising money for the Government.  As a result of this, and as a result of the golden share factor, I suggest that Irish Sugar is going to go for a song, and for much less than it ought to go.  What the Minister ought to have done, and I hope he will do so on Committee Stage, is to have given us a clear indication of the pricing policy and the detailed method of flotation which he intends using when this company comes on the market.</P>
    <P>There is a real danger that Irish Sugar will be sold at a knock-down price unless a commitment is made by the Government to a minimum value.  They are very keen that it should be attractive to institutions who will also then be well conditioned towards Irish privatisation but these institutions are very sophisticated investors who will not be interested in paying above the odds for a company which is only semi-privatised and in which the Minister retains a golden share.</P>
    <P>There is other information to which this House is fully entitled which has not <Col N="164" /> been given by the Minister.  Neither was this information given in the Dáil.  We are entitled to know the sort of transaction costs we can expect on this flotation. We are entitled to know what advisers and legal fees will amount to, together with merchant bank fees, stock brokers' fees and consultants fees.  How many people are being employed to advise the Government on this issue? These fees will comprise a very heavy percentage of the actual flotation price. In Britain Mr. Paul Sweeney, who wrote a book on privatisation entitled <i>The Politics of Public Enterprise and Privatisation</i> estimated that out of £30 billion raised from privatisation £8 billion has already been given away through bad pricing policy, high launching fees and high transaction costs.  It is very possible that we will make an awful mess of the launch of this company to the detriment of the taxpayer because we have been given no information as to how it is going to be done.</P>
    <P>If pricing policy is wrong we will see a sensational rise in the share price on day one.  That will be wonderful for those who invest in this company and we have seen varying degrees of premium for investors in the United Kingdom, ranging up to 78 per cent in some cases within a few days.  That is wonderful for the few people who get shares in an oversubscribed flotation but it is very expensive for the taxpayer.  Even this week the flotation of a company on the British market ended the first day with a premium of 36 per cent.  That is an appalling reflection on the pricing policy of the Government's advisers there and I hope the Minister can reassure us that the Government here are taking measures to see that a substantial premium is not given on day one.  If it is he will be happy because he will take his money and run; the investors will be happy but the taxpayer will have been robbed of a large amount of money &mdash; maybe up to 25 per cent of what the company is worth &mdash; and will not know it.</P>
    <P>This Bill is unacceptable because of the lack of strategy on the semi-State sector, the lack of Government commitment to <Col N="165" /> privatisation, the lack of information on what price is acceptable and on where the money is going.  I would like to know if the Government are ideologically committed to privatisation and whether they believe now that it is a good thing for industry as a whole to be privatised.  They did not believe this pre-1987.  I would like to hear the plans for the future of the semi-State sector and to know what companies are being prepared for privatisation. I would like to see what calculation the Government have made on this issue and in particular on Irish Sugar regarding the benefits sacrificed on the future flow of dividends against the capital it is going to receive from this flotation.  I do not believe any of those calculations have been made because if they had we would be entitled to hear them from the Government.  Instead, we get a generally insulting speech from the Minister because of its lack of commitment and lack of information.</P>
    <P>On the employment issue, I would like to know the Government's view about privatisation.  Do they believe that privatisation tends to reduce employment or to increase it, because I would suggest that Mr. Sweeney fairly conclusively proves in his book that privatised companies and public centre enterprises defy conventional wisdom on this issue.  In Britain the number of jobs in public centre enterprises from 1979 to 1988 decreased from one million to 669,871 whereas employment in privatised companies was just about the same, taking exactly the same companies from 1979 to 1988.  Employment actually went up a little so the conventional wisdom that privatisation is dangerous to employment does not seem to be borne out by those figures.  The conventional wisdom that the semi-State body protects employment does not seem to be borne out either because some areas of the semi-State sector are so inefficient and so badly run that in order to survive they have to reduce employment piecemeal.  It is important that the Government should tell us their thinking on this issue and particularly on the issue of jobs.</P>
    <P>It is no comfort to the workers in B &amp; I <Col N="166" /> or in Irish Shipping to tell them that their jobs are protected because they are in the semi-State sector.  That is not the case.  The figures suggest their jobs are more at risk because the semi-State sector is less efficient and is involved in crisis after crisis which necessitate emegency measures on the part of the Government and which sometimes involve sudden losses of jobs.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that the Government's commitment to privatisation is total or that they have looked at or made calculations about the alternatives.  If Irish Sugar have the bright future which everybody says did the Government not consider putting in the necessary equity? I do not suggest that is necessarily the right solution but it is a suggestion which the Government should have considered. If the company has a bright future, if it will float well on the Stock Exchange, and if the Government do not have an ideological commitment to privatisation, the logical thing for them to do would be to put the necessary equity into Irish Sugar because in that way they would get a return on their equity.</P>
    <P>We hear what a wonderful company it is and what tremendous room there is for expansion and what a great future it has. As an ordinary investor I would invest in a company which had a wonderful future and which was looking for equity if I had the money which undoubtedly the Government has got.  I would certainly put the money in but I do not believe the Government have considered this option. I believe the conclusion was come to a long time before the consultants' reported and that the Government decided that this would be a convenient form of capital revenue.  Having made the initial decision that they would take money out of Irish Life and Irish Sugar they came up with what are, basically, bogus reasons for the sale of these companies.</P>
    <P>I think it is inadequate for the Minister to come before this House to give us piecemeal reasons for the privatisation of Irish Sugar.  It would be more honest to have been given a full explanation by the Government as to their attitude to <Col N="167" /> privatisation as a general principle.  We would like detailed figures on Irish Sugar and information on how the Government and the taxpayer are going to benefit.  If we do not get that sort of information from the Minister in his reply, I certainly will be opposing this Bill.</P>

      <P>I begin by welcoming the Minister, Deputy Smith, here this afternoon. We have had Deputy Kirk with us for the past two days and I am sure he is glad to have a break.</P>
      <P>May I begin by saying that the Progressive Democrats welcome this legislation. My party and I hope that this privatisation will be the first of several. Senator Ross said that there did not appear to be an ideological commitment. I can reassure him that from the point of view of at least one of the partners that there is such a commitment.  We believe that where the State can disengage from activities which could more appropriately be carried out within the private sector to the benefit of the community that that is what should be done.  My party do not have any ideological problems about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a serious strategy involved here.  The State has invested over £65 million in the Sugar Company over the years.  That money was well invested.  The Sugar Company has a very creditable record.  However, the State is entitled to recover its investment from a company of this nature which should be run as a commercial activity.  There are historical reasons why the company was structured as it was.  Obviously, in the early days of the State, the capital was not available within the country to go <Col N="168" /> along the private road.  The State had to intervene to establish such industries.</P>
      <P>Comhlucht Súicre Éireann, Teo.  and the ESB are very notable successes in the early history of the State in relation to State engagement in establishing companies which acted for the benefit of the people.  Now we have a totally different situation where vast flows of capital can cross frontiers, where there is capital within and outside the country looking for a profitable home where money can be invested well, where it is secure and where it will yield a return.  That is why it is appropriate at this juncture in our history that a privatisation of this nature should take place.  The Minister stressed that it is a partial privatisation, not a complete privatisation, and that there are mechanisms incorporated in the Bill to protect both the grower and the worker. These must constitute priorities in the running of an efficient, commercial, profitable operation.  Certain national interests are involved and these should be and are protected in the Bill.  I do believe that Senator Ross did want it both ways; on the one hand, he wanted full privatisation but on the other hand he did not want a Thatcherite type of situation. He wanted meaningful jobs which he felt the private sector could create.  I became totally confused as to whether he was in favour of full privatisation, partial privatisation or no privatisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will go back to what the <i>ad hoc</i> group of consultants said when they referred in their report to the Sugar Company.  They said, that the company could not remain static if long term commercial viability and growth were to be ensured.  I would subscribe fully to the diagnosis that unless the company were put into a situation where it could expand and become competitive domestically and internationally, its long term time viability would be very much at risk.  Certainly there were signs that it might not have long term commercial viability when we saw what happened to Thurles and to Tuam.  Would Carlow or Mallow have collapsed next and would we eventually have no sugar beet industry, losing the valuable contribution it makes to farming and to the economy? <Col N="169" /> It was essential to put the Sugar Company on a sound, commercial, business-like footing.  I believe that the Government who invested money in the company are entitled, as any other investor is, to a return on their investment.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will be aware from the Department of Industry and Commerce review, where it refers to the food industry, that business will need a turnover of about £1,000 million a year, ideally, to be competitive within the new international situation.  Here we have a company with a turnover of £270 million. It is quite obvious that if the Sugar Company is to become a competitive player on this level playing pitch it is going to have to diversify, invest outside its core activities and must be given the opportunity through the market to do so.  If it requires equity to carry out acquisition or expansion it can go to the market, seek those funds and if it is a well run company it will obtain those funds.  Considering the difficulties which farming will encounter during the next few years in the CAP reform, under the GTT, even under the proposals that are before us this year, we will need companies within the food sector who can stand up and be counted in Europe and who can contribute positively to the national economy.</P>
    <P>Questions were asked about the use of the money.  Senator Ross was being a little bit disingenuous when he said that he did not know what the figure as to the market capitalisation of the company might be.  I think he has a reasonable idea of what it might be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Very different from what it was a few weeks ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>If we assume that the Government are going to get £70 million or £80 million out of this flotation, then that £70 million or £80 million must be put to good use.  It must be put towards reducing debt or to capital expenditure and not towards day-to-day expenditure. I know that the Government are quite determined that that will be the case. Otherwise privatisation will not make <Col N="170" /> any significant contribution to the welfare of the State.</P>
      <P>I have some questions as to why 45 per cent will be retained by the Minister, and why it might not be less, given that the golden share exists and that we can effectively prevent predatory acquisition. Could more not have been floated off to the market?</P>
      <P>I believe that Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta served the country well because it had very high quality growers who showed their commitment to the industry over many years.  It also had very high quality workers within its factories who showed their commitment to the industry over many years together with high quality management.  The most recent record of the company is to be admired.  Workers and management have enabled the company to go to the market and seek funds in the expectation that it will obtain those funds.</P>
      <P>It is encouraging to see that job numbers have increased over the last couple of years and that there are now approximately 1,700 people employed in the company.  Going back over the history of the company, we have had some inspirational figures such as General Costello and people who came after him such as Mr. Sheehy, and now Mr. Comerford and Mr. Cahill contribute to the welfare of the company.</P>

    <P>I would like to highlight the contribution made by the growers to the Sugar Company.  Quite a lot of emphasis was placed on the protection of workers during the Dáil debate on the Bill, which was quite appropriate.  The workers are being protected through the golden share mechanism.  But it is also certain that the growers must be protected within the new environment in which they find themselves. There are growers in south Kildare and Carlow who are, I would submit, among the best tillage farmers in these islands and in Europe.  They have demonstrated year in year out their ability to produce crops of the very highest standard for processing within the Sugar Company factories.  They have contributed significantly over many years to <Col N="171" /> the welfare of this country.  Their interests should now be protected.</P>
    <P>There is a slightly technical matter in relation to the yield of sugar per hectare or per acre.  Obviously, the foundation of the sugar processing side of the industry depends very much on the ability of the growers to produce maximum yield of extractable sugar per acre or per hectare. There is every evidence that given the opportunity and given the incentive they can do that, but the overall priority must be one of protecting our national quota within the EC.  There is already in this year's price review proposals to reduce the price of beet.  I am sure the next quota review will be quite a difficult one, but it must be protected.  It is a valuable national asset.</P>
    <P>The rights of the growers' representatives in negotiating the price of beet need to be protected in the new arrangement. They must still continue to have negotiating rights.  We must be somewhat worried, in relation to the quota, about the implications of 1992 and the Single Market.  I realise that there is an intention within the Bill to protect the quota.  My concern is that if somebody were to go to law in the European Court or elsewhere, could there be any possibility that growers could find themselves divested of a quota?  There must be a cast-iron, solid guarantee that that cannot happen under the 1992 agenda.  Perhaps that is something that the Minister can address in his reply.</P>
    <P>The growers have concerns which they are quite entitled to voice and which I can sympathise with in relation to payments for beet over the years.  There is this whole question of the ghost sugar and the sugar that is extracted from crown tare for which they do not get paid. There has been controversy over many years about the tare system for beet. Even though the growers representatives are present in the tare houses, it seems to be an ongoing sore.  I hope that some of the lingering difficulties which have existed between the growers on the one hand and the company on the other hand in relation to the extraction of sugar, the <Col N="172" /> yield of sugar, and in relation to tare, can be resolved as the company advances into the new situation of partial privatisation.</P>
    <P>In that respect, the record of the company, of course, has been one in which it has shared its profits to a degree with farming interests and with its workers. I hope that within the new commercial environment the sense of partnership which has existed over so many years and has served the company so well, will continue into the future.  There is no doubt that we can compete quite successfully in relation to producing sugar &mdash; how it grows, how we process it and how we sell it.  We must go forward from that basis.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it is quite apparent that if sugar alone were to be the business of the company it could never become large enough to be a successful player within the international food industry. That is why the company must be allowed to diversify.  It must be allowed acquire companies both here and abroad, if that is considered necessary.  It has already, of course, invested in Odlum's and in Grassland Fertilisers.  That is part of a total integration which is to be welcomed. The initiative there has been a very successful one.  If we come back to its core activity of sugar, it is quite probable that as we look forward into the next decade we will have more competition from artificial sweeteners and from cane sugar. There is the whole question of the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and their relationship to the EC in how the sugar market is managed.  They are going to pose difficulties on the sugar processing and sugar production sides.  That is why the company must move to protect that core business through acquisition and expansion.</P>
    <P>One of the things I am somewhat concerned about &mdash; and it may have been answered in the debates in the other Chamber, but from what I could read it was not &mdash; is that there is a 50 per cent option to take up the balance of the buy out.  Is that option going to be exercised through paper?  In other words, are Odlum's going to get new sugar company shares to pay for the acquisition of the <Col N="173" /> extra 50 per cent of the Odlum company? I am not clear about that.  Perhaps I missed something in the debate in the other Chamber.</P>
    <P>Minch Norton in south Kildare is a very significant player in the whole grain and malting barley industry.  It is again sensible that if we have sugar beet growers looking for tillage land &mdash; and we need acres of tillage land to grow the sugar beet crop &mdash; there must be an integration with the malting barley growers and the whole serious side of the business so that the acreage is maintained.  For that reason, I would encourage the company to look towards Minch Norton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to a large malting company in Athy.  They must look in those general areas to expand and diversify out of the core business.  The Minister, Deputy Kirk, would be quite committed to the whole horticultural scene.  He has already demonstrated that through the Bord Glas Bill.  There is huge potential.  Unfortunately, we have an appalling history on that side of the Erin Foods-Sugar Company equation where, perhaps, we could have done a lot more. The country has huge potential to expand and develop the production of fresh vegetables for an export market.  The vegetables that cannot be shipped fresh can be processed.  It is possible that that could be done through joint arrangements with some of the very large food companies. It is an opportunity which has been missed in the past.  We cannot continue to miss it in the future.</P>
      <P>All this can make a great contribution to the welfare of the country, the welfare of rural Ireland and the welfare of workers within a rural environment.  That is something that obviously will become increasingly important as we come under pressure from the CAP reform and from GATT.  It is through such activities that we can hope to keep viable rural communities in place and provide jobs and lasting economic activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="174" /> In relation to the need for the golden share, it is something to which I fully subscribe.  I am glad to see Minister Kirk has returned to us.  We were just talking about horticulture and its value and the Minister's contributions to An Bord Glas.  I know that he will share the view that the Sugar Company should be involved in the whole vegetable &mdash; horticultural side.  In relation to the golden share, it is essential that a company of this nature which by international standards is quite small, is not a target for predatory take over.  We are seeing on the Continent what the giant companies like Feruzzi or even Beresford, which has a more unfortunate history, can do.  It is essential that the value of this company to the Irish people be maintained through the golden share.  I have no difficulties about that golden share.  We have seen in the milling industry what can happen through predatory takeovers where foreign companies come in and buy Irish mills.  We are now down to the stage where we have just two milling groups. We have had bakeries closed down.  We have had mills closed down, just because of what has happened.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the question of 1992, the GATT and the whole question of the CAP reform.  Under the 1992 agenda there will be free movement of capital, goods and services.  We must protect the industry within that framework.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which is causing growers some concern, and I share their concern.  The employees within the company were, on 26 February, circulated with a letter which said that the Minister for Finance intended to offer each qualifying employee approximately £250 worth of shares without payment &mdash;&ldquo;free shares&rdquo;.  I have no objection to that whatsoever.  That is something to be applauded.  It will improve the commitment of the workers to the company. It is proper that they should be rewarded for the input they have made in the company. What I am saying is that if the workers are entitled to that facility the <Col N="175" /> growers are also entitled to a similar facility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that, Senator.  The letter stated that there would be certain income tax consequences, and so on.  It is either a facility which is available to all or available to none.  In my view, both the workers and the growers have contributed to this company over the years.  Both the workers and growers should be rewarded for that contribution.  I accept that the workforce must be protected.  I think that the mechanisms within the Bill achieve that objective.  I am glad that the workforce has increased from 1,500 to 1,750.  People can get one share in Greencore for every £9 of pensionable earnings they have in the company, or 500 shares, whichever is the greater.  That is subject to a 20 per cent discount.  I notice that those discounted shares will be held in trust for a period of approximately two years by a newly created company, Greencore Trustees, Ltd.  I realise there are tax implications here.  It would be desirable for some people to hold the shares for two years because of those tax implications.  I think that if somebody wants to dispose of shares on the market, he should be able to do so.</P>
      <P>I realise that the discussion on the Bill in the other House went on late last night. Some of these matters may have been dealt with there.  I have certain reservations about the relationship between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture and Food under the Bill, and the fact that there is a certain joint responsibility in relation to a lot of matters. My sincere desire is that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture and Food continue to get on well together because I do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh. Your protection is appreciated.  It does raise the question as to the relationship between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  There could be situations where that relationship might not be all it should be.  Senator Ross raised certain questions as to when it is intended to go to the market, and what the price might be.  I wish to have some of the answers that he wanted as well.  Is there any indication as to what the price is going to be and when the company is going to be floated?  I understand from the stock market that they intend to have meetings at the end of the first week in April with some of the people in Germany and elsewhere. What sort of timescale are we looking at?</P>
      <P>It is gratifying that we are now floating off the company when the market has recovered to a very significant degree. That will be to its benefit.  One thing we must be conscious of is the critical importance of establishing a price for the shares which does not mean that fat cats who are sitting at boardroom tables across Europe get large windfall profits at the expense of Irish people.  I am sure the Government will be aware of that and will attend to it.  The price at which the company is floated is a very important matter.  On the one hand, we have to try to make it an attractive investment, but on the other hand it would be most unfortunate if there were very large, immediate gains which were lost to the country, or if those gains resided in places which had nothing whatsoever to contribute to the country and in people who are only interested in their own personal and selfish positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The state of the market is something which will be a help to the floating of the company.  I am sure it will become a successful player within the market and that it will have much to contribute to the welfare of farming, workers and the country.  The achievements over many years can be built upon.  We are looking forward to a bigger, better and more <Col N="177" /> commercial Sugar Company.  Within that context, it is important that the growers, who contributed so much to it, should continue to be paid a fair, equitable price for their beet.  It is a profitable crop.  It is one of the most profitable crops in farming.  Of course, it should be one of the most profitable crops in farming because of the effort that goes into growing it.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are old enough can remember what it was like to thin beet, snag beet and to heat beet in frosty weather when it would stick to your hands.  Thankfully, we have gone away from those days, but it is still a high capital investment crop.  It is still a difficult crop to grow.  It requires a high level of expertise.  The farmer is entitled to expect that it should be a most rewarding crop.  I hope that we can continue to grow Irish beet on Irish farms to be processed in Irish factories for many years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I wish to protest in the most vehement manner at the undue haste at which this Bill was attempted to be taken and, in effect, was to be rubber-stamped by the Members of this House.  I listened yesterday to the statement by the Leader of the House indicating there was a closing date and that the Bill had to be completed.  Fortunately, through the good offices of the Leader of the House we have time today and tomorrow to discuss a very important Bill.  Might I add that this is the second recent important piece of business, dealt with in this manner?  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was discussed and decisions were taken outside this House which is the place where decisions of such importance should be taken.  It is a very dangerous and undemocratic trend if we, the elected representatives in the Houses of Parliament, are only allowed minimal input into legislation of any kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill shows scant regard for a semi-State body which has been in existence for 60 years, and which has given tremendous employment.  It contributed in no small manner to the national economy, <Col N="178" /> to the workers and to the farmers who are involved in the industry.</P>
    <P>Regarding the company's substantial contribution to the economy over those years, I can speak from personal experience. Up to 1987 we had a viable plant in my own constituency in Thurles, County Tipperary.  Despite many commitments from management, pre-election promises and local Fianna Fáil manifestos, some time later that same plant went out of operation which had a traumatic effect on the economy of the area.  There were serious and substantial job losses which had serious economic effects on the families of those who lost their jobs.  Further promises were made by the same people, both management and senior Ministers, after the 1987 election.  Replacement jobs were promised in Thurles to offset the job losses.  Unfortunately, once again I have to say that the outcome was a very much reduced response in job creation with a continuing serious crisis in unemployment and in the economy of the area. That is why I have to emphasise I am not satisfied with section 6 of the Bill which, I was told today, was introduced in the other House by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, in an effort to protect the workers.  In my opinion this is the most important aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the speeches here today and as far as I can see the Bill is mainly about money, shares, dividends and profits.  The human element is sadly lacking in the Bill.  That is why I again refer to the serious weakness in the section 6.  It was said here today that the Minister has decided to include a section in the Bill so that the workers were still being protected under EC regulations.  I challenge this Bill from a local viewpoint. I remember well only two months ago a commitment publicly in the local papers that the Minister would ensure that the workers in the industry would be protected. To me section 6 is not a protection. When you speak about gratuities, pensions and redundancies, you are not speaking about viability.  You are not speaking about permanent jobs. <Col N="179" /> You are speaking in terms of retirement, redundancies, pay-offs and loss of jobs.</P>
    <P>The vehemence of the Left was referred to by certain Senators some time ago.  I am vehemently opposed to that attitude.  If anyone in this House considers the inclusion of gratutities and redundancies as a protection for workers I must say I regard it as a direct opposite. To me it is an indication that the workers in the remaining two plants at Mallow and Carlow cannot think positive about their future prospects, but can only look to the implications of the unfortunate circumstances that occurred in Thurles and Tuam where, despite the promises, job losses occurred and redundancies, gratuities and golden handshakes were given out.  That is why I am emphasising I cannot accept the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>I am concerned basically about section 7 and the effect this Bill is going to have on the permanency of the workforce in the Sugar Company.  I listened to the Minister outlining details &mdash; the jobs involved, the job creation, the number of people employed by the Sugar Company, and the proposals and hopes of the Sugar Company to increase employment. There is a weakness in section 6 in regard to the employment factor in the industry, and seeing that the company is going private, on past records I agree completely with other speakers that there is no guarantee whatever to the workers, many of whom have given 40 or 50 years service in the plants in Mallow and in Carlow.  For that reason I am not happy and will be opposing the Bill at Second Stage.  To me it is a case of profits and not workers and their families.</P>
    <P>I would also like to support Senator Dardis on our national sugar quota of 200,000 tonnes.  It is most important that this quota is protected.  It is a vital sector of our agricultural industry which at present is going through a serious crisis. While we have provision for a quota of 200,000 tonnes, there is nothing firm and permanent in the Bill to indicate that the tonnage should be, or has to be, manufactured from our own natural resources. That leaves the door open to the Sugar <Col N="180" /> Company on privatisation to be able to go to plants and purchase the amount of sugar they require to the detriment of the sugar growers who, like the workers, have given considerable service to the sugar industry over the years.</P>
    <P>I know the situation in my own area. The sugar factory worker and the man producing the sugar beet were the people who contributed and got little thanks when the sugar factory closed down in 1987.  I am not a stock analyst, I am not involved in dividends, I am not a big farmer, I am just an ordinary man in the street who has seen what the factory was worth to Thurles.  I have seen the devastation caused by the closure of the factory. I am saying that, unfortunately, this Bill is putting money before people. There is no human profile to the Bill. Because of that I, for one, will be opposing the Bill at Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very important legislation as far as Irish agriculture and particularly the Sugar Company are concerned. I congratulate the Minister and, indeed, the Minister of State here present, Deputy Kirk, for bringing forward the legislation at this time.  We are facing a new and exciting phase in European history.  It is important that our indigenous industry should be afforded every opportunity of being put on a proper, sound financial footing in order to face the exciting prospects in the new Europe.  I am satisfied the Minister and the Government have taken a correct decision in their proposals to restructure the Sugar Company.  The legislation will have the effect of allowing the company to develop and expand while, at the same time, it will permit the Government to recoup some of the substantial moneys that have been invested in the company over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to know from the Minister's speech that the company have reported net profits on ordinary activity since 1986 and had a record after-tax net profit in ordinary activities of £18.2 million in the year ending 30 September 1990 compared with £15.4 million in 1989. Extraordinary charges of £5.9 million <Col N="181" /> reduced the retained profit in 1990 to £12.3 million.  During the period of recovery, profits were applied in reduction of borrowings and large accumulated losses which had been incurred prior to 1986.  Turnover was £271 million made up as follows: sugar division, £133 million; food division, £74 million; and agri-trading division, £64 million.  It is good to see their policy in diversification making profits.</P>
    <P>The Sugar Company were set up under the provisions of the Sugar Manufacturing Act, 1933, with the main objective of manufacturing sugar from beet.  However, over the years the company have diversified into many areas such as agriculture, heavy engineering, food processing, fertiliser distribution, molasses trading and many other areas. Partial privatisation will further enhance the process of diversification which, in turn, will lead to greater profitability and, subsequently, greater job creation.  The company were in a loss-making situation in the early eighties but due to commitment, loyalty and dedication of both employees and the small farmers &mdash; the beet growers &mdash; we have now a very profitable and effective company.  Turnover has reached over £270 million with an operating profit of £18 million, as was already mentioned in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>I am obviously very concerned about the long term viability and future of this company.  I am satisfied that the legislation before this House will protect the future of both the employees and the farmers who depend on the Sugar Company for a living.  I am glad the Minister has recognised the very important role which both the employees and the farmers have played in the expansion of this company.  He has made provision for a shareholding for both employees and farmers that will further enhance the company and will ensure the continued loyalty and commitment of both the employees and the farmers in the development of the Irish Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provision which allows the Minister for Agriculture and <Col N="182" /> Food to acquire a special share in the holding company.  This will prevent the disposal of the controlling interest in Siúicre Éireann of the Sugar Company's assets.  I call on the Minister to ensure that under no circumstances can this share ever be sold.  This morning, the Minister said that as a result of discussions with The Irish Congress of Trade Unions and representatives of the beet growers, he specifically included in the Bill a provision that the special share may not be sold.</P>
    <P>Particular attention must be paid to the 5,000 growers who are the cornerstone of the Sugar Company.  It is vital that growers will be party to any future decisions regarding the distribution of the Irish sugar quota.  The new company must recognise the rights of existing contract holders in traditional beet growing areas. Over the years, the number of occasions on which the Sugar Company returned a loss were few, in spite of having to trade in some very unfavourable economic conditions.</P>
    <P>In the past 15 years the company have embarked on a major capital investment programme.  This is very evident to anybody who has recently seen the major changes in two of its factories.  This programme was essential if the company were to keep pace with international competition in the sugar sector.  Successive Governments have contributed towards this major investment programme by making Exchequer advances to the company in order that their debt-equity ratio would remain in line with commercial norms.</P>
    <P>This investment was essential to ensure the survival of the sugar industry, since the finance was required to replace obsolete machinery and to increase the production efficiency of the various factories.  This rationalisation programme also saw the closure of two factories in Thurles and Tuam.  The programme of investment that has taken place in Mallow and Carlow will streamline their operation and hopefully will put them in a position where they can take advantage of the new Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="183" /> The introduction of this Bill constitutes a recognition by the Government of the central role played by the Sugar Company in the development of agriculture in Ireland over the past 60 years.  It places on record the commitment of this House to fostering an ordered future for the Sugar Company.  As regards farmers, they should be considered as partners in this whole new structure.</P>
    <P>Privatisation was mentioned by Senator Ross and, like Senator Dardis, I was at a loss to know whether he was in favour of or against privatisation.  I cannot understand why people, including politicians, have a fear or dread of privatisation and going to the market for money.  It gives every citizen the right to purchase equity in the new body.  Privatisation has been a success in Britain and on parts of the Continent.  Since it was introduced as a new concept 12 or 13 years ago in Britain, many of the privatised companies have enjoyed outstanding profitability and success.  That outstanding profitability and success would lead to further job creation and it would not be all about money, it would be actually about people and Senator Ryan can forget his concerns in this area. I am firmly convinced that we should have more partial or full privatisation in our semi-State sector if it is to be successful and if we want to see growth in that area.  Greenvale will become a major player in the food business.  That is a subsidiary of the Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>Growers of Sugar Beet have been involved in a very profitable enterprise during the past few years.  Hard work is involved.  There can be a late spring or a bad winter, causing difficulties for farmers and for the workers in industry.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis said he thinned beat as a young boy and did other work with beet.  I remember doing so myself and I remember covering beet in frosty weather. If I had cut off my fingers I would hardly have felt it my hands were so numb.  Those were the conditions in which farmers of that time had to work, but it was their work and commitment <Col N="184" /> that led to the success of the Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>Late spring can have a retarding effect on a crop which must be high yielding if it is to be profitable.  Bad weather can lead to expensive spraying with herbicides and pesticides.  There can also be problems in very dry years.  It is a vital crop in the rotation system.  You can have beet one year, cereals another year and grass another year, and that is what leads to good farming.</P>
    <P>We have the distinction of having disease-free sugar beet.  We do not have the worry of the new disease in the United Kingdom.  We are fortunate that we are an island country and that helps us to maintain our disease-free status, whether it be in crops or cattle.  There are also problems on the Continent which we do not have.  I hope we can long have a protected industry so that the company will be a success both for itself and for the farmers and the workers at all levels.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for the manner in which he consulted with the farmers and so on, prior to the publishing of this Bill.  I again congratulate the Minister and I am sure this legislation will ensure a better future for the Sugar Company, for the farmers involved in the industry and especially the employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I believe it is a step in the right direction and while there may be certain amendments one would like to see introduced here and there, the main thrust of the Bill is what right-thinking people should accept.  As Senator Kiely said, people should not be afraid of privatisation in so far as, in this instance, provision is clearly there for the workers, the growers and anybody else to become involved to the extent that they want to become involved.  There are special and easy measures for their involvement in it.  We are not talking over something and closing a door and keeping people out.  That is not the proposal from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a background to all this development and the increasing losses in the semi-State sector.  In the seventies and the eighties the attitude to semi-State <Col N="185" /> bodies changed totally.  This is the very relevant background that has led us to the situation in which we are today. Obviously, in common with other semi-State bodies, the Irish Sugar Company incurred large losses.  It required additional equity from Government to prop it up; it was clear this could not and would not continue.  The company was given a brief to operate on a commercial basis. The company took that brief on board and set in train a major plan to improve its competitiveness.  That involved closures, cutbacks in staffing, and investment to improve its performance.  The success of these actions, together with the equity injection from Government, is clear from the major turnaround which has been achieved.  In the recent accounts, the group earned operating profits of £26.7 million; in 1986, the comparable figure was £12.5 million approximately.</P>
    <P>We look to the future and while performance to date has been good, one must ask where does the company go from here?  It is highly dependent on sugar for profitability, consequently it is highly dependent on that arm of its business.  However, expansion of sugar production is not realistic because it is controlled by quota limitations and these have been referred to already.  Ireland has, as we know, an A quota which is 182,000 tonnes and a B quota of 18,200 tonnes so while sugar is profitable, it does not, of itself or in itself, provide growth possibilities.</P>
    <P>The company must use the profits from sugar to fund development in other areas. The funding development through cash generation from activities can be a slow process.  Opportunities can pass by while the cash is being built up.  Equally, many would-be sellers would prefer shares or a mix of cash and shares.  It is out of the question, in my opinion, that the Government would provide additional equity to fund future business purchases.  Indeed, one could argue that it would be inappropriate for the Government to fund Irish Sugar to purchase business in competition with other private sector companies. In other words, the Government <Col N="186" /> would be using taxpayers' money to compete with other operators in the arena of purchasing companies.</P>
    <P>While one cannot expect the Government to provide additional equity to fund commercial risks, the Government should expect a return on their investment in the company.  In the eighties, they invested £59 million and to date have not received any dividend from that substantial investment of money.  With regard to flotation, the sale of a majority shareholding by Government is the better option for the company.  However, it is necessary to protect the interests of beet growers and employees.  This is being achieved by means of a golden share which ensures that the beet quota is retained in Ireland.  The quota is a national asset and should be protected. The sale of the company to another company or individual would not have achieved this same degree of protection. That is important &mdash; the retention of the quota in its entirety.  The rights of workers should be protected on changeover to new ownership.  The company is in the process of concluding agreements with trade unions and others concerned to ensure that there will be no reactions from these quarters.  While the company flotation should yield money for the Government, it is important that the company itself will raise cash.  This is important to ensure a good price as the institutions will expect it.  The money should be used to fund the various operations in the future.</P>
    <P>The Government will receive a return on their investment by means of the sale of shares and by means of the ongoing dividends on the shares it continues to hold in the company.  The Government will retain not less than 45 per cent of shares in the company.</P>
    <P>Beet growers' interests must be protected by means of the golden shares. This also benefits the employees, and their interests too, must be protected. The emphasis will be on expansion rather than cutbacks.  For the company, flotation will mean that it can expand in the agri-food sector.  It will be subject to the disciplines of the open market rather than <Col N="187" /> those previously imposed by the State.  It faces a tough task but we need a larger, efficient company to meet the competitive challenges of the European Market.</P>
    <P>There are a few points in the annual report of the Irish Sugar Company, 1990 I would like to refer to, with particular reference to some remarks made by the general manager of the Irish Sugar Company. The general manager of the Sugar Company, Mr. Comerford, has played a magnificent role in ensuring that the company has been brought to a position of significant improvement.  We understand from the report that in 1989-90 the group achieved new record levels of turnover and profitability.  Turnover increased by nearly 26 per cent, to £271.4 million.  This mainly reflected the impact of the Odlum acquisition during the financial year.  Profits before tax on ordinary activities were £21.97 million, an increase of £4.86 million on the previous year.  However, the level of retained profits was reduced due to the treatment of the group's investment in replacement activities undertaken following factory closures.</P>
    <P>I believe that 20,000 square feet has been set aside for an advance factory by the IDA in Tuam.  It is a matter of great urgency that this 20,000 square feet be taken up at an early date and that employment be provided in the Tuam area. When Tuam closed &mdash; and I am not saying it should not have closed &mdash; there should have been much needed jobs provided in that part of the country.  I would urge the Government, through the IDA, to make sure that that advance factory is brought to a position where jobs are available from it.</P>

    <Title>Sugar Bill, 1990: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about jobs in Tuam.  I would like to reiterate that I believe jobs should be made available in Tuam.  There has also been the closure of the Thurles factory and while I know there are some jobs there, there is a target of something like 384 jobs for 1992. Hopefully, that target will be met because Thurles is a town much in need of employment.  It is not a town with <Col N="190" /> industry and its hinterland relied on the Sugar Company and related activities over many years.</P>
      <P>I wish to make reference to the annual report of the Irish Sugar Company.  In 1989-90 the average annual employment in the group was 1,757 at a total cost of £33.2 million.  That is very significant. It shows the considerable employment content and the amount of money in circulation as a result of that employment. There were 1,556 people employed in 1988-89 at a cost of £28.7 million.  One could go on and on.  There is some very interesting information in the annual report but I am sure it is something everybody here has read.</P>
      <P>The Sugar Bill is primarily to provide for certain matters relating to the restructuring of the Sugar Company.  The primary function of the legislation is to provide for a restructuring which will enable the company to pass from State owned to a more widely diffused ownership in partial privatisation.  Before one enters into discussing the Bill in any detail which we will be doing at an early date, there are a number of general points in relation to the processes which I believe are very relevant and should be made.  I have referred to some of them already.</P>
      <P>First, there are questions that have to be asked in relation to certain matters concerning growers, workers, and we must, above all, get firm assurances on these.  The Sugar Company are now a public limited company with an issued share capital of £66 million comprising of 65.5 million ordinary shares of £1 each and 0.5 million of 6 per cent cumulative preference shares at £1 each.  The Minister for Finance holds all these shares as of now with the exception of a small number of qualifying shares held by the directors which amount to something less than 0.5 million preference shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said already, the company while mainly involved in the process of sugar engaged in other activities.  They have almost 100 per cent of the market for sugar in the State, 70 per cent of the market in Northern Ireland and a small market for industrial sugar in the United Kingdom.  The company are also involved <Col N="191" /> in the food sector in recent years and there have been a number of acquisitions in the food sector area.</P>
    <P>I made reference to the acquisition of the Odlum share of 50 per cent and there is provision for the acquisition of a further 50 per cent of that operation.  Agricultural trading has become a very important feature for the Irish Sugar Company. I understand Thurles could be developed very fully along the lines where it would present a very appropriate location for some developments there in conjunction with other suitable businesses.  The company have reported net profits on ordinary activities since 1986 and had a record after-tax net profit of £15.35 million in the year ending September 1989 compared with £11.8 million in 1988.</P>
    <P>During the period of recovery profits were applied in reduction of borrowings and large cumulative losses which had been incurred prior to 1986.  Turnover in the year ending September 1989 was £216 million which was made up in the following way: the sugar division, £125 million; the food division, £34 million; agri-trading division, £57 million.  The turnover consists, and this is very good, largely of Irish sales with only £36 million accounted for by sales outside the State. The financial results of the Irish Sugar Company for the year ending September 1990 again are quite encouraging.  It is against that kind of background that we are now approaching a situation where the company being partly handed over to private ownership.</P>
    <P>We talked about the equity which the Government contributed over a number of years.  They contributed £20 million in 1983; £9 million in 1987 and £30 million in 1982.  This was a major injection which brought the total Exchequer equity to £65.5 million.  This has been, and continues to be, a considerable cost to the State.  On that large amount of money a dividend has not been paid because of the legal ban on such payment until cumulative losses have been cleared.  In <Col N="192" /> addition, because of protracted loss-making the company have paid little corporation tax.  This proposed legislation, when and if enacted, will at last enable the State to get some return for its investment; and the State getting it means the people of the country getting it.  I think this is highly important.  This will be achieved through the sales of shares and the payment of dividends on the residual Exchequer shareholding following the proposed flotation.  There are various options to be considered by groups and committees who are putting the finishing touches to this operation at this time.</P>
    <P>One could continue the present operation, but I do not think it is a desirable option and it should be departed from. That approach of continuing the present line would be appropriate if the company was prepared in the long term to remain in a static rather than a dynamic position. We do not want to have it in a static position; we want to have a dynamic approach in it.  Therefore, we must move forward.</P>
    <P>There will be significant changes in the context of the Community sugar regime, the outcome of the GATT negotiations and the fact that in Europe the terms of the company will be of vital consequence. We must also recognise that for 5,000 growers of sugar beet this industry is very important.  There are 82,000 acres approximately used for the growing of sugar beet by 5,000 growers.  I think it is safe to say that, even taking milk production into account, in the last year the production of sugar beet was the most lucrative line of farming.  Regrettably, we are tied to a quota arrangement, to which I referred earlier.  We must make sure that we retain that A quota and B quota; but at the same time it does provide significant relief to a very depressed farming community, a significant relief to at least 5,000 of our farmers.</P>
    <P>Recently I had discussions with some farmers involved in the growing of beet. They had just a few points of concern which I want to raise.  The first is this.  It is understood that the first board will be appointed by the Minister, be it nine directors or whatever the number is, I am <Col N="193" /> not certain.  I would ask the Minister: will the next board and chairman be appointed as in any other company by the shareholders at an annual general meeting?  It is highly important and desirable that that be the case.  That should show an absolute involvement on the part of all concerned that the shareholders would have that right to appoint the chairman and board members at an annual general meeting, which, I would like to think, after this legislation has gone through, would be held at a reasonably early date after the board have been appointed by the Minister.  I accept the appointment of these directors in the first instance, but I would urge that the first annual general meeting would not be left too long.  The beet and vegetable division of the Irish Farmers' Association &mdash; they may have had discussions with the Minister in the recent past &mdash; obviously have discussed this matter in depth.  They are extremely concerned that their right of negotiation, which they have at present, would continue and that there would be no interference whatsoever with the existing process for negotiation.  I am familiar with the negotiation machinery that has successfully operated for the benefit of the company and of the growers over a number of years and there should not be any interference with that.</P>
    <P>There is one other very important point, that is, that farmers are paid a due and just reward for the amount of sugar extracted from the beet.  I think this is highly important.  This can be, as we all know, depending on climate and so forth, a very variable thing.  It is of paramount importance, and deserving of putting on the record here today, that, first, we have our board appointed at the AGM; secondly, that we have our negotiating machinery between the growers and the company continue in a meaningful form, as it exists today; and, thirdly, that growers are paid fully and adequately for their sugar beet.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the existing growers' negotiating rights be protected &mdash; not just the price but their quota, contract distribution and redistribution, including the right of all existing contract growers <Col N="194" /> to hold and maintain their contracts.  In addition the growers' consent must be necessary to prevent the removal of any quota from Ireland.  One could not over-emphasise the importance of the quota for this country and I think all concerned &mdash; and, I am sure, the Government, too &mdash; would have a positive and active interest in ensuring that.  I have referred already to the necessity for a fair and equitable share of the total sugar extracted from the beet and the crowns to be paid to the growers of the crop.</P>
    <P>Following their last meeting the company now propose to look positively at the problem of extractability after 1991 as part of a proposed new quality payment for beet.  My recognition of the growers' claim is very positive and I assume that the Minister shares that point of view.  The beet growers' representatives were a bit disappointed that there has so far been no tangible concessions given on this issue for 1991, a crown tare concession.  That is something we can discuss on Committee Stage.  It is a little bit disappointing that the company have so far failed to resolve the outstanding dispute with the growers on sugar extractability payment prior to privatisation, because I think this is the time to do it; but it has not happened.  Perhaps the Minister could elaborate on this matter. It is of national concern at this time.  This company about to be set up and to be known as the Greencore plc should have the very best regulations governing it on its establishment.  In the first instance, we know in regard to the new company, Greencore plc, that the directors are going to be appointed by the Minister. As I have already said, I would like to believe they will be appointed subsequently by the growers, the workers and all the shareholders at an early annual general meeting.</P>
    <P>This is worthwhile and progressive legislation.  There are a number of amendments which hopefully will be taken on board.  I would like to pay tribute to the excellent work of the chief executive, Mr. Comerford, in bringing the Sugar Company to a position of good growth and good health, economically, <Col N="195" /> financially and otherwise, and to his board as well, but particularly to Mr. Comerford and his staff who have worked very hard in changing the position right around.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation. While some people outside this House may not see how important it is, my colleagues and I certainly do.  The speakers up to now have confirmed this. I do not like the word &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo;; I am going to use the word &ldquo;restructuring.&rdquo; I think that is what it is about.  Senator Hourigan in his closing remarks paid tribute to the present chairman and chief executive of Siúicre Éireann.  I would also like to pay tribute to the chief executive and, indeed, to all who have served the Sugar Company.</P>
      <P>Some colleagues of mine here yesterday had trouble in taking this Bill on a Friday.  I am not allowed to comment about their absence, but one has just to look around.  If this Bill was to come into this House even on a Sunday, I would see it as important enough to be present to take it.  We have here a whole new regime that surely must be to the benefit of our workers, the growers and the nation.  That is how important this legislation is.</P>
      <P>Senator Raftery &mdash; a distinguished Senator of this House, for whom I have special regard &mdash; in his address earlier today was commenting on the Taoiseach's new realism, that he was a convert to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Restructuring.  In fairness to the Taoiseach, if he believes something is for the good, he is prepared to change. In his opening remarks Senator Raftery may have given the wrong impression, but someone as distinguished in the field of agriculture as the Senator later made it quite clear that he welcomed the Taoiseach's new thinking on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would pay tribute to the unions for the role they played in making this legislation possible.  I find it extraordinary at times <Col N="196" /> that strong members of trade unions who serve in both Houses cannot give credit or trust to union members who take part in talks and put in place agreements which result in legislation that is to the benefit of all.  I say that with the greatest respect to my colleagues who have commented on who took part and who put this in place.  I am big enough &mdash; and I did it last week &mdash; to pay tribute to the top men in unions who have also perhaps shown new thinking in putting jobs for people in place.  Surely that is our role also.</P>
    <P>I have long associations with the Sugar Company.  This might give away my age, but I do not mind because it is in all the books.  I was lucky enough to be the daughter of the first Irishman to be appointed machine master in Carlow sugar factory.  He replaced Zabalesky, at the time, who was a Czech.  The man beside him was Neerman who was a Belgian.  I have long associations and lovely happy memories of the Sugar Company and of my late father's connection with it.  It was during the war years and there was a bond with the workers which, I am quite sure, has stayed in place right down through the years, because I have checked back on families concerned.</P>
    <P>The Sugar Company will not cease to operate.  This seemed to be the worry of some people.  It is only right that we should pay tribute to all the workers down through the years in Carlow and Thurles for their extraordinary long hours.  It was a tough job.  I do not think it ever became easier.  Perhaps with new machinery it may have become a little easier.  I would also like to pay tribute to the beet growers.  It may well have been some of the toughest money ever earned by the small farmers of this nation.</P>
    <P>I understand that about 12 years ago the Sugar Company had 2,400 employees, then rationalisation took place and the figure was reduced to 1,700. I understand that if this new company is a success, which we must ensure it will be, they will continue to process sugar <Col N="197" /> and vegetables and continue grain milling. I would hope then to see the workforce increased and perhaps with more guaranteed job security.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister for Finance will hold a 45 per cent share in the new company and that the Minister for Agriculture and Food will hold this famous golden share.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food has responsibility for this very important quota.</P>
    <P>I always have some worry with legislation where two Ministers are involved. I want to know where the buck stops if something goes wrong with this legislation and who is responsible for what.  I would like to have seen the Minister for Agriculture and Food having more responsibility in this legislation, no matter who the Minister was.  We have a £200,000 quota.  My friend, Senator John Ryan, was worried about this a while ago and he asked could some of this quota move out of the Irish company.  It is the Minister for Agriculture and Food's responsibility to see that that does not happen.  We have, I understand, 5,000 beet growers and some 82,000 acres under beet.  Most of those are small families. That was the situation and I presume it still is the situation.  It is our responsibility to make sure that they are protected and that this legislation will be to the benefit of the worker and the grower.  Senator Dardis was also worried that there might be more concern about the worker than the grower.  I would worry also about the growers, because if we do not have the growers we do not need the employees.</P>
    <P>I welcome the attitude of the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, in regard to accepting amendments.  This is what the Houses of the Oireachtas are all about.  I understand he accepted amendments to section 6.  That was a section also that Senator John Ryan had concerns about.  In his opening address here today, Minister Kirk said:</P>
    <P>Concern had been expressed regarding the rights of employees following flotation.  The position is that the workers' interests are protected under <Col N="198" /> the European Community's (Safeguarding of Employees Rights on Transfer of Undertaking) Regulations, 1980.  However, in order to further reassure workers on this point I have inserted, by way of amendment on Committee Stage in the Dáil, section 6 in the Sugar Bill, 1990, which underlines the rights of employees.</P>
    <P>Speaking on Second Stage in the Dáil on 30 January 1991, the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, said, at column 802:</P>
    <P>Neither workers nor suppliers have anything to fear from the flotation.  On the contrary, the overall strengthening of the financial base of the company arising from the flotation can be to their advantage only.  Beet growers and employees of course will approach certain individual issues from a different perspective to that of the company. There will always be negotiations on matters such as prices and wages. However, in a growing and profitable company &mdash; such as I expect Greenvale to be &mdash; these matters should continue to be capable of resolution without particular difficulty.</P>
    <P>I welcome the attitude of the Minister and his senior officials in accepting amendments and in listening to people in the Dáil who had opinions on his own Bill.  I would like the Minister to tell us what protection there will be for this company in the years ahead.  I know that he did not interfere, nor did previous Ministers for Agriculture, in the company we are leaving behind us.  I suppose it is the board who will protect the company from now on.  It is the Minister for Finance, I understand, who appoints the board.  I would hope that it would be in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Food that that board would be put in place.</P>
    <P>Somebody said today that this Bill was only about shares and money and was only for people with money.  I do not think that is quite true.  In fairness to all of us, I would hope that our concern would be for the workers of the company as well as the beet growers and not just <Col N="199" /> for people investing just for investment sake.  I have the same interest as Senator John Ryan has in the future of the whole company.  I would be in the same category as Senator Ryan.  I do not have this big money that some people have.  I am lucky to have the job I have and I do it well.</P>
    <P>I note that the workers get £250 worth of shares as a type of gift and then they get a discount on the purchase of further shares.  I welcome that.  I welcome legislation that allows the people who make it all possible to participate.  I was one of the first in my party to think that this should have been done long ago.  The farmers also are allowed shares with the 20 per cent discount; but I understand they do not get the gift shares that the workers get.</P>
    <P>This is something I want the Minister to explain in his reply.  This golden share hits me every time I pick up a paper.  Yet today I heard the Minister say that other shares held by the Minister for Finance could be disposed of.  Perhaps I took that up incorrectly, but if it is correct, I would like to know why would the Minister dispose of his shares.  I do not understand high finance, but if I do not understand something, somebody explains it to me. There is, I understand, extra money available from beet in these times and I would like to know if in the future it is possible that the beet growers will get any of that extra money?  I understand they thought they would be entitled to some.  If I remember correctly, there was £6 million extra money but the beet growers did not get any of it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I was disappointed my close friends and colleagues in the Labour Party have deep worries about section 6.  Perhaps the Minister will deal with that in his reply.  Perhaps it is just a party ploy to oppose this legislation or perhaps Senator Ryan wants to make his presence felt.</P>

      <P>We do not have any of them.  On a famous morning, in the middle of a campaign in Carlow sugar factory, one of the main machines &mdash; turbines my late father called them at the time &mdash; gave quite a bit of trouble.  He was called out in the middle of the night as he was the machine master.  As I was going out to school the following morning, my father was coming in and I asked why he was out all night at the factory. We lived across the road in Strawmill right outside the factory gates, just down from the manager's house.  Incidentally, the six houses are still there.  I said: &ldquo;Surely engineers were there during the night&rdquo; and he said: &ldquo;May the Lord preserve me from those book engineers&rdquo;.  I am sure if I went down to Carlow factory this evening, there would be book engineers on the factory floor.  My colleagues will be interested to know that some things never change.  We have book engineers here too.</P>
      <P>I hope we will have more legislation like this which, if we work together with the trade unions and small farmers, will create jobs.  That is what it is all about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Honan's story has put both myself and Senator Conroy in our places.  Indeed, I suspect that Senator Fitzgerald, who has just left the Chair and the House, may well have done so because he was a member of the governing body of UCD.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are opposed to the Bill for three main reasons.  First, we are concerned about the effects this Bill will have on the workers in the Sugar Company in the <Col N="201" /> medium and longer term.  We are concerned about the effect it will have on beet producers and the fact that this move could put the Irish sugar quota of 200,000 tonnes in jeopardy should the Sugar Company be purchased by a foreign sugar producer.</P>
    <P>The quota of 200,000 tonnes is a vital asset to the nation.  There has been a lot of talk about the golden share protecting that quota and ensuring that the quota will continue to be produced in this country but I am not satisfied those assurances are foolproof.  I am not satisfied that they give a cast iron guarantee. Senator Dardis already alluded to some of the possibilities and he expressed concern about the free market in 1992.  Loss of the sugar quota would have adverse implications for both the workforce in the Sugar Company and for the beet growers.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the golden share for another reason.  To some degree, the Minister is seeking to have it both ways.  If, as has been suggested, the golden share guarantees that the Minister's interests will, as a first priority, always be preserved, that will reduce the value of the company.  If, however, it does not work then we are open to the possibility that the sugar could be produced outside the country.  The Minister may now be creating a situation which will end up as the worst of all possible worlds.  To some extent, the value of the company may be reduced because of concerns about the effect of the golden share on the commercial value of the company and, at the same time, I fear that in the longer term the notion of the golden share will not be adequate to prevent the sugar quota moving out of this country.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that we do not know what the company is worth.  Why are we selling a company whose value we do not know? That is a question that needs to be answered.  We need the answer to questions about shares.  How are the shares to be made available?  What are the details?  I understand they have not been provided.  It is implied that the details have been worked out.  I am quoting from memory when I say that the Leader of <Col N="202" /> the House the other afternoon spoke in terms of his anxiety to get this Bill through because of Stock Exchange requirements commencing on 5 April.</P>
    <P>Why have we not been told how the shares will be made available?  What are the details concerning the floatation of these shares? Who will get them?  Who will have access to them?  Who will be entitled to purchase them?  It is fair to say that the shares will rise significantly in value after day one, and in a very short period.  That appears to have been the history of these matters in the United Kingdom.  Those who get their hands on the shares on day one stand to make a handsome killing in a very short period of time.  Who will have the opportunity of backing what one might call odds-on favourites in a no-lose situation?</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> I understand that five lines are devoted to the Sugar Company and mainly deal with the golden share and so on.  No mention is made of the welfare of the workers.  I am concerned about the workers.  I am not at all satisfied that the provisions of section 6 will really make that much difference.  As Senator Ryan said, this is all about money.  There is a very strong chance that in a few years the Irish Sugar Company will be based at one location and the people in Carlow and Mallow would do well to concentrate their minds on that possibility.</P>
    <P>The Sugar Bill is part of a great U-turn. Senator Raftery in his contribution referred to a letter which was written by the Taoiseach on 20 January 1987.  I hope I am correct in saying that Senator Conroy asked Senator Raftery for details of the letter.  Senator Honon was reading the details and got as far as column 802 of the Official Report.  If she had continued she would have been able to get the extract from the speech of my colleague, Deputy Liam Kavanagh, who drew attention to a number of factors. For example, in 1987 when Fine Gael were in power on their own there was a Fianna Fáil motion which stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> That Dáil Éireann reaffirms its support for an efficient and effective semi-State sector as a major instrument of economic development and the provision of employment, and deplores recent Government statements to the contrary.</P>
    <P>That is contained in a letter from Deputy Haughey to Peter Cassels.  It makes interesting reading.  The letter states:</P>
    <P>As you will be well aware, the record of Fianna Fáil, whether in Government or Opposition, has been one of consistent support for our state bodies, most of which were created under Fianna Fáil Governments ...</P>
    <P>I have on many occasions made my views known on privatisation.  For example, in the Adjournment debate of 14 December 1984 I stated: &ldquo;To close down, sell off or devalue a State company seems to have been turned to by the economists and other spokesmen for the New Right as a demonstration of political virility....  If this process of dismantling the State sector is brough much further, the Government &mdash; and here I interject to say that Fianna Fáil were not in Government.</P>

      <P>That was the Taoiseach in 1987 quoting what he said in 1984.  There has been, in the words of Senator Honan, a restructuring.  The Taoiseach and the Government have restructured their position.  They have restructured the whole enterprise and have faced it in the opposite direction.  It is a super U-turn. This week we had another U-turn and I am beginning to wonder if Fianna Fáil should go and change its name to the U-party because it seems to be big into U-turns these days.  What does one make of all this, of commitments, of promises, of guarantees?</P>

      <P>It is difficult to see how that commitment and guarantee can be reconciled with selling off a State company.</P>
      <P>We will oppose this Bill.  I am very concerned about the workers and the fact that one of the two sugar factories which remain will be closed.  It would be a pity if that happened during the sale of the Sugar Company when quite a number of people will do very well out of it.</P>
      <P>Somebody spoke earlier about fat cats. I would hate to think that fat cats would become even fatter while the workforce in Carlow or Mallow found themselves out on the streets or in the pathetic position in which many of the workforce in the Thurles factory were left when it closed down despite commitments given which stated in fairly explicit black and white terms that the Sugar Company in Thurles would not be closed down.  That is history.  What does one make of all this?  I am opposed to what is happening.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. It is a pragmatic and sensible restructuring of the Sugar Company to ensure that it can compete in the modern world on an efficient and effective basis.  That is what we all want.  As the Minister has rightly pointed out, if we do not take these steps fairly quickly &mdash; and, if anything, they are a little overdue &mdash; the industry will be uncompetitive.  Jobs will be lost and I am sure no one wants that. This is an innovative approach.  The company is not being sold off to private enterprise. It is giving the best of the excellent State and semi-State bodies we have an opportunity to have proper capital structures and competitiveness so that they can evolve and develop in the future.  One does not want to see companies being disposed of or collapsing or the workforce being dismissed.  It is to avoid these very factors that we are moving forward and developing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of the Sugar Company has, at times, been a very difficult one, but also, on balance, it has been a very successful one.  Many very distinguished people, both nationally and internationally, have been associated with this company, including the father of one of the Senators in this House.  It has been <Col N="206" /> an Irish success story.  Let us keep it that way and give it the opportunity to continue to be a success and to compete.  It cannot do so with outmoded structures.</P>
    <P>The one business where we can be up-to-date, efficient and competitive is the food agri-business.  We have a market of 300 million people.  We must be able to compete in it.  We are already doing well but there is a tremendous opportunity for us to do even better.  We must be competitive.  We cannot expect some form of internal or external subsidy to be handed to us.</P>
    <P>We have only two world class commodities. One of them is dairy products and we must be more competitive there. I found it a little ironic to see an advertisement in this building about healthy diet and low fat.  I would have thought that we of all legislatures should know that there is a good deal of evidence that dairy fat is an excellent healthy fat. However, so be it.  It will take this a little while for that fact to come through, but it is crucial for agriculture in this country.</P>
    <P>We need to have modern technology, high quality competitive processes and foodstuffs and a good reputation.  The Sugar Company has established such a reputation.  I am quite sure it will be able to continue this as it evolves and diversifies, although it will not be easy.</P>
    <P>I have some concern about acquisitions and joint ventures.  Acquisitions can pose problems.  Joint ventures are not always easy or successful but I am confident that the people concerned with the new sugar company will be both aggressive and effective in their acquisitions and in the conduct of those acquisitions.  It is a very competitive world and the trend, particularly in the food business, is towards large groupings with all the advantages of scale.  We cannot compete with that. That is the reality &mdash; let us not kid ourselves &mdash; in relation to the sugar company or any other company.  We must compete on quality because we cannot compete on scale.</P>
    <P>Effectively, control of the company remains with the Minister.  It is intended that it will have an independent board which will be protected from a predatory <Col N="207" /> takeover by the golden share and the combined ministerial shareholding.  It is very unusual to have a golden share.  It is the first time it has been done in this country.  It is a pragmatic, sensible decision.  It is also unusual to have combined ministerial shareholdings.  It has worked very successfully in other circumstances. One of the most successful companies in the world, British Petroleum, is a Government controlled company even though it has an immense private shareholding.  It is perfectly feasible to combine both but there are certain difficulties.  The degree of independence which the board and executives of the new sugar company will require and their relationship with the Government are matters on which they will work together to ensure success.</P>
    <P>I hope Irish and other institutions will be encouraged to invest in the new sugar holding company.  I also hope that private investors will be encouraged.  They should get a reward.  After all, they take a risk and there must be some effective relationship between the two.  I wholeheartedly agree with my colleague, Senator Honan, in her references to employee involvement.  Nowdays we see companies relating to shareholders who own the company and employees who basically make for the success of the company. They are mindful of their responsibilities to the society in which they are working.  We must have such a combination in terms of modern living and modern competitive industry.  The agri-business is very competitive.</P>
    <P>I hope dividends will accrue to the State.  So far, the State have not received many either in terms of direct dividends or in terms of taxation and return to taxpayers.  That now becomes a possibility for both the State and those institutions or individuals and employees who invest in what I believe will be a highly successful company which will bring credit to this country and give us an opportunity to compete.  If we can have such a successful, competitive industry it will bring permanent, lucrative and worthwhile employment and at the <Col N="208" /> same time give a return to the State and to investors.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>Bille an tábhachtach é seo.  Táimid ag plé athruithe bunúsacha i structúr ceann de na Comhlachtaí Stáit.</P>
      <P>This is the second Bill that has come before us relating to fundamental changes in the structure of State industry. The first one was in relation to Irish Life which, because of its unique background, was not quite the same as what is being proposed in this Bill.  This is the first of the commercial semi-State bodies which were set up in the thirties to provide an industrial base based on agriculture, that is being changed fundamentally in its structure.  We must examine what is happening here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I object to the term &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo; because that is not what is involved.  As long as the golden share is held in the company one cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, say that the company has been privatised.  We hear much talk from Opposition spokesmen about the principle of maintaining companies in total State control.  However, those of us who have experience of running businesses know that the minute you go out and borrow money you relinquish some control over the business.  The lender will lay down terms that will ensure that his investment is safe.  Therefore, in the present climate we must look at alternative methods of raising finance for expansion of the agri-food business. One can continue to do what was done throughout the sixties and seventies, raising further money through borrowing which inevitably has to be funded from the Exchequer when the borrowing becomes too great and it is not able to sustain the repayments; or one can look at innovative ways of achieving two results at the one time.  Those results would be the raising of money which does not have to be repaid unless one makes a profit and which, at the same time, gives workers and suppliers a chance to buy a share in their own industry.  At the same time we are talking about retaining State control over this industry.  I must <Col N="209" /> say, as somebody who has been involved in innovative structures in the co-operative business, that I favour this type of approach.  It is very important that companies would have a proper debt-equity ratio.  It is very important that developments, particularly where risks are involved, are not over-funded by borrowing where one is obliged not only to repay interest but also to make fixed repayments on the capital, irrespective of the performance of the company.  I must welcome this Bill as a worth-while experiment.  If the experiment fails or runs into problems it may have to be modified in the future when subsequent developments of this type are being looked at.  However, I do see it as a way of generating new capital for this business.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention to the history of the Sugar Company which began as a provider of essential commodities and then expanded into the food sector in a much broader way.  We have to look at the unhappy experience of the sixties when the activities of the Sugar Company were curtailed and it was not allowed to expand in an aggressive way. I hope that that will not recur in the future.  When we ask the semi-State sector to become competitive we must not attach unreasonable controls that would damage its potential to compete with private industry.  It must be a fundamental principle for the semi-State sector that companies be enabled to compete in an aggressive and fair manner.  I hope that the Sugar Company will diversify into new food products and new technology in the future.  However, in any such diversification it is important that we do not get the inverted pyramid syndrome where the diversified businesses become greater than the core business and cannot be sustained through the inevitable ups and downs of business.</P>
    <P>I hope that we will get steady, incremental, organic growth rather than the fás aon oíche that we have seen in many cases.  In cases of too rapid growth, the bubble bursts at the end of the day and one is left with a massive headache. I look forward to the steady growth of <Col N="210" /> the Sugar Company both within its core business and within the expanding food sector.</P>
    <P>I accept, much as I have reservations about the principle of quotas, particularly as they relate to this country, that quotas must exist.  Therefore, within the core business the expansion will have to be in the realm of added-value products.  On the whole question of quotas, and since we are an island, I would like to see these industries organised on a 32 county basis. In the competitive Europe we are in now, unless we approach things on this basis, we cannot hope to survive.  Even if we had 95 per cent of the national market, there would still be a problem with quotas in an island set up.  On the Continent you could be talking about amalgamations and take-overs for businesses to achieve efficiency.  That is not possible once one has processed the full sugar quota of this island.  We are at an unfair disadvantage from a processing point of view compared to our bigger neighbours on the Continent and it is something we should look at again and should never forget.</P>
    <P>The question of finance for semi-State bodies is important.  Traditionally, the semi-State sector has been excluded from IDA help and therefore has been either totally dependent on share investment from the Government or on borrowing. This, at times, gave a totally distorted picture.  For example, if a semi-State body were totally dependent on borrowings it meant that the Government-owned body was at a terrible disadvantage compared to the private sector which was getting free &mdash; in terms of repayments and interest &mdash; Government moneys to expand its business.  It did not make sense to expect the same performance from them.  On the other hand, in the case where a share holding was invested there was always a great olagón about where the money was going to come from.  Money needed for share investment in State companies had to come from borrowing.  I never heard the question being raised about where the money was coming from for the IDA grant aid being given to industry.  Therefore, I hope that in the new structures <Col N="211" /> that that anomaly will be sorted out and that due credit will be given to the fact that the development of a company, such as the Sugar Company, has traditionally not drawn on IDA support, which should be taken into account when considering its performance rating.</P>
    <P>As the Minister mentioned at the beginning of this debate, three options were considered.  Sugar is a strategic national industry so I would have to welcome the fact that the privatisation option was rejected because it would have made our industry totally vulnerable to predators from the Continent.  I can however, recognise the merits of the proposal now before us.  I accept that the structure would protect the vital interests at issue here.  I welcome the opportunities being given to workers and farmers to invest, and I hope they will invest in the company.</P>
    <P>Finally, I must say I have reservations about the call some people have made &mdash; and I know it is not included in this Bill &mdash; to have worker directors on the board. I am not yet convinced that that is in the workers' interest because it is very hard to be on both sides of the table at one time.  As an employer I always believed in unionisation of workers, and always dealt in a very amicable way with unions, but I always felt that it was easier for workers &mdash; and we tried having workers on the board &mdash; if they did not have to try to be both managers and workers at the same time, particularly when it came to negotiating on their own behalf.  I am delighted that the unions have supported this agreement and that all the conditions of employment, pay, continuity of employment etc., have been fully guaranteed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate.  As you know we are finishing Second State and we will have the opportunity to move into Committee and remaining Stages tomorrow.  I will respond later to the points raised but first let me say that the Government's approach to this legislation is one which is based on pragmatism and realism.  We are endeavouring to do what is best for the long term future of Siúicre Éireann, its employees and all its suppliers.  We are doing this in a way which will safeguard the Irish sugar industry and at the same time will give something back to the State in return for its substantial investment in the company, particularly in the eighties.</P>
      <P>I need not remind you that our semi-State commercial sector, including Siúicre Éireann, has played a major role, over the last 60 years, in the development of the Irish economy and the creation of employment even in times of scarce capital resources.  The achievements of these companies is a tribute to the skills and commitment of the workforce, management and suppliers in the intervening years.</P>
      <P>However, the European and world market situation has changed dramatically since the initiation of commercial State bodies.  In response, the Government believe that rather than being State dependent, our economy must be led by a dynamic, vigorous, market-driven strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, Irish food industries must be prepared and be able to expand and to react to changes as they take place, if they are to meet the challenges posed by the evolution of the markets and to compete especially with their European rivals.  Irish food companies will never be <Col N="213" /> as big as the giant European and US companies.  However, that does not mean that they cannot succeed in the Europe of the future.  There will be plenty of room for efficient smaller companies, even though they may look to be large in Irish terms as presently understood.</P>
    <P>While the small scale of Irish food companies may be a disadvantage, their ability to secure high quality raw materials at a relatively low cost is a major advantage. Siúicre Éireann has, in recent years, displayed commercial and other capabilities which should stand them well in their drive to become a successful Irish-based European food company in the nineties.  They have been successful with branded sugar products in Ireland, while Odlums is a household name.  It is in this context that the decision to enable Siúicre Éireann to be the first semi-State body to seek flotation on the Stock Exchange was taken.</P>
    <P>The company has performed well over the last number of years but given the changing business environment in which it has to operate, it cannot continue to turn in good performances in the long term without expanding and developing its activities into other areas.  Such expansion and development require know-how and substantial financial investment.  The company have, as its performance indicates, significant technical and managerial expertise which will provide the know-how but access to the other essential expansion requirements of sufficient finance is not available to the company. This financial access is available to its competitors.  This is the basic anomaly which we are seeking to address in this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Company need to have access to commercial sources of finance so as to be on the same footing as their competitors and which they can avail of immediately when opportunities for growth and expansion present themselves.  This is imperative, particularly to meet and be prepared for the challenge which the Single Market in 1993 will present for the company.  This Bill before you will give the company the essential freedom of <Col N="214" /> ready access to funds by means of its flotation on the Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>The workers and beet growers who have been key partners in the company's success have nothing to fear from the flotation.  On the contrary, the overall strengthening of the financial base of the company arising from the flotation can only be to their advantage.  As I mentioned already, specific provisions have been made, in the Bill, underlining the rights of employees of the company and these give additional reassurances to the protection already set down in this regard in EC legislation.</P>
    <P>The protection of the sugar quota which is of particular concern to the beet growers is provided for in the special share which will prevent in addition to other matters, the disposal of the controlling interest in Siúicre Éireann and their sugar quota.  I have made provision whereby the special share may not be disposed of.  Furthermore the growers and employees will be given as shareholders an active interest in the company and will benefit from its expected development by way of income from dividends and the capital appreciation of shares.  Now let me turn to the various points raised by Senators during the Second Stage debate.</P>
    <P>I was taken to task somewhat by Senator Ross for not giving an explicit assessment of the valuation of the company since no sensible shareholder would sell shares without knowing their value. I have of course taken expert financial advice in what the value might be on flotation but it would be most imprudent to discuss that here.  Indeed the one sure way for the financial speculators to profit would be if I were to say now what this expert advice revealed.  I can say that the company will not be sold at any price.  It will only be sold if the Minister is satisfied on the basis of internal and external expert advice that he is getting value for his shareholding.  I can assure the Senator that the price will be set very carefully when flotation does take place.</P>
    <P>I accept that ascribing the correct value to a company is a difficult science at the best of times but particularly so now given <Col N="215" /> current uncertain world political and economic conditions.  In setting the precise date for flotation account will of course be taken of market sentiment.  The flotation of Greencore will be a major issue by Irish Stock Exchange standards and the Government are determined that it will be a success.  I realise that there has been a fall in the Stock Exchange valuation of most quoted companies in the past year but the reality is that a sound company will obtain a good rating on the market.  In the past few years Siúicre Éireann has expanded significantly and greatly increased profits. This improved performance will be reflected in the valuation of the company for flotation.</P>
    <P>Another point worth mentioning in the context of timing is the capacity of the market to absorb the flotation.  The advice available to the Minister for Finance and myself is that the Irish market can readily absorb the proposed flotation. Indeed some managers have been aware for some time of the intention to float this year and I expect that they will already have earmarked some of their funds to pick up shares in Greencore.  But there is still a reasonable flow of funds to institutions and I expect that some of these funds will be made available for new equity investment.  The market should welcome the opportunity to invest in a company of the size of Greencore which will in my view be a significant addition to the Dublin market.  This market is dominated at present by a small number of firms and I am sure the presence of an additional large firm will be advantageous to the development of the market.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ross also referred to the use of the proceeds.  A major aim of the flotation is to achieve a proper price for the State shares and to enhance the future of the company.  This is the best means of ensuring value for the Exchequer which have invested £65.5 million in Siúicre Éireann, £59 million of which was contributed in the 1980s.  It is essential to get a return on this investment and the best and quickest means of doing so is through <Col N="216" /> sale of a portion of the shareholding. Provided the company is successful the residual 45 per cent State shareholding should, appreciate in value while, at the same time, an annual dividend can be expected.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer investment in Siúicre Éireann was financed from borrowing which, of course, has to be serviced.  Proceeds from the sale of shares and future dividends will represent a return on the investment which means that the Exchequer will have to borrow less than otherwise would be the case.  The budgetary arithmetic for the share was calculated on the assumption that the flotation would proceed this year. Accordingly, I can inform the Senator that the funds received will effectively mean borrowing will be lower than otherwise would be the case.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross said the Government should put up more capital for Irish Sugar and they have the funds to do so.  This is hardly true given the national debt situation.  If the company are to operate commercially they must be subject to market dictates and not controlled by the Government.  As regards the type of flotation I would like to make the following points.</P>
    <P>The number of active shareholders in most Irish companies is rather small; however, many people are passive investors often without realising it thorough insurance policies they hold and through pension funds.  Essentially it is the investing institutions who are the main shareholders in companies; the general public has no great tradition of buying shares. In the case of Greencore it will be open to anyone who wishes to do so to apply for shares.  The necessary details will be published in the newspapers near the flotation date.  Small investors can arrange to buy shares either by contacting a stockbroker or the local bank.  I have been assured that orders for small quantities of shares will be accepted.  I should say that it would not be appropriate, given the large size of the issue, to actively target it at the small investor.  The advice available to me is that small investors on <Col N="217" /> their own are likely to only take up a relatively small portion of the issue.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer further to the question of expert advice.  Because of the size of the proposed flotation and the complex financial accounting and legal issues arising, financial advisers were appointed by the Minister for Finance and by the Minister for Agriculture and Food to advise them on the flotation.  The procedure for appointing the adviser was that 20 leading merchant banks, stockbroker and accountancy firms were invited to tender for the job.  Six firms finally made proposals and each of these was interviewed by a special committee set up in the Department of Finance.  This committee made a report and recommendation to the Minister for Finance on the best advice available.  The question of fees was also raised.  I cannot reveal the precise amount at this stage but I can assure the Senator that the level of fees to be paid by the Government will, by any measure, be quite modest.</P>
    <P>I would like to clarify the position on the special share provisions as they were also raised by Senator Ross.  The special share is of indefinite duration and will be held by the Minister for Agriculture and Food of the day.  I would add that compatibility of the special share with EC competition policy has been examined and the advice available to me is that the arrangements is not at variance with Community rules.  Essentially, the special share will protect the company from takeover and ensure that the sugar operations are maintained.  On this latter point I should point out that the sugar operations of the company are their major asset and, as a result of substantial restructuring and capital investment, generate substantial profits.</P>
    <P>Potential shareholders will, no doubt, view the profits of the sugar operation as a major benefit especially as they generate a strong cash flow which can be used to strengthen the overall company. The precise mechanism to prevent a takeover is through the use of the special share to prevent shareholders, either individually or acting in concert from acquiring more than 15 per cent of the <Col N="218" /> total share capital.  Expert advice has been received to the effect that the existence of the special share is not a significant factor in valuing the company.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis asked why the Minister for Finance does not sell off more than 55 per cent, in other words, maintain less than 45 per cent.  In response to the question why we opted for the figure of 45 per cent and not some other figure, I can tell the Senator that advice was received from the consultants in this regard.  They advised us on the best approach to adopt in trying to attract strategic investors while retaining a substantial stake in State ownership at the same time.</P>
    <P>The capacity of the market is, of course, limited and the proposed issue will be substantial in Irish terms.  The Minister for Finance as a significant shareholder is not expected to dispose of further shares for some time.  This is because if he sold a large block of further shares the price would fall which would be generally unsatisfactory for investors. For this reason the Minister for Finance will make a statement in the prospectus that he will not dispose of any more shares for at least two years.  As regards Odlums, the question of purchasing the remaining 50 per cent is a matter for the company and Odlums can expect this item to be addressed in the prospectus.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the special share which the Minister for Agriculture and Food will have in the holding company.  Let me say to them that the advice available to me is that the special share arrangement does not infringe any provision in Community law.  It is worth noting that in other privatisations, mainly in the UK, the EC Commission have not objected to the golden share rule. Difficulties may arise if we were to exercise the rights attaching to the special share in a discriminatory manner, for example, against nationals of other member states.  Senators can be assured that no Minister will act in such a discriminatory fashion while exercising any of the rights attaching to the special share.</P>
    <P>I would like to clarify the position on <Col N="219" /> the special share.  My reason for doing this is to ensure that the sugar industry will be protected.  Essentially, the special share protects the company from takeover and ensures that the sugar operations are maintained.</P>
    <P>Senator John Ryan raised the question of the closure of the Thurles Sugar Factory in 1989.  In January 1989 the Board of the Sugar Company decided to close the sugar factory there.  In taking this action the board was conscious of the impact which this decision would have on employment in the Thurles area.  The company, in conjunction with Shannon Development, developed a number of new industries and projects at Thurles in which Siúicre Éireann are involved as a shareholder.  Shannon Development and other Government agencies support these projects.  Initially four projects were envisaged but one which was to deal with the curing of animals skins and the manufacture of leather had to be abandoned owing to failure to obtain planning permission.</P>
    <P>The details of the other three projects which are now up and running are as follows.  GMX manufacturer of electronic timers and transformers for microwave ovens and other electrical appliances; the eventual job content of this project will be about 250.  At present about 115 jobs have been created.  Total investment in this project is expected to be in the region of £8.5 million.  Siúicre Éireann have a 25 per cent shareholding in the company.  Merriott is a manufacturer of central heating radiators for the UK market.  The eventual job force is expected to be 54.  At present about 22 persons are employed in Ireland; ten persons in the sales area are based in the UK.  Total investment in this project is expected to be £1.5 million.  Siúicre Éireann are the major shareholder in the company with 67 per cent of a stake. Tipperary Candy is a manufacturer of confectionery products.  This project at present employs 60 people which was the original job creation target.  Total investment in this project will be in the region of £1.25 million.  Siúicre Éireann <Col N="220" /> have a 40 per cent shareholding in this company.  These details surely demonstrate the Government's commitment to creating jobs in the Thurles area.  As I said in my opening speech the target for jobs in the Thurles area is 384 by the end of 1992.</P>

      <P>A number of other points were raised during the general discussion.  Senator Honan raised the retention of shares by the Minister for Finance and why this Minister is a shareholder in Siúicre Éireann when supervision of the company rests with the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  The position is that under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, the Department of Finance are charged with certain financial responsibilities and it is as a result of the requirements of this Act that the Minister for Finance is the shareholder in Siúicre Éireann on behalf of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing <Col N="221" /> me to raise this most important matter on the Adjournment tonight.  I welcome the Junior Minister to the House.  I thank him for his time and attention.  I hope he does not take personal exception when I state that I am disappointed that the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, was unable to join us this evening.  The Minister of State is very welcome personally, but the Minister is very familiar with the difficulty we have in Wexford in this area. Through his obstinancy in refusing to meet either the Wexford paediatric action group or the Oireachtas representatives from County Wexford, major concerns have arisen.  I hope the Minister will bring me good news this evening and that, at the very least, he will be able to tell me that the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, will meet the Wexford paediatric action group and the Wexford Oireachtas representatives to discuss the provision of a full paediatric service at Wexford General Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last autumn, the Minister announced the provision of a consultant paediatrician with the necessary back-up staff. That post has been advertised in recent weeks, but there is a very strong view on the ground &mdash; which is not confined to the politicians nor the action group but has been researched by the medical consultants in Wexford &mdash; that a single paediatric consultant would increase referrals from Wexford to both Ardkeen and Dublin.  The view of the medical staff in Wexford &mdash; it was published in the Irish Medical Journal in December 1990 &mdash; is that the appointment of one consultant paediatrician would worsen the present situation because any consultant worth his or her salt would take no risks with seriously ill neonates or young children when they were not on duty and were unable to give 24-hour a day cover.  One consultant can work only a limited number of hours and days per week.  A seriously ill child would have to be transferred either to Ardkeen Hospital or to Dublin to ensure consultancy level care around the clock.  At the moment, any child with a serious illness is immediately referred to Ardkeen Hospital or to <Col N="222" /> Dublin.  The provision of one consultant would not be improving the matter.</P>
    <P>It is now some years since a case was made for the provision of this full paediatric service at Wexford General Hospital. Even though in 1986 the post was advertised and the then Minister, Mr. Barry Desmond, agreed to the filling of the post, because of subsequent cutbacks at the time the South-Eastern Health Board felt unable to locate the paediatrician in Wexford on a full-time basis.  The consultant was located in Waterford, even though the post had actually been advertised for Wexford.  A two day a week visiting service was provided for Wexford General Hospital by the paediatrician who took up the post but who was based in Waterford.</P>
    <P>Since then that paediatrician, and the service in Waterford and Dublin, have coped admirably, but there has been growing concern and alarm among the parents in Wexford whose 30,000 children are affected by the lack of a full service in Wexford.</P>
    <P>I quote from the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i> of December 1990:</P>
    <P>In a ten year review from 1980 to 1989 of Wexford perinatal statistics, particular emphasis was placed on neonatal deaths and transfer rates of normal formed infants.  It has been shown that sick infants treated in units without paediatric skills have a threefold increase in this odds of dying, and survivors could be expected to have a higher incidence of handicap compared to those treated in properly staffed units.</P>
    <P>Wexford General Hospital is a medium sized maternity hospital without on site paediatrician.  It is unacceptable in the 1990s that a general hospital, with a catchment area of over 100,000 as in Wexford's case, especially one with a busy maternity unit, be deprived of experts and support staff to care for sick children.</P>
    <P>The appointment of one paediatrician, which was advertised two to three weeks ago, would inevitably result in even more transfers when that consultant was off <Col N="223" /> duty or on holiday.  Therefore, it would make the situation nearly more unacceptable than it is at present.  At least two full-time consultants must be appointed to provide continuous service.  One paediatrician would increase transfers to either Ardkeen Hospital or Dublin.  It would increase perinatal mortality over what it need be if the service was available where the maternity hospital is, which is in Wexford.</P>
    <P>In Cavan-Monaghan &mdash; and which Minister comes from Cavan-Monaghan &mdash; with half the birth rate in Wexford General Hospital, they have two paediatricians and the necessary back-up staff, accommodation and equipment.  This whole problem emphasises the lack of the Government's political will and commitment to Wexford.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has refused to meet the paediatric action group and the Wexford Oireachtas Members.  I would ask the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, to be at least able to state now that the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, will meet those of us who requested this meeting last October.  The deputation will include medical staff from Wexford General Hospital.  We do not expect him to meet a group to pursue a matter on a political basis because the local elections are coming up.  This issue has been there for four years.  It has not just arisen now with the local elections around the corner.  It is not the view of any one political party. This issue is supported across political boundaries, by a very broadly based Wexford paediatric action group and by all the medical staff concerned in Wexford General Hospital.</P>
    <P>I implore the Minister of State to ensure that his senior colleague, the Minister for Health, at the very least meets us so that the case in detail can be put to him, away from the political arena, so that the medical facts, as printed in the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i>, and as researched by the medical staff in Wexford General Hospital, can be put on the table.</P>
    <P>Even though there has been a shortfall in funding to the South-Eastern Health <Col N="224" /> Board by £1.8 million this year we are assured by the Minister that sufficient moneys will be available for the commissioning of both the new surgical wing at Wexford General Hospital and, indeed, Ardkeen Hospital in our region. There will be sufficient moneys to establish the paediatrician in Wexford with the necessary nursing and backup staff.  We understand the cost to be in the region of £500,000.  All we are requesting at this stage is that one extra consultant's salary be added to that bill.  Put him in at £40,000 a year.  I am not quite sure of the sum because consultants would also have a private practice to boost their income. But put in a consultant at a gross of £40,000 a year, a second paediatrician.  It is very little on top of the £500,000 that will be spent on providing half a service which could only increase the transferral rate.  For an extra £40,000, or even leave it at £50,000, an extra 10 per cent of £500,000, we would have a full paediatric service, a full paediatric unit, at Wexford General Hospital, where we have a very high birth rate and a huge catchment area of 100,000, not to mention the enormous increase in our catchment area during the summer season because we are a major tourist resort.</P>
    <P>Our case is without argument, to be honest with you.  The Minister has been generous.  He has come some of the road with us.  He is providing a paediatrician with the necessary backup.  The medical view shared throughout medicine in Ireland is that you need a minimum of two to provide round the clock service. Without two, you are just increasing your referrals.  The mothers and fathers of the small children and of neonatal infants in Wexford Hospital want them treated in Wexford so that they can be with them on a daily basis and in order to minimise the disruption of the other children in the family when there is a sick child who must be treated far from base.  What frustrates us all on this whole issue is that the Minister has been relatively generous in acceding to the request for a paediatrician but has refused to even talk to us about going that final step to put the full service in place. <Col N="225" /> I would make a final plea, which is broad based and which comes from all the political parties in Wexford.  It comes from the Wexford Paediatric Action Group, who have fought so valiantly for a full paediatric service.  Before them we had AWCH, the Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital, who fought for years up to 1986 to get a service in Wexford but who were thwarted by the last minute transfer of the paediatrician to Waterford because of the economic cutbacks at the time.  I appeal to the Minister on behalf of the medical staff and of the other consultants who are based in Wexford who have over the years valiantly tried to cope with the sick children and neo-nates in the absence of a full-time paediatrician to go that final step of the road.  A sum of £550,000 would give the full service and would provide the full paediatric unit that is essential to allow the parents of Wexford have treatment in their own town for their neo-nates and sick children.  I thank the Minister for his interest in this issue and I ask him to assure me that his senior colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, will meet the paediatric action group and the medical profession concerned to put the final piece in place and ensure a happy outcome for what has been a long campaign by a broad section of people in our county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my appreciation to the Senator for her words of warm welcome to me on my first speaking visit to the Seanad.  I want to say that I have taken very careful note of the points which the Senator has raised.  As she rightly says, I have taken a specific interest in this matter.  On a recent visit to Wexford I took the opportunity, albeit a brief one, to meet with the action group the Senator refers to.  I felt, coming away from that meeting, that we had a very productive discussion and I was very much informed.  I was able to report back to the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, the results of that meeting. For that reason I intend to keep in close touch with the situation and to try to <Col N="226" /> develop the services we are now discussing to the very fullest possible extent.</P>
      <P>I want to also thank the Senator for raising the matter on the Adjournment. I welcome this opportunity to explain the current position in relation to the provision of an on-site paediatric service at Wexford General Hospital.  The policy of the South Eastern Health Board in relation to the provision of paediatric services has been for the development of a regional service with the main base being in Ardkeen and associated units at Wexford, Kilkenny and Clonmel.  At present the three paediatricians employed by the South Eastern Health Board are based in Ardkeen.  The paediatrician from Waterford visits Wexford General Hospital on two days per week to provide an outpatient and consultancy service there.  In addition, the paediatric unit of Waterford Regional Hospital provides a flying squad service which gives a very rapid response to any emergency situation which might arise in Wexford.  The organisation of paediatric services in the South Eastern Health Board region has recently been under review by the board.  This matter was discussed at the May, 1990 meeting of the board.  The following recommendation of the hospitals committee was adopted and I quote:</P>
      <P>The committee recommend that there be a consultant staffed paediatric service on the site of each of the board's acute general hospitals and that the board should proceed with all haste to establish a paediatric service at Wexford General Hospital.</P>
      <P>The board subsequently submitted proposals to the Minister's Department for the establishment of a locally based paediatric service in Wexford General Hospital. The proposed service would be provided from existing beds but would require additional staff and financial resources.  Discussions took place between officials of my Department and the South Eastern Health Board to agree arrangements for the provision of this service at Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health informed the <Col N="227" /> board in September 1990 of his agreement to the appointment of a consultant paediatrician with the appropriate support staff to Wexford General Hospital. It was further agreed that the staffing situation will be reviewed at a later date in the light of activity levels at Wexford. The post of consultant paediatrician was recently approved by Comhairle na nOspidéal, the statutory body which is charged with regulating the number and type of consultant medical posts.  In conveying its approval An Comhairle has requested the South Eastern Health Board to give the post a community dimension, that is, a special interest in community child health.  This structure would be similar to that which was adopted for the paediatric appointments at Mullingar General Hospital.  The board then referred the application to the Local Appointments Commission.  The post was advertised on 21 February 1991. As regards the funding of this service, the non capital allocation notified to the South Eastern Health Board takes account of the expenditure likely to arise in 1991.</P>
    <P>In summary, might I say that I am very happy to be able to reply so positively on this issue and that I can say that Wexford General Hospital will have a much improved paediatric service as soon as <Col N="228" /> the key personnel are recruited.  I would also like to point out that in the light of activity levels, as I have already stated in Wexford, decisions will then be taken about further enhancing and improving the particulr service.  That is the point I made to the Wexford group referred to by the Senator.  It appeared to me that they were satisfied with that particular process.  All the Oireachtas representatives, including the Senator for the area, have made the point that it is necessary to proceed as quickly as possible to perhaps the second paediatrician.  I am satisfied that, in the light of activity levels at Wexford hospital, that will, in fact, be the case.</P>

However, if such a request is conveyed to me by the group I will certainly take it up with the Minister.</P>
