      <P>I have notice from Senator Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to explain the reason for the delay in the payment of subventions from the Eastern Health Board to nursing homes.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Hederman of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to proceed with the cycleway around St. Stephen's Green as prepared by Dublin Corporation in 1980 and as discussed with the Office of Public Works at a meeting on 21 April 1983.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator B. Ryan of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to discontinue the requirement that all travellers not living in permanent housing must sign on at <Col N="1134" /> labour exchanges at 11.30 a.m. on Thursdays.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Jackman of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Labour to provide financial assistance to the Abbington Enterprise from FÁS special projects funds so that the project development officer can continue his project work as a paid employee rather than in a voluntary capacity as at present.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Ross, Hederman and Ryan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Ross's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Hederman and Ryan may give notice another day of the matter they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have had to rule the matter raised by Senator Jackman as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take item No. 2, the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990, Report Stage, until 6 p.m., with a sos from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  It is proposed to take the Fine Gael motion, item No. 12, Motion No. 45, from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. and we will then continue Report Stage of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill until 10 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I ask the Leader of the House about his intentions regarding item No. 1 on the Order Paper. This has been there for quite some time and, in fairness, we should not bring in a Bill like this if we do not intend to move with it.  We should find some way of dealing with the Bill between now and the end of this session.  It may well be that it can be sent to some special committee or other, but I do not think it is right that the Bill should lie there all of that time. We should do something with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" /> Secondly, will the Leader indicate if the list of legislation which he announced here two weeks ago as being the programme between now and the end of the session still stands or if there are any changes in that?  Thirdly, in view of the seemingly inevitable and sad collapse of the Brooke talks in Northern Ireland, would he between now and the end of the session, and preferably at the end of the session, make time now available for a debate on Northern Ireland?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of matters I wish to raise and ask the Leader of the House to allow a debate to take place on these urgent matters.  I think the macho noises from the Minister for Finance over the past couple of days about the budget overrun and the Exchequer overruns is something which should be considered by this House.  It is important that we have the opportunity to put on record our views on the handling of the economy and the proposals the Minister is talking about, examining public service cutbacks, etc.  I appeal to the Leader of the House to allow statements to be taken on this issue this afternoon. It is a matter of urgent importance that affects the lives of many people and we should discuss it.</P>
      <P>I also wish to have considered an item which has developed since we last met: I refer to the MacSharry proposals on the CAP.  It is quite clear that this is going to be a source of discussion right through the summer.  These proposals would have serious implications for and impact on Irish taxpayers one way or another.  It is important that both sides of the argument are put because we are certainly getting an almost knee-jerking response from many of the interested groups at this time.  It is important that we have a full and comprehensive debate on it to see where our future in Europe is tied into a future CAP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, I think the developments in Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and that general area need to be discussed at this stage.  We discussed eastern Europe, we discussed many problems <Col N="1136" /> in the world, and I think we now need to look at what is happening in those areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House if he would make time available for a debate on the economy and on the impending cutbacks?  It is appropriate that this House should have its voice heard on these matters before the announcements are made at the August bank holiday weekend when they will attract minimal levels of publicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if we could have a full day's debate on the farming crisis, which is becoming more serious by the day.  We should have a full debate on this, our main industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Leader of the House when it will be possible to discuss item No. 1, which is the debate on a report of the European Community.  Things are indeed moving very fast, as the House will know, and I feel we should have an opportunity of having an input into the policies, and especially that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should be aware of collective views of Members of the House.</P>
      <P>I should also like to ask if the Leader will make time before the recess to discuss Motion 50, which deals with development aid and the famine in many countries.  Indeed, if you look at the papers or the television news, I think if is becoming more and more important that we should have a better forum in this House, such as the much-talked about foreign affairs committee.  We had one here <i>pro tem</i> in 1981 and 1982.  Most of the policies that impinge on our lives are tied up with international policy at the present time and would the Leader of the House agree that the Members of the House should have a greater input? Surely we should have an opportunity of having a Minister listen to the views of the House, because all these foreign items are affecting our livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>May I join with other Members in appealing to the Leader to <Col N="1137" /> grant time for a debate on agriculture in view of the statements from Brussels and of the fact that farm incomes are expected to decrease once again this year.  May I say, through the Chair, to Senator O'Toole that the reaction is far from being a knee-jerk one, that if these proposals go through in the shape in which they are being formulated it will not be just the farmers in this country but every citizen who will feel the effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely what I wanted a debate on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting the Senator in his call for a debate.  I request the Leader to put a question to the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  In this House on 27 February the Minister said he would be setting up a forum which would involve consumers, producers, experts, officials and anyone else who was involved to look at the problems in the industry.  When may we expect that to happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to repeat what other speakers have said but if we are going to have a debate on agriculture could we please address the extraordinary maldistribution of income in agriculture which leaves 20 per cent of farmers filthy rich and 80 per cent impoverished. Neither of the two parties in this House who claim to represent farmers have ever addressed that issue.  I would invite them to do so if we have a debate.</P>
      <P>On the question of the state of the economy, there are many issues but I ask the Leader of the House to appeal to the Government to keep their hands off overseas development aid if they are going to cut back.  It would be taking food out of the mouths of the starving if they do so.  It should be immune to all cutbacks and it should, in fact, be going in the opposite direction.  I appeal to the Leader of the House to send that message to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, given that the Government &mdash; at least I think it is the Government &mdash; have set up a body to review industrial <Col N="1138" /> policy, may I ask the Leader of the House if at some stage we could have a discussion on industrial policy in this country, because our industrial policy has failed on a number of occasions.  I would like to put on record that, given the eccentric economist who has been put on that committee, I would have no great faith in the validity or the reliability of the report of that body.  I would rather have the commonsense of Members of this House look at industrial policy than some of these eccentrics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with my colleagues in calling again for a debate on agriculture.  Indeed, I have been calling for this debate on every occasion that was offered to me since this session commenced. It is now accepted generally and from all quarters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I would like to put the following question to the Leader of the House.  We have been seeking the establishment of a committee on foreign affairs for some time to which the Government are apparently committed but they have not yet established it.  This provokes us to seek debates on foreign policy issues independent of that committee. I support Senator O'Toole in his remarks about events in Yugoslavia.  I would put it to the Leader of the House that what is happening today in Slovenia is civil war.  It is the first time a city has been bombed in Europe since World War II.  The situation there is out of control completely.  In view of the lack of support by the European Community, to which we are a party, and of the United States which is forcing this particular policy today, I should put this question.  In view of the visit of the Prime Minister of Slovenia, Mr. Peterle, to Leinster House three months ago, when he sought solidarity with this country, I put it to the Leader of the House that he should arrange for a debate so that we can respond by seeking that they can aspire to independence in the same way as countries like Lithuania, Latvia, Hungary and Poland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there should be <Col N="1140" /> a debate on agriculture, but it should not be confined to agriculture as such because there are so many of us in business who depend on agriculture.  I think a debate on agriculture would be of benefit to those of us who are in the agri-business and I am asking that such a debate should take place.  Agri-business is something we are all interested in and I think the Leader will grant that request.  Yesterday I found the Standing Orders of Seanad Éireann relative to public business under the Constitution of 1930 and I think that we should all be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to ask a question in relation to the Order of Business. It suggests that the Cathaoirleach should examine every notice of motion &mdash; and I presume this is what everybody is asking for &mdash; to &ldquo;ensure that it shall be as brief as possible and that it shall contain no preface or argument nor any personal implication upon any Member of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senators O'Toole and Staunton in their references to the crisis in Yugoslavia. The fact is that we are probably not equipped to debate events in Yugoslavia precisely because of the lack of a foreign affairs committee.  We are reminded once again of how inflexible our procedure is in this House &mdash; it is a point Senator Upton has made more than once &mdash; in our inability to respond to developing events.  Senators will have received a letter from the President of the Parliament of the Republic of Slovenia.  The least I would expect in a crisis that is in <Col N="1141" /> our own backyard is that we would have a statement of Government policy or European Community policy from the Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just concluding. What I am saying is, if you want it in the form of a question: why could we not have at least a statement on events in Yugoslavia from the Minister for Foreign Affairs; if he is too busy, then from the Minister of State; or, even at a pinch, we could have a statement from the Minister for the Gaeltacht on events in Yugoslavia.</P>

Does he also realise that the statements from Brussels on the CAP and on the GATT are of a nature&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is not confined to a person with 200 acres or 300 acres or more or less.

I asked <Col N="1143" /> the Leader of the House previously if we could have a debate on this issue.  I raise it in the knowledge that in the past week we have been made aware that we are going to have consultancy charges or what I would term interview charges.

We have passed the Bill for the dissolution of Thomond, which means that it is integrated with the University of Limerick.  It is strange that what is supposed to be a very slow process, the movement of the wheels in the Department of Education, can move far faster than we can in the Seanad, where I have consistently asked this question, with the support of other Senators, and we still do not know the situation.  It is a discriminatory situation and I ask the Leader if he could give me specific information today so that we do not have to wait until October before the question has to be taken up again.</P>

      <P>If I may take up a point that has just been made, as each week goes by this House is perceived as being more irrelevant because we do not appear to have the structures to debate quickly and to respond quickly to the issues that are important to the people of our country. I ask the Leader of the House, with some urgency, to try to find out what is holding up the establishment of a foreign affairs committee.  We have consistently, on all sides of this House, pressed the Leader on this for a long time now.  There were some utterances in the other House by the Taoiseach just a week or two before the local elections which left us in a position that perhaps we will have no foreign affairs committee.  I would like to know exactly the Government's intentions in the matter.  We need a vehicle where we can discuss and respond to issues, particularly those as close to home as Yugoslavia.  This is what we should be talking about this week, or at the latest next week, and yet we appear not to be able to do so.  This is just not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As finance spokesperson for Fine Gael in this House, I also support the call for a debate on the economic and social impact on our country, both rural and urban, of the proposed reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  We are not opposed to reform; we are just opposed to the particular proposals that apparently are before us and, indeed, the implications of GATT.  GATT and the Common Agricultural Policy can be taken together and should not be isolated and perhaps a debate could be structured in such a way that we could include the <Col N="1147" /> budgetary overrun in that debate.  I would prefer two separate debates but given the date we may not have time for two separate considered debates on the social and economic implications for agriculture and on the budgetary overrun. We must turn our minds to issues which are relevant to the people.  I ask the Leader of the House to ensure that we are perceived as being relevant and respond quickly to the issues.</P>
    <P>Has the Leader of the House plans to allow a debate, even for a few hours, on ODA policy?  There is a contnuing problem worldwide with starvation particularly on the African continent. Our small contribution in terms of official ODA needs some consideration by this House and I ask the Leader to allow us to debate that matter in the next week or two.</P>

      <P>If I were to accede to all the requests from Senators for debates on the many issues raised, we would sit well into the month of August.  I had planned, as I am sure others had, a short break in August.  It is unrealistic to ask for so many debates at this time, however important they may seem.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning that Item No. 1 is on the Order Paper for too long.  It is not my fault.  If we kept it moving obviously it would have been disposed of by now.  I will do something about that before we adjourn for this session.  Senator Manning also asked about the programme for the rest of the session.  We are pretty much on target as regards the taking of items.  I indicated that the Sea Pollution Bill might be taken but it will not be taken before the summer break.  The Competition Bill will be taken as will the Courts (No. 2) Bill, the Trade and Marketing Promotion Bill, the Temple Bar Bill and the Courts (No. 1) Bill.  We hope to conclude those in the present session.  As I indicated previously, we will be sitting into the third week of July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning asked for a debate on the Brooke talks.  We all live in hope in regard to the talks.  I will keep the <Col N="1148" /> matter under review and see what happens but I cannot promise a debate at this time.  Many Senators raised the question of the economy.  We are not unique in respect of this problem and many countries near us are worse off.  Our inflation rate, interest rates and trading figures are all good and I am confident the Government will rectify the position in due course.  Having said that, in a spirit of cooperation, I will investigate the possibility of having a debate on the economy. I favour the point made by Senator Doyle that we would have a debate on the economy/agriculture.  Two weeks ago we had a debate on the developments in the EC and there were only three speakers.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan referred to a review of industrial policy.  I will investigate that. Senator Dardis queried the forum that Minister O'Kennedy referred to.  I will investigate that and find out the present position.  Other Senators referred to matters I have dealt with.  In regard to Standing Orders, I have to work within the rules of the House and will continue to do so.  In regard to Senator Hourigan's point, I do not wish to offend him but he seems to think that my personal views on issues determine if they are relevant. They are not relevant to the Order of Business.  I would prefer if that did not arise and I say that without in any way trying to cause offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Keeffe referred to bank charges.  While it is an important matter, I have no plans to raise that subject in this session.  It seems to be a very suitable matter to raise on the Adjournment.  On the Local Government Bill, I am not aware when the <i>ultra vires</i> rule will be implemented but I will make inquiries <Col N="1149" /> and inform Senator Hederman.  Senator Hanafin also referred to bank charges and agriculture.  I have no plans for a debate on item No. 7 which Senator Neville referred to.  I will further investigate the Seanad voting rights for Senator Jackman.  I have no plans for a debate on Yugoslavia or on overseas development aid mentioned by Senator Doyle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment arises from our discussion of section 2 on Committee Stage.  I indicated that I would re-examine the section with a view to having a more definite expression contained in it concerning the commencement of the various provisions of the Bill once it had been enacted.  There was general acceptance that a specific date for commencing the legislation would be inappropriate because if it could not be commenced by that date, it would fall.  For this reason I cannot accept Senators Doyle's and Naughton's amendment. I have, however, reconsidered the provisions in the Bill and I have come forward with a revised version providing for a positive statement ensuring that those elements dealing with the establishment of the agency, the integrated pollution control licensing procedures and Part VI will come into operation on the passing of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I outlined previously to the House the Government's strategy with regard to the assignment of functions to the agency on a phased basis commencing with the operation of an integrated licensing system and for those activities listed in the First Schedule and for additional functions to be assigned to the agency as they are capable of taking them on.  This approach will enable the agency to approach the tasks assigned to it in the Bill in a structured and effective manner and will ensure that the agency is given every chance of success in performing its <Col N="1152" /> allotted tasks.  My amendment, therefore, will satisfy the desire of the House that the principal provisions of the Bill will come into effect on enactment while allowing the agency to build up its expertise to take on the additional functions.</P>
    <P>So far as the assignment of the other functions of the agency is concerned, it is my intention and that of the Government that they will be assigned without any undue delay.  To a large extent, it will depend on how fast the agency will be able to provide the necessary staff, many of whom will have to be recruited on the open market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) an emission which is a pollutant by reason of its smell,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understood the Minister to be reasonably well disposed towards the point we were trying to make on Committee Stage. As the concept of smell has not been <Col N="1153" /> included in legislation to date, it is difficult to define.  It may mean a different thing to different people.  I hope the Minister accepts the point we are making because to the general public obnoxious smells are one of our greatest pollutants. It was said before that what was obnoxious to me may be quite pleasant to someone else and <i>vice versa</i>.  Those of us living in rural Ireland are used to a variety of smells that are part and parcel of daily life there whereas somebody from a city area may find the smell from a silage pit or an effluent tank obnoxious.</P>
    <P>I accept there may be difficulties as regards definition but the Minister should introduce, either by way of this amendment or by wording one herself, the concept of smell as a pollutant in certain cases.  I urge the Minister, notwithstanding the considerable discussion we had on Committee Stage, to look at this point again.  A definition of smell, olfactory nuisance or any other high-falu-tin phrase that may be considered necessary by the parliamentary draftsman should be included in this Bill.  I am very familiar with the Air Pollution Bill because the initial drafting of that Bill took place in the Department of the Environment while I was there and I know the arguments for and against this type of issue.  I do not consider that adequately covers what is perceived by the general public today as the nuisance of obnoxious smells of one kind or another.  I ask the Minister to look at this. I hope she is in a position to accept my amendment or to improve on the words herself.  If she is not prepared to do so, I would like a satisfactory reason because it is an area the Environmental Protection Agency will come up against regularly in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment not simply to facilitate debate but because I agree with it.  In the environmental impact study prepared for Sandoz by EOLAS there is a less than happy discussion on the incidence of offensive smells in the lower harbour area of Cork. I am not trying to be provincial but that <Col N="1154" /> is an area where there were many environmental problems.  The way EOLAS dealt with that was to coin a phrase, rather sniffy, saying that methyl mercaptars which were the source of the smell were not really a health hazard until they reached a concentration well in excess of that which produced an offensive odour.  They implied that because this awful smelling substance was not a health hazard, the smell could not be seen as a serious environmental hazard and the conventional definition of a hazard in terms of the chemical industries at least does not just include those things which are life threatening.  It includes things which are insulting to the environment like, for instance, smell which may not be from a substance which is toxic or harmful but can be environmentally offensive.  It is no good stating the obvious, which is that we have no instrument yet which can detect smell. That is not the solution.  That is like saying that substances that are known to be very hazardous can be released in quantities less than that possible to detect with modern instrumentation.  The only solution is to minimise the release of such substances.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that we are not left with things which when instrumentally or scientifically measured produce no health hazard but which can, as happened in the Cork harbour area where children went home from school vomiting violently as a result of the offensive smell, damage the quality of life it is necessary to include smell in those things which can be seen as environmentally offensive.  It is the most self-evident fact that, for instance, to live near a badly managed intensive pig farming unit, chemical plant or tannery and so on there may not be anything that is physically or medically damaging but, as sure as night follows day, the smell will destroy the quality of life just as much as noise, for instance, which is referred to extensively later on in this Bill.  I second the amendment and I am happy to support it.</P>

      <P>I indicated on Committee Stage that I would have another <Col N="1155" /> look at the question of smell to see if there was any need for an amendment in the light of the discussions.  Since then, I have had the matter thoroughly reviewed in my Department and I am satisfied that this amendment is unnecessary.  Smell is caused by one or more chemicals released into the atmosphere.  As such, it comes under the definition of emissions in section 3 by reason of the fact that this definition includes an emission into the atmosphere as a pollutant within the meaning of the Air Pollution Act, 1989. Air Pollution includes matters that have power to interfere with amenities or the environment.  Smell clearly comes under this definition and prosecutions have been taken on foot of this definition.  For example, Tipperary South Riding County Council successfully prosecuted Munster Proteins Ltd., in Cahir for offensive smell under the Air Pollution Act.</P>
      <P>Smell is an air pollution problem and there appears to be adequate legislative provisions for its control.  The difficulty in controlling smells would appear to arise at the enforcement level due to the difficulties in monitoring the nature and sometimes mobility of the source and the subjectivity aspect of the problem. Legislative controls which apply to this area include legislative controls as defined by activities licensed by the agency.  Any odour or smell from activity licensed by the agency is covered by the definition of emissions and would, therefore, be subject to the control of the agency through the integrated licensing or through other powers which will be available to it under the Air Pollution Act.  Smells from sources other than an activity licensed by the agency are subject to control under the Air Pollution Act, 1987, in relation to waste the European Communities Waste Regulations, 1979 and under the nuisance provisions of the Public Health Act, 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, smells from any plant licensable under the Air Pollution Act, 1987 are controlled by the local authority concerned through the implementation of the conditions to any such licence issued and the general powers available <Col N="1156" /> to it under the Air Pollution Act, 1987. Many of these plants on the establishment of the agency will in the future be licensable by the agency.  In the case of nuisance, subsection (24) (ii) of the Air Pollution Act, 1987 provides for an offence for the occupier of any premises to cause or permit an emission from such premises in such a quantity or in such a manner as to be a nuisance.  It is quite clear from the definitions used in the 1987 Act that smell is covered by this prohibition. There are other controls under the Air Pollution Act.  For example, under section 26 a local authority may serve a notice on the occupier of any premises to prevent or limit air pollution which includes the emission of any substance which impairs or interferes with amenities or with the environment.  It is obvious that smell comes under this provision.</P>
    <P>Smell in the context of the disposal of waste is dealt with under the European Communities Waste Regulations, 1979 under which there is a general prohibition on the disposal of waste in a manner which could cause a nuisance through noise or odours.  Under section 107 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878 this specifies the types of behaviour and activities which would constitute a nuisance. These are wide and include, for example, any premises in such a state as to be a nuisance, any ditch, gutter, drain or ash pit or fowl in such a state as to be a nuisance, any animal so kept as to be a nuisance, any accumulation or deposit which is a nuisance.  It is clear that offensive odours would fall into a number of these definitions.  The penalties payable under the 1878 Act are being increased under section 109 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The points raised by Senators are adequately covered in the wide range of legislation I have referred to.  It would be duplicating already existing legislative provisions to specifically include a reference to smell in this Bill.  I do not believe it is necessary.  I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed the Minister has not accepted this amendment. <Col N="1157" /> She listed a whole series of Acts and regulations under which people can be prosecuted for the production of these odours or their emission.  These controls are not effective.  If you drive from Dublin to Cork or Dublin to Limerick on a warm day you will find people spreading slurry the smell of which is quite simply disgusting.  I wonder why nobody is prosecuted for this type of behaviour.  It creates a curious impression on tourists who come to this country because it is fresh, green and environmentally friendly.</P>

      <P>I spoke on Committee <Col N="1158" /> Stage about the difficulty of measuring smell.  I also raised at that time the difference between a nuisance and an annoyance as opposed to a pollutant.  I am very sorry for Senator Upton and his citified sense of smell which has taken him into urban Dublin.  I do not see much wrong with the smell of slurry.  I have to put up with it every couple of weeks. It is part of the process of agricultural development.  Senator Upton's attitude is very like that of those who, if you stick a spade in the ground, line up to object to whatever you are going to build.  It is the same thing.  There is a certain amount of inconvenience at any level of industry. Having been accused of being anti-farmer some minutes ago, I would thoroughly support the farmers doing their business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister.  This is a Bill about pollution.  It is not about nuisance or annoyance.  It has not been suggested by anybody that the smells referred to are polluting the atmosphere.  Those that are a pollutant can be dealt with under the 1987 legislation.  I think that is where the distinction has been made.  There is probably a middle ground we have failed to address and we have failed to address it because the calibration or measurement of smell is not possible.  It may well be that a more sophisticated form of measurement can be introduced some time in the future but it is not available at the moment.  The Minister has offered a fairly good middle ground as to how we can address this issue and I accept her explanation.</P>

      <P>In my view the contributions from the opposite side of the House highlight the difficulty we would have if the amendment were to be accepted.  What appears to be a quite <Col N="1159" /> pleasant odour to Senator Doyle is a very unpleasant one to Senator Upton.  It should be said that the word we are looking for is &ldquo;odour&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;smell&rdquo;.  To suggest that Senator Doyle smells would suggest to me that she is capable of using her olfactory senses rather that she emits an unpleasant odour, which I would never suggest of the Senator.</P>
      <P>The point I wish to make is that the problem is that an odour is the by-product of the emission and it is the emission we must deal with and in dealing with the emission we, therefore, deal with the unpleasant or pleasant odour.  It should also be pointed out that there are some very toxic substances which are odourless and are capable of killing.  For that reason I do not see the merit of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 27, after &ldquo;the&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;handling and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I would like &ldquo;handling&rdquo; to be specifically part of the wording on page 10 in relation to section 4 (2) (c).  I would like it to read: &ldquo;the handling and the disposal of waste in a manner which would endanger human health or harm the environment&rdquo;.  Again, this was discussed and debated quite well on Committee Stage.  I regret the Minister feels she cannot accept the more explicit terminology I have proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion that we include &ldquo;handling&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;disposal&rdquo; came to me specifically from the scientific community. It may be assumed that when waste is disposed of it has to be &ldquo;handled&rdquo; somehow, mechanically or manually. The scientific community felt that in view of the importance of this and of the way industrialists and other large concerns have been able to get around legislation in the past we must be specific in saying that this applies to the handlers as well as to the disposers and often they are two different people.  In case the legal people are given a field day in defining exactly who does the handling and who does the disposing they would like the two kept <Col N="1160" /> together and that we would refer to the handling and the disposal rather than just the disposal which is too weak if it was challenged legally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated on Committee Stage that this amendment, if adopted, would lead to every householder and shopkeeper in the country coming within the ambit of the agency. Such control is clearly a matter not for the agency but for local authorities.  The handling of waste by activities licensed by the agency could, of course, be the subject of conditions attached to a licence under Part IV of the Act, Subsection (1) (k) of section 81 provides the conditions in a licence may specify the nature of treatment to be applied to waste and the manner in which it shall be held or disposed of.  I consider this adequately covers the point at issue.  In other words, the handling of waste by licensed activities can be regulated by the agency attaching appropriate conditions to the licence.</P>
      <P>The points made by Senator Doyle in moving her amendment in relation to the handling of industrial or agricultural waste &mdash; I accept the points she has made and particularly the legal implications &mdash; are matters which will be dealt with in the context of the new waste Bill which is currently being drafted in the Department. To include &ldquo;handling&rdquo; here would bring every householder who handles or produces waste and every shopkeeper and so on under the ambit of this agency. I do not think that is desirable nor is it the intention.</P>
      <P>In the definitions section of the Bill, the definition of &ldquo;disposal&rdquo; reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;disposal&rdquo;, in relation to waste, includes the collection, sorting, carriage, treatment, storage and tipping above or under ground, and the transformation operations necessary for its recovery, reuse or recycling;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was one of the reasons I suspected that I knew what the Minister was going to say to me but I may be wrong.  When we discused this the Minister said: &ldquo;I will be happy on Report Stage to accept the amendment in this form, or words to this effect, if that is in order&rdquo;.  The Minister put down an amendment which deals in a far more limited fashion with the same issue.  This amendment suggests that the definition of the best available technology not entailing excessive costs should be as it is there:</P>
      <P>to prevent, limit, eliminate, abate or reduce an emission from an activity shall be construed as meaning the provision and proper maintenance, use, operation and supervision of facilities which, having regard to all the circumstances, are the most suitable for the purpose.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to insert after &ldquo;circumstances&rdquo; the simple phrase, &ldquo;in particular the need to prevent environmental pollution&rdquo;.  That is a position that has been expressed very vigorously to me by people who work in the chemical industry, among other areas, that it is important to make it clear that the objective of BATNEEC is to prevent environmental pollution.  The Minister's amendment No. 7 is a somewhat narrower understanding because it applies largely to a clarification of what constitutes &ldquo;costs&rdquo;.  It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1162" />&ldquo;...after &ldquo;costs&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;, having regard to the risk of significant environmental pollution which, in the opinion of the Agency, or any other licensing authority is relation to section 108, exists&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is a rather subtle but important distinction. One is an assessment of risk of pollution which is what the Minister has in mind and the other is a statement of principle about what we are about.  They are not the same thing.</P>
    <P>They are not the sort of thing with which I want to take up the time of the House but I do not believe that an elaboration on what is meant by &ldquo;excessive costs&rdquo; can be taken as stating that the objective of the best available technology is to minimise environmental pollution.  I do not believe they are the same thing, particularly the assessment of risk.  Risk is a balance of probabilities.  It involves two things.  It involves, first, the likelihood of something happening and secondly, the scale of the damage that will be caused by that happening.  If you want to get a risk index the usual way is to multiply the probability by the number of casualties and that gives a risk index which can be used, in my view, somewhat spuriously to quantify things that are still at such a primitive state that they cannot be quantified.</P>
    <P>The principle contained in subsection (1) is an attempt, albeit a somewhat limited attempt, to define BATNEEC and which makes it clear that the principal overall objective is to accept the need to prevent environmental pollution, not to reduce the risks, not to change the risks or to limit the risks but to prevent environmental pollution.  That is what we discussed on Committee Stage.  That is what the Minister said she accepted and I, for one, must say that I do not think her amendment meets those objectives. It meets a separate objective which is to ensure that costs are judged in terms of the risk and that is a very different matter.  Adjudicating cost for prevention against risk is one thing, but stating the principle that the objective of all of this is to prevent environmental pollution is <Col N="1163" /> a much more global concern of which assessment of risk in terms of ultimate cost is a specific example, but it is not the same thing.  That is why I move this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I second amendment No. 6.  In doing so I would like the Minister to put on record the answers to a few questions.  Who will define the concept of &ldquo;excessive cost&rdquo;?  Excessive relative to what?  At what price environmental protection? At what price the protection of human health?  Excessive costs in relation to a greenfield operation are totally different to what may be considered excessive costs when retro fitting an existing plant that needs updating or modern technology applied to it or scrubbers installed in the emissions stack or whatever. We need to be more specific.  I recall our discussing this here before.  Any new factory, industry or major agri-industry being established should use the best available technology full stop.  I think there is an argument for adding the rider &ldquo;not entailing excessive costs&rdquo; when we are retro fitting.  I would like the Minister's views on this.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with two totally different situations.  We could put an existing industry, large or small, out of business if we insisted on best available technology with no regard to the costs when installing some environmentally friendly piece of technology that is now demanded by ourselves or by the international community generally.  That argument will not apply when a new industry is looking for planning permission, looking for licensing, probably going to a greenfield situation to start up.  We have to define the two totally different scenarios and I would like to hear the Minister's views and they should go on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who will define the concept of &ldquo;excessive cost&rdquo; and how will it be defined? Interestingly, BATNEEC as a concept was not included in the Water Pollution (Amendment) Bill when applying to farmers and the environmental improvements demanded of them.  The excessive cost was not a consideration.  I am not <Col N="1164" /> saying that is right or wrong.  I am stating it as a fact that we are being inconsistent in terms of our environmental legislation, particularly given farm incomes at the moment.  If you relate excessive cost to the profitability of the operation, there would be no environmental protection work done at all by our farmers.  Can we pick and choose and decide when it suits us to add the concept of excessive cost to the technology we are demanding of the different sectors, or where is the line drawn in all of this?</P>
    <P>Am I right in saying that I may not speak on the Minister's amendment when she puts it?  Is that correct?</P>

      <P>I just wanted guidance on that.  In relation to the Minister's amendment, I welcome it in so far as it does what it is intended to do but it is slightly different from what Senator Ryan's amendment, and indeed the amendments in Senator Naughten's name that have not been moved, tried to do.  I welcome the Minister's linking section 108 in terms of not always insisting on BATNEEC for bio-engineering projects of one kind of another.  BATNEEC and bio-engineering would be very dangerous bedfellows and I have difficulty in relation to section 108 and why it is tagged on to this legislation at all.  A home had to be found for it because of European Directives. Section 108 does not refer to the agency at all whereas section 5 does refer to the concept of BATNEEC as applied to the agency's activities.  I am not so sure how an amendment of section 5 will be in order in relation to section 108 which is <Col N="1165" /> a totally different area of environmental protection altogether and has no relationship to the agency.  I would like that clarified. I assume the Minister is well advised in what she is doing.</P>
      <P>I welcome very much the relaxing of the BATNEEC concept as I understand her to be doing in her amendment.  I await her explanation, which I still have not had.  In amendment No. 7, she is relaxing the BATNEEC concept as it applies to bio-engineering and the handling of genetically modified organisms and that area of research and development generally. The implications for the human race and the environment generally of over-restricting costs and not having sufficient controls in this area are enormous and one could relax controls by crying &ldquo;excessive costs&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If I understand what the Minister's amendment intends to do I welcome it but I am worried about the connection of section 108 to an amendment in section 5 given that section 108 has nothing to do with the Environmental Protection Agency at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment arises from the debate on Committee Stage, the amendment by Senator Brendan Ryan concerning section 5 and, in particular, the criteria to be used by the agency in devising BATNEECs for new activities. There was concern that in determining the particular measures appropriate to such a BATNEEC the obligations on the agency to ensure that any measures it imposes do not entail excessive costs may result in the cost implications associated with the application of a BATNEEC becoming the dominant factor to the extent that the risk of environmental pollution arising may not be accorded sufficient weight.  I am satisfied that these fears are groundless because subsection (2) (a) (ii) obliges the agency when drawing up a BATNEEC in respect of a new activity to have regard to the requirement of environmental protection.  Also under section 80, the agency may not licence an activity which would breach any air or water quality standard in existance or <Col N="1166" /> cause significant environmental pollution.</P>
      <P>Central to this Bill is the attempt to achieve a proper balance between the need to protect the environment and the need for economic and social development. The use of BATNEEC is one of the means through which these objectives can be secured.  However, to show my good faith in this matter, I have tabled this amendment which specifically provides that environmental protection must receive the proper consideration in determining BATNEECs for new activities.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Ryan's amendment the parliamentary draftsman has considered the proposed addition contained in these amendments and confirmed that if adopted it would only lead to confusion as to what is entailed.  Subsection (1) makes it clear that BATNEEC is used to prevent, limit, eliminate, abate or reduce an emission from an activity.  To put in a new clause related to the prevention element would only lead to confusion about what is intended and does not add anything to the requirement of what a BATNEEC is to achieve.  It is most important in considering the BATNEEC requirements to have regard to how it is used. In the licensing process it is only one of many matters to be considered by the agency under section 80 and it is the combination of these provisions that will determine the conditions under which a licence can be given.  A licence cannot be granted by the agency unless it is satisfied that all of the conditions included in the six paragraphs under subsection (3) are complied with as well as taking into account the requirements of section 80 (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The adoption of the amendment proposed by Senator Ryan would blur the clear direction to the agency in section 80 that significantly polluting activities are not to be licensed.  There is no question of us allowing a situation to develop where the prevention of significant pollution is to be considered in the context of cost effectiveness in so far as the polluter is concerned.  BATNEEC comes into play where emissions exist which do <Col N="1167" /> not cause significant pollution but which could be further limited using the best available technology taking account of costs.</P>
    <P>In relation to Senator Doyle's query about who will define &ldquo;excessive costs&rdquo; that will, of course, be a matter for the agency who I think are the most appropriate body to decide it.  The provisions referring to section 108 are being included to strengthen the section because the agency may not be the licensing authority for section 108.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan had two amendments on Committee Stage and, while I am not accepting one of them because I think it would confuse the definition already included in section 5 (1), I believe the second amendment which I am more or less accepting makes it quite clear that we must take into account the implications for environmental protection and we must ensure that the costs have regard to the implications for creating or causing significant environmental pollution.  I think it very clearly defines that costs are not to be taken in isolation in respect of the implications as far as the environmental pollution are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to say I am not happy and it is not the first time in my career that I have been unhappy with the parliamentary draftsperson.  Section 5 (1) reads &ldquo;the best available technology not entailing excessive costs to prevent, limit, eliminate, abate or reduce an emission... &ldquo;It does not say: &ldquo;the best available technology to prevent an emission&rdquo;. It does not say &ldquo;the best available technology to limit an emission, to eliminate an emission, to abate an emission.&rdquo;  It is a series of alternatives, the least of which is: &ldquo;or reduce an emission&rdquo;.  That is what the best available technology not entailing excessive costs is required to do under subsection (1).  Subsection (2) reads:</P>
      <P>in the case of an activity other than an established activity&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the current state of technical knowledge,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1168" /> (ii)  the requirements of environmental protection,</P>
    <P>Everybody is in favour of the requirements of environmental protection. Nobody is against environmental protection. The point is that as subsection (1) stands all you need is the best available technology to perhaps just reduce an emission.  It is a matter of choice by the agency which is necessary.</P>
    <P>My amendment, on the other hand, which I introduced on Committee Stage said: &ldquo;in particular, the need to prevent environmental pollution&rdquo;.  In other words, it says that in terms of looking at the definitions of &ldquo;reduce, limit, abate&rdquo;, for instance, it has kept in mind that its objective is to prevent environmental pollution, not simply to reduce an emission.</P>
    <P>The definition as it stands gives a series of alternatives ranging from the magnificently perfect &ldquo;prevent&rdquo; to the less than happy reference to &ldquo;reduce&rdquo;. &ldquo;Reduce&rdquo; could be simply reduce from a very unacceptable level to a less unacceptable level.  It does not meet the objective which should be to prevent environmental pollution and that is why, at the request of a considerable number of people and on my own initiative ultimately, I suggested the insertion after&rdquo; circumstances&rdquo; that the overriding objective of the best available technology not entailing excessive costs must be the need to prevent environmental pollution, not to reduce emissions, not to abate emissions, but to prevent environmental pollution.  It gives a series of options.  I agree they are somewhat constrained by the later provisions but they are not the same thing.</P>
    <P>The second point relates to standards. I have an OECD paper here from the OECD <i>Observer</i> on chemicals, in which is perfectly clear as anybody knows that in respect of huge numbers of chemicals we still do not know whether they are toxic or at what levels they are toxic. We will come back to this on a later amendment.  Therefore standards, particularly standards as set in this country, are set for only a limited number <Col N="1169" /> of substances.  There are thousands and thousands of substances in use and if you were to get into the area of something like an incinerator in operation and products of incomplete combustion you would be into thousands of substances that were not even thought up until you started to run incinerators at high temperatures. You must have an overriding philosophy in this, and it must be the prevention of environmental pollution, not the reduction of emissions, not the sort of strange notion the manager of environmental policy from the IDA has that there is a distinction between contamination and pollution which is a new one in my lexicon.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the parliamentary draftsperson's view that the insertion of <Col N="1170" /> my amendment would in any way cause confusion.  What it would do would be to make it clear that all these other terms, particularly the reduction of an emission or the limitation of an emission must be seen in the context of the overall need to prevent environmental pollution.  Otherwise, it can be according to some other yardstick less than the one which we claim to want, which is to prevent environmental pollution.  Therefore, I am not at all happy to withdraw this amendment.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 7:</P>
    <P>In page 11, line 12, after &ldquo;costs&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;, having regard to the risk of significant environmental pollution which, in the opinion of the Agency, or <Col N="1171" /> any other licensing authority in relation to section 108, exists&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) the provisions of paragraph (b) shall only apply for a period of five years from the coming into operation of this section.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On the question of the best available technology not entailing excessive cost, BATNEEC for short, the Bill makes a distinction between established activity and other activities.  Established activity, while I can understand its problems, cannot be allowed to go on for ever not meeting standards.  The Minister when I introduced this amendment on Committee Stage, agreed, and I quote &ldquo;to discuss with my advisers the implications of putting in a time limit&rdquo;.  I put down this amendment to make sure we received the fruits of the Minister's discussions with her advisers about a time limit.  We cannot have sloppy industries who are, unfortunately, mostly indigenous and many of which are traditional, producing unacceptable standards of emission forever more.  There has to be a set period at the end of which all industries will attain the same standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a danger that subsection (2) (b) could leave us with unacceptable levels of emission for an indefinite period. Many people in this country have suffered appallingly from smells from well-established, traditional industries and it is time we got this sorted out.  An industry that cannot clean up its act in terms of the safety and health of its workforce and of the environment is going to end up in a mess anyway.  It is possible to run industries cleanly and the obligation to be clean, efficient and safe usually brings in its wake a considerable increase in staff <Col N="1172" /> training, industrial productivity, housekeeping, inventory control, in all of those things which ultimately produce, to coin a phrase I would not be associated with, &ldquo;a learner, fitter industry&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The requirement to meet high levels of environmental standards, as with the requirements to meet high levels of safety, does not put many industries out of business; it actually makes many industries more efficient.  I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is formally seconded. Senator Ryan makes a valid point when he seeks to set a time limit before which the existing industries are required to clean up their act.  I am not sure whether it should be five years or longer but a definite time limit should be set.  In these situations one trades off the consequences of damaging the environment and the implications of such damage for the economy against closing down or restricting an inefficient industry which cannot get its act together and which, in the heel of the hunt, will probably go under.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the mover and seconder of this motion; A finite length of time should be specified.  Five years may be a little short but I take the point that we have to get on with it quickly and that we have tolerated low standards and sloppy procedures for too long from many industries both foreign and indigenous. If we are to get a name in this country for insisting on standards in relation to industry of all kinds and their operation, cleaning up of the act of existing industries must be given priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am still unclear as to how the concept of BATNEEC is going to be applied to existing industries.  Will the costs be considered excessive relative to the annual balance sheet of the company or to the amount of environmental damage that would otherwise be done if such a procedure were not carried out?  How will <Col N="1173" /> the concept of excessive cost be measured? If a company obviously cannot pay because it is only ticking along, perhaps marginally profitable, and yet if damage is being inflicted on the environment by the company not introducing modern technology of one kind or another, which side will win in that case?  Will the company have to retrofit and apply modern technology particularly to incineration or scrubber stacks and so on or can they plead lack of profitability and get away with not applying the technology deemed necessary for the industry which would be demanded if that company were setting up today in a greenfield situation?</P>
    <P>I wonder will the &ldquo;Moneypoints&rdquo; be able to cry forever that they cannot afford to instal proper scrubbers, etc. because the Irish public cannot afford to have their electricity bills increased by 2 or 4 per cent to pay for what should have been installed when the station was being established?  Will we continue to say that our contribution from Moneypoint to the sulphur being deposited in northern Europe is 0.1 per cent so we are only minor contributors to the acid rain problems of northern and central Europe and do not have to update our technology? What is the basis for deciding or measuring what is excessive in terms of cost? How long more will we be able to make an argument for the sloppy standards we have always tolerated as a small poor country which cannot afford to pay, or will we demand the standards that Europe is now insisting upon and that other countries have demanded?</P>
    <P>For a long time we have clapped ourselves on the back and heaped words upon words about the tourist potential of our country.  We all believe there is a great future in tourism for our country, particularly for activity holidays, because basically we are an unpolluted, environmentally pure country.  We say that on the one hand and on the other hand we make excuses and accept sloppy environmental standards, justify marginal activities and do not demand standards which are demanded elsewhere.  We need straight thinking and talking on this instead of using one argument when it <Col N="1174" /> suits us and another when excessive costs might creep into the issue.  I would like clarification in this area regarding existing plants that are not meeting present acceptable standards, which standards may be deemed unacceptable in the next year or two.  As standards become stricter we will have to look even more closely at existing industries to see how with retrofitting they may reduce their emission levels to the standards demanded of them.</P>
    <P>I await with interest the Minister's response in relation to what the excessive cost factor will be measured against.  If a company genuinely cannot pay, what sort of grant aid or grant structures can be put in place so that the standards can be improved in the industry concerned? What procedures will the Environmental Protection Agency use to look at old industries not meeting acceptable standards today?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Senator Doyle's question about BATNEEC and who will decide, this will be a matter to be decided by the agency.  It will not be decided on a company by company basis but rather on a sectoral basis; BATNEEC will be prescribed for a sector and all companies within that sector will have to be able to subscribe to the BATNEEC principle, as it were.  That may mean, in some cases, that the financial requirements would be too much but it will certainly be a sectoral rather than an individual approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  BATNEEC will be prescribed by the agency on a sector by sector basis.  That is how this principle is applied, not only here but elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the amendment moved by Senator Ryan and the discussion we had on Committee Stage, I am anxious that as soon as possible all existing activities under the First Schedule would be licensed and monitored by the agency. Senator Ryan and other Senators both today and on the last Stage made the <Col N="1175" /> point that in many cases existing older activities cause most of the problems rather than newer industries where the standards and technology seem to be higher.  I am still examining the implications for different sectors of improving a specific time limit and I have not finalised my investigation in relation to this matter.  I am weighing up the financial costs for individual plant and activities or industries and the economic cost and what might be a reasonable time period. I am going to have to leave this matter to the debate in the other House because I was not in a position to finalise my investigations.</P>
    <P>I have one problem about the amendment that is proposed here: if BATNEEC is to apply to all existing activities within five years new activities licensed by the Agency, who have put in the best available technology and so on and are operating to a high standard, regardless of the environmental implications, would have to change their technology within a period as short as four or five years when their licence was reviewed, because the best available technology would obviously have improved in the intervening period. There is certainly a problem about applying a time limit to the concept of the best available technology being applied to existing activities.  All new activities will be existing activities within that period and therefore when their licences are reviewed, even though they are relatively new, they would have to totally update their technology which would be unreasonable.</P>
    <P>In relation to BATNEEC it is important to remember that that is only one of six criteria that the agency will have to enforce when they are deciding on a licence application.  It is not a matter of give a licence and apply BATNEEC. That is merely one aspect covered in section 80.  Many of the points raised by the Senators are covered adequately under the six provisions listed under section 80 of the Bill in relation to the licensing operation.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to accept this <Col N="1176" /> amendment and I understand that there is no country where new arrangements of this kind are applied across the board to existing activities.  It is not contained in the European Directives, nor does it apply in the industrial plant directive or whatever because of the serious implications of applying it broadly across the board.  I hope Senators will accept my bona fides in that I am still examining this matter and I am sorry I was not in a position to conclude my examination. This matter and the relationship between licensing and the planning system are two matters that I am going to have to leave over to the other House because of the time factor involved and because of the huge implications in trying to finalise the arrangements in relation to them.  Obviously a Bill of this size is going to come back to this House in any event; it is unlikely that a Bill of this complexity will go through the other House without amendment.  It is not a matter of trying to get away from the subject without the intention of coming back again to discuss it and other matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since my amendment mentions a period of years and since I would not dream of being dogmatic about it, I could not have insisted on this amendment because I would not argue about whether the period should be four, five or six years.  When one realises how little we know, particularly in the area of chemicals, we cannot allow a perpetual time lag to contnue.  We have had this until now and from the ESB we have had quite distorted publicity in which they suggested that the entire capital cost of retro-fitting sulphur dioxide scrubbers at Moneypoint would have to be carried in one year's electricity bills.  If they were to tell us that the entire capital costs of the generating programme were to be charged on one year's electricity bills we would have some astronomical figure.  It was quite misleading of them to suggest that the whole £400 million would be slapped on everybody's ESB bills next Monday to be paid for over a year or a month or six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is inadequate to say that we only <Col N="1177" /> produce a tiny per cent of European sulpher dioxide; we probably produce as much as anybody else and probably in five year's time when others have imposed more stringent standards we will produce more per head than anybody else, so there is a need to impose restrictions now.  The evidence is that with the exception of a move to a completely unregulated Third World country, there is no real premium for the chemical industry to move from one OECD or EC country or any of the major developed nations to another because of differing environmental standards.  It is a game they play to persuade Governments not to regulate them excessively but large sections of the chemical and pharmaceutical industry are so profitable that the difference in standards imposed between one country and another is not going to be a major deterrent to investment.  To suggest that our insisting on the highest possible standards would deter industries from coming here is a story they would love to put about, but it is not true.  Sections of industry wear two hats; with one hat they say they are prepared to do everything necessary to meet the highest possible international standards and with the other hat on they say that facilities such as the planning appeal procedure which is part of any civilised legislation should be severely restricted.</P>
    <P>I am happy to withdraw the amendment and to leave it to the undoubted good will of the Minister to deal with this issue and we can discuss it when the inevitable amendments come back from the other House, though they will hardly be able to surpass our wisdom, I suspect.</P>

      <P>In the interests of moving through the business fairly quickly and given that the Minister's amendment is a reasonable attempt to meet our requirements, I would like to withdraw my amendment and leave it to the Minister to move her amendment.

      <P>&ldquo;(4) Where a person has been convicted of an offence under this Act the court may order that person to remedy (or pay for the remedying of) any damage caused to the environment by the offence.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am just checking the exact relationship between my amendment and amendments Nos. 16, 79 and 105.  The principle in amendment No. 13 is quite obvious. In relation to environmental pollution or destruction of the environment, those of us with an interest in this area over the years have been preaching the principle of &ldquo;the polluter pays&rdquo;.  My amendment attempts to nail that principle into the legislation before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> Section 9 of the Bill deals reasonably adequately with penalties, but penalties in themselves will not restore a river that has been polluted, advertently or inadvertently, by the discharge of some substance into it that has caused major damage to the river and to the life therein. I do not think there is really any need for me to develop the point I am making at length but I feel very strongly that the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle must be nailed into this legislation.  I wait with interest to hear the Minister's response.  May I reserve the right to come back after the Minister has spoken on her amendment before I respond to my own amendment? Perhaps we could take the substance of all of these amendments together and perhaps I will be satisfied at that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendments arise from a commitment I gave on Committee Stage to come back on Report Stage with regard to empowering the courts to oblige a polluter to remedy the damage caused by his or her pollution and also in relation to civil liability arising from pollution. There are already adequate provisions of this nature in the legislation governing water pollution and any powers under that legislation can be transferred to the agency by virtue of section 97 of this Bill. I consider that if a similar power is to be provided in relation to air pollution or waste, the power should be included in the basic legislation in relation to all activities and not just those for which the agency will be responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there are already considerable remedies provided in the Air Pollution Act, 1987 in relation to air pollution, I have decided to amend it to incorporate similar provisions to those in the water pollution legislation in relation to civil liability and to remedying damage.  The amendments I am proposing will provide for the inclusion of these provisions in the Air Pollution Act.  The agency can be given any powers necessary under the Air Pollution Act by virtue of the provisions <Col N="1181" /> of section 98 of this Bill.  The amendment to section 80 (7) of the Bill is necessary to ensure that persons complying with an Environmental Protection Agency licence are not open to proceedings under the new section which my amendment inserts into the Air Polution Act.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, a comprehensive Waste Bill is in preparation in my Department.  That Bill will be the appropriate place for bringing forward any necessary provisions in relation to remedying damages for civil liability in relation to waste.  In that connection also, provision will be made to ensure the agency can be given any appropriate powers included in the Waste Bill.</P>
    <P>I believe the principles I have outlined, of making appropriate provisions in the basic environmental legislation as to remedying damage by polluters, are the correct ones and will deal with the issues raised on Committee Stage.  For this reason Senators Doyle and Naughten's amendments are inappropriate and for the same reason, the proposed amendments to the Air Pollution Act are, therefore, appropriate.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 16, to delete lines 13 to 18.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a time when discussion in many areas is about product liability and when consulting engineers and people who give <Col N="1182" /> professional advice are beginning to realise that the incorrectness of their advice, particularly where negligence can be demonstrated, may result in legal proceedings against them, I find it astonishing that we could have a section in this Bill which says:</P>
    <P>No action or other proceedings shall lie or be maintainable against the Agency or any body referred to in section 43 or 44 for the recovery of damages in respect of an injury to persons, damage to property or other loss alleged to have been caused or contributed to by a failure to perform or to comply with any of the functions conferred on the said Agency or body.</P>
    <P>All I want to ask is, why?  I am quite prepared to accept that, if the agency does its best with goodwill and with reasonable <i>bona fides</i>, then, it cannot be blamed for the unforeseen consequences of the fact that, as the OECD will say, the toxicity of thousands of chemicals is not clearly known or understood. However, to suggest that there should be a blanket immunity for the agency irrespective of what it does, irrespective of its own incompetence or otherwise, seems to me to be going too far in the direction of protecting them from normal redress.  If the Environmental Protection Agency makes a fundamental blunder and, as a result, people suffer, I cannot understand why they should not have to face the consequences of that blunder if it is a result of negligence.  If a member of the medical profession, a consulting engineer or anybody else acting in a professional capacity, gives somebody advice which turns out to be the wrong advice and if there is a case which suggests that they are negligent in that advice, in other words, that they did not show a proper standard of professional expertise or knowledge, then they can be held legally liable for it.  I do not understand why the agency cannot have a similar liability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides that the agency will be immune from any <Col N="1183" /> legal proceedings for recovery of damages arising from a failure to perform its functions.  It does not give immunity against negligent performance of functions. Similar immunity is granted to any other bodies, such as the local authority or other public authority, when providing services under sections 43 and 44.  This proposal is not unique as there is a similar provision in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.</P>
      <P>The range of functions under the Bill is so broad that, if the immunity from legal action as a result of a failure to perform a function provided for in this section were not included, it would leave the agency, or bodies acting on its behalf, exposed to a succession of law suits which could be damaging, and not only financially. It would also affect, adversely, both the ability of the agency to carry out its functions and the credibility and standing of the agency and the other bodies involved.  Without this provision, the agency could easily become the fall guy where serious pollution occurs, given the doctrine of joint and several liability which applies in Irish law.</P>
      <P>If this section were to be deleted it would mean, for example, that if a company licensed by the agency were to fail in some way to do what it was required to do, the agency could be joined in any legal suit against that licensed body or activity.  That would be unfair.  It would be making the agency responsible for things it had no responsibility for.  It would be unfair and damaging both to the credibility of the agency and to any body or group of people working on behalf of the agency.  It does not mean that the agency cannot be sued if it is negligent or if it performs its functions in a negligent fashion.  That is different.  Obviously, one would not want to see immunity from that, but it does mean that the agency should not and cannot be joined in a law suit for something for which it cannot or could not have responsibility.</P>

      <P>The fact that this provision exists elsewhere does not impress me in the least.  The Minister discussed <Col N="1184" /> the broad issue arising if the agency did not do some of the things it was supposed to do.  Either it has a legal obligation to do them or it has not.  If it has a legal obligation to do something then it should do it or take the consequences.  It should not have any discretion.  We are not talking about negligence.  The Minister said the agency had many functions and if it did not do something it was supposed to do, then it could be sued.  I do not see why this should not be so.</P>
      <P>The question of where it issues a licence and what will happen if the industry does not meet the standards of that licence could be dealt with by a specific provision.  It would be reasonable to argue that the agency had met its legal obligation by issuing a licence which was of an acceptable standard and which was based on BATNEEC.  To suggest that, because there is a possibility that it might not do something it is legally obliged to do we should give it an immunity from prosecution and an immunity from suit, seems to me to be meaningless.  It is the classic way in which we, in this country, protect the State from the consequences of legal obligations other people have to carry.</P>
      <P>Let me remind the Minister that the fact that I may not be aware of my legal obligations in any area, and may not therefore fulfil them, does not make me immune from the due process of law.  I am expected to meet all the standards in every area that the law sets down.  If I did not know about them or forgot about them or did not get around to meeting them, I would not be excused.  I would still be liable.  If I forget to tax my car for two months I can be prosecuted, although it does not cause any threat to anybody, and is not a criminal offence.  The fact that I have a hundred other things to do, that I spend two days a week in Dublin and that I am very busy, does not give me the least excuse for not doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am not going to push this amendment to a division, the justification the Minister gave for this section is far from convincing.  It should be possible to write a section which would make it clear that other people's actions could not be <Col N="1185" /> the basis for suing the agency.  That is not the same as giving the agency a blanket exemption which says that, if it does nothing in many areas, nobody can take any action against it.  That is effectively what the section says.</P>
    <P>I know there are similar provisions in other legislation; perhaps it is a standard section that goes into many Bills but that is no reason for having it here.  In fact it is a reason for taking it out.  It is not justifiable in common sense or in my layman's knowledge of the law.  It should be possible to draft a section which ensures the agency will not be prosecuted or sued for other people's failures to do things the agency tells them to do.  It should not be possible for the agency to fail to do things because of lack of resources, time or inclination, and then say &ldquo;we cannot be sued&rdquo;.  I do not regard that as logical or rational.  Having said that, because I do not want to delay the House unnecessarily, I do not propose to push the amendment to a division.</P>

      <P>We discussed this amendment and others in some detail.  It concerns the overall composition of the committee referred to in section 21.  I retabled this amendment to make a point.  The list before us consisting of the Secretary to the Government, the Secretary of the Department of the Environment, the chairperson of the Council of An Taisce, the managing director of the IDA, the general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the chief executive of the Council of Status of Women could be improved.  The chairman of the Confederation of Irish Industries would be a very worthy addition to the committee, instead of the managing director of the IDA or with him, depending on the Minister's preference. I would like to see a strong voice of private industry represented, for balance. That sector is extremely keen to be on the right side of all environmental protection arguments.  They are the people who need to be at the table.  They really need to listen and offer their opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister would suggest an alternative to the chairman of the Confederation of Irish Industries I would <Col N="1187" /> certainly listen, but I feel, at the moment, the balance as listed in the Bill is not correct and I would urge the Minister to consider my amendment favourably.</P>

      <P>The position of the managing director of the IDA is anomalous. There is a considerable need to have a <Col N="1188" /> representative of industry on this committee. I am quite happy about that. Many of the environmental lobbyists would argue that not only should there be representatives of industry but also a representative of agriculture so that the person appointed would be seen to have the support of a broad range of the interests that are affected by this legislation. The logic of including the managing director of the IDA escapes me.  In our society, the IDA is a major player, which defends its own patch and its own areas of activity with considerable vigour. It may well have lobbied very effectively to have itself parachuted in here.</P>
      <P>I have a small excerpt from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 21 June.  The headline is &ldquo;Perception of some industries `misguided&rdquo;'. It is a report of remarks by the IDA's environmental affairs manager who, I presume, articulates IDA policy on the area.  He says, for example:</P>
      <P>From the IDA's point of view we expect industry to meet the highest international standards.</P>
      <P>They do not, of course; they expect them to meet our standards, or indeed EC standards, not necessarily the highest international standards and for this reason we welcome the introduction of new legislation setting out their responsibilities.  Modern industry, and particularly pharmaceutical and chemical companies were more than willing to design and build plants to accommodate any environmental regulations.  What they found difficult to live with is the moving goal post scenario where additional and often substantially modified conditions are imposed, usually after an appeal has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems to me to be the IDA affirming its belief that planning appeals are a bad thing, something the former managing director has been known to say.  But then it goes on, and this is what I find absolutely breathtaking: &ldquo;Much of the contamination of the environment&rdquo;&mdash; I love this word, it is a new word &mdash;&ldquo;caused by industry was unavoidable and as long as <Col N="1189" /> man wished to eat and breathe he would continue to unavoidably contaminate his environment.  But this unavoidable contamination is not pollution.  The environment always has been and always will be capable of absorbing it&rdquo;.  That particular view of environmental pollution is about 25 years out of date.</P>
    <P>The problem is that this planet has far exceeded its capacity to absorb what this person calls contamination.  We cannot do it, which is why the chemical industry is moving towards clean technology, zero emissions, waste minimalisations, etc, The industry acknowledges what, apparently, the IDA do not acknowledge: that the capacity of this planet to absorb what this man called contamination has been far exceeded and we have to stop.  The point is that this is the view of the IDA. It is a protagonist with a far lesser degree of sophistication than that of industry, for instance.  It is not so long since the Federation of the Irish Chemical Industries had to dissociate itself from remarks by the previous managing director of the IDA about interest groups and environmental movements.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there is an overwhelming case for taking the IDA out of this arena, as Senator Doyle has said.  I would be quite happy to withdraw my own amendment in favour of hers except that I am afraid the term should be the president of the CII, rather than the chairman or chairperson, or perhaps the director general.  We can discuss that with the Minister.</P>
    <P>The IDA is a singularly inappropriate body to have represented on this committee. It is not an environmentally expert body.  It does not represent any large interest other than that of one State agency.  It does not speak for industry, as industry will tell you very quickly.  It is an anomaly to include the IDA.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions represents the interests of those who work in industry. An Taisce, perhaps excessively conservatively, represents nevertheless, the interests of the environment.  The Government have a considerable interest.  There is particularly good reason, given the loaded dice that women <Col N="1190" /> have to deal with, for having the chief executive of the Council for the Status of Women there &mdash; to remind what might be an exclusively male interview panel the subtle ways men have of excluding women will not be allowed to operate in this area.  I say that to make sure that Senator Murphy does not think he has a monopoly on views on that issue.</P>
    <P>I cannot see, and never could, the logic or the rationale of having the managing director of the IDA included, other than the perpetual insistence of the IDA to expand its brief to become a bigger and bigger player in Irish society.  That is a tendency which, in my own view, ought to be kept firmly under control.  What I propose to do, with your permission, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, is to withdraw my amendment and support Senator Doyle's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what Senator Ryan has just said &mdash; that he is withdrawing his own amendment and is supporting Senator Doyle's &mdash; I too support Senator Doyle's amendment.</P>
      <P>The balance in the composition of this committee is quite wrong.  It is loaded too much on the side of statutory bodies, Government Departments, etc.  I do not believe that the IDA has a proper role in this matter.  The IDA has a specific job, a specific function which it is always under pressure from the Government to perform &mdash; to produce more jobs.  It used to be &ldquo;jobs at any price&rdquo;.  That is probably not quite fair any longer, but it is still valid to a certain extent.  I do not believe the IDA has a strong conservation or environmental element in its composition which would, in that way, give a balanced input into this committee.  I would wholeheartedly support the deletion of the managing director of the IDA from this committee and support Senator Doyle's substitution of the chairman of the Confederation of Irish Industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave very careful consideration, when I was deciding on what group should be represented on the selection committee, to the fact that it is important that the agency, when established, have the greatest possible level of support within the country and be acceptable to the widest possible number of people.  It must be perceived to have balance, to be progressive and so on and not in any way perceived to be anti-development or anti-industry.  Therefore, since the agency would be licensing and monitoring a huge number of industrial activities I felt it was appropriate that a representative of industry would be involved at the selection procedure stage. Many representations were received. The Federation of Irish Chemical Industries felt that probably all the industries covered by their federation, or certainly a substantial number of them, would be licensed and monitored by the agency and that they should be the group on the selection committee.  The IFA and the farming sector believe they should be involved because agriculture and agri-business will be licensed and monitored by the agency and the same applies to the Confederation of Irish Industry.</P>
      <P>There are so many groups representing industry in its sectoral sense that it became impossible, quite honestly, to choose between them unless one was to have more than one representative industry. Then we would have a selection committee which would be unwieldy because we would have to balance it with additional people from the environmental sector.  Therefore, I felt in all the circumstances that the Industrial Development Authority are the Authority responsible for industrial development in Ireland.  They are a cross-sectoral organisation in that they are responsible for industrial development activity in the agri-food sector and the agri-business sector, in the chemical and pharmaceutical sector and in industry generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> Many points were made by Senators in relation to the environmental attitude of the IDA.  It is particularly important in the context of future development &mdash; whatever about past developments &mdash; that the IDA recognise the huge environmental asset of our clean environment and that industry is promoted and encouraged here on the basis of being environmental friendly.  It is also important that the IDA take on the environmental agenda and that it becomes part of their job and, equally, that they become involved in the whole environmental protection debate.  It will be good for the IDA and for the environment to have that Authority involved in the selection procedure of the new Environmental Protection Agency.  I believe that in seeking to encourage industry here and in promoting this country as a place suitable for industrial development, the IDA will be very much aware of their environmental responsibilities because their chief executive will be part and parcel of the group selecting the new agency.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances and trying, as we were, to get a balance and have a group that would reflect the community at large &mdash; I will not go into the merits or otherwise of having a chairperson of the Commission for the Status of Women there because I do not want to open up that whole debate again &mdash; I believe the selection committee is very broad based. It is very representative and that is important. The board of the agency will essentially comprise people with environmental or scientific expertise, who are capable of issuing licences, of monitoring the very strict conditions attached, of dealing with very technical, industrial processes and so on.  They will be very much a committee selecting professionals, they will not be a committee selecting environmentalists.  Obviously they will use in their recruiting procedure the assistance of professional recruiting companies and so on to help them in that task.  It will be difficult to get the kind of balance required to do the very comprehensive job being given to this agency.</P>
    <P>I believe in all the circumstances, with all the representations and the lobbying <Col N="1193" /> to have different groups represented, that we have got the balance right.  Those with whom I have argued on the environmental side generally have accepted that, although they may have some misgivings. The same applies to industry.  Obviously, everybody would prefer to be the person or group chosen but, on balance, most people with whom I have discussed this are happy that we have a good balance and that is what is important.</P>
    <P>I believe the committee will act very much as a group, that they will come together and be dynamic within that committee in the task that has ben given to them.  In the circumstances, it would be inappropriate to start changing the proposed selection committee now.  It would again bring back the lobbying in favour of the different sectoral interests to which I referred on Committee Stage.  Therefore, I regret I am not in a position to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret the Minister's response to the amendment before her.  I ask her to cast her eye again on the list of the committee as set out in section 21.  The private sector is not represented at all, the sector who will have to put its money where its mouth is and the sector we will be looking at to invest and create jobs in industries throughout the country.  Apart from the chairperson of An Taisce &mdash; and that will be an individual representing An Taisce who could not be said to represent private sectoral interests in relation to industry and, indeed, the chief executive of the Council for the Status of Women and we know who their present incumbent is but we really do not know who will hold that position in future years &mdash; one cannot say that the private sector is represented at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The private sector &mdash; dare I say it &mdash; probably causes the greatest problem in this whole area.  It is essential that the <Col N="1194" /> sector is tied in, that their representative, whether president, chairman or chief executive officer or whatever the correct title of the head of the CII is represented on this committee.  The CII can represent the chemical industries and the various other groups under their umbrella.  I have no difficulty or concern about one group or another being appointed provided the boss of the umbrella body representing industry in Ireland who put their money where their mouth is is represented. There is the Secretary of the Government, the Secretary of the Department of the Environment, the IDA, ICTU, the Council for the Status of Women and An Taisce, which, if you like, are in the private sector but they are not putting money into industry.  None of these sectors represent industrial investment in our country the type of sector we need to get round the table and to ensure that they are on side.  They are the type of industry attracted to this country, and that policy generally will suit environmental protection policy.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly that there will be a huge omission on the committee as long as the chairman or the president of the CII is not represented.  I do not mind whether the Minister adds that person to the list or substitutes the president of the CII for the managing director of the IDA. I will not fall out with her on that; I will not quibble if she feels it is important to keep the IDA at the table.  However, it is essential that private sectoral interests are represented and that the sector we will look to for most of the investment in our country to create sustainable jobs, jobs that will respect the environment in which they are located, is around the table as a member of that committee.  I urge the Minister to reconsider this matter.</P>

      <P>In response to amendments from a number of Senators on Committee Stage which sought to reduce the interim term of directors to six months, I undertook to introduce an amendment on Report Stage to reduce the period to nine months.  The amendment meets the Senators' concern half way and I believe that the maximum term of nine months will allow the Minister the flexibility necessary to deal with vacancies on the board of the agency while meeting the concerns of Senators who fear that the interim director provision could be abused by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am happy to move this amendment but I will not be pressing it because the Minister's amendment, which is coupled with ours, effectively takes on board the point I was making in discussing section 30 on Committee Stage.  I would like to thank the Minister, because I felt very strongly at the time that without including the concept of consent and consultation with the employee and his or union representation there could be a situation where people could find themselves working for a different sector in the public service.  I have no doubt what this was intended to do: it was really to facilitate Joe Rea and the hiving off of perhaps Johnstown Castle to the Environmental Protection Agency.  I am quite sure that the employees down there would not object to it but the principle of consent of the employees who have given good and loyal service to a sector of the public service for many years should be nailed into the legislation.  That is what my amendment intended to do and indeed the Minister's amendment does it even better.  I am happy not to press my amendment and I will support the Minister's amendment, which is very welcome.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 43 not moved.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 44:</P>
    <P>In page 26, between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  A public authority shall not designate an employee under subsection (1) or (2), without having notified in writing the employee and any recognised trade unions or staff associations concerned, of its intention to do so and considered any representations made by him, or by them or by any of them, in relation to the matter within such time as may be specified in the notification.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment arises as a result of discussions on Committee Stage.  Senators Doyle, Naughten and O'Toole have put down amendments requiring consultations by a public authority with its staff or other representatives where employees were being designated for employment by the agency.  As I pointed out at the time, section 31 contained provisions to ensure that tenure, pay and terms and conditions of service for such employees will not be less favourable or less beneficial than before transfer to the agency.  It was never intended that consultations would not take place if sought.  No prudent employer refuses to talk with their staff or their representatives about matters affecting the employees' interests.  It is not necessary to write such a requirement into the legislation and it is not written into other similar type legislation setting up new bodies &mdash; the Marine Institute is a case in point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as Senators are aware, I have to be as positive as possible in meeting their concerns and I have accepted the principle of a considerable number of these amendments on Committee Stage in amendments now.  I promised to consider the concerns of Senators on Report <Col N="1204" /> Stage and I have brought forward a considerable number of Report Stage amendments on this basis.</P>
    <P>The amendment I am now proposing to section 32 will fully meet the points made by Senators in relation to consultation with employees and their representatives and require any representations made to be considered by the public authority concerned before any of its staff are designated for employment to the agency.  The wording in the amendment is fully in line with the wording in some similar type legislation, including, for example, the Labour Services Act, 1987, and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.  Where such a provision is being written into the legislation there is much to be said for maintaining the same wording.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposed for section 32 is on similar lines, but as there is a significant number of staff involved in the dissolution of An Foras Forbartha provision is being made for consultation with the relevant unions and staff associations rather than employees.  In the case of section 30 there might be only one employee or a small number involved and hence the provision for consultation with employees as well as their representatives. My amendments apply the substance of Senator Doyle's and Senator Naughten's amendments.</P>

      <P>In page 27, lines 20 and 21, to delete &ldquo;(other than those relating to tenure)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically, I would like to know from the Minister why conditions relating to tenure cannot be considered in the terms of conditions for staff when they have been transferred.  I am not quite sure <Col N="1205" /> exactly why the tenure has been specifically isolated and cannot be considered. Am I right in assuming that a public servant who had worked for 20 or 25 years for ACOT and now Teagasc could find himself now working for the Environmental Protection Agency, but the terms and conditions as regards tenure would date from day one of employment with the Environmental Protection Agency.  I would be obliged if the Minister could indicate why it was necessary to single out the conditions of service and have the words &ldquo;(other than those relating to tenure)&rdquo; specifically in this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding the amendment I must say I share Senator Doyle's concern.  I am intrigued as to why the exception is made for tenure.  Does it, for instance, mean that if someone leaves one of the established agencies and is employed by the Environmental Protection Agency that they go on probation again before they become permanent employees, or what does it mean?  Did one of the mysterious people in the draftsperson's office land this on the Minister's desk?  I would like to believe there is no underlying or suspicious reason but I will listen with interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can certainly assure the Senators that there is not.  As the terms and conditions relating to tenure are provided for specifically in section 31 (1) there is a need to exclude this matter from subsections (2) and (3) and that is the reason the words which the amendments seek to delete appear there.  If the words were deleted there could be confusion as to what terms and conditions would apply in so far as tenure is concerned. The wording in the Bill is similar to the wording in other legislation, such as the Labour Services Act, 1987, and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.  Basically, section 31 (1) deals with the question of tenure and that is why it is deleted in subsections (2) and (3).</P>

      <P>This amendment will allow the Minister to exempt certain grades or classes of employees from the provisions of section 36 restricting them from membership of a local authority.  A similar provision applies to local authority staff and the Minister has exempted non-senior grades from the exclusion for membership of local authorities.</P>
      <P>I feel this amendment will meet the concerns expresed by a number of Senators that the rights of employees in the agency to participate in political activity are unduly restricted by the provisions of section 36 while avoiding the danger of the agency becoming unduly political in the public eye as a result of the political involvement of its employees. Many Senators made a strong case for this and I decided, therefore, to review the situation and to allow the Minister to make exemptions and to designate certain classes of people for the purposes of participating as members of local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">

      <P>I am glad the Minister said this because I was under the impression at the time that there was a <Col N="1207" /> similar provision for local authority members but none of us was quite sure. I hope the appropriate grade will be taken to be reasonably high up the ranks, that people who are in many areas of activity in the Environmental Protection Agency will be allowed to participate.  We should be very wary of putting any obstacle in the way of allowing people to be involved in political activities, and particularly in local government.  There is a need for considerable extension of local authority activity and local authority powers, and related to that is the need to have people who have an interest or perhaps an expertise being prepared to participate in local government.  I am glad the Minister has introduced these amendments.</P>

    <P>(5)  For the purposes of this section, a person shall not be regarded as having an interest to which this section applies if the interest is so remote or insignificant that it cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to influence a person in considering or discussing, or in voting on, any question with respect to any matter arising or coming before the Agency or in performing any function in relation to any such matter.</P>

This wide ranging provision will ensure that the interests of the agency's directors and senior personnel are clearly visible to the public, thus ensuring that public confidence in the impartiality of the agency's decisions will be enhanced.</P>

      <P>When I introduced a two line amendment on Committee Stage I did not expect a page and a half of an amendment back from the Minister.  I compliment her on her thoroughness.  It is a considerable and courageous step forward.  It may well inhibit certain people from seeking senior positions in the agency, but that is as it should be. This is a very important area where public trust is the bedrock of the success of the agency.  We could perhaps direct the Minister to the idea of persuading the Government or the Houses of the Oireachtas to introduce similarly drafted and fairly brief legislation to deal with the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and their interests.  It would be a further step in the direction of public transparency and public trust in the political process.</P>

      <P>I indicated on Committee Stage that I would take on board on Report Stage the content of amendments proposed by Senator O'Toole to the effect that persons with an interest in matters being considered should withdraw from the meeting rather than take no part in the consideration of the matter while being able to remain at the meeting. The amendments before us are identical in substance but slightly different in wording to Senator O'Toole's Committee Stage amendments and will oblige members of the agency or of the agency committees or consultative groups to withdraw from meetings where a matter in which they have an interest is being discussed.</P>

      <P>As I indicated on Committee Stage, this amendment would result in the rather anomalous position that the Minister for Finance would be obliged to exercise his discretion in relation to Government expenditure but not be obliged to exercise it in any meaningful way.  Were the amendment to be carried, the Minister for Finance would be obliged to sanction funds for the agency but the sanction of a token sum would satisfy the obligation.  The key to proper financing of the agency lies not in legislative phrasing but in the Government's commitment to environmental protection.  I can assure the Senators that this Government are fully committed to the new agency and will ensure that it is adequately financed.  The adoption of this amendment would have no impact whatever on the agency's funding position.</P>
      <P>I do not think the substitution of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo; would make any difference because, as I said, a token sum would fulfill the legislative requirement and would not go any way towards providing what I think is behind Senator Doyle's intent here, that is, sufficient funds to allow the agency to carry out its responsibilities in an efficient and effective manner.  That certainly is the intention and that is obviously a budgetary matter.  You cannot legislate in any meaningful way for the provision of funds to any public body.  Therefore it is not desirable or necessary or would it in any way be effective to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. Having listened to the Minister, I am <Col N="1214" /> quite confused.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in every bit of legislation I have seen &mdash; and I have had long arguments with Government Ministers, including the Minister present, about the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash; was always seen as making something a good deal more mandatory; in other words, if you said &ldquo;shall&rdquo; it meant they had to do it and if you said &ldquo;may&rdquo; it meant they had some discretion in the matter.  It seems to me that we are getting a slightly different interpretation of words that have been used fairly extensively in legislation in which we are suggesting that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; apparently is less helpful than the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  It seems that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; simply affirms the fact that the Minister for Finance shall.  He might only have to make a token sum available but under the present framework he or she would not even have to make any sum available. The difference is not enormous and I doubt if we are going to have a long argument about it; but there is a difference and the difference makes it a little more imperative on the Minister to cough up some cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to respond to the Minister.  I am disappointed that she cannot accept the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo; here.  I know there are many occasions where one could draw the conclusion that we are tying the hands of a Minister in mandating him in the Bill and leaving no options but in this case it is quite different.  We are not stating that he shall give a specific figure to the agency each year.  We are not saying &ldquo;he shall&rdquo; and thereby must give £8 million a year. We are not taking the discretion from the Minister in terms of his budget in any way by substituting the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo; in this context.  I would ask the Minister to look at it, because if the Minister of the day is not prepared to grant aid the Environmental Protection Agency each year, and if he needs the option of whether he will or he will not, which effectively is what the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; implies, we are weakening the case we are making here for the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1215" /> There is another matter which concerns me also.  It is this.  As the agency gets established and licence fees start to come in, and they get fines, and charges and payment for the services, they will render nothing in a particular year to the Environmental Protection Agency, that they can live on the funds they are generating. I would read that as far more sinister than just a &ldquo;may&rdquo; in this case.  I would like to see the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to ensure in the future that any Minister in a position to consider it will give a grant. I know a token grant could be made if the Minister wanted them to live off their own resources or the moneys they have generated themselves, but I doubt if any Dáil or Seanad would allow that in any budget debate.  I doubt if any Dáil or Seanad would allow that in any budget debate subsequently.</P>
    <P>Members on all sides of this House, feel strongly that the Environmental Protection Agency be established, that it be viable, that it be strong and that it does <Col N="1216" /> the work we all want it to do.  Therefore, I think that any discretion in the future as to whether a Minister may or may not grant aid the Environmental Protection Agency in any particular year should now be removed from the Bill.  There is so little involved.  We are not tying the Minister's hands in a budgetary sense; if we were, this amendment would be disallowed, so obviously we are not infringing on the Minister's budgetary discretion by changing the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment. It is a very small amendment but it could make a huge difference in terms of the strength of commitment to future funding of this agency.</P>

    <Title>Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Senator Neville on Wednesday, 19 June 1991:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the abject failure of the Coalition Government in face of the deterioration in crime, lawlessness and vandalism and in particular for its failure:</P>
    <P>&mdash;to increase the gardaí to their full strength of 12,000 as promised in their election manifesto;</P>
    <P>&mdash;to review the policy on policing in rural areas and to &ldquo;restore a realistic Garda presence there&rdquo; as promised; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;to deal with the bail situation which has not worked effectively for many years.</P>

    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. The images that remain in my mind from the recent canvass completely reinforce the validity of the motion.  Whether in rural or urban areas, what I faced daily <Col N="1218" /> and nightly were barricaded gates, triple locked doors, both front and back and not just one but three dogs in many cases, some chained and some in the rooms of urban dwellers where both partners were working.  The surburban areas were barricaded during the day.  Going back to the local elections six years ago, in rural areas there was an open door both day and night and one did not see community watch signs.  They are a good thing but they are a symptom of the times.  If you knocked on doors in the late afternoon or early evening you wondered whether the occupants were at home.  They were afraid to come to the doors.  The only thing that alerted their attention was the snarling of dogs which were not the typical dogs that I as a country person used to see.  Instead of sheep dogs and collies I saw alsatians and other breeds I could not determine.  It was an exercise in self-preservation. Being a farmer's daughter, I never had any fear of dogs but I got two bites for which I had to have anti-tetanus shots.  I presumed that because I was not afraid of them I could move freely but, unfortunately, this was not so.</P>
      <P>I am painting those pictures and images because the people in urban and rural Ireland are terrified day and night.  It was very disturbing to see terror on the faces of elderly, middle aged and young people who choose to live in the country areas. They were absolutely terrified.  I spoke to other councillors on the trail and they too said that people were living in fear, agony and terror and they were barricaded in their homes as if they were in Long Kesh or some other institution.  The questions must to be asked, why?  What is the problem? What has led to this tremendous anxiety among the people?  In small villages there might be a squad car patrolling but, like the small rural post offices which are under threat, the police stations have already closed.  It is very important that this motion was put down because we cannot ignore the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems of rural Ireland have been enumerated 100 times in Seanad Éireann through debates on farming policies, An Post, the closure of schools and creameries.  This is the last straw.  The <Col N="1219" /> elderly should be living in contented environments, not under lock and key or under the surveillance of unusually vicious dogs.</P>
    <P>The membership of the Garda Síochána three or four years ago was 11,500. We were promised a membership of 12,000 but the extra 1,000 members provided could not even keep pace with retirements.  In rural areas particularly quite a number of retired gardaí were not replaced and one third of all small rural stations are without a sergeant.  In the Limerick area not just little villages but villages with sizeable populations, such as Kilfinane, Murroe and Athea, are without a sergeant.  The result of such a practice means that the number of attacks on elderly people have increased.  These are not just petty crimes, we are talking about elderly people being beaten up. They do not have telephones so they cannot ring for help.</P>
    <P>As regards the telecommunications system the so-called green man, from what I see of this it does not work.  For some reason it is like people using the telephone and finding there is a recorder on.  The number of times people speak is an indication of their slowness to accept such modern technology.  I know the system was designed so that one would get through to the Garda and there would be an instant reaction from them. However, the response to the green man innovation has not been favourable. People will not talk to doors.  The human dimension is important and cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>What research, if any, was done on this new telecommunications system?  What has been the feedback?  Has a report been published?  If £30 million were spent on the telecommunications network, this would be part of it, I would like to see publication of the results of this modern technology.  In the normal way there would be communication at least 20 times a day with the gardaí but only a dozen calls have been recorded through the green man system.  I am not saying there should not be innovation but it should suit the needs of the community.  Was <Col N="1220" /> the system tested?  Was a random sample carried out to see if people would use this method to look for help?  In times of stress one turns to the human being and not to some contraption.  Have the new methods been of benefit to the people for whom they were installed?</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that an offender is caught, property is rarely recovered so the victim of crime is not just upset but is also bereft of whatever property was taken.  The treatment of victims and the court system must be looked at.  In the Limerick city area, on a normal day 19 gardaí are on duty.  During the summer months approximately five would go on leave and others go on courses.  They are not replaced.  With the cutback in overtime, a skeleton staff tries to cope with increasing problems.  On a typical Sunday evening, of the 19 officers on duty there are ten on duty between 2 p.m. and 10 p.m.  The gardaí are thin on the ground and it has been noticed that the number of crimes increase at that time.  One specific example of that is the cars of people visiting graveyards are broken into.  The criminals are very much aware that this is an off-peak time and they have a bonanza.</P>
    <P>The fundamental test in deciding whether to allow bail is the likelihood of the applicant to evade justice.  His solicitor will give a guarantee that he will appear when his court hearing comes up but while those people are on bail &mdash; and this has been shown statistically &mdash; waiting for their court cases to come up they commit more crime because they know they will get concurrent sentences. We want bail to be refused because the evidence shows that offenders continue to offend and that is something that has to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Let us look at unemployment and its relationship to crime.  We see youngsters with ambition and with a great sense of purpose living in large housing estates. As a result of unemployment ambitions are unfulfilled and there is a feeling of uselessness.  There is a lack of family support because of unemployment, poor housing and lack of opportunity.  As a result of that, there is lack of self-esteem. <Col N="1221" /> As the old saying goes, the devil makes plenty of work for idle hands and youngsters get up to all sorts of mischief.  They start innocently, move on to glue sniffing, petty crime and joy riding and then they get involved in wanton vandalism.  They become involved in robbery and feel that they do not belong in society.  The education system fails to support those who are not academically inclined and who leave school at a very young age.</P>
    <P>We do not want to be negative.  We want to look at methods of preventing crime.  This needs an investment of money in the very early stages.  It means building a sense of community, addressing youngsters' educational needs at basic primary level and tackling unemployment in blackspot areas.  Nobody sets out as a young child to behave badly but if they do not have the support structures to enable them to live fruitful lives they will end up committing crime.  The strength of the Garda must be increased. We must get rid of the green man if it is not making any impact.  We must review policy on policing in rural areas and restore a realistic Garda presence.  We must also deal immediately with the bail situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is basically about crime and there is no doubt that crime has increased compared to when we were youngsters.  On the campaign, I was told that in a relatively small area one person had his car burnt in the driveway of his house and another person not many yards away had their back door smashed in.  There were cider parties going on outside and, going from the very serious to the ridiculous, another person's washing was stolen from the line.  This all happened in an area of a few hundred yards on the same evening. In one estate I represent seven cars were wantonly destroyed and burnt in one evening. It is an appalling situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt, unfortunately, that crime has increased.  It may seem mild by what we see on shows such as &ldquo;Miami Vice&rdquo; or experience if we visit New York but it is very real to those living here. People, particularly women, are afraid to <Col N="1222" /> go out, and there are streets in Dublin where people are reluctant to walk in the evening and tourists are robbed there all too frequently.</P>
    <P>Various factors contribute to the cause of crime.  A young population tends to be associated with an increased incidence of crime, often of a nature which is not so directly malign but more in the sense of excessive and foolish high spirits, but nonetheless there is a correlation between age and the more violent physical types of crimes.  That is one aspect.</P>
    <P>It is very common to talk about such aspects as the environment and poverty. I do not doubt that there are parts of the world, and maybe even in this country where poverty is directly related to crime but many people of our generation experienced far greater problems without any of the social back-up services or securities that exist today.  They did not resort to crime nor did they suggest that because you are poor you commit crime. Such a suggestion is an insult to many hard working industrious people who just do not have the good fortune to have all the better things of this life.</P>
    <P>I am sure many Senators were shocked at the number of houses where small children of four, five, six or seven years of age were left alone because their parents had gone out for an hour or two, or perhaps the whole evening.  That is a far greater deprivation than the immediate lack of prosperity or funds.  That is a deprivation of care, responsibility, and love.  You can get the same thing in some upmarket neighbourhoods where they regard themselves as being very well off but have little time for their children. They are surprised when their child gets into trouble or if you ask them how much time they spend with him and if they knew he was out.  Their usual reply is no. Parential responsibility must be emphasised. There is usually a story behind a youngster who gets into trouble.</P>
    <P>There are other causes of crimes and unfortunately.  I remember 20 years ago talking with a sergeant in what was then the drug squad and he was able to name the people involved in drugs.  Unfortunately, that has changed today.  The <Col N="1223" /> addict must get his fix and he will do virtually anything, be it robbery or prostitution, to get money for these drugs. This is one of the most serious causes of crime.  It is also one of the most difficult to deal with.  Violence is acceptable to many of those people in their crazy desire to have drugs.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the causes of crime. We also went through a stage where we thought that if we could deal with the social and economic causes of crime it would disappear.  That comes from the belief that all people are born angels and will stay that way for the rest of their lives.  Let us face it; just as there are some people who are very good and saintly there are others who are evil.  It may be that they are psychotic or simply bad but to pretend that such people do not exist is regrettable and unfortunate.  It is confusing to see a person jailed and on his release commit further crimes, being jailed again, released again and so on.  It is essential to realise that we can have all the probation officers in the world and we can improve the environment but there will still be a certain number of people who are basically a danger to society and who should be kept out of society's way.  I do not think they deserve to be given preference.</P>
    <P>There are a number of different causes and I know many of them have been touched on during the debate, but it is no harm to bring ourselves back to reality. There are some causes of crime that we may be able to do something about but there are others which, unfortunately, we can do nothing about.</P>
    <P>What do we try to do then?  One aspect we must look at is parental responsibility in the home.  If a youngster is allowed to wander the streets or is left in a house alone I do not think you can blame him if he gets into trouble.  I am delighted to see, but saddened in some ways, that the Minister proposes to make it law that parents, guardians or the people responsible for children will have to appear in court: he will be able to do that under regulations.  It is just not good enough <Col N="1224" /> that they should shrug off their responsibility and say they do not know where their children are.</P>
    <P>They must also take responsibility for them in a financial sense if they burn a car, smash up a house or injure somebody.  Criminals should be punished for their crime and not simply put away.  That is simply putting them away to protect society and is not an effective deterrent. Sometimes taking these children out of society may mean putting them into a school for crime.  Criminals should pay for their crimes.</P>
    <P>In Victorian times criminals were very badly off and could not conceivably pay for the damage they caused but most criminals today who are involved in serious crime could well afford to pay damages to the person whose handbag has been robbed, whose car has been burned or who has been physically injured.  There is no real compensation for that but at least it might go some way towards inducing a greater sense of responsibility and be some compensation for the unfortunate person who has been beaten up or had their arm broken or whatever.  It is necessary, unfortunately, that some people be locked up for the good of society.</P>
    <P>Another aspect we have to look at is what people are going to jail and why are they going there.  It is totally inappropriate, for example, that a high percentage of people in jail are there for debt offences and are not really a great threat to society.  There are others the Garda know are very dangerous and they are frequently in and out of prison.  Our criminal justice system in respect of courts and jail must be looked at very carefully.  There is no use just increasing the number of jails if there are people going in who should not be there at all and if there are people who should be in jail and who are still managing, under one pretext or another, to escape from not just punishment but from being put away where they cannot do damage to society.</P>
    <P>Equally, there are people about whom something can be done.  We have a very <Col N="1225" /> good probation service and it needs to be expanded.  It is operating under very difficult conditions.  In the case of people about whom something can be done, if they are youngsters as far as possible we should avoid putting them into jail where they will mix with other criminals and perhaps get into a criminal way of life. Where there are genuine cases of difficulty and the probation officer is working with people we should give them all possible support.</P>
    <P>I know the trend has changed.  I proposed in this House, and I think the Leas-Chathaoirleach was here at the time, that Loughan House be built.  I remember being hissed from the opposite side of the House; one of the few times that occurred in this Chamber.  Unfortunately, we need to have a certain amount of residential accommodation for young criminals.  That is a necessity but let us deal with those who are genuinely criminal and let us have understanding for those who are not but who are neglected by their parents or by society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on what is probably one of the most important motions that has come before us in recent months.  The need for a discussion on the whole crime situation was forcefully brought home to me in recent weeks as I, like others, trooped the streets and knocked on the doors, particularly on bright evenings. You would call to a house at about 7.30 p.m. and ring the bell or knock on the door.  There would then be a delay as a potential Fort Knox scenario unfolded before your eyes as a couple of chubb locks were opened and bolts were pulled back.  There was also the possibility of a dog being there for the householder's protection.  This experience brought home to me the utter fear in which many of our people are living, particularly our elderly population but even our not so elderly who have had their cars vandalised, have suffered house robberies, bag snatches, common assault or aggravated assault resulting in bodily harm or, even worse, rape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ths problem has to be looked at and <Col N="1226" /> tackled immediately.  We reacted to the jobs crisis with the creation of a task force.  This needs another task force involving various Departments, including probably, Justice, Education, Health and probably Social Welfare.  There should be a Minister to deal with the growing breakdown in law and order.  This is what the Fine Gael motion addresses.  It calls for the restoration of gardaí on the streets.  That was one of the complaints made to me.  People did not know when gardaí were last in their street or were seen on the beat.  The numbers must be brought back up to the promised level of 12,000.  It is at present 10,400 or 10,500 and while I welcome the recent recruitment I hope it is not just an election gimmick by the Government.  I hope that providing a few extra gardaí was not just to save a few votes.  The gardaí must be brought back on the beat.</P>
    <P>The motion calls for a review in certain places of the various other matters that go on in Garda stations.  I understand there are about 60 to 70 forms in relation to which the Garda have some responsibility. That ties gardaí in stations and prevents them from doing what the general public want them to do in relation to crime prevention and, where necessary, crime detection.  When you look at the numbers of gardaí allocated to a certain station the number sounds very good but you have to divide that number by about four because there are three rosters in a day and provision must be made for a resting group.</P>
    <P>There are also gardaí on holidays, on sick leave, gardaí involved in court duty or VIP protection.  All of these matters must be looked at.  Where there is an area with particular problems or where certain ambassadors or other people require protection, there should be a central force from Garda headquarters or Harcourt Terrace or wherever to augment the force in that area.  The number of gardaí in the area should not be reduced and the people in that area should not have to suffer.  I ask the Minister to look at the whole question of how gardaí are utilised, particularly in relation to the clerical work they have to do.  These matters <Col N="1227" /> could be dealt with elsewhere.  There could be central registration officers and officers dealing with say, gun licences or other types of licences.  Gardaí are not being paid to give forms to the public. People want gardaí to work on crime detection and crime prevention and this must happen.  We must see the numbers increased to the level that was promised by the Government.  There is also the question which has been dealt with by some of my colleagues of policing in rural areas and the so-called green men, etc. This has to be looked at also.</P>
    <P>There is also the question in my own constituency of the relocation of the divisional headquarters in Dún Laoghaire Garda station.  There is a proposal to move it a couple of miles up the road to an apparent no-man's land, but it is important that some sort of presence, perhaps a smaller unit, be maintained in the main street.  It is the focal point of business.  It is where the old people live. It is where they can walk to.  These people want to be assured that the gardaí are not being moved from where the people want them.  I would ask the Minister to look at this problem.</P>
    <P>Another matter which we have to address is how we support victims.  We should not ignore victims and just put them on the computer as another satistic. People who suffer a house robbery or personal assault are never the same afterwards. There was a certain response recently in relation to victims but unfortunately victims are all too easily forgotten. Many groups are asking for more luxurious prisons and all sorts of facilities, and those suggestions are to be welcomed, particularly for once-off offenders or people who can be rehabilitated, but what follow-up do we given the victims?  It should be mandatory that there is a follow-up from the gardaí.  This would require either extra gardaí, which I have requested already, and an extra allocation in relation to overtime so that gardaí can build up a liaison with the people in the area in which they are working. In the past we have seen the great work done by juvenile liaison officers.  At <Col N="1228" /> times they have been able to identify potential troublemakers and have been able to head them off at the pass.  That is what we have got to look at here.</P>
    <P>There has to be an injection of extra funds.  If not, the consequences will come back on to all of us by way of extra insurance costs, car break-ins, etc.  We are all aware of the spiralling insurance costs.  I would ask the Minister to tell us of any definite action being taken by him and his Department in response to the increase in crime, lawlessness and vandalism.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has been mentioned and which was dealt with at length by our spokesman a couple of weeks ago was the question of bail.  A decision was handed down some 25 years ago by the late Chief Justice Ó Dálaigh but since then times have changed, many things have changed.  It is time for a total radical rethink in this area.  We cannot afford the luxury of allowing habitual criminals to be continually released on bail to commit further crimes.  While some matters have changed in relation to concurrent and consecutive sentencing, at the end of the day if a justice is dealing with a person who is up for ten or 50 robberies, it will not make a very big difference to the sentence handed down.  That is what we have to tackle.  We have to deter people who can pay for the spell inside by committing a certain quota of robberies in the interim.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to respond to the Bill which was put forward by this party.  It may not be perfect, changes may be required and if a referendum is needed so be it.  But to sit in our ivory tower and think that a judgment handed down 25 years ago is sacrosanct and should not even be commented upon, is very foolish. We have to review the situation now.  We have to respond to the situation now. We have to look at the problem of our prisons, especially the revolving door policy where one can be sentenced on Friday, released on Saturday, commit another crime on Sunday and be back before the same district justice on Monday.  There is something wrong with that system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> I would ask the Minister to deal with the whole question of juvenile offenders. Senator Conroy referred to the burning of cars.  We do not want to see the emergence of self-appointed vigilantes on to our streets.  It is ironic that the activities of some of those people have been dormant for the last four to five years.  It was only with the advent of the local elections that they suddenly re-emerged as concerned citizens in the neighbourhood. This is particularly galling when some of them are members of the Sinn Féin Party.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the Neighbourhood Watch scheme, which has been quite a success, be given a revamp, that further meetings take place to see how it is working.  People who were on the steering committees in the past may not have been as active with the passage of time.  New people are needed because some people who were involved in the inauguration of the Neighbourhood Watch scheme may have moved on.  It is important that this issue be looked at.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would urge the Minister to consider our motion very seriously to deal with the matters mentioned by Senator Jackman and I tonight and by our spokesman a couple of weeks ago. The bail situation has to be looked at immediately.  On a Monday morning at the Bridewell, 100 gardaí can attend although defendants may be just looking for a further adjournment.  Surely some other system can be devised where gardaí can attend at other times during the day. At present gardaí from all over the city have to attend at 10.30 a.m. and some of them do not appear in court until 12 noon.  These gardaí are on duty but are not out on the streets where they are needed.  I ask the Members opposite to support the motion before the House tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is ill-timed. In terms of the English language it is also unusual because the Opposition are suggesting that there is a deterioration in crime, lawlessness and vandalism. &ldquo;Deterioration&rdquo; means there is a reduction, and we would have to agree that there has been a reduction in crime, <Col N="1230" /> lawlessness and vandalism over the past number of years.  Maybe it is a matter for the people who tabled the motion but I feel it is ill-timed and in terms of the English language seems to be diabolical.</P>
      <P>Members of this House would have to agree that there has not been an increase in vandalism on the streets over the past couple of years, there has not been an increase in crime.  There was always vandalism in Ireland.  There was always lawlessness in this country but if one reads our history one would find that since the foundation of the State there has been a reduction in crime and lawlessness down the decades.  It is unfortunate that this motion is before the House for other reasons.</P>
      <P>The Garda are doing everything possible. They got extra resources and they are able to cope generally with crime. There is nobody on either side of the House who would suggest that an increase in funding would eliminate what the motion suggests.  Education is the area we need to address when we talk about lawlessness and the elimination of crime.  Education in the civics area has been very badly lacking.  Where the Neighbourhood Watch has been introduced people are genuinely concerned with what is happening.  They are getting in touch with the gardaí and with their neighbours and there has been a decrease in crime.</P>
      <P>Senator Cosgrave said that the increase in Garda numbers was a cheap election gimmick.  The increase in Garda numbers is a fact.  Not alone will there be an increase in Garda numbers but they will be better trained.  The facilities being provided in Templemore will bring the level of Garda training up to university standard. That is not a cheap election gimmick, it is a fact and anybody who goes into the Templemore centre will see the modern training that is being given to young recruits.  These are very highly educated and motivated people who will now be very highly trained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true to say that there is a breakdown in law and order.  There have always been criminals in this country and over the last number of years in particular <Col N="1231" /> we have to give credit to the present Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, for what he has attempted to do within the constraints of the budget.  He has given more money for policing on the streets. I speak to gardaí regularly and, admittedly, they have problems but their problems will not be solved by this motion. This motion is anti-gardaí, it is antiperson and it is untimely.</P>
    <P>Rape has been mentioned by various people.  Rape is a horrific crime and this motion will do nothing to stop people committing this heinous crime.</P>
    <P>Parents have a responsibility and I am glad that under the legislation being introduced parents will have to attend court if minors are being charged.  That will reduce a certain element of crime because once parents are brought on the scene the responsibility goes from Government back to where it should be &mdash; education and the family.  There is no question but that the lack of parental guidance has been the biggest element in the increase in crime.  There are people who could not care less where their children are late at night or early in the morning, and there is no point suggesting that a Government or a Minister for Justice can take the place of a parent because that is not possible.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to hear people refer to luxurious prisons.  There is nothing luxurious about having to stay in a confined space for 24 hours a day.  What is luxurious about that?  You are deprived of your freedom and of every right.  You cannot open a door unless somebody tells you to do so.  When Gerry Conlon came out of prison he said that he sat in his bedroom and could not realise that he was free to open the door.  Luxurious on the inside means nothing.  If a person does not have his freedom he has nothing. He can live in the lap of luxury but if he has to wait for somebody to open the door, turn on the television, turn on the light, wake him up in the morning, produce his breakfast at 9 o'clock, his dinner at 1 o'clock and his tea at 7 o'clock, that is not luxury.  It is a deprivation of his civil rights.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> Other countries are going through similar problems but we are coping with ours.  The Minister, the Government and the gardaí are coping better with our problems because we have a central Government controlling a central police force, unlike Britain and other countries where the police force are controlled at local level.  I would not like to see a diminution of our central police force, although somebody suggested that maybe there should be a diminution of the cental force.</P>
    <P>The junior liaison officers have done a tremendous job steering young children away from crime, suggesting to parents that their children should not be involved in certain activities.  These officers throughout the country have done a tremendous amount of work and should be complimented.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the changes that are taking place in the bail system should continue.  It is absolutely irresponsible that people should be allowed out on bail to commit other crimes which are added to their previous list and a month or two is added to their sentence, or maybe they end up in Shelton Abbey in the lap of &ldquo;protective luxury&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Insurance costs have nothing to do with this Bill.  Insurance costs go up because of the system.  I have a son in the legal system and I know they will fight for the biggest return for the smallest accident. There has to be some way to do away with the astronomical sums that are given in judgments against insurance companies.</P>
    <P>This motion is absolutely and utterly irresponsible.  It should not have been brought before this House and the amendment should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the contributors to the motion and to totally disagree with Senator Lanigan's contradictory statement that the motion is untimely and irrelevant in the present circumstances.  I believe the Government have failed to recognise the national crime crisis and the amendment proposed by Senator O'Donovan is an indication of the Government's lack of commitment <Col N="1233" /> to doing anything about the situation. Crime is a real problem and the Minister should recognise that people feel under constant threat; anybody who disbelieves that is closing his eyes to the situation. People feel under constant threat in their homes and on the streets and I am disappointed that the Minister and Government have failed to respond to the problem or tried to improve the situation by providing resources to combat crime. The Minister proposed a mathematical change in Garda numbers; they will be increased by 1,000 but 1,000 gardaí will also retire over the same period of time.</P>
      <P>The Government are not prepared to provide financial resources to combat crime but I believe the taxpayers are prepared to pay to stop old and vulnerable people being molested and robbed in their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should provide the resources.  Taxpayers are prepared to invest in facilities to stop young people being attacked as they alight from buses in our streets late at night, or to ensure that drug barons and drug pushers are put out of business and the Minister should recognise that.  Taxpayers are prepared to invest in halting the spiralling growth of juvenile crime but the Minister and the Government are not prepared to respond to this or to acknowledge that people need and deserve protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has failed to respond to the problem of white collar crime and is effectively ignoring it.  I made a comprehensive contribution on this matter on the introduction of the motion two weeks ago and we have had no response whatsoever from the Government.  My points have been ignored.  I ask the Minister again to make fraud a criminal offence, whether committed by an individual or by a group.  He must make provisions to require people in certain circumstances to provide potentially self-incriminating evidence and should immediately consult with his colleagues in the EC through the Trevi meetings in order to come to grips <Col N="1234" /> on an EC level with the growing problem of white collar crime.</P>
    <P>Increasing numbers of drug pushers must be tackled in Dublin and in other cities.  The Minister should listen to the concern of the Garda Representative Association and to their views which I expressed in this House.  He has ignored them.  He must redress the decision to cut the number of plain clothes officers in Dublin by 15 per cent in the light of the fact that drug pushers are given a free rein in many parts of Dublin.  He must restore&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In his address to the recent annual conference, the Garda Representative Association leader, John Furey, voiced his concern as follows, and I quote:</P>
      <P>The decision of the Garda Commissioner to cut the number of plainclothes officers in Dublin by almost 15 per cent means that officers who had been working on drug squads in many Dublin stations have returned to uniform duties giving drug pushers a free rein in many parts of the city.  The decision also cuts down on the number of armed officers available for duties such as protection, bank escorts and crime investigation.  The hardest hit areas are some of the cities toughest crime spots.  The undercover Drug Squad based in Store Street station which had a strength of five has been cut to three by the directive.  In the city centre station of Pearse Steet the CPU which tackled crime on tourists and targetted specific crime sprees by criminals in the Grafton Street area was disbanded.  Other areas hit include Kevin Street station where the CPU have dealt with a serious heroin problem in the Thomas Street area.  The directive instructs uniformed gardaí who have been working on plain clothes duty to return to uniform duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan rejects our motion on the basis that crime has been in existence for thousands of years.  Does the growing level of crime, the growing viciousness of criminal acts and the growth in professionalism of such criminals mean anything to the Senator?  He said that the proposal to increase Garda numbers by Fine Gael will, and I quote, <Col N="1236" />&ldquo;not automatically ensure that we see the end of crime and violence&rdquo;.  He cannot have been listening to my speech proposing the motion.  He was busy enjoying the Minister for Justice's skit regarding canvassing at doors after 8 o'clock at night.</P>

      <P>The Minister informed the House that he intends to provide 45 extra places for juvenile criminals at Árd Mhuire site, Lusk, County Dublin &mdash; 36 for boys and nine for girls.

      <P>Juvenile crime has risen <Col N="1237" /> by a factor of almost nine since 1985 at a time when some contributors, including Senator Lanigan, would suggest that things were improving.  The Minister made no substantial suggestions in his speech last week for combating the situation. I welcome his tentative agreement to look at the bail system.  It is a failure on his part not to have corrected this situation at the recent local elections when he might have amended the Constitution to enable the Minister to do so. He has failed twice to use that opportunity, during the presidential and the local government elections.  He has again lost the opportunity to take action against those &mdash; Senator Lanigan supports me on this &mdash; who, when granted bail, go on a crime spree because they know they will get out of prison anyway.</P>
      <P>The Minister has failed to respond to my proposal on the right of silence on which I spoke last week.  It is outdated that professional criminals have a right when questioned by gardaí to remain silent and that an inference cannot be taken in the courts with regard to this even though this provision is incorporated in recent law, including the Bill going through this House on the DNA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also disappointed that the Minister did not inform the House about the developments in connection with the open border after 1992.  I asked him to <Col N="1238" /> respond to this last week and he had an opportunity to inform us of the situation and the implications for a further increase in the crime rates post-1992 when people will have free access across our borders. Criminals will then be in a position to organise themselves in areas where numbers of gardaí are low and to farm out their activities.  Drug pushers can base themselves in areas where opportunity of escape is greatest or where sanctions are at a low level.  I am disappointed that the Minister did not respond to this area about which Garda authorities are extremely concerned.</P>

I had hoped to get a response but the Minister failed to do so.  The case put by this side of the House has proved that the Government have failed abjectly to counteract the growing crime problem and they have no intention of providing the resources or of doing anything other than ignoring it at the cost of many lives and of much suffering.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 57:</P>
      <P>In page 34, line 45, after &ldquo;report.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Details of any trusts or conditions attached to such gifts shall be contained in the report.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment should go through without any problem.  It is simply a matter of clarification.  The section deals with the acceptance of gifts by the agency and as far as it goes it is quite acceptable because it specifically says that the agency can accept gifts, which is perfectly reasonable. I do not know if they will get many but they can accept them.  One could envisage some of the multinationals being prepared to fund some of the work of the agency.  That might be expecting too much but nevertheless, one could. envisage it.  Subsecton (2) says that &ldquo;the <Col N="1241" /> agency shall not accept a gift if the trusts or conditions attached to it would be inconsistent with, or prejudice, the effective performance of its functions&rdquo;.  That is perfectly reasonable.  Subsection (3) says &ldquo;the agency shall publish in its annual report details of all gifts accepted by it ...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My amendment suggests that the report should make public the conditions attached to any trusts because there can be conditions, that they would be used in only one area of the agency's work, that they would be used over a period of time, that, perhaps, certain trustees might have to be consulted or conditions that one cannot envisage.  Therefore, it should be made perfectly clear that nothing is being withheld from the public in this area.</P>
    <P>To the Minister's great credit, she dealt in considerable detail in amendment No. 52 with the interests of people in senior positions with the agency.  It is perfectly reasonable then that we should go to some lengths to ensure that interests attached to gifts are clearly known to the public.  All my amendment says is that details of any trusts or conditions attached to such gifts shall be contained in the report.  I know the Minister will tell me that that is implied in the phraseology of subsection (3) but even if it is it will not do any harm to have that made explicit and in doing so to underline the principle &mdash; that is not nearly as well underlined as it ought to be &mdash; or transparency.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept what is not in any way a controversial or fundamentally important amendment but one that contributes to the objective the Minister has set herself in this Bill, which is to win public trust.</P>

      <P>I indicated on Committee Stage that I would look at this again for Report Stage but that I did not think a change was necessary. I have considered it again and discussed it with the parliamentary <Col N="1242" /> draftsman who confirmed since Committee Stage that this amendment is unnecessary.  The details of the gifts to be published under subsection (3) would include the conditions attached to such gifts.</P>

      <P>I will not hold up the House unnecessarily on this but I do not think the parliamentary draftsman is right.  I have been here long enough to be aware that while that office is, I am sure, populated by eminent people of considerable ability and so on, it is not infallible.  I do not accept that details of all gifts accepted by the agency means details of all the conditions attached to the gifts.  I believe that simple English means what it says.  If I am told that I will be given the details of the gifts I think what I am guaranteed, as distinct from what the agency may choose to make available to me, is simply a statement that we got gifts from A, B, C, D, E. In plain, simple English a report giving details of all the gifts made to the agency does not in any way give me a guarantee that details of the conditions attached to those gifts will be made available to me. On this point I beg to differ from the parliamentary draftsman.  I think he is wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 61:</P>
      <P>In page 41, line 14, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to accept this amendment. Basically, this section states that the agency may, for the purposes of environmental protection, specify and publish criteria and procedures for the selection, management, operation and termination of use by local authorities of landfill sites for the disposal of domestic and other waste.  I am not sure why &ldquo;may&rdquo; is necessary in this.  I would like to see a national policy and standards laid down. Leaving it to individual local authorities in cases where the local authorities are scrupulous and have a good environmental record is very satisfactory but I am afraid not all local authorities have a good environmental record.  The agency should lay down national standards in the management, operation and, indeed, the termination and landscaping ultimately of completed landfill sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister to strengthen this otherwise very good section with the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;; I think &ldquo;may&rdquo; is unnecessary there.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used many times throughout the Bill when we would prefer the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  It weakens the impact we all want the agency to have in terms of environmental protection and national management of the environment. I do not think it should be a matter of being worried about stepping on the corns of local authorities.  Niceties in regard to the relationship between the local authority and the Environmental Protection Agency cannot be the reason the Minister has not accepted the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; here. I urge the Minister to ensure that we have national standards and to make it dictate, <Col N="1244" /> if you like, that the agency shall specify and publish criteria and procedures for landfill sites.  It is very easy to knock every proposed amendment; often the simpler they seem, the quicker they are pushed to one side.</P>
    <P>There is hardly a more contentious area in local government than that of garbage disposal and landfill sites.  Local authorities would appreciate having recourse to a higher body that would decide these issues.  It would avoid them facing down local councillors or groups who may be causing difficulties in terms of location, siting or management if they could defer to an Environmental Protection Agency who would lay down national criteria and there would be no argument about it.  One of the most difficult problems in the years to come will be the disposal of waste and the management of landfill sites.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to accept my amendment. Section 59 (1) would then state that the agency &ldquo;shall for the purposes of environmental protection, specify and publish criteria and procedures for the selection, management, operation and termination of the use by local authorities of landfill sites for the disposal of domestic and other waste&rdquo;.  This will be a critically important area in the years to come and one in which local authorities will need help from a national agency such as the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>

      <P>Landfill sites are potentially extremely hazardous.  Apart from the visual impact, the smell and so on, there can be large accumulations of methane gas.  For instance, we do not know how close we came to a serious incident with the major landfill site in Cork city but what we do know is that by the time <Col N="1246" /> the corporation finally condescended to let the public know what they knew, they had already taken remedial action. However, until they had sorted it out to their satisfaction, they would not tell anybody what they knew.  Transparency is grand but it does not seem to work when there is a problem and people are entitled to know when there are problems. We do not yet understand the effect of leaching of toxic substances and heavy metals.  It appears that whatever standards are set there still will be problems subsequently.</P>
      <P>For all those reasons it should not be left to the discretion of the agency.  It is an extremely important part of a proper environmental protection policy that the Environmental Protection Agency should specify and publish criteria for the selection, management, operation and termination of the use by local authorities of landfill sites.  It is an extremely important and sensitive area in terms of human health and safety and in terms of visual amenities.  Therefore, it is not an area where the agency should have discretion. The simple amendment proposed by Senator Doyle is perfectly reasonable and this should be one of the obligatory functions of the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand why Ministers have a horror of putting the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; into legislation.  Perhaps in this section we should insert the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  In fairness, the Minister thought she had sufficient protection in the explanatory document where it states: &ldquo;If the Agency is dissatisfied with the monitoring response of a local authority it can carry out the monitoring itself and recover the cost from the local authority&rdquo;. As Senator Ryan said, draftsmen, or draftspeople, of legislation make mistakes but they are willing to rectify them. Perhaps the Minister would look at Senator Doyle's amendment and deal with the phobia of Ministers not wanting to change the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; because draftsmen use the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the Bills which come before us all the time.  This would protect her new <Col N="1247" /> legislation, as it would protect the local authorities.  Perhaps the Minister should accept Senator Doyle's amendment to section 59.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. The Bill, is riddled with &ldquo;the Minister may&rdquo;, &ldquo;the Agency may&rdquo; and so on.  As Senator Doyle said, this area of landfill sites, as any member of a local authority will know, has been fraught with disagreement, contention and, in many instances, has been very badly handled.  The dump in Clifden was in the most scenic part of the town and a monstrous visual blot on the landscape. Fortunately, it has now been moved to a very suitable location but in my term on Dublin City Council, the Dunsink dump and others have been among the most contentious subjects raised at meeting after meeting.  I accept that it is necessary to have those landfill operations for the disposal of vast quantities of waste and rubbish of all kinds, far too much of which is produced in any case.  The Minister is working as effectively as she can but probably not as effectively as she would like, in reducing the amount of domestic rubbish by recycling it.  Many local authorities would welcome assistance on how, where and the criteria they should use in the selection of landfill sites for the disposal of domestic waste.  It is imperative that the agency produce those specifications and I urge the Minister to take this amendment on board and change the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have to consider accepting this amendment.  It is in the spirit of everything that she has said from the first day she came into this House with this legislation.  It is completely in line with the objectives outlined in section 51.  This is one of the most emotive issues in many towns.  Dingle, Tralee and Clifden have been mentioned but there are many more.  The list of towns where there has been a row about the siting of landfill sites is too numerous to mention.  This is precisely why we are setting up this kind of agency.  I have held <Col N="1248" /> the view all through the discussions on this Bill that we should allow discretion and that the agency should be able to make decisions.  However, this is not about discretion.  This is about direction, this is an indication of what we expect of this agency.</P>
      <P>I am not a member of the local authority, nor do I aspire to be, but I have seen the split and division created in local authorities when they have had to decide on the location of landfill sites, and so on.  Far from constraining or restricting them this would give them direction and allow them to make decisions within a national context.  We have to put the words &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the context of the sentence.  The Bill states: &ldquo;The Agency may, for the purposes of environmental protection, specify and publish criteria and procedures for the selection ... The agency can be as vague or as definite as they choose.  There are other cases where you might put in &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; where you are tying in the agency. If we say, as a legislative move, we now want the agency to produce a certain set of criteria, the agency might decide it is not possible to put in definite tight guidelines or constraints which would satisfy the needs of every selection process in different local authority areas and that all they can do is give more generalised sets of criteria, but we are entitled to ask for that.  Addressing the various different areas is surely a critical part of their operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of landfill sites is one that people argue about.  In terms of the public response to the Bill, leaving out those who are involved in industry and development, it is from the Legislature that their direction will come.  Whether people like it or not, a local authority has to make a decision within the parameters laid down by the Authority.  It would be unfair of the Minister to respond that it is unacceptable that local authorities be tied down or constrained by the decision. That is not what is intended.  What is intended here is to set the guidelines and the parameters within which the selection <Col N="1249" /> should take place.  This is a most reasonable demand and I think it will be welcomed because the local authority would have guidelines.  A county has to make a decision now and again.  They do not have access to the totality of information regarding landfill sites, etc. and that information will be available to the Authority. They will have at their disposal all the information within which to determine parameters and then the local authority will make the final decision.</P>
    <P>It is a most reasonable amendment and it would be in all our interests if this were to happen.  It gives direction and meets the need and it is what the people are looking for.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the face of it, what Senators are saying may be very reasonable but the problem in relation to landfill sites is not the criteria for site selection; it is rather the enforcement of the criteria that exist.  In 1987 the Department of the Environment issued a very detailed memorandum for the guidance of local authorities on the management and operation of landfill sites.  The memorandum incorporated earlier site selection criteria previously drawn up by the Geological Survey Office and so on, and relates to sites for disposal of household waste on its own and sites where industrial and commercial waste may be disposed of in conjunction with household waste.  The problem is not the issuing of guidelines, criteria, procedures or whatever; rather it is the enforcement of it, and that is why the agency is being given mandatory powers under subsection (3) (a) and (3) (b) in relating to monitoring and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty I have with putting the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo; in section 59 (1) is that it would cause difficulties for the commencement of the section in that it is, I am advised, a mammoth task. It would require the agency to go through every single landfill site that exists in order to issue and specify the criteria involved.  I am well disposed to the point made by Senators.  I would like to have an opportunity before we go to the Dáil, if that is in order, to look at the time <Col N="1250" /> implications that might be involved.  I am advised that if &ldquo;shall&rdquo; replaces &ldquo;may&rdquo; the obligation upon the agency is immediate and what we want to do &mdash; I discussed this earlier when we were bringing in a commencement date &mdash; is bring in the most pressing areas that the agency must deal with first, like the licensing role and so on.  Obviously, although it is desirable that it would be done as quickly as possible because of the time factor and so on involved, it may be necessary to specify a time period for bringing in the mandatory condition or requirement for the agency to carry out this particular task.</P>
    <P>In relation to landfill sites, I agree there are problems around the country particularly with many of the older sites.  The problem very often arises because of the manner in which these sites are operated and maintained.  Section 59 (3) (b) states:</P>
    <P>The Agency shall carry out, cause to be carried out, or arrange for, such monitoring as it considers necessary to verify results transmitted to it under paragraph (a).</P>
    <P>I agree that the monitoring, management and operation of sites are possibly more important in many ways than the selection itself because invariably there are difficulties with selection.  Virtually no community wants landfill sites close by.</P>
    <P>The whole question of waste, the need for waste minimisation, prevention and so on, is being dealt with in a separate comprehensive Bill which is being drafted in my Department, and obviously the whole issue of waste will be dealt with in that context.</P>
    <P>This is such a complex Bill that obviously it will be necessary to come back to the Seanad with it because I do not envisage it will go through the Dáil without amendment.  We were not able to finalise our thinking on the relationship between the licence and the planning system before Report Stage and I was anxious to get Report Stage here over as quickly as possible.  There will be a number of things we will be coming back on and, if that is in order, I would like to look at the practical implications of <Col N="1251" /> putting the mandatory requirement there from day one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply and am pleased to hear that she will have another look at this issue and the implications of the amendments between now and when the Bill reaches the Dáil.</P>
      <P>If this section read &ldquo;The Agency shall as soon as practical for the purposes of environmental protection&rdquo; would get over the immediate crisis of the logistical problem of going around the country and sorting things out.  I do not agree that it will be such a mammoth task and that the agency will literally hold every local authority, big and small, by the hand and say here is your site, cover it with so much clay so many times a week.  A national set of guidelines and criteria could be published stating minimal acceptable standards for the maintenance of landfill sites.  I would have a slightly different view of what might be represented by this, but obviously the Minister knows best.</P>
      <P>I cannot see the Environmental Protection Agency, no matter how much time it is given, sorting out the individual problems of every small urban council, town commission, county council and corporation in every half parish, in terms of waste disposal.  Perhaps the Minister will bear that in mind.  In any case, &ldquo;The Agency shall as soon as practical for the purposes of environmental protection, specify and publish criteria&rdquo; would get over the logistical problems.  I do not think we should run away from what is best in the Bill because there is a time scale that is difficult to incorporate initially.  We will have to look to that and sort it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To say we cannot substitute the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; for &ldquo;shall&rdquo; because the criteria are not causing the problem but rather the enforcement, is not justified.  If that were the case, the Minister could have omitted section 59 (1) and gone straight on to the section dealing with enforcement.  When the Minister mentions the possibility of publishing criteria, it is obviously in her <Col N="1252" /> mind that the Environmental Protection Agency will get round to doing this for all or some of the major local authorities. Obviously this is an issue.  We might differ on the degree of importance but we cannot underestimate the difficulties there will be in the years to come in relation to local authorities complying with their requirements to dispose of waste safely and, at the same time, meeting the environmental demands, both real and hyped, of local people.  It is the NIMBY principle: not in my back yard. We all want the local authority to dispose of waste and to house travellers so long as it is not in our back yard.  That is unfortunately the type of society we are living in today.  The local authorities would welcome the help of national guidelines and criteria laid down by the Environmental Protection Agency.  I urge the Minister to look at this and hopefully change &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and include &ldquo;as soon as practical&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This amendment will enable the agency to include criteria and procedures relating to recovery, reuse and recycling facilities in any criteria or procedures they may publish relating to the management of landfill sites by local authorities.  As such it accords waste recycling and recovery specific recognition in the Bill and meets the wishes expressed by a number of Senators on Committee Stage.  My amendment applies the substance of Senators Doyle's and Naughten's amendments as far as recycling is concerned.  The reduction of waste at source is more appropriate to the forthcoming waste Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister is wrong when she says the reduction of waste is more appropriate to the waste Bill.  As I said before on this Bill, clean technology is the way of the future for a large section of the processing industries.  It is not a matter of controlling waste.  The ultimate objective is the elimination of waste.  The place to deal with that is in Environmental Protection Agency legislation.  I am not going to delay the House with a long argument about it, but there is a philosophical difference here.  The Environmental Protection Agency with the agency in this State which deals with occupational health and safety ought to be the groups responsible for waste minimisation because it applies as much to the safety of the workforce on the plant as it does to people in the surrounding area.  The handling of waste and dealing with it are perfectly legitimate things for a Bill on waste but if the objective of a waste Bill is to minimise waste we will have to live with hazardous substances for a while.  There is a perfectly good reason for having legislation to deal with it.  The objective of waste minimisation is the fundamental platform for future environmental protection and there is a good reason for having it in this legislation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the amendment but fully support the case made by Senator Ryan that the reduction of waste at source is a matter for this Bill.  It may be a matter also for the Waste Disposal Bill and other legislation.  It most definitely is a matter to be referred to here as it is part and parcel of the overall environmental debate.</P>
      <P>Prevention is better than cure and the best way to protect our environment is by not producing the waste in the first place so that we do not have the problem of disposing of it or recycling it.  If we can reduce it, we reduce other programmes further down the line.  The concept of the reduction of waste at source deserves to be in this legislation because it is one of the environmental principles under which those of us who are concerned about the environment operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1254" /> While I accept the point the Minister made that this might be more appropriate for discussion on the Waste Disposal Bill, the concept and the principle of reduction of waste at source deserves to be included in any serious environmental legislation. I would like to think this is serious environmental legislation and this deserves to be included in the Bill.  While I have no difficulty in supporting the Minister's amendment as far as it goes, I would like her to add the principle of the reduction of waste at source or accept that part of my amendment when we get to it.</P>

      <P>We are talking about landfill sites.  The reduction of waste at source is a matter for decision where the waste is produced in the first place by giving incentives or specifying obligations to reduce it or whatever.  That is a matter which is being considered in the context of the waste Bill which is currently being drafted.  It would be the intention to give the agency responsibility for certain aspects of that Bill when it is being debated.  When the Bill is being discussed we will deal with the issues that will be the responsibility of the agency.  The two will not be separate.  What we are talking about here is introducing a requirement in conection with landfill sites for the reduction of waste at source.  I do not think it is relevant to the issue of landfill sites.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 65:</P>
      <P>In page 46, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f) data on the toxicity and flammability of all emissions listed in paragraph (e)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My sympathy is with my two colleagues: I am amazed by the ruling on amendment No. 64.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 65 relates to the section of the Bill which deals with the environmental quality data storage system which the agency shall establish and maintain.  Sometime, informally, I would love to have a discussion with the Minister about the criteria used for the selection of &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in various sections of the Bill.  I am glad the agency will have to establish and maintain a data base related to environmental quality.</P>
      <P>Section 66 (2) contains a list of provisions. My amendment simply wants to add to that list the data on the toxicity and flammability of all emissions listed in paragraph (e).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I want toxicity and flammability included is that they are the two <Col N="1257" /> things that most concern citizens in terms of emissions from plants.  What concerns them most is the harm they might do. They are also concerned about the possibility of fire or an explosion resulting from those emissions.  There are a number of issues to be raised there.  I read with interest the Minister's view on this.  She says that: &ldquo;something on the lines of the US toxic release inventory would be a better option, be more meaningful and helpful to the public and probably result in reductions of emissions if the American experience is repeated&rdquo;. The Minister may be right and a standardised method might well take over from this.  If the agency is obliged to tell the public that a long list of substances with obscure names are being released but is not obliged to tell them the hazards involved, the risk to human health and the possibility of a fire, then we are in a peculiar pickle.</P>
    <P>In column 1780 of the Official Report of Seanad Eireann dated 10 May 1990 the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I have been advised by my technical advisers in the Department that this provision would not be a practical proposition as toxicity and flammability are only meaningful when used in relation to a specific medium, life form or location.</P>
    <P>Most human beings consider toxicity in terms of &ldquo;will it kill us or not&rdquo;.  To quote from a more authoritative source than Brendan Ryan, the Byrne Ó Cléirigh report which the Minister's office supplied to me, deals with the proposed national incinerator and with the question of hazardous waste.  It refers us to the draft EC directive on hazardous waste of August 1988 which gives the definition in Annex 3 of what is an explosive substance, what is an oxidising substance, what is a highly flammable substance, a flammable substance, what is an irritant, what is harmful, toxic, carcinogenic and corrosive.</P>
    <P>If the Minister told me that my amendment did not go far enough and should list all those criteria then perhaps we could have a discussion.  In my limited <Col N="1258" /> technical knowledge, the toxicity of a substance is measured as either an LD50 or an LC50, two different ways of testing the toxicity of substances on animals. Without getting into the ethical question of whether this is right, they are the criteria that are used.  They are then linked with threshold limit values which are stated data under defined criteria.</P>
    <P>In relation to flammability there is an upper explosive limit, a lower explosive limit and a flashpoint.  It is the first time that I have been informed that people cannot be given any sort of data about toxicity or flammability because they can only be used in relation to a specific medium, life form or location.  It is true that toxicity is different for a human being, an animal or a bird.  It is true that flammability depends on whether the substance is in the presence of oxygen but it is disingenuous to suggest that technical fact can be used not to give people access to the information that is available about the toxicity of substances that are released into their environment.  We can argue about the wording of the amendment but I cannot understand why the agency responsible for making available to people details about emissions into their environment should not be obliged to inform them of the risks.</P>
    <P>One of the problems for technical people is that science is not nearly as knowledgable as it pretends.  I quote from the OECD report of May, 1987:</P>
    <P>Many thousands of chemicals currently in commercial use have not been adequately assessed for their potential hazards to man or the environment.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the problem is that they would have to tell people that it is not known if a lot of what is allowed into the atmosphere is considered harmful or harmless. There is also the question of whether we can tell what is being emitted from a hazardous waste incinerator.  The truth is that we do not know half the things that are emitted.  We can only search for the things we know exist.</P>
    <P>If people are to be told what is emitted, the data base that contains details of the <Col N="1259" /> emissions should also contain information about the relative hazards of the emissions.  Hazard identification is not vague, it is fairly well quantified.  The measurements on which it is based are specific.  They do not apply universally but they can be stated in a fashion which tells people what they need to know about themselves.  Should it be decided that inventories of emissions into the environment should be kept by the Environmental Protection Agency, then the hazards of those emissions should be part of the data base on which those inventories are kept.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator's interest in ensuring that maximum information is available to the public about toxicity and flammability of emissions into the environment.  Perhaps the introduction of the concept into this section is not the most appropriate for all sorts of practical reasons.  For example, as regards the more wide-ranging emissions of substances such as sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxide and volatile organic compounds, there is standard and well-documented information on toxicity and inflammability.  Anyone who has an understanding of the implications would have no difficulty in finding that information.</P>
      <P>In relation to emissions from licensed activities, these will be dealt with in the context of applications for licences.  The information obtained as regards such emissions, including toxicity and flammability, will form part of the information held and the licence register to which public access is being provided for under section 86.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agency will have power under section 84 (2) (d) to seek information which could include toxicity and flammability data from applicants.  In addition, I consider that something on the lines of the US toxic release inventory would be <Col N="1260" /> a better option.  It would be more meaningful and helpful to the public and probably result in reductions of emissions if the American experience is repeated.</P>
    <P>I am investigating the possibility for providing for such an inventory in the new waste legislation and I do not think we should include a similar type of provision in two separate Bills.  I am confused as to whether the Senator is asking for details of the substances so that somebody else can decide their level of toxicity or flammability in regard either to animal life or human life or whether he expects that this will be done by the agency.  I do not think that would be either desirable or possible.  Obviously a lot depends on the levels and exposure.  I am not a scientist. The Senator quoted what I said the last day.  I have nothing further to add.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to take the advice of my technical advisers who know more about this than I do.  The register of the details of the licence conditions, emissions and so on will be available for public inspection.  The details will be contained in the register and will be open to anyone who wishes to measure the toxicity and flammability.  I do not think it will be a matter for the agency to analyse those matters.  In any event, if the aim is to have information made public with a view to reducing the level of such substances, it is more appropriate to deal with it in the way the Americans have, which has had a dramatic effect on the level of pollutants and on the nature of substances which are used and the various chemical emissions.  In all, about 20,000 different industries are covered in the United States where they have to submit details annually of about 320 different substances that are used.  The actual obligation to submit the information, without any mandatory condition to do anything about the substances in itself, because of the access the public have had to that information and so on has led to a huge reduction in the use of these substances <Col N="1261" /> in the first place.  Something of that kind is desirable here and it is being examined in the context of waste legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have here before me a draft EC directive on hazardous waste. Just for the record, it defines for instance, &ldquo;highly flammable&rdquo; as &ldquo;liquid substances and preparations having a flashpoint below 21º centigrade&rdquo;.  If a draft EC directive can define a flammable substance as that, either all the experts in the EC are wrong or I am wrong or the Minister is wrong.  The directive defines &ldquo;flammable&rdquo; as &ldquo;liquids substances and preparations having a flashpoint equal to or greater than 21º centrigade&rdquo;.  It then defines toxic substances as &ldquo;substances which, if they are inhaled or ingested or if they penetrate the skin may involve serious, acute or chronic health risks and even death&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In regard to the concept of toxicity, since we cannot test all these substances on human beings we have to test them on animals.  There are only a limited number of ways of testing the toxicity of substances and tragically, the major method of identifying carcinogens which have been allowed into the human environment has been counting dead bodies. Epidemiological studies are by far the most effective methods of identifying potential carcinogens and that, tragically, has been the experience over the years. I am not asking that the Environmental Protection Agency should do studies of this.  I am simply saying that a body with its resources should assemble the data so that the ordinary citizen can know precisely what risks are involved.</P>
      <P>Let us talk about polycyclic or heterocyclic aromatic compounds, aliphatic amines, aromatic amines, ethers, any congenor of polychlorinated diben-zo-furans, any congenor of polychlorinated dibenzop-dioxin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disingenous of the Minister to talk to me about sulphur dioxide and nitric oxide, for instance.  We all know about sulphur dioxide and nitric oxide.  There are thousands of substances and only a specialised agency dedicated to the task can assemble that information so that <Col N="1262" /> every local group does not have to work through Green Net or one of these groups to get information about the evidence that is available about the toxicity or otherwise of much more obscure substances. I am not too worried about suplhur dioxide any more.  I am not too worried about dioxides of nitrogen any more.  We now realise how hazardous they are and nobody will get away with emission levels of any significance for those but there are thousands of other substances that are obscure and we do not understand the toxicity of many of them.  Citizens are entitled to know if our Environmental Protection Agency does not know whether a substance is toxic or not.  They are entitled to know what the agency knows about the toxicity of substances and similarily about flammability.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while I would have been prepared to listen to the Minister on the appropriateness of my amendment, I have to say that I am not satisfied with her response on this one that they are going to have an inventory of emissions. This means, presumably, that we are going to have some data about all of the emissions that are going into the atmosphere and we are going to have them all in a data base.  The citizen will then say: &ldquo;What harm will these emissions do?  Are they risky?  Are the concentrations that are liable to emerge in my area dangerous?&rdquo; and the Environmental Protection Agency will say: &ldquo;No.  When the Oireachtas passes the waste management Bill we may have a toxic release inventory available which will tell you that&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the less than whole-hearted acceptance of this.  Part of the necessary data to be available to people should be the risks to them of emissions.  My suspicion is &mdash; I am not accusing the Minister or her advisers of this &mdash; that many scientists are reluctant to admit that they do not know the hazards involved.  They can say quite happily that there is no scientific evidence at this stage to show that this substance is dangerous.  That does not mean it has been proven to be safe.  It simply means <Col N="1263" /> that it has not been proven to be dangerous. Therefore, I cannot withdraw the amendment.</P>

Therefore, it seems to me that given the importance of environmental audits in terms of improving the quality of environmental appreciation and protection, etc, by various activities, it seems to me perfectly reasonable that the Environmental Protection Agency should have an obligation, not a discretionary power, to promote environmental audits.</P>

      <P>The whole concept of the environmental auditing does not as yet exist in this country.  I think it is desirable that it should be introduced and that the agency should be given responsibility for introducing it to those sectors or areas of activity where it believes it is desirable.  I believe that in the first couple of years of <Col N="1266" /> its introduction it should be discretionary rather than mandatory for every single operation to have to carry out an environmental audit.  While I have no doubt that eventually we may get to that situation in relation to most activities, I think, initially, it is only desirable that that be the case in relation to certain matters. Therefore, it is desirable that this function, which is a very new and radical one in Irish legislation, should be at the discretion of the Environmental Protection Agency and I do not think it is desirable to insist that the agency does things simply for the sake of doing them. I think we should leave it at the discretion of the agency to introduce the concept of environmental auditing into those areas of activities where it believes it is not necessary and desirable.</P>
      <P>The discretions should rest with the agency so that they can, both in terms of their resources and expertise, concentrate their activities into the areas where they, as environmental professionals, believe they are most needed. I am not certain that we should be giving the agency a host of mandatory conditions simply for the sake of doing it.  If that were the case, it would mean that many things would only be done as a matter of course rather than because they are important, necessary and desirable.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Minister is making a mistake or being badly advised but there is nothing in my amendment which would suggest that if the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; replaces &ldquo;may&rdquo; the agency would have to go around making every process carry out environmental audits.  For the first time in the debate on this Environmental Protection Agency Bill I am beginning to get a little annoyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have discussed the landfills earlier where the Minister objected to the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo; and suggested that if &ldquo;shall&rdquo; went instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo; it would have to apply to every landfill site in the country on the spot.  We now have the Minister suggesting that if &ldquo;shall&rdquo; goes instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo; the agency will immediately have to enforce every process in the country to carry out an environmental audit.  Any reading of section 71 makes it quite clear that it is <Col N="1267" /> not the case.  What the section would say is: &ldquo;The agency shall promote the carrying out of environmental audits&rdquo;.  It does not say it shall make people, shall compel, shall require, it says it shall &ldquo;promote&rdquo; and whether it has &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo; it seems to me that it does not even have the power to make anybody carry out an environmental audit.  It cannot require anybody to do it whether it is discretionary or otherwise.  All it says is the agency may promote the carrying out of environmental audits.  This is, as the Minister said, extremely important, extremely innovative.</P>
    <P>Water quality management plans in 1977 were also discretionary and have not yet been drawn up by some local authorities after 14 years.  I am extremely sceptical about discretionary powers.  In 1977 the Water Pollution Act gave local authorities the discretionary power to draw up water quality management plans.  Some of them still have not done it and we are in 1991.  I am extremely nervous of the number of discretionary areas in this legislation which will quite likely be left because they are difficult.  I get annoyed when the Minister suggests something that seems to be manifestly at variance with a reasonable reading of this.  There is nothing in my amendment which would make the agency tell every process in the country to carry out an environmental audit.  It simply says that instead of having the discretionary power to promote environmental audits, they have to promote environmental audits and that is all it says.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Again we are going through the same increasingly frustrating routine.  These are environmental quality objectives. What could be more central to the role of an Environmental Protection Agency than the specification and publication of quality objectives which the agency considers reasonable and desirable for the <Col N="1268" /> purposes of environmental protection? What do we have?  The agency &ldquo;may&rdquo; do it.  In relation to any environmental medium, it does not have to specify and publish quality objectives which the agency considers reasonable and desirable for the purposes of environmental protection.  What will an environmental protection agency which does not have to specify environmental quality objectives do if it does not have to specify environmental quality objectives?  Will it operate on an <i>ad hoc</i>, one-at-a-time basis without any principles or basic criteria?</P>

It would state: &ldquo;The Agency shall, in relation to any environmental medium and without prejudice to its functions under section 100, specify and publish quality objectives which the agency considers reasonable and desirable for the purposes of environmental protection.&rdquo;  It could start off with what is currently available and it could build up from that with time as it considers reasonable and desirable.  How many qualifications, sub-clauses or adverbs do you have to put into a subsection to protect the agency from ever being forced to do anything?  First it &ldquo;may&rdquo; and then, having been given that enormous discretion, we go through the Bill and it says &ldquo;which the Agency considers reasonable and desirable&rdquo;.  As far as I am concerned my amendment is eminently more reasonable, than that it should have to do what it believes to be reasonable and desirable.  That is not much of an objective.</P>

I am a committed Senator and I hope the Minister will take this in the way I mean it because we are good friends.  This Bill is being taken very seriously by some of us in this House.  As <Col N="1269" /> a senior Senator I am a little annoyed to be told by any Minister that the Bill is going back to the Dáil to be amended there.  I say that with the greatest respect to the Dáil.  I have proved myself to be a committed Member of this House.  Legislation which goes through here is important, regardless of the daft people who believe this House should be abolished.

The Committee Stage was very long and arduous as many Senators know.  We gave a lot of time to it and I took the whole debate very seriously.

      <P>In page 54, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;79.  Nothing in this Act shall be construed as preventing the Agency from refusing a licence where the Agency is satisfied that such a refusal is required in the interest of environmental protection.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is in response to a point made to me by some people involved in the environmental movement in Cork. They said it is difficult to take from this Bill one clear message, which is that the agency has the right to refuse a licence where it is not satisfied that an operation can operate to standards which will ensure that the environment is protected. When you take five or six different criteria together and the various powers and obligations that the agency has, I am fairly sure that this is not true because I cannot see an omission like this slipping through, particularly since we have been on this Bill for too long at this Stage.  I would still like to have it made perfectly clear to me, and to some of the people who raised it with me, that the agency can refuse a licence where it is satisfied that such a refusal is required in the interests of environmental protection.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. This is the only amendment apart from one later on which we can deal with on Part IV because some of the others were ruled out of order for whatever reasons; however, I will not go into that now.  I have great pleasure in seconding Senator Brendan Ryan's amendment particularly firming up the whole area of issuing licences and establishing that the agency is entitled to refuse.  This is all part of the confusion that I feel will exist when we have a dual system in the planning procedure on the one hand and the licensing procedure on the other.  I seriously ask the Minister to again consider this area very carefully.  We all welcome the concept of integrated pollution control licensing but the Minister now proposes that the agency becomes the licensing authority &mdash; she has intimated a couple of times tonight that she is looking at certain aspects of this section.  I am not quite sure what she has in mind and to what extent she is going to investigate it. Perhaps in her reply to this amendment she would elaborate on what actually is being looked at.  That would be very useful because we could know in which direction this area might be going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very strong view that if the agency becomes the licensing authority as proposed in this Bill many inconsistencies would occur as well as the concerns as indicated in this amendment.  For example, planning and pollution control, which are at present handled by the local authorities, would split between separate agencies in the case of projects which would require integrated pollution control licences.  There would also be an inconsistency in the right of appeal. There still would be appeals to An Bord Pleanála against the trade effluent discharge licence or conditions contained therein or an atmospheric emission licence but in relation to the integrated pollution control licence, which it is now proposed to give the agency, there would be no right of appeal.  There is no point in saying that we can go to the High Court because that virtually takes from objectors their third party rights established under the planning process, the trade effluent licence process and the atmospheric emission licence process. <Col N="1272" /> There is a duality then and an inconsistency there.</P>
    <P>Under the Minister's proposals here the conditions attached to the integrated polution control licence may not be compatible with the proper planning in the area as there would be two bodies, the local authority plus the Environmental Protection Agency dealing with them and this may cause enormous future problems. Planning and pollution control, as we all know, are indivisible and cannot be separated without creating duplication and administrative difficulties.  I ask the Minister to look at Part IV again.</P>
    <P>The opportunity should have been taken to unify and integrate these processes so that a single set of permissions and licences could be issued simultaneously and not through two different agencies as is now being proposed.  It is considered by many that it would be preferable for the agency not to function as a licensing authority and that the local authorities should be responsible for issuing all permissions and licences.  I support that view strongly.</P>
    <P>When issuing licences for the types of development listed in the First Schedule the local authority must consult the agency and must have regard to any recommendations made by the agency. Any appeals against a refusal of a licence or against the conditions attached to licences should be made to An Bord Pleanála and that will not be allowed under what you the Minister is proposing.</P>
    <P>In the case of scheduled developments or activities, An Bord Pleanála must seek the advice of the agency and must have regard to any recommendations made by the agency.  If an oral hearing has to be held then an An Bord Pleanála inspector should be assisted by technical assessors from the agency.</P>
    <P>The system proposed in this amendment would remove the Environmental Protection Agency from direct involvement in the issuing of licences &mdash; a role which could be perceived as conflicting with its more fundamental and unique function to protect the environment.  I feel strongly that the Minister is compromising the integrity of the agency as an environmental watchdog by handing them the task of issuing licences.  Local <Col N="1273" /> authorities have to maintain a balance between their roles as development agencies on the one hand and protectors of the environment on the other.  The Environmental Protection Agency should be free to concentrate its energies on its role of protector of the environment. I ask the Minister not to compromise the integrity of the agency by asking them to issue licences.  Leave that to the local authorities and to the appeals procedure we have and if difficulties arise we may bring in the Environmental Protection Agency to say, &ldquo;Stop, the standards are right&rdquo; or &ldquo;The standards are not right&rdquo;, or to prosecute or take whatever action is appropriate. The agency's licensing function is one of the major weaknesses of an otherwise good Bill.</P>
    <P>Allowing local authorities to remain unaffected by directives of the Environmental Protection Agency is another major weakness of the Bill.  I do not know what the Minister is examining in this area and perhaps she would indicate tonight what she intends to look at between now and when the Bill goes to the Dáil to allay the fears of some of us in this House and of some of the Minister's best supporters and some environmental agencies who are watching the progress of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 80 (1) the agency has an absolute discretion to grant a licence subject to, or without, conditions or to refuse to grant a licence. The power to refuse a licence is further strengthened by the separate provisions of section 80 (3) which prohibits the agency from granting a licence unless it is satisfied that the specified criteria can be met.  There are, therefore, no constraints or restrictions applying whatever to the grant of licences which would necessitate the amendment suggested by the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discretionary power of the agency to grant or refuse licences is further reenforced by the provisions of section 85 in relation to the review of such licences which illustrates some of the situations under which the agency may revise the licence but always without prejudice to <Col N="1274" /> the generality of their powers.  I, therefore, believe that this amendment is unnecessary.  It is clear from section 80 (1) that the agency operates totally at its own discretion in deciding whether in the first instance to issue a licence and then in determining conditions and it can only issue the licence if it satisfied the criteria or conditions can be met.</P>
    <P>In relation to the points made by Senator Doyle, I am anxious to streamline the planning and integrated pollution control system to make sure that they are effective and to reduce further delays and complications in what many would regard as an already complicated system.  Even with the integrated licensing regime being proposed, the Irish planning system is more favourable to industrialists than that of many other countries.  It is not fair to say that Ireland has the longest delays in determining planning applications.  As a small country we do not want to place additional burdens either on industry or on environmental organisations who from time to time have to oppose or modify certain proposals or whatever.  It is, therefore, important to have the most streamlined and effective system and my officials are currently having discussions with various interests to see how we can improve the provisions in the Bill so that they will meet with the greatest level of satisfaction.</P>
    <P>We had a wider debate on this matter on Committee Stage and I undertook to do that.  My officials and I have applied ourselves this but we have not finally cleared our minds as to the best way to proceed and it would be wrong, therefore, to bring in amendments here until such time as we are happy that they would increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the integrated pollution control and planning regime we propose.  Many suggestions in this matter were made on Committee Stage which will be taken on board, I am sorry I cannot be clearer but as soon as possible I will indicate my decision because it is desirable that those who have made a case like the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries, some of the environmental organisations, such as An Taisce, and the Confederation of Irish Industry should be informed.  We will <Col N="1275" /> make our position clear as soon as is practicable, to use legal jargon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 75:</P>
      <P>In page 55, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) the views of the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health on the activity for which a licence is sought.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I want to catch up on the earlier debate on Committee Stage.  I was not in the House when this amendment was discussed but fortunately the Minister referred to it in her remarks on another amendment and, therefore, I am entitled to raise it again.  I thank the Minister for her generosity, which is not to say that I thought much of her reply when she did mention it.</P>
      <P>The objective of this amendment relates to what the Environmental Protection Agency must do in considering an application for a licence.  It must have regard to relevant air quality management plans, relevant noise regulations, special control areas and to such matters related to the prevention, limitation, elimination, abatement and reduction of environmental pollution as is considered necessary.  I want inserted there as an additional paragraph in section 80 (2) that the views of the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health be sought and I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying the official title of that agency for me.  Otherwise my amendment could have been conveniently avoided because I would have used the wrong name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in her reply suggested that this agency was just one more body. In the spirit of the amendment she said that while she agreed that the views of that authority should be an important factor in the consideration or the review of a licence, it could be just as relevant for the agency to consult the health <Col N="1276" /> board, the Heritage Council, the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public works and many other bodies.  The answer is that it could not be because the philosophical basis of loss prevention and hazard minimisation within all of the process industries is to treat the inside and the outside as part of a whole.  At the risk of pretending to be more knowledgeable than I am, I refer to a journal called <i>The Process, Safety and Environmental Protection</i> which the Institution of Chemical Engineers produces on a monthly basis. This journal deals with safety problems inside the plant and environmental problems outside the plant in the same journal because they recognise, as do an increasing section of the professions that safety, health and the environment are three aspects of the same question and cannot be dealt with separately.  That is why the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health is effectively the environmental protection agency for inside the factory walls.  The same hazards apply to the workforce that will apply to people in the region; the same substances threaten their well being.</P>
    <P>In the early stages of first year chemical engineering, a student is taught the definition of a hazard: an incident or a happening which may result in the loss of production, the loss of life, serious injury to people and something which may damage or insult the environment.  The two aspects are taken together as part of a whole and it is clear that if serious and consistent criteria are to be applied to environmental protection outside the plant, the highest standards of safety and health must also be inforced inside.  This agency is different from all the others mentioned above because its role within the plant fulfils the objectives of the Environmental Protection Agency outside the plant.</P>
    <P>One cannot look only at the emissions at the end of the pipe.  The environmentally secure, safe and acceptable industries will be those that meet the highest standards of health and safety operation inside.  The two things fit perfectly together.  The practices, the sloppiness, the lack of training, the lack of respect for the substances which would prevail in an unsafe plant, would have a <Col N="1277" /> spin off on the outside.  Safety hazards outside and inside the plant should not be distinguished and it seems to me that the Environmental Protection Agency should be obliged to consult the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health before it gives a licence.</P>

      <P>I do not disagree with what Senator Ryan has just said.  It is desirable that the agency consult with the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health either before a licence is issued or when a licence is being reviewed.  I am against singling out particular organisations in the body of the legislation but I can give the Senator an undertaking that, in the regulations to be made under section 77, we will specify that the National Authority for Occupational Health and Safety will be consulted if that is in order.  In relation to other matters other bodies will have to be consulted if that is in order and it is desirable that we do that by way of regulations rather than by specification in the body of the legislation.</P>

      <P>I cannot be reasonable and I do not accept that.  The philosophical point is of fundamental importance to a proper understanding of how you deal with hazard minimisation.  The national agency which is responsible for health and safety within the work force is central to the proper operation of environmental protection outside.  This authority is different from all other bodies.  It has a statutory obligation to look after the well being of the work force and to see that proper standards are met.  Unlike all other bodies, it is the equivalent of the Environmental Protection Agency within the environment of the work force and, therefore, I do not think the Minister's <Col N="1278" /> assurance is adequate.  I cannot withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>As a newly elected county councillor to the area, one of the principal problems I encountered related to nursing homes in Bray, County Wicklow.  This extends as far as Greystones and probably further down the eastern coast of County Wicklow.  There are at least 25 nursing homes in the Bray/Greystones area, the majority of which are situated in Bray itself.  During my canvass and campaign of that area I found that the unanimous complaint from these nursing homes was about the delays in payment from the Eastern Health Board.  I was rung up by one nursing home owner who complained about this and I confirmed the problem with every other owner and proprietor of a nursing home I came across in Bray.  This causes extreme difficulty for nursing homes because it is impossible for the owners to plan their financial year or their future.  I do not need to remind the Minister that these homes are looking after people of a very old age, many of whom are senile, some of whom have Alzheimer's disease.  Many of them are incontinent and for many reasons are incapable of looking after themselves.  They need constant attention and care of a very sophisticated variety.</P>
      <P>The subvention to these patients is, I believe £39.55 per patient a week, given to them by the Eastern Health Board. The problem is that these payments are late; they are extremely late and are getting later.  It is now July and has not only the June payment not been paid but, as of the day before yesterday, when I checked with some of these nursing homes, the May payment had not been made, the April payment had not been made nor had the March payment.  These nursing homes are at least four months behind in their subventions from the Eastern Health Board.  Even worse, when I checked today, one nursing home had received one payment and another nursing home had received two together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I maintain that the Eastern Health Board's methods of payment are so chaotic that the very existence of these nursing homes is at risk.  They do not know when they will get these subventions which are their lifeline and the basis on which they operate.  I asked several nursing home owners what the situation was when they got in touch with the Eastern Health Board.  They understood that the payments would be made maybe one month in arrears.  They all said categorically that when they got in touch with the payment section in the Eastern Health Board they were put off.  They were passed to someone else, their queries were deferred but they were never given an adequate answer either regarding the delay in payment or when they would actually get paid.  They were given excuses.  Some were informed that they <Col N="1281" /> had been told not to release cheques yet, others were told the cheques needed extra signatories, and some were given other excuses such as that it was not their responsibility.  They were told anything to get them off the telephone, but they were not told when they would get the cheque to which they had a right.  As a result of these appallingly erratic payments &mdash; and that is the most charitable way of putting it &mdash; the nursing homes in Bray and Greystones are working on very large overdrafts and are finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet. They have overdrafts of tens of thousands of pounds which result in very small profit margins, if they make any profit at all at this stage.  It is unreasonable that the Government, through the Eastern Health Board, should be putting those involved in a very necessary and relatively unprofitable venture under this sort of pressure.  Playing about with the patients' health should not be permitted by a Government or by the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>Another complaint I have heard but have not confirmed &mdash; maybe the Minister will be able to confirm or deny it &mdash; is that the Eastern Health Board pays smaller subventions to nursing homes than any of the other health boards.  The rest of the country gets £7.02 per patient per day while the Eastern Health Board only pays out £5.65.  Many of the nursing homes paid by the Eastern Health Board get assurances in writing every July that they will receive increases but they never materialise.  As a result it is impossible once again for the nursing homes to plan. There is a breach of promise by the Government to those involved in a very vital health service.  The Minister should realise this, even though the objective of most nursing homes is to make a profit and their proprietors who have wide experience in the nursing world also want to make a profit.</P>
    <P>If the Government, through the Eastern Health Board, deny the nursing homes the possibility of making a profit, then the nursing homes will have to close. As a result the Government will inevitably have to take on that responsibility, will have to set up State nursing homes <Col N="1282" /> and will have to take on the responsibility for these geriatric patients, many of whom are totally incapable of looking after themselves.  That is the doomsday picture but it may be the reality in Bray or Greystones if these people are not given assurances about the time and the amounts they will be paid.  I would like the Minister to give me firm pledges, which will be kept, about these payments and tell me what the timelag will be.</P>
    <P>At the moment the proprietors are living in wonderland waiting for their cheques.  They are ringing the Eastern Health Board three, four or five times because the payments are three and sometimes five months overdue.  The inevitable result of this will be that the patients' health will suffer, the banks to whom these nursing homes are in debt will sooner or later say they can go no further.  I have seen the overdrafts some of these people are running on and I do not understand why banks have given them these overdrafts.  They are given on the basis that there is a cheque coming from the Eastern Health Board.  It is an impossible way to run a business and it is utterly wrong that any health board should pay out so erratically and so sporadically. I would like the Minister to tell me that in future these payments will be paid on time, and will be paid regularly.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies, I would like to apologise to the House for missing the last vote.  I was to be contacted but, unfortunately, I was across the road and I did not get the message.</P>

      <P>First, I would like to congratulate Senator Ross on his election to Wicklow County Council and hope he enjoys his time there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regards of the issue before us, there are three kinds of accommodation for the elderly: there are the State run institutions, the private nursing homes and the voluntary nursing homes which are non profit-making.  The Health (Homes for Incapacitated Persons) Act, 1964, and the Homes for Incapacitated Persons Regulations, 1985, govern the operation <Col N="1283" /> of private nursing homes at present.  Subventions may be paid to dependent persons in approved nursing homes under section 54 of the Health Act, 1970. Health boards may also utilise section 26 of the 1970 Act to pay subventions to dependent persons in nursing homes that operate in compliance with the 1964 Act and the 1985 Regulations on a means tested basis.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to the difference between the Eastern Health Board and other health boards.  I am unaware that the Eastern Health Board pay less than the other health boards by way of subvention, but unlike the other health boards the Eastern Health Board use the latter section I referred to, section 26 of the 1970, to pay subventions whereas the other health boards have always used section 54 of the 1970 Act which gives the right to recognise nursing homes.  No nursing home has been recognised under that section of the Act, however, since 1981.</P>
    <P>I would also draw the Senator's attention to the Health (Nursing Home) Act, 1990, which I introduced in the Dáil and Seanad last year.  That Act will place a statutory duty on health boards to register nursing homes.  The boards will also be enabled to subvent a person in need of care in a registered nursing home following an assessment of the person's dependency and their means and circumstances. Something that is new is that the health boards will be able to subvent a person in a nursing home and there will not be a restriction on the amount.  It will take into account the means of the person and also the degree of dependency.  In other words, the health board will be able to subvent a person who is incapacitated to a greater extent.  For example a person with Alzheimer's disease would be seen as very dependent and the higher subvention could be paid by the health board in those circumstances.  At present we are drafting regulations to give effect to the provisions of the Act and it is hoped to implement that Act later this year. Section 54 of the Health Act will be repealed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1284" /> In addition to present expenditure by health boards on nursing home subventions, a further £0.5 million has been provided this year to implement the new legislation.  I would also refer the Senator to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which includes a commitment to provide adequate numbers of extended chair beds for the elderly, especially in those board areas experiencing a rapid increase in their elderly population.  As the Senator is aware, there was a special allocation of £5 million in 1990.  That was repeated in this year's estimate and a further £3 million was added in the budget to improve the services for the elderly.  The health boards receive a <i>pro rata</i> share of the money provided in 1990 and again this year, depending on the number of elderly in their area.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board pays £3.1 million per annum to nursing homes within the board's functional area in respect of the cost of subventions and contract beds.  In recent years there has been a significant increase in the demand for subvention from dependent persons in nursing homes, and in order to meet this increased demand it has been necessary for the board to structure the release of cheque payments in line with the cash and overdraft facilities available.  In this regard it is the policy of the board to try to maintain a payment period of not more than two months for nursing home accounts.  The board maintains regular contact with the nursing homes in its area and arrangements are in place to deal with any particular cases or difficulty which arise from this policy.</P>
    <P>I might point out that it is not a matter for me or my Department, it is for individual health boards when they pay their creditors.  I will bring the points raised by the Senator here this evening to the attention of the health boards.</P>
