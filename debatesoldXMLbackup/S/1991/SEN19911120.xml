      <P>I have notice from Senator Mooney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to investigate the circumstances surrounding the placement of a teacher (details supplied) in County Leitrim on the panel and to request the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to meeting existing staffing levels at Drumshanbo Central Primary School.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for improved sewerage treatment in Greystones, County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Manning of the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the continued dissatisfaction among former employees of Irish Shipping, the need for the Minister to outline (a) the number of meetings he had with them in the last year, (b) any planned future meetings, and (c) his plans to respond to representation regarding their position.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Jackman of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="842" /> The need for the Minister for the Environment to notify local authorities immediately of their rates support grant to facilitate local authorities in compiling their estimates.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Raftery of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Government to take immediate action to help more than 6,000 farmers who are having difficulty paying their land annuities as otherwise over 400,000 acres of land will be returned to the State.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator O'Keeffe of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to ensure that the post office at Kilmurray, County Cork, which was recently closed, is reopened at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for clarification by the Minister for Education in relation to the purchase of Carysfort College having regard to comments made in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Mooney, Ross, Manning, Jackman, Raftery and Cosgrave as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Mooney's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Ross, Manning, Jackman, Raftery and Cosgrave may give notice another day of the matters they which to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have to rule the matter raised by Senator O'Keeffe as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with the Order of Business for today I would like on behalf of all the Members of the <Col N="843" /> House to extend sympathy to the wife and family of former Senator Dalgan Lyons, who died recently. I also express the sympathy of the House to the wife, family and colleagues of Corporal Michael McCarthy who, tragically, was killed on a peace-keeping mission with UNIFIL. Coming as I do from an Army town that has had, unfortunately, its share of fatalities overseas over the past number of years, I know full well the grief this killing brings to the family and friends of those who are killed.</P>
      <P>I turn now to the Order of Business for today: Item No. 1 &mdash; all Stages of the Liability for Defective Products Bill, 1991 to 6 p.m.; there will be a sos from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. following by Item No. 12, Motion 36, from 6.30 p.m. until 8 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest, if the House agrees, that the leaders of the groups in the House might wish to be associated with the votes of sympathy as proposed by Senator Fallon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to concur and second the motion of sympathy to the wife and family of the late Senator Dalgan Lyons. Dalgan served with distinction not only in this House but also in the Dáil and on behalf of all my colleagues I would like to be associated with the sentiments of the Leader of the House, Senator Fallon.</P>
      <P>We would like to be associated also with the words of sympathy to the wife and very young family of the late Corporal Michael McCarthy who was so tragically killed on UNIFIL duty recently. An incident such as this reminds us all of the risk, and indeed the bravery, of all those serving in the Defence Forces overseas &mdash; a point which at times we are inclined to forget, particularly if they are in a peace-keeping role and not actively involved in wartime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Order of Business, may I through you, a Chathaoirligh, ask the Leader of the House to give the House today a date for the Maastricht debate? He very kindly promised the House a <Col N="844" /> debate prior to the Maastricht Summit. As the weeks close on the Maastricht meeting we would like assurances of when the debate will be held in his House and assurances that it will be a long and considered debate on perhaps one of the most important matters we could be discussing that will affect not just our lives but indeed those of our children and our children's children for years to come if the country does not get it right and if Maastricht does not get it right.</P>
    <P>May I ask the Leader of the House also what progress is being made in relation to the two announcements made recently by the Taoiseach concerning an EC affairs committee and the foreign affairs committee he promised last week? I have checked specifically the answer to the parliamentary question and he has promised a full foreign affairs committee as well as a revamped EC affairs committee. I would like to know what contact the Leader of the House has had with his colleagues in the other House, and indeed with his party Whip, to know the state of play and if he could inform this House weekly on the progress regarding the setting up of both these committees. While revamping, if you like, the terms of reference of the EC committee and the setting up of a foreign affairs committee, all sides of this House have called for a very long time for a broad foreign affairs committee.</P>
    <P>We welcome the announcements by the Taoiseach but do not want to see the matter left any longer or put on the long finger over the Christmas break before we know what is happening. We have expressed frustration with our inability to debate wide foreign affairs matters, not just EC matters but matters such as the Yugoslav problem and, further afield, the difficulties in the Third World. If we had these committees many of the debates that all Members of this House wish to participate in could be siphoned through these committees. I would like if the Leader of the House would consider a weekly monitoring of the situation and keep us up to date on a weekly basis on the progress on the setting up of both these important committees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan will deal with the votes of sympathy on behalf of the independent group.</P>
      <P>On the other matters, I would like to put on record that I am totally frustrated with the operation of the House. I have asked over the last number of weeks for a number of specific things to be dealt with. It is disgraceful, particularly at a time when the other House is so busy, that no legislation is being introduced in this House and that there is no indication that any legislation will be introduced here. For the fourth week in succession I ask the Leader to indicate to me the items of legislation it is proposed to initiate in this House. Our role has been downgraded over the past months and it is time we put the boot in. I suggest that either we have a meeting with the Government Whip to deal with that or else we just capitulate completely. I draw attention to the fact that there does not seem to be any Whips meetings any more in order to work out the business for successive weeks and it is important that that should be done.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Government parties are totally out of touch with what is happening in the world out there? For three, four or five weeks we have been asking for a debate on the Maastricht Summit. Decisions will be taken next month and they will be screaming on the Government benches as well when they will see what has happened, what we may have missed out on, what we have refused to address and what we have refused to consider. The decisions made at Maastricht will affect the future generations of this country for as long as we can see into the future. It is a disgrace and an abrogation of responsibility that we have not got a commitment to a debate on this matter at this stage and not the week of the summit or the week after the summit. I would like to have a clear commitment on this topic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I join in the expression of sympathy to the family of the late Dalgan Lyons, who represented Mayo both in this House and in the other House for many years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="846" /> I would also like to be associated with the words of sympathy to the family of the late Michael McCarthy who was killed on duty with UNIFIL. It is only at times like this that we fully realise the tremendous work our Army does overseas in its peace-keeping role; indeed it is only at times like this we were made fully aware of the risks that are part and parcel of the work they do.</P>
    <P>I would also like to express my wishes for a speedy recovery to Michael McCarthy's colleague who was wounded in the same incident.</P>
    <P>May I also express my regret at the closure of Century Radio Station? I thought the people who worked at Century Radio did a very good job and I am sorry to see 50 jobs gone. The news service which that station operated was first class and I am sorry to see it go. On that note, may I ask the Leader of the House to convey again to the Government my request that even at this stage they would consider publishing a White Paper on broadcasting so that the various issues in relation to broadcasting can be debated in an objective manner?</P>
    <P>Finally, a Chathaoirligh, I understand Senator Lanigan's mother died recently and I would like to express my sympathy to him on that sad event.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>May I join with other Members of the House and on behalf of my party, the Progressive Democrats, in expressing our sympathy to the family of the late Senator Lyons. In particular, I want to express our sympathy to the family of Corporal Michael McCarthy and also to his colleagues in the Fourth Infantry Batallion. This is a very sad incident and underlines once again the credit our Army brings to our country internationally through its service in UN duties. In this case the ultimate sacrifice has been paid and this House must recognise that sacrifice and the contribution the Army plays in promoting international peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also share the expressions of good wishes to Private Richard McGrath, who was wounded in the incident. There is a third person whom I would like to <Col N="847" /> single out, with your permission, a Chathaoirligh, and that is Private Camillus Ryan, a medical orderly, and who showed, I am told, extraordinary bravery in this incident in attempting to get to his fallen colleagues and to bring them back. I think he deserves the commendation of everybody in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the other Members of the House who have called for a debate before the EC Summit. It is of vital importance that such a debate should take place here within the next number of days.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Leader of the House, through you, a Chathaoirligh, if he would inform the House when local authorities will be notified about the rates support grant. Many local authorities are in the process of discussing their estimates, which have been drafted on the assumption that the rates support grant is going to be the same as last year. Local authorities do not know what the rates support grant will be and many of them have to adopt their estimates within the next week. They find themselves in the unreal situation of having to adopt their estimates within the next week without knowing what is the rates support grant. Will the Leader of the House inform us when local authorities will be notified about the grant and, if they are not notified this week, will the Minister extend the statutory time available to local authorities to adopt their estimates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure all of us share the expressions of sympathy to the families of the deceased. I could not help but reflect on the expressions of sympathy to the Irish soldier who was so tragically and needlessly killed in Lebanon. I hope that needless death will help to concentrate yet again the minds of all those involved in the fact that it is long past time that the Israeli-backed South Lebanon militia were disbanded and that the writ of the UN, particularly where the Irish are involved in South Lebanon, be allowed to run without having to face what is now yet again another tragedy. However, I <Col N="848" /> know that is no comfort to the young wife and family concerned or to the injured soldier.</P>
      <P>I am glad Senator Upton raised the issue of Century Radio. Does the Leader of the House share the serious concern expressed and the equally serious concern at the situation of Irish broadcasting following the closure of Century Radio? Is he able to tell the House when the Broadcasting Bill amendments will be coming to this House for discussion? Will he convey, through the Minister, to the Irish Radio and Television Commission their heavy responsibility to ensure that the national radio franchise is advertised without delay? I would also like to request the Leader to convey to the Minister the deep concern regarding what has now become a debacle in Irish broadcasting. The Irish Radio and Television Commission should ensure that they seriously question prospective applicants for the national franchise on their programming priorities. I believe it is not simply management problems that closed Century Radio but market forces.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that perhaps it would be more decorous if we had separated the expressions of sympathy from the general debate on the Order of Business. I also thought we had an agreement that only one spokesperson for each group would speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I made that point at the outset and I can only hope for co-operation. Senator Mooney was late obviously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like on behalf of our group to be associated with the expressions of sympathy. I am the only speaker from our group on this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the former Senator Lyons, I always think the death of a former <Col N="850" /> Member is a timely reminder to us all about our mortality and the relatively passing nature of our activities here and should cool us all down, including myself, when we are inclined to get too worked up about our importance.</P>
    <P>In regard to the death of Corporal McCarthy, there is a particular tragedy in the death of someone who works in the name of peace. The capacity of our contingent in southern Lebanon to keep the peace and to create an atmosphere of peace was well recorded by Bob Fisk when he received his Jacobs Award and made a special point of paying tribute to UNIFIL and the Irish contingent in that force. Our group would like to be associated with the words of sympathy to his family.</P>
    <P>I would also like to commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs for his prompt request to the Israeli Ambassador that they would deal with their proxy forces who have been responsible for this. I ask the leader to convey my view to the Minister that I agree fully with him on that issue.</P>
    <P>May I also ask the Leader, in support of the request of my colleague, Senator O'Keeffe, on past occasions, for some progress on a debate on the banking system. I will give as an illustration a short quote:</P>
    <P>For the past nine months small Irish enterprises have been throttled by the banks who have literally pirated their internal cashflow in order to reduce their exposure to industry.</P>
    <P>If I did not know where that came from I would have thought it came from something like <i>Militant Weekly</i>, but it is from an editorial in the <i>Sunday Business Post.</i> When the newspaper that speaks to business talks like that about the banking system it is high time the Oireachtas responded. I appeal to the Leader to give a specific date as to when we are going to have such a debate.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with my colleague, Senator O'Toole, that we must have a debate on Maastricht. The issue is most important but the presumption that there is a monopoly of wisdom over in Iveagh <Col N="851" /> House or in the Department of the Taoiseach and nowhere else is untrue. We are walking into something and the nation is blindfolded. We need to have a debate, not just to go through a ritual, because not of the possibility but the probability that there are views in both Houses of the Oireachtas that have been omitted, forgotten or badly understood by those who represent us in Maastricht. That is a reality of life. It is not a party political criticism. We badly need to introduce this issue into the Seanad for political debate and I would appeal to the leader in this regard.</P>
    <P>I conclude by putting on the record of the House the fact that in a book which I discussed with you earlier you were recognised as the best jiver the author of <i>Jiving at the Crossroads</i> has seen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the expression of sympathy including that in respect of Senator Lanigan's mother. I wish also to say how sorry I was to hear of Century Radio going off the air last night. They tried very hard, despite the various ideas that many people may have on the matter.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the leader if he would approach the Minister concerned and ask him if he will bring the Broadcasting Bill in this House first. There were very many contributions on the previous Bill when it came here. Many points were made, but a number of us felt that the Bill had passed through the Dáil and that the various points that were raised could not be taken into account at that stage. I would like the leader to use his good offices with the Minister to introduce that Bill in this House. There is much expertise here that could contribute enormously to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to mention two matters on the Order of Business. Firstly, I fully support the expression of sympathy in relation to Corporal Michael <Col N="852" /> McCarthy, but I think we should go further and support the call of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in demanding that those who perpetrated this killing be brought to justice. We should also seek compensation from Israel. For far too long there has been a softly, softly, approach in respect of this matter.</P>
      <P>Secondly, as our Communications spokesman I, too, support what has been said by Senators Upton, Mooney and Cassidy in relation to the closure of Century Radio. It would be the intention of this side to seek an immediate debate and we would be looking for a positive attitude from the Leader of the House. I certainly have the utmost sympathy for the various journalists and other people involved who have lost their jobs. It brings to mind the time certain legislation was rushed through this House. There needs to be a rethink in relation to that and I ask that this matter be considered favourably, otherwise we will be forced to resort possibly to putting down a motion under Standing Order 29 to seek an immediate debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>May I support the call for a full debate on Maastricht. I find it disappointing that we have not had an earlier opportunity in this House to discuss this very important meeting. I concur with many of the other speakers and say that the gravity of the matters to be discussed at this summit is such that they will affect not just the people now living in this country but future generations. It brings into focus the appeals from all sides of the House for a foreign affairs committee, and since the day I came to the Seanad, I have been looking for such a committee. If we had had such a committee six or eight months ago we could have discussed the very item we are now wishing to debate. There is an urgency about this matter and I ask the Leader of the House if we could have a debate next week on that summit. It is of the utmost importance. It also brings into sharp focus the need for the foreign affairs committee and the European affairs committee to be set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great personal regret about the <Col N="853" /> closing of Century Radio and great sympathy for the staff who worked so hard there. However, I would disagree with some of my colleagues who have said the Minister should rush into this House or the other House with new legislation on the matter. That was the problem with the previous legislation. As somebody who publicly had enormous difficulty with the previous legislation and was opposed to many aspects of it, the proof, in a sense, is now in the eating. A full debate is now needed because of the withdrawal of the franchise from TV 3 and the closure of Century. It clearly shows us that there is a difference between radio and television and to try to deal with both of them under the same specific legislation may not be possible. I would say: caution, a full discussion, with no question of rushing legislation into this House or the other House.</P>

      <P>May I draw the attention of the Leader of the House to the fact that the Irish Radio and Television Commission has developed an obsession with the grandiose and has not granted community radio licences. I am sure the Leader will be as concerned as I am about that.</P>
      <P>May I ask a very specific question of the Leader of the House, namely, when is it proposed to resume the statements on Seanad reform? Is it intended to take this item next week and can I join with other Senators in expressing concern about this?</P>
      <P>Votes of sympathy have already been moved by my colleague, Senator Brendan Ryan on our behalf, but a number of speakers brought up the question of the situation in the Middle East, which is serious; it is one in which we have clearly got an interest. It is astonishing to me that we are still in the situation where we have to summon the Israeli ambassador from London. Why do we not have an Israeli Embassy here so that we could make the protest directly and can we have a debate on the Middle East?</P>

      <P>I crave your indulgence to allow me say a word or two in connection with the death of Dalgan Lyons. As the only Mayo Senator I am probably one of the few Members of this House who knew Dalgan Lyons given the man's age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was a man of very simple origins from near Ballyhaunis who had a very limited formal education yet who was one of the most educated men I ever met. He was a distinguished elected member of Mayo County Council probably for more than 20 years. He was at one stage chairman of the county council and he had the best grasp of local authority regulations <Col N="855" /> I have known in my years in public life. He had the distinction of having been elected from the old south Mayo constituency to Dáil Éireann and subsequently on two or three occasions to the Seanad. He was a gifted orator, he was articulate and he was a broad-minded politician who had not a mean bone in his body and who took a broad national moral view on issues. I am very pleased to be associated with the vote of sympathy passed here to his widow and family.</P>
    <P>I support the views expressed about the Israeli backing of the South Lebanese paramilitaries and wish to associate myself with the resolution of sympathy to the widow and family of Corporal McCarthy. What is happening in Lebanon is institutional violence and I support completely the protest the Minister for Foreign Affairs made to the Israeli ambassador. We have had far too many of these atrocities which have resulted in loss of life of people from this country and other countries. We have to take a very tough line and as a Member of this House I support it.</P>
    <P>I would like to put a question to the Leader of the House in relation to the demise of Century Radio which I regret very much because the lack of competition is very unhealthy. I do not think it is just a question of when certain broadcasting Bills will come to this House. We had a discussion here some weeks ago on broadcasting legislation and my view is that it is very flawed legislation. The gun was put to our head when the Dáil did not have an opportunity to sit but the question is very simple. It is time we had a debate on broadcasting issues in the most open-minded sense and I request the Leader fo the House to address himself to that issue.</P>
    <P>I also support those who are calling for a debate on the Maastricht Summit which is to start I believe on December 9. Time is running out. The most recent poll in this country showed politicians bottom of the pops. Maybe it is the increasing level of irrelevance that is generating that attitude among the public but if we are <Col N="856" /> to be relevant it is not an understatement to say that there should be a debate on that issue.</P>

I do not think it is proper that we take the Committee and Report Stages on the same day. We need time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We have heard that this House has been downgraded, we have heard of our frustrations and we all know we are marginalised. In relation to Motion 53, will the Leader say if it will be possible to take that motion and other motions at the conclusion of the debate on the reform of the Seanad. I believe that if that motion were passed it would get to the root of the problem in this House where 55 Members of the House are under a Whip, where 45 of 54 Members are waiting to get to the other House, were in the other House, or they tried to get to the other House. Will the Leader <Col N="857" /> agree to take motions here at the end of the debate on the Seanad reform? We have the frustration of people asking for a debate on Maastricht. We have not got it.

      <P>Senator Doyle and many others raised the question of the Maastricht Summit. In regard to various views expressed over the past number of weeks I found the greatest emphasis placed on three areas of importance to this country. One was the Common Agricultural Policy, the others were Maastricht and the banking system. The Common Agricultural Policy is on the agenda for tomorrow. I had hoped to debate the Maastricht Summit next week and the banking system the following week but I am of the opinion now that will have to be changed. However, I can assure the House that Maastricht will be debated in this House, even if it means coming back for a special sitting, in the next two weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Doyle also raised the question of the European affairs committee and a foreign affairs committee. I made inquiries over the past weeks and I understand they are still onstream, I cannot say exactly when they will be set up but I <Col N="860" /> know the intention is there, to establish the committees. I have asked for representation from the Seanad on them.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole asked, not for the first time as he said, when legislation will be initiated in this House. I repeat what I said previously; both myself and the Chief Whip will continue to look for legislation to be initiated in this House. As he knows, there has been a change of portfolios. Many Ministers have been changed and that has altered the position somewhat. Nonetheless our efforts will continue in that direction.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton referred to Century Radio as did many other Senators. I very much regret the closure of Century and the loss of 50 jobs. I am very sorry for the staff in that station. I will certainly inquire from the Minister, when amending legislation to the Broadcasting Bill will be introduced and if it can be introduced in this House. I will further inquire from him if there is likely to be a &mdash; I have heard no mention of it &mdash; White Paper on broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten referred to Maastricht and the rates support grant as did others, in particular, Senator John Ryan and Senator Hederman. I have spoken to the new Minister for the Environment regarding this matter and he tells me that within the next three or four days councils will be informed of the level of the rates support grant.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney referred to the Broadcasting Bill. I have given my reply in that case and also in reply to Senators Cassidy and Cosgrave. Senator Brendan Ryan asked about the banking system. As I explained, the debate could be next week. I hope both Maastricht and the banking system debates will take place within two weeks in this House.</P>
    <P>Senator Cullen spoke about Maastricht and Century Radio. Senator Costello referred to taking all Stages of the Bill we are discussing today. My intention was to go as far as we could to 6 p.m. Obviously if the House agrees we should stop at Committee Stage I would have no objection but the intention would be to go ahead if we can.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris asked about a White <Col N="861" /> Paper on broadcasting and he asked when we will resume the debate on reform of the Seanad. I believe I am safe in saying to Senator Norris that resumption of that debate will take place next week. I have no plans for a debate on the Middle East at this time.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton referred in a very detailed way to Dalgan Lyons. There is no better person to do it than a Mayo man like himself. Senator Ó Foighil referred to Maastricht and broadcasting and Senator Ross also asked about broadcasting. I certainly do not intend to comment on Senator Ross's reply to Senator Hederman.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), to delete line 20, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) damage caused by death or by personal injuries, or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, the objective of which is to provide consumers who are injured by defective products with a new mechanism for seeking compensation thereby implementing the directive of the European Communities on Liability for Defective Products of 25 July 1985. I also welcome the fact that this directive, which is being implemented by this Bill, is indeed attached to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its definition of damage in section 1 (1) of the Bill the drafting, I believe, has moved away from the wording of the directive although normally, and particularly in this case, we should be at pains to follow exactly the wording of the <Col N="862" /> directive. The definition of damage has been changed from that contained in the final draft of the EC directive of 25 July 1985. Indeed it adopts the wording of the British legislation contained in section 5 (1) of the UK Consumers Protection Act, 1987 and the wording contained in the original EEC Draft Directive of 9 September 1976.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (1) of this Bill states that damage means (a) death or personal injury or (b) loss of, damage to, or destruction of any item of property other than the defective product itself. Thus, if a person is injured by a defective product, this Bill provides that two categories of damage arise and arise only. The injured person can get compensation for that injury and he can also get compensation for any item of property. However, it would appear to me at least that the whole area of consequential and economic losses arising from damage caused is excluded by this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is an inherent and basic principle of our law, and has been indeed for many years, that if damage is caused a person can get compensation for injury, damage to property and consequential and economic loss. Thus, for example, a defective steering mechanism in a motor car may cause it to crash and serious injury may result which causes a person to be out of work for a considerable length of time. These consequential losses, loss of earnings and the loss of the use of the car, are excluded, because of the wording of this Bill.</P>
    <P>When the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; is used on its own and is not subject to interpretation in any particular legislation it includes a wide range of items, damages for personal injuries, pain and suffering, damage to property and consequential and economic losses. Consequential damages are not provided for in this Bill. I believe all a court can do, therefore, under this legislation is to look at the definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; contained in section 1 (1) of the Bill and decide if the injured person is entitled to damage. It seems to me this matter could be effectively dealt with (a) by adopting this <Col N="863" /> amendment and reverting to the definition of damages contained in the final draft &mdash; I stress the final draft &mdash; of this directive or (b) by adopting amendment No. 4, which we will be dealing with shortly. Indeed, an abridged version of amendment No. 4 would be my preference.</P>
    <P>The obligation on the Houses of the Oireachtas so far as this directive is concerned, is to bring in, as a minimum, what the directive requires. There is nothing to stop us from being more generous to the consumer in certain areas than this directive requires. What we cannot do, and what the restricted definition of damage in this Bill is doing, is giving the consumer less than the directive provides. Indeed, we could find ourselves in more litigation on this issue as to whether we are in default in regard to this directive.</P>
    <P>This area of compensation for injury and death was examined in great detail by the English Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission. They concluded that under existing law a person who sustains personal injury may be awarded damages under two main heads &mdash; in respect of pecuniary losses and in respect of non-pecuniary losses. Under the heading of pecuniary losses he is compensated for his financial loss, such as loss of wages and out of pocket expenses; and, as far as non-pecuniary losses are concerned, it is usual to award compensation on a more general basis for pain, suffering and loss of amenity that result from the injury. They also concluded that it would be inconvenient procedurally. If an injured person wished to recover full damages, he would have to set up two distinct causes of action within the regime as recommended, one based on strict liability and the other on his rights in tort. The third conclusion was that both commissions stated:</P>
    <P>We recommend, accordingly, that compensation for death or personal injury should be assessed in the same way under the scheme for strict liability as where the claim lies in tort and that, <Col N="864" /> in particular, non-pecuniary losses should be compensated for.</P>
    <P>These two commissions and the Pearson Commission examined these matters in great detail and there is a lot to be said in these various recommendations.</P>
    <P>As has been said by a Member of the other House, litigation is indeed the art of making argument. There is no doubt that legal energies will be consumed following the passage of this Bill if this particular section remains as it is, by people trying to draw an inference and an importance from the fact that there is a different definition of damage in this Bill from the definitions contained in the directive and from the definition of damages contained in the Civil Liability Act, 1961. Many cases, indeed, end up in the High Court and in the Supreme Court because Ministers and Governments are not sufficiently responsive to nonpolitical points made at the formative stages of legislation. The Minister of State, speaking in another place, has indicated that non-material damage, such as pain and suffering, will fall outside the scope of this Bill. However, Alex Hewster, director of ICEL &mdash; the Irish Centre for European Law &mdash; and a man with a wide range of experience in this area, takes a contrary view. He takes the view that any uncertainty as to whether damages for pain and suffering fall within the scope of liability introduced by this directive has been removed by the interpretation clause in section 1 (1) of this Bill which defines personal injury as including any disease and any impairment of a person's physical or mental condition.</P>
    <P>I would like, therefore, if the Minister would take this opportunity to clarify again the situation as to whether items which are so important today in Irish law fall within the scope of this definition. The Minister has said, in another place, that all wisdom does not exist on the Government side, even with the best advice of the Attorney General, and that includes, of course, the new Attorney General. I, therefore, urge the Minister to accept this amendment, the wording <Col N="865" /> of which is based on the direct wording in the directive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. As I indicated on the Order of Business, I have basic objections to all Stages of a Bill being taken on the same day. It is most appropriate that we should not discuss Committee and Report Stages on the same day. When dealing with legislation we need time for reflection to ensure that further amendments arising out of existing amendments can be put down and discussed. It is a bad precedent to start taking all Stages of legislation on the some day. It is the equivalent of imposing the guillotine. I regard this as an unsatisfactory procedure.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister and his officials for including in the legislation for the first time, the directive itself. That is a good precedent and should be followed in future so that we can see precisely what is the thinking and the formulation of the directive which is the essence of the Bill before us.</P>
      <P>As the directive has been printed as part of the Bill, we can see what the compilers of the directive intended and what we have done. We have not included in the definition of damage in this legislation the full intent of the directive. We have, as Senator Kennedy said, the British wording rather than the wording of the European Community. We should have the broadest possible wording; we should cast the net wide. It seems that what are presented here are loopholes or exceptions that will not be covered by the legislation &mdash; the first relates to consequential matters arising out of the defective product, which will be covered by another amendment and the second relates to limiting it to the private sector, to the idea of personal injury rather than professional and business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a narrower definition of strict liability than was intended in the legislation as originally envisaged. That will give rise to a variety of problems for our courts in that we will be proceeding on the one hand with strict liability in relation to that particular definition of damage as death or personal injury and, <Col N="866" /> on the other, we will be dealing with it by tort. While this is not supposed to be a substitution for existing legislation or existing judicial procedure, nevertheless it will result in confusion where we will have one type of approach to deal with it in one particular area and because the definition is not broad enough to include the other area, we will find ourselves having to make a separate application. I do not see why we cannot cover the two in the same legislation and expand the provisions in relation to liability for defective products to a wider range than is here. It would ease the problem and provide greater protection for the consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made by Senators Kennedy and Costello on amendment No. 1. I also endorse the point made by Senator Costello in regard to the inadvisability of going further than Committee Stage today. I make that point for an added reason. If my information is correct, the other House ran out of time both on Committee Stage and the remaining Stages of this legislation. The conclusion I draw from reading the reports of the debate in the other House is that there was not time to give attention to the detail of the later sections of the Bill. I believe it would be very inadvisable for the Minister to insist that this Bill pass the Seanad without giving detailed consideration to all the sections of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In a sense I find this extraordinary legislation and quite difficult to come to grips with parts of it. I am in favour of the concept of the Bill and indeed I am in favour of consumer protection where defective products are concerned but I have a worry that the protection the Bill provides with one hand it removes with the other. That is part of the reason I am anxious that this House be given all the time that is required to go into the detail of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the amendment before the House, I support strongly the arguments that have been made by previous speakers. I cannot find the justification for changing the wording from what is in <Col N="867" /> the directive. The new definition which the Minister has introduced as opposed to the wording in the directive has given rise to the concern that has been expressed here. It has given rise to the belief that damages to a consumer injured or disadvantaged in some way by a product are being restricted by the change in wording. There is doubt in relation to the whole question of consequential loss. As Senator Kennedy said, there is a major question whether the matter of pain and suffering endured by a person is also outside the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I add my support to what Senator Kennedy and Senator Costello have said. I urge the Minister to adopt what I believe is a very well thought out and a worthwhile amendment. I am satisfied they have advanced justification as to why this amendment should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden) Terry Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to amendment No. 1 and the point made by Senators Kennedy, Costello and Howard, I emphasised in my speech during Second Stage that the wording of the Bill for the most part follows closely on the wording of the directive itself. In the small number of cases where there are deviations or departures, the aim is to provide for greater clarity while achieving the same purpose and intent. As I also mentioned on that occasion the EC Commission had sight of the Bill and it had no difficulty with the definition of damage as provided in section 1 (1) of the Bill.</P>

    <P>I would add that I have consulted with the Office of the Attorney General on this matter. That office is of the opinion that it is the result to be achieved under Article 9 of the directive, which contains the definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo;, rather than its exact drafting, which is mandatory on the State. Article 9 (a) is correctly translated into domestic Irish law by means of the definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; in section 1 (1) of the Bill. The definition used in the Bill is entirely consistent with <Col N="868" /> the approach contained in the definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; in section 21 of the Civil Liability Act, 1961. That Act is the principal statute governing civil liability in this country and the definition contained in that Act is as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;damage&rdquo; includes loss of property, loss of life and personal injury.</P>
    <P>The relevant section should be read in conjunction with section 2 (1) of the Bill, which provides that:</P>
    <P>The producer shall be liable in damages in tort for damage caused wholly or partly by a defect in his product.</P>
    <P>When examined in this manner, the provisions relating to damage are sufficient, in my opinion, to make applicable domestic Irish rules concerning the assessment of damages, including pain and suffering, consequential losses etc. subject only to the limits expressly imposed by the directive which are reproduced in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The reason, therefore, for departure from the wording of the directive in relation to this definition, is to align the meaning of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; with the accepted principles of Irish law. In the circumstances, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it now the Minister's opinion that pain and suffering comes within the ambit of this Bill because he said the opposite in his contribution in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>We had discussion on this matter in the other House and, as a result, I consulted with the Attorney General's office and that office is of the opinion that it is the result to be achieved under article 9 of the directive, which contains the definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; rather than its exact drafting, which is mandatory on the State. The Civil Liability Act, 1961 is the principal statute governing civil liability and the definition contained in that Act is as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;damage&rdquo; includes loss of property, loss of life and personal injury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" /> That is relevant and important. I have consulted with the Attorney General in that regard and I am satisfied that in the circumstances we cannot accept the amendment. I accept the points put forward by the Senators that it is a change from the actual directive itself but it is only changed on the basis of bringing it more in line with existing Irish legislation.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that this Bill has been viewed by the Commission who have accepted our wording and are quite satisfied with it. I believe the explanation I have given is satisfactory and should be accepted by the House as the best advice available to me from the Attorney General's office. Although I respect the views expressed by Senators Kennedy, Costello and Howard I cannot accept their amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hate to push the matter any further with the Minister but I am asking him a specific question. Is pain and suffering within the ambit of this Bill or is it not? He now seems to be saying that on further advice it is within the ambit of the Bill but I must bring it to his attention that in the Dáil Official Report Vol. 411, No. 5, column 1397, he clearly informed the other House that pain and suffering do not fall within the ambit of the Bill. It seems to me that if the Minister has got it wrong in regard to such a matter as pain and suffering he may very well be getting it wrong in regard to consequential and economic loss. I am not satisfied with the Minister's assurance that the Commission had sight of this Bill and are satisfied with it. I know the European Commission are quite happy to have their own exact wording incorporated into this Bill. For that reason we will have to press this amendment if the Minister is not more forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has replied to the points raised. Is the damage caused by death or personal injuries included in the definition or is it not? Senator Kennedy has referred to pain and suffering as typical consequential damage that would follow <Col N="870" /> damage caused by death or personal injuries. A simple &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; will answer that question. What the Minister has said in relation to quotation from the Civil Liability Act, 1961, confirms the point we have made because he refers to the definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; as including loss of property, loss of life and personal injury but there is no exclusion, there is no strict defintion of it, so it includes that whatever else. If the Minister had simply left &ldquo;damage&rdquo; its original definition without narrowing it down to exclude areas, which this seems to be doing, then we would be quite happy. What is intended by this amendment is to ensure that the consequential effects of death or personal injury are not omitted and that the consumer is covered.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased Senators have read the Lower House's deliberations on this particular Bill because I received further advice since the debate in the Lower House which is what you expect when issues are raised at a particular time. It was necessary for me to get further legal advice on this Bill and I will tell the House exactly what the advice was from the Attorney General's office arising from the debate in the Lower House:</P>
      <P>The relevant section should be read in conjunction with section 2 (1) of the Bill, which provides that: &ldquo;The producer shall be liable in damages in tort for damage caused wholly or partly by a defect in his product&rdquo;. When examined in this manner, the provisions relating to damage are sufficient in my opinion to make applicable the domestic Irish rules concerning the assessment of damages, including pain and suffering, consequential loss etc., subject only to the limits expressly imposed by the directives which are reproduced in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that clarifies the concerns expressed here today in relation to this section. At the end of the day it will be the decision of the judge or jury in the case to decide on the section and to <Col N="871" /> decide on the question of pain and suffering. I do not want to prejudge their decision but I am clarifying the position from the information I have received from the Attorney General. That may be contrary to the views available to me when this Bill was going through the Lower House. As a result of the concerns expressed by Deputies I sought further clarification from the new Attorney General on this Bill and that is the advice I got and I am giving it to the House. I cannot accept the amendment, on the basis of the information available to me from the chief law officer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from what the Minister has just said, and I do not doubt him because I regard him as a very conscientious Minister and I believe he did go back to the Attorney General for further advice on the matter. As I understand his reply, the advice he received from the Attorney General was that if section 1 (1) is read in conjunction with section 2 (1) the matters that concern us at this stage are taken care of. That is the advice of <Col N="872" /> the present Attorney General. Am I to understand it was the previous Attorney General who advised the Minister that we should use a different wording in this Bill from the wording in the directive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the actual wording in this Bill is the same as under the previous Attorney General. What I was getting was a clarification of the liability in this Bill which was sought in the Lower House. That was obtained from the present Attorney General but the wording itself was not changed by the parliamentary draftsman's office or the Attorney General from the Bill I circulated.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), line 22, to delete &ldquo;other than&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;including&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In respect of property damage &ldquo;damage&rdquo; will mean&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b) loss of, damage to, or destruction of, any item of property including the defective product itself.</P>
      <P>In so far as property damage is concerned section 1 (1) of this Bill requires that the damage be to any item of property other than the defective product itself. Thus if an electric kettle, for example, self destructs but causes no damage to other property, no liability accrues under this Bill. If a motor car self destructs and crashes into a wall and the car is wrecked, the damage to the wall is recoverable but the damage to the car which was defective is not recoverable under this Bill. The Minister, of course, will point to the two conditions built into every contract of sale &mdash; sections 14 and 15 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, as amended by the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980. However, as was pointed out in the other House, there may be circumstances where a person might not be in a position to avail of the sale of goods legislation 1893 to 1980. It might not be possible to establish certain facts under the sale of goods legislation whereas it would be possible to come within the scope of this Bill which breaks new ground and sets up new circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the existing law if a person buys a product which turns out to be defective and causes damage and the vendor is not available or amenable or has not money, or if the company has gone into liquidation, the consumers' rights under the sale of goods legislation is based on contract and would be confined to the vendor of the goods. If such a consumer wants to succeed against anybody higher up the <Col N="874" /> chain he would have to prove negligence. However, in a situation where the contract or the tort remedies may not be open to the consumer, if we extend the terms of section 1 (1) of this Bill by including compensation for the defective item itself it would meet the situation. There is nothing to stop us if we are so minded from going beyond the minimum requirements of the directive.</P>
    <P>The purpose and intent of this Bill is to introduce the new concept of strict liability without having to prove the very often impossible requirement of negligence. It seems strange, inconceivable and illogical that the very first item that should be included within the ambit of this Bill should be the defective item itself. In fact, the defective item itself is the first item to be excluded from this Bill. Thus if a vendor, as indicated previously, is gone, has no money or the company has gone into liquidation, the customer will have no effective remedy under the sale of goods legislation. Since such a customer cannot prove negligence if he is in this category he will have no remedy in contract or tort. He will have no remedy under this legislation unless we extend the definition as contained in section 1 (1). I urge the Minister in the clear interests of the consumer to accept amendment No. 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the sentiments expressed by Senator Kennedy. Our intention in tabling the amendment is to extend the definition of damage in terms of liability to ensure that we broaden the net rather than leave loopholes and to ensure that we do not create a situation whereby one set of circumstances in relation to a defective product is dealt with by strict liability and another is dealt with by the normal procedures of negligence and tort. We want to ensure that the burden of evidence remains on the producer as far as possible and to change the situation from the present one of <i>caveat emptor</i> to one of &ldquo;let the producer beware&rdquo;. It is difficult to see how there can be an argument against including the defective product in the definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; meaning loss <Col N="875" /> of, damage to, or destruction of, any item of property. There is nothing in the directive that prohibits us from extending the scope of the directive.</P>
      <P>We should not be minimalist in this respect. Too often our legislation giving effect to directives is late and minimal. In the EC annual report that was issued last week it was stated that the incorporation of Community provisions into national law within the prescribed period is the exception rather than the rule. This was with direct reference to Ireland. National legislation is often adopted when proceedings initiated by the Commission are already at an advanced stage. That is the context in which this Bill has been introduced. We have been slow in producing it and minimal in implementation of the provisions outlined in the directive.</P>
      <P>Why make it more difficult for a consumer to establish negligence in relation to the product itself? It is not satisfactory for the Minister to point to section 2 (1) and say that is already covered by &ldquo;the producer shall be liable in damages in tort for damage caused wholly or partly by a defect in his product&rdquo;. That is the existing situation. The whole purpose of the directive is to amend the existing situation, to improve the lot of the consumer so that not just the consequential damage or the liability arising from a defect but the actual defective product itself is covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see why the Minister has been presenting section 2 (1) as a satisfactory conclusion. Let us take for example the whole issue of haemophiliacs and the infection that resulted from contaminated blood plasma. We all know the difficulty and hassle there was for years before the Government accepted any responsibility. Negligence had to be proven. The Government simply refused to accept any responsibility in the matter until eventually they had to but they did so with very poor grace. If we had strict liability in relation to that defective product which was the cause of further damage, we would have avoided all the hassle that went on with people who were <Col N="876" /> in very serious ill-health suffering injury and, in some cases, death.</P>
    <P>All products should be covered by this legislation and the defective product itself should be subject to the same liability. No doubt we could give other examples &mdash; the tablets that gave rise to thalidomide or the situation that exists at present in relation to mad cow disease or angel dust itself, insecticides or the so-called nutrients or hormone promoters.</P>
    <P>A broad extension of the definition would be better than an exclusive one. I would be much happier if we did not have the definition as outlined in the Bill but simply left it to the dictionary definition of damage. We would be able to do business a lot better. The essence of this amendment is that strict liability should be extended to include the defective product as well and the Minister in pointing to section 2 (1) is not giving an adequate response to our concerns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment the objective of which is to extend the definition of damage in the interests of the consumer. The Bill states that &ldquo;damage&rdquo; means (a) death or personal injury; (b) the loss of, the damage to or destruction of any item of property other than the defective product itself. What this Bill appears to give with one hand it takes back with the other. It goes on: &ldquo;Provided that the item of property &mdash; (i) is of a type ordinarily intended for private use or consumption,&rdquo;. I would like the Minister to clarify that. Section 1 (b) (ii) states: &ldquo;was used by the injured person mainly for his own private use or consumption;&rdquo; There is a spirit of good neighbourliness throughout the country and that is good. Suppose for example, I purchase a defective product but the defect does not manifest itself during my very limited use of it but I oblige my neighbour by giving him or her a loan of the product and it explodes or disintegrates and causes damage. My reading of the section is that my neighbour has no comeback whatsoever because the appliance was intended for my private use or consumption. The safeguards that <Col N="877" /> are built into the Bill could eliminate the intention to protect the consumer.</P>
      <P>Rather than repeat the very good arguments made, I will simply say I support the amendment. Very good arguments were made by Senators Kennedy and Costello and I encourage the Minister to accept the amendment. I would like him to comment on the example I gave.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I wish to pass on the apologies of the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden. He has other legislation to deal with in the Dáil and I have been asked to deputise on his behalf.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senators who spoke on this amendment. Article 9 (b) of the directive provides that damage shall not apply in relation to the defective product itself. In this regard we have absolutely no discretion or flexibility. In line with the general overall approach, the wording in the Bill in this case is the same as that of the directive. We had no option but to comply when transposing this provision into Irish law.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out that damage to the defective product itself is already covered in Irish contract law under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Sevices Act, 1980. Section 14 of that Act provides for two very important implied conditions for the consumer in every contract sale: first, that the product or goods are of merchantable quality and, second, that they are reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are intended. If a product is defective when purchased it is almost certain not to comply with at least one, and in most cases both, of these criteria.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill and the directive is to provide remedies and redress over and above those already available under the existing contract and tort law. Accordingly the interests of the consumer is already well safeguarded. We have no discretion in this matter and for that reason I simply cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We have now two contradictory positions. On the first amendment we were told that we were implementing the directive, that the matter was covered by section (2) (1) and that it was being dealt with adequately because it had been brought to the attention of the EC Commission. On the second amendment we were told we had to stick to the terms of the directive. In section 1 (1) (a) the Minister has stuck to the directive and he is quite satisfied that he does not have to, so he lessens the scope. In the second instance, the Minister sticks to the directive and he is quite satisfied because he says he has no discretion in the matter. Would the Minister please explain why he seems to have had absolute discretion in relation to the first amendment and has no discretion in relation to the second amendment as in both cases we seek to broaden the scope of the definition of damage? It is scarcely good enough to say that the remedies and redress here are over and above that in existing tort law. What we seek is to provide strict liability to protect the consumer. Everything that is in the area of strict liability must be, of its nature, over and above what is in existing law. Why can strict liability not be extended to cover other areas like the defective product itself or the damage caused by death or personal injury? I have not heard a satisfactory explanation from the Minister. He is more or less giving excuses instead of explanations. I would like him to address the issue more effectively than has been the case to date.</P>

      <P>As I understand the thrust of amendment No. 2, the result which Senators are endeavouring to achieve is adequately catered for under existing law, as I stated in my initial reply. Are <Col N="879" /> Senators advocating that we should have overlap or duplication? If we are satisfied that the existing legislation is adequate, why make the further provision proposed in amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to pursue the point I made. The definition of damage is:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;damage&rdquo; means&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) death or personal injury, or</P>
      <P>(b) loss of, damage to, or destruction of, any item of property other than the defective product itself:</P>
      <P>Provided that the item of property&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) is of a type ordinarily intended for private use or consumption, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> (ii) was used by the injured person mainly for his own private use or consumption;</P>
    <P>That covers me if I am the primary purchaser or owner of the product, but if I loan it to another person, from my reading of this section, damage does not apply in relation to whatever happens to the product in the possession of another person. Is that interpretation correct?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Senator to the next amendment. Perhaps the observations he has just made would be more relevant to that amendment and we will have an opportunity to deal with them at that stage.</P>

      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), line 27, after &ldquo;consumption&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or for a business occupation or profession&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment will extend somewhat the principle being established by the Bill and admittedly it goes beyond the minimum requirements specified in the directive. However, as we have said on other <Col N="881" /> amendments, there is nothing in our Constitution or in our laws which says that we may not provide more genersously for consumers than we are obliged to do under the minimum requirements contained in this directive.</P>
    <P>Why should a person who produces a defective product which causes injury to a small businessman during use be excluded from responsibility? Are we to be placed in a lottery situation? If a defective product explodes during use for private purposes the producer is caught by this legislation but if the product is being used by a small businessman when it explodes, then the producer escapes liability. It seems logical and fair that the principle being written into our law by this Bill should not be compromised by confining it to private user consumption as opposed to business and other consumption. The European Community would be quite satisfied if we applied this principle in its minimum content but there is nothing to stop the Oireachtas from providing further protection for small business people. Therefore, I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. The same principle was enunciated in relation to the two previous amendments; we want to extend the definition of damage and also extend producers' responsibility beyond private use or consumption to include business, occupational or professional use. Again, we do not want a minimal introduction of the directive. We should be as generous as possible in the application of strict liability to safeguard the consumer and by doing so we are ensuring a better quality product, better quality control and, ultimately the product is enhanced and its market value increased. The economy as well as the consumer benefits. It is not unreasonable in the context of this legislation to request its extension to the business or professional sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of a small businessman or woman running a public house and encountering a defective product, why should the producer or manufacturer of that product not be responsible in liability <Col N="882" /> terms for the defect? The step from private consumer use to use in a small workshop or family busines is a small one. On the professional side, almost everything is done now on a professional basis. Members of the teaching profession use pens, books or other teaching aids in the classroom and any of these may be defective. This is not a case of personal or private use but it is akin to private use. Use of a product by a professional in this case could easily be covered by the intention of this Bill and the context in which this directive was produced.</P>
    <P>There is no reason to restrict this legislation or the definitions in it to purely personal or private injury. It is unfortunate that we tend to implement EC Directives as well as international protocols, as we discussed in the Sea Pollution Bill two weeks ago, in a minimal way. We should be more generous.</P>
    <P>This legislation was produced only when we were told to do so, we had exceeded the allotted time span for its introduction and it is coming, I suggest, under the shadow of a gun and being proposed in its most minimal terms. I ask the Minister to be more generous and not to say, as he said on the last amendment, that he has do discretion. Of course he has discretion. He can extend the legislation to a greater definition of damage if he wishes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senators Kennedy and Costello on this amendment. In extending the definition of damage to include business, occupation or profession the provisions of the Bill are being rightfully extended into the commercial sector. The legislation provides safeguards for the private individual's use; the intention of this amendment is to extend those safeguards to certain commercial or professional operations. Earlier on I suggested a half-way house between those two states to the Minister which he said he would reply to at this stage. My suggestion related to the loaning of a product and damage caused to the person to whom it was on loan; the Bill did not extend the definition of <Col N="883" /> damage to that kind of situation. I am anxious, therefore, that the point I raised with the Minister be clarified now and I fully support the argument put forward by Senators Costello and Kennedy for extension of the definition of damage to business, occupations and professions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again I draw the attention of the Members of the House to the provisions of Article 9 of the directive. When referring to property damage, this Article specifies that the definition applies only to property of a type ordinarily intended for private use or consumption. This proviso is also stated clearly in the preamble to the directive, page 8, lines seven and eight.</P>
      <P>The directive is a consumer protection measure; that is its intent and purpose. The rationale for this is that business is or should be able to adequately look after its own interests. The law of tort and the various remedies available under it cater for the interests of business. It is evident, therefore, that the directive is not intended to apply to property damage in the commercial sphere. There can be no other interpretation and I am not, therefore, in a position to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is just as unsatisfactory as it was in the case of the other two amendments when he says that anything not included in the definition is adequately dealt with by the law of tort under existing legislation. The problem is that the purpose of this legislation and of the EC directive was to ensure strict liability where the consumer was at risk. Now a consumer can be at risk in a private or a public capacity. Drawing a line between private and commercial use is too rigid a solution; a large grey area exists where people operate in a private and a semi-private capacity. I gave two good examples in relation to a small business operation and a professional operation, where considerable personal damage can be caused by a defective product. We are leaving huge swards of areas unprovided for here <Col N="884" /> despite the intention of the legislation. We should be more generous in our definition and in our interpretation and extend the application of strict liability on behalf of the consumer to a greater rather than a lesser degree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The main difficulty has been exposed as a result of the Minister's reply. The proposed application of this legislation is very restrictive. The Minister who introduced this Bill here last week dressed it up, saying it was the most significant consumer legislation to come before the House but at this point it emerges that severe restrictions are contained in it. The definition of damage and the provision in this Bill will apply to me as a private individual only. We experienced reservations from the introduction of this Bill and we attempted to establish clearly the limitations of this legislation with regard to the consumer. It has now emerged that it has an extremely restrictive application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make some points. Senator Howard mentioned earlier that goodwill in rural Ireland meant that items were lent among farmers and that this was not covered by the Bill or the directive. The loan of a product in such circumstances normally implies no liability on the part of the lender. If the situation were otherwise, producers would be placed in an impossible situation. The opening sentences of my original response to points raised by the three Opposition speakers graphically set out the position in relation to this directive and the facilitating legislation. The Confederation of Irish Industry which represents the interests of small businesses has not asked to have their activities covered by this Bill or this directive. That is a recognition of the restricted application of this legislation. I respectfully ask the Senators to reconsider their position in relation to this amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="885" /> In page 2, subsection (1), between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(c) consequential loss or damage sustained by the injured person, such loss to be assessed in like manner as losses are calculated by law in cases of tort;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to clarify conclusively that consequential or economic losses or damages sustained by an injured person come within the scope of this Bill. We have heard the Minister of State say that the advice he got from the previous Attorney General in respect of pain and suffering was that it was not included in this legislation. Today we were told the new Attorney General advises that consideration of pain and suffering is provided for in this legislation. Two different Attorneys General advising the Minister of State took differing views.</P>
    <P>The arguments I made in support of the first amendment today are relevant in respect of this amendment also. I do not intend to repeat them but I remind the Minister of State of the conclusion reached by the English and Scottish Law Commissions and by the Pearson Commission in this regard. Those three well established commissions examined this question over a period of years. The definition of damages given in this Bill is excessively specific and restrictive and makes no reference to the definition of damage contained in the Civil Liability Act, 1961. It means that a court may not use the well defined meaning of the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; or &ldquo;damages&rdquo; that has been used over centuries. This Bill defines damage in terms of two heads, (a) and (b); therefore that is all that a court will say when applying the normal rules of court. I urge the Minister to seriously consider this amendment above all others. It would clarify the legislation.</P>
    <P>There is great confusion at present, as to whether consequential losses are covered by this Bill. I have checked with various colleagues in the law library and have found that much confusion and uncertainty have arisen from things said in the other House. On the one hand, we <Col N="886" /> are told by Alex Schuster, a distinguished lawyer from Trinity College, Dublin, director of ICEL that consequential and economic loss is not covered by this Bill; that was categorically stated at the conference held in the Incorporated Law Society on this topic. Deputy Michael Smith, the former Minister of State speaking elsewhere, stated that consequential damage is covered and included as a legitimate claim within the provisions of this Bill &mdash; I refer to volume 411, No. 7, column 2095 of the Official Report.</P>
    <P>This amendment, therefore, would help enormously to remove some of the uncertainty and confusion that now exists and we would be happy if a shorter version of this amendment was agreed to by the Minister. He might look at that on Report Stage. I suggest that the amendment be abridged to &ldquo;(c) consequential loss or damage sustained by the injured person.&rdquo; That would cover it. The rest of that amendment could be regarded as superfluous in view of judicial interpretation and decisions in the courts.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister of State will be responsible in this matter and permit three heads of damage rather than the two heads contained in this definition. Damage would mean (a) death or personal injury, (b) loss of, damage to, or destruction of any item of property other than the defective product itself and (c) consequential loss or damage sustained by the injured person. This is a most reasonable amendment and I urge the Minister of State to give it consideration. Legal practitioners at the moment are questioning the application of this legislation.</P>
    <P>We need a united approach to this matter. There is no point in having three compartments, contract, tort and civil liability. Various learned treatises on the subject in America point up the desirability of a unified approach which is currently being implemented there. Having studied the approach to this matter in the other House where it was teased out in great detail and having read the debate on this matter in the House of Lords and the House of Commons at <Col N="887" /> all Stages, I think the Minister would be acting in the interests of the consumer and of legal clarity if he would accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly propose that the Minister accept this amendment. Of the five Committee Stage amendments this is the most important. It would be very valuable if we could extend the definition of damage to the three areas suggested here: (a) death or personal injury, (b) loss or damage to an item of private property by a defective product and (c) consequential damage or loss sustained by the injured person. That provision is extremely important because nowhere else in the Bill is there reference to financial or economic loss, pain or suffering sustained as a consequence of a defective product. It is not covered under the terms of strict liability defined in the directive.</P>
      <P>Without this amendment, consequential loss would be left to the law of tort and of contract, but if we want to introduce radical change to protect the consumer, let us specify consequential loss or damage in the definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an important amendment and if accepted by the Minister will expand the definition to a reasonably satisfactory degree. We would have liked to see it expanded further, but this amendment gives a necessary degree of protection against consequential loss and covers many related matters we have discussed over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Defective plasma means that haemophiliacs may be infected with the AIDS virus. Neither consequential loss whether economic, pecuniary or financial, nor pain and suffering as a consequence of that defective product had been admitted for strict liability with the result that we spent years haggling over whether compensation would be given in respect of that defective product. The matter brought about the fall of a Government before the last election and caused enormous human suffering in a very sensitive area. Why can we not <Col N="888" /> extend the definition of damage to cover consequential loss in that context?</P>
    <P>One could quote other examples. A factory could be reduced to rubble by a defective light bulb. What about consequential loss there? How is it covered except by tort, by negligence or by contract? Why not by strict liability? We are going to end up with a mish mash of protection measures. We are trying to implement EC Directives to ensure strict liability to protect the consumer. Let us be generous where a desirable extension could be applied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 4 appears to be the same as amendment No. 1 so far as consequential loss or damage is concerned. The arguments advanced by my colleague, Deputy Leyden when he rejected amendment No. 1 apply with equal force to this amendment. I am satisfied that this subsection as it stands in combination with section 2 (1) provide for consequential loss and on that basis I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is satisfied that the section provides for consequential loss. I wonder if he would tease that out further? We are certainly not satisfied because from our reading of the Bill it is far from clear. There are two items covered &mdash;&ldquo;damage&rdquo; means death or personal injury and &ldquo;damage&rdquo; means loss of, damage to or destruction of any item of property, provided that the item of property is such and such for private use. Where is there a reference to consequential loss? I have no doubt that it is covered within the broad provisions of the Bill in terms of tort, but where is it covered in terms of strict liability? That is what I would like to know and that is the whole tenor of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that when Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, set out the arguments in his response to amendment No. 1 &mdash; Members will be familiar with the argument he advanced at that stage &mdash; it clearly set out the position that, <Col N="889" /> having had consultation with the Attorney General at the time, there was inadequacy of cover in the particular provisions. On that basis I think Members might consider their stance and perhaps accept the validity of the arguments that were advanced in opposition to amendment No. 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">

      <P>It is disappointing that we have a different Minister of State at this stage and that the Minister of State with the main responsibility of this area could not be here, because this is a most important amendment. We have to put it on the record that it is also disappointing to read that in the other House one Attorney General gave one view in regard to payments and another Attorney General now apparently giving another view to this House. In regard to consequential loss, economic loss and so on, it is intolerable that we have this lack of clarity. You have the Director of the Irish Centre for European Law, a distinguished lawyer in this area, telling us that consequential and economic loss is not covered by this legislation. That is a categorical statement. You have the former Minister of State, Deputy Smith, as I indicated, clearly saying categorically that it is covered. Then you have the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, coming in today telling us that this is a matter for the courts and the judges.</P>
      <P>Of course, it is a matter for the judges, but I would like to suggest to this House that our job as legislators is to keep these unnecessary controversies from reaching the High Court and the Supreme Court. We see, for example, the fiasco that has been made in regard to various matters including the recent situation on extradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we are trying to create three heads under that definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; in order to bring clarity into the law. We want to have it spelled out that death, personal injury, property damage and consequential economic loss come within the ambit of this legislation. If the Minister is not responsive, then I think it is a poor day indeed for legislators. I think we have done our job. The feeling at the <Col N="890" /> moment among practitioners of law is that consequential loss is not covered. The very fact that there is a question mark over it means that some of this legislation will have to be tested. I would prefer if we did not have to have a case stated for a High Court judge to rule on this matter. We should do our jobs as legislators as far as we can and we should bring clarity into the law.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister having to handle this matter at short notice, but his reply is not sufficient for us. Therefore reluctantly we must press this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, we have emphasised that this is the most serious and most important amendment we are proposing. We think it would fit the bill if the Minister was to take this amendment and look at it between now and Report Stage. We are not necessarily talking about the specific wording of this amendment but that the sentiments it expresses would be taken into consideration. Clearly, there is an element of confusion whether consequential loss is covered by the definition of damage and if paragraph (c) was inserted to clarify the situation, then the matter would be resolved. I ask the Minister to take it back and come back to us on Report Stage with suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears there is some confusion about what different people are supposed to have said. The realities are, I am advised, that the Attorney General's advice was sought on the matter of consequential loss and he is satisfied on that point. I am also advised that my colleague, Deputy Leyden, did not suggest what is being imputed to have said earlier today. It is not a question of there being alternative varying advice from the two different Attorneys General. That is not the case. As I said, the Attorney General's advice has been sought on the matter and he is satisfied in regard to it. I would ask the Members on the other side to respect his opinion on the matter.</P>

The fact is that the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, said here that he sought further clarification on the matter and that he is now satisfied that pain and suffering come within the ambit of the Bill. I have already given Senators the reference to the Dáil debates on the matter when the Minister of State said that pain and suffering did not come within the ambit of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, he told us today in this <Col N="892" /> House that he sought further advice on the matter and he is now satisfied that it comes within the ambit of the Bill. If you want, I can read the extract from the Dáil and go through it all; but the Minister said he sought further clarification from the new Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the new Attorney General, I did not; and I do not think any Member here mentioned it. He was the first person to say that the new Attorney General had further clarified the matter and I think it is disappointing the Minister does not agree to give clarity to the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines 17 and 18, to delete &ldquo;where damage is caused as a result of a failure in the process of generation of electricity&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 1 (1) of the Bill provides that electricity is a product for the purposes of this new legislation. Unlike the position in the directive itself, liability is restricted to those instances &ldquo;where damage is caused as a result of a failure in the process of generation of electricity&rdquo;. That is section 1 (1) (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finbar O'Mahony, Secretary of the <Col N="893" /> Electricity Supply Board, in a recent article entitled &ldquo;Customer Policy, the new EC Trading Environment: the ESB's Position&rdquo; state that &ldquo;electricity is mentioned in this directive because under many laws electricity is deemed to be energy rather than goods&rdquo;. However, section 1 (1) (b) provides that the inclusion of electricity in the definition of products is intended solely to cover defects which are due to a failure in the process of generation of electricity and not to the defects which are due to external agents interfering after the electricity has been put into the network or to damage resulting from a failure to supply.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (1) (b) is another example, in my view, of an important variation which the Minister has made in the wording of the directive. The directive itself simply states that &ldquo;product includes electricity&rdquo;. The Minister of State on several occasions today has referred to the need to carry over the exact wording of the directive but here the Minister has varied and extensively altered the definition. Therefore, in any fair interpretation of &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; as defined in the directive itself, it must include electricity in all its forms and facets so far as generation, supply or any other aspect of electricity is concerned. The Minister has changed that. He has cut back, varied and altered the clear meaning of the word &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; as contained in the directive and this could lead to serious loss to those consumers who may be affected by this change in definition. The large scope of electricity deals with several areas other than generation. Therefore, in view of the special position of the ESB, and indeed the position of private suppliers of electricity also, this change in the directive should be looked at.</P>
    <P>It must also be emphasised that in the recent UK case of Foster v. British Gas in 1990 it was held in that case that an EC directive can indeed have direct effect as far as nationalised companies and industries are concerned. Thus, even if domestic legislation does not implement a directive or only partly implements an EC directive, an individual can rely on the particular directive in a claim for <Col N="894" /> damages against the body responsible for providing a service which is under the control of the State. I am suggesting because of the supremacy of European law over domestic law in certain situations and because that it is directly applicable and that EC directives are directly applicable, if not introduced or only partly introduced here, that on the basis of the Foster and British Gas decision an individual would have a straight case against a nationalised or semi-State industry in this regard. Such bodies, as has been pointed out by the Secretary of the ESB, must comply with EC directives even though the State has not implemented them or only partly implemented them.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State in endeavouring to defend his position in the other House &mdash; and he will probably do so again in this House &mdash; pointed to the alleged intention of the directive as far as electricity is concerned as contained in a statement on the subject entered in the minutes of the Council of the European Communities on the occasion of the adoption of this directive. It is extraordinary that a Minister would come into either House and reply on the minutes of a meeting of a Council of the EC. It would be extraordinary if an Irish court or any court were to rely on such extrastatutory or extra-parliamentary material. In fact, it is not done in the courts. The courts do not look at Dáil reports and Seanad debates and all the extra parliamentary material to decide what is the intention of the directive. Is it now to be suggested, as the Minister of State said in the other House, that in order to find out the intention of the directive we must look at the minutes of the Council of the EC, or indeed the minutes of the European Commission?</P>
    <P>We have this directive in black and white before us. It is annexed to this Bill, and I already have commended the Minister and the Government for so doing. We cannot and should not go beyond the clear words of the directive and start talking about minutes and other extra-parliamentary material. Section 1 (1) (b) is an extraordinary departure from <Col N="895" /> the clear wording of the directive dealing with strict liability in the area of electricity. Therefore, I urge the Minister, in his own words, to adhere to the exact wording of the directive on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Senator Kennedy in putting forward this amendment. I do not want to repeat at length the points made by Senator Kennedy except to endorse one point he made, which is that the directive simply said that &ldquo;product includes electricity&rdquo;. Therefore, it was a conscious decision by the Minister or Government, whoever is responsible, to move from a straightforward situation where the directive said that &ldquo;product includes electricity&rdquo; to what we have in the Bill which states: &ldquo;electricity where damage is caused as a result of a failure in the process of generation of electricity&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister say what damage we are talking about here? Will he please give an example of the kind of damage this line in the Bill is supposed to cover? His reply may show that my reason for what I am going to say might not be well founded but when you find the Minister for the Government move from what is a very simple proposition to one that is not quite so simple, you have to seek reasons, you have to try to anticipate what was the thinking that brought about that change. I believe that change was brought about as a result of representations made to the Government by certain interests or certain people involved in that area, including the ESB. I am suggesting that it is very likely that representations were made to the Government by either the ESB or/and others who have an interest in providing electricity. There has been considerable interest in and talk about the privatisation of electricity generation. I am not against that proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another reason to change the wording is to ensure that this protection is built in and that the possible privatisation will be an attractive proposition to the private sector. I am advancing these few points to the Minister and I look forward with <Col N="896" /> interest to his response. I fully support the other points made by Senator Kennedy.</P>

I am satisfied that Article 2 is intended solely to cover defects due to a failure in the process of production of electricity and not defects due to external agents intervening after the electricity has been put into the network. The rationale behind this principle is that when a power cut occurs electricity is no longer in the network and cannot, therefore, be considered as a product within the meaning of the Bill. A surge in current, however, occurs during the time when the electricity is still in the system and as such is considered to be a defect in the product, the product in this case being the electricity itself. I am also satisfied from our contacts with the EC Commission that the directive is intended to cover surges in power but not power cuts. As far as I am aware, this interpretation has been the one followed by other member states when transposing directives into their national law. Unfortunately, I am not in a position to accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>On the point raised by Deputy Howard, neither the Minister for Industry and Commerce nor his Department received representations from any interests relating to the definition of electricity. Thus, the issue of privatisation is not in question.</P>

      <P>The Minister has just said that he has been informed that a similar approach has been adopted by other Legislatures. In fact, the Consumer Protection Act, 1987, in the UK, in Part I, section 1 (1) states:</P>
      <P>A &ldquo;product&rdquo; means any goods or electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Electricity is not defined. It is taken in all its facets and aspects. There is no reference to the generation of electricity or anything else. There you have a very <Col N="897" /> comprehensive Bill that was introduced in 1987 in the UK and they have not departed from the strict wording of the directive. I do not know of any other country that has departed from the wording of the directive as the definition in our Bill has. If the Minister is looking for <Col N="898" /> support of his arguments to reject the amendment, I do not think he can rely on the British legislation.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise what I regard is a very crucial matter on section 1. It is crucial that we get clarification of what we are talking about here. I support the exclusion of primary agricultural produce. I do not think that a defective product in the majority of cases has ever occurred inside the farming gate.</P>
      <P>The liability for a defective agricultural product occurs at what is described as the initial processing stage. What does &ldquo;initial processing&rdquo; mean? My concern is shared by a number of organisations. I want to give one example. I received a letter from the consultative committees of accountancy bodies in Ireland. They said they consider that clarification is required as to what precisely constitutes &ldquo;initial processing&rdquo;, for example would packaging of vegetables, grain drying or the initial cleansing of fish prior to being placed in cold storage, constitute such processing? They consider that the definition of initial processing contained in section 1 (1) of the Bill should be significantly expanded to avoid that doubt. I have doubt about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister's response to the following example. Currently we are all concerned about certain developments in the meat industry. A perfect product is produced on the land, a perfect product initially processed. Some years later it is removed from the chill room, the cold store or wherever it is, it is thawed out, <Col N="899" /> it is reprocessed and a defect occurs. My reading of the legislation is that no responsibility or no damage attaches to the reprocessing, which is the point at which the damage occurred but comes back to the initial processor. I would like the Minister's comments on the reservation expressed by the accountancy bodies as to what precisely is meant by &ldquo;initial processing.&rdquo; Here again we have introduced a change to the wording in the directive.</P>
    <P>Under section 1 &ldquo;primary agricultural products&rdquo; means the products of the soil, of stock-farming and of fisheries and game, excluding such products and game which have undergone initial processing. Are the packaging of vegetables, the drying of grain and the initial cleansing of fish considered to be the initial processing? I would like the Minister to comment on the longer term scenario I also referred to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>One aspect of the Bill's definition of &ldquo;product&rdquo; is that it exempts primary agricultural products which have not undergone initial processing. Such products were also exempted by the directive but the directive allowed member states, in Article 15, the option of bringing such products within the scope of the regime of no-fault liability. The Government have decided not to avail of this option. There were calls by a number of Senators on Second Stage to have such products included within the scope of the Bill. They contended that their inclusion would enhance the image and reputation overseas of Irish food products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This contention is based on a number of grounds. First, of the nine member states which to date have implemented the directive, only Luxembourg has included primary agricultural products. Agriculture does not boom large in Luxembourg's gross domestic product at 2.6 per cent compared with 10.2 per cent in the case of Ireland. Equally, Luxembourg accounts for only 0.1 per cent of the total Community production whereas for Ireland this figure is 2.0 per cent. <Col N="900" /> Second, in the other eight markets &mdash; the UK, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Denmark, Holland, Greece and Portugal &mdash; primary agricultural products are excluded from the implementing legislation. Third, if we were to include them it could send the wrong signals to consumers in other European markets by unwittingly giving the impression that our primary agricultural produce was in some way suspect. The principal reasons the Government decided to exclude them were that such products are particularly prone to hidden defects caused by environmental factors beyond the control of the producer, for example, acid rain, nuclear fallout and industrial pollution of rivers and seas.</P>
    <P>Producers of primary agricultural products, however, continue to be liable under tort and contract law. Under the law of tort the consumer has rights against the producer where damage caused by negligence can be proven. Under contract law goods are required to be of merchantable quality and fit for the purpose intended. There is also in place a variety of legislation which controls various aspects of quality in agricultural production, for example, the European Communities (Classification, Packaging and Labelling of Pesticides) Regulations, 1985 as amended. These regulations prescribe various conditions which must be complied with in relation to the placing on the market of pesticides; and the Animal Remedies Act, 1956, which regulates the import, manufacture, sale and advertisement of animal remedies; the European Communities (Veterinary Medicinal Products) Regulations, 1986. These regulations control the licensing and manufacture of veterinary medicinal products. In accordance with these regulations all such products sold must have an authorisation granted by the Minister for Agriculture. These authorisations are granted on the recommendation of the National Drugs Advisory Board who test the preparations in question with particular regard to quality, safety and efficacy.</P>
    <P>Regarding primary agricultural products which have been subject to initial <Col N="901" /> processing, even in cases where a defect in these types of products was not caused by the processing operation itself, the onus is on the processor to discover any hidden defects, no matter how they were caused. In an attempt to clarify what constitutes &ldquo;initial processing&rdquo; we have included &ldquo;any processing of an industrial nature which could cause a defect&rdquo; drawn from the directive. It is accepted, of course, that it will be ultimately a matter for a court to decide whether liability applies in any particular case.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, the Irish Insurance Federation, the Conferation of Irish Industry and the Industrial Costs Monitoring Group, concur with our thinking in respect of the exclusion of primary agricultural products. The main opposition to this exclusion is represented by the Consumers Association of Ireland, who feel there is no real relevance to the argument that primary agricultural products are subject to environmental factors beyond the control of the producer. Because of the extent to which fresh vegetables are, for instance, sprayed with chemicals and the land in which they are produced is artifically fertilised no valid distinction can be made between natural and processed products.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the vast majority of the other member states have excluded such products from their implementing legislation it would be extremely inadvisable for Ireland to take any measures which would put our farmers at a disadvantage in respect of their Community counterparts. To include primary agricultural products in the scope of the Bill would mean that farmers would be obliged to carry product liability insurance, a development which would add substantially of their production costs and, as a result, have a negative effect on competitiveness in respect of further EC members. Product, as defined in the Bill, will be very wide in coverage and any question of whether <Col N="902" /> a particular product is covered by the legislation will ultimately be determined by the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill defines &ldquo;initial processing&rdquo; in relation to primary agricultural products as any processing of an industrial nature of those products which could cause a defect therein. In most situations where a defect has been caused in such products by the processing operation, it will be obvious that the process used was &ldquo;of an industrial nature,&rdquo; for example canning, bottling, freezing and packaging, etc.</P>
    <P>However, in some cases where the raw product has been subjected to some minor process only such as, for instance, trimming and washing and packaging, it will not be such a clean-cut case of industrial processing. It is considered, therefore, that the question of whether or not a product has been subjected to such processing will be a matter for interpretation by the courts. This was the advice of the Commission when we sought their advice on what does or does not constitute initial processing. The definition in the Bill is that contained in the preamble to the directive.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to the House and wish him every success in his office. I have every confidence, as I am sure has everybody in the House, that he will do exceedingly well.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this motion. The subject of motor insurance is an emotive one and common to every household in the country. Therefore, it is a subject that people understand, or in many cases misunderstand. Everybody seems to have a lot to say on the cost of motor insurance, in many cases rightly so, but the difficulty is in identifying where the solution lies. I believe firmly that it is a combination of many different possibilities and not just one solution, that will bring about the lowering of insurance costs. In the time I am allowed I shall try to deal with some of the issues that are pertinent.</P>
      <P>I believe one has to go back and look at how one comes by a driving licence as one of the factors that causes so many accidents, particularly accidents among young people. This is the area of greatest concern to all of us. It is where the highest costs are and where the highest claims are experienced. I have held the view for many years that accessibility to a driving licence in this country by comparison with many of our European partners is far too easy. Because of that the right to take a vehicle &mdash; be it a motor cycle, a car, or van or whatever it is &mdash; on to the roads is not valued as in European countries. The testing standards one has to go through to acquire a driving licence here are very deficient and I believe there is a contributing factor to the high level of accidents that occur among young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, in Denmark one cannot just do a series of lessons and on a given day go out and do a test and be granted a driving licence. One must do driving <Col N="904" /> tests under certain specific conditions. You have to do what I would call the normal driving test we have with regard to being able to park the car, reverse the car, know the general rules of the road. In other countries you have to be able to drive in fine weather and prove that you can do so and, as part of the driving test, you have to do a test in very severe winter conditions. You are tested on your ability to control a car in very difficult conditions. Somebody may say we do not have as much ice and snow as they have in some European countries but we have dangerous enough driving conditions to deal with and people who get a licence at a young age may not be able to cope with such conditions, due to the lack of expertise and experience. That is an important factor. On the Continent a person has to learn to drive in snowy conditions and the ability to drive in wet conditions is regarded as essential. Who can say that in a country like Ireland we do not have a very wet climate? What specific onus is on anybody in this country to take their driving test in very wet conditions? There is none.</P>
    <P>The experience one must have to get a driving licence is very limited and it does not cover all of the conditions that people are going to meet in the normal course of driving a vehicle. Because of that young people lack experience of driving in all kinds of weather. In my opinion that, in itself, is one of the contributory factors in the high level of accidents among young people. A person should be tested in a specific place to drive a car at speed, to drive a car in very wet conditions, in windy, icy and even snowy conditions if that is possible. Driving in the different conditions people will meet in the normal course of their driving should be a fundamental and basic part of the driving test. Thus, when people qualify and gain their driving licence it is something far more valuable, something they will treat with far greater care than I believe they <Col N="905" /> do at present, simply because accessibility to a licence is perhaps a little too easy.</P>
    <P>It may be said that could be an expensive process but so be it. One has to remember all those who are killed and maimed because of the action of inexperienced young drivers.</P>
    <P>A licence granted to a person on the Continent is granted for life. It costs in the region of £300 or £400 but payment can be phased over a period and it is not beyond the wit of anybody to acquire a licence. The proof of that is there is nobody deprived on the Continent, irrespective of background, socially or otherwise, of access to getting a driving licence and once they get it they are qualified and they are far more responsible. We only have to look at the claims; that in itself is a contributory factor and is something I would like looked at.</P>
    <P>Why the Department or bureaucracy needs to be the testing body is beyond me. I do not think that is necessary. It clogs up the system, it becomes heavily bureaucratic and it entails all the difficulties involved in that area. An independent body run on a commercial basis and allowed to function as a commercial operation should be involved in this area. I think it would be far more efficient, less hamstrung, far more focused. The standards I have outlined for qualifying for a licence could be set out in a more organised way and that is another aspect I would like considered.</P>
    <P>I remember speaking two or three years ago in the Dáil about the high cost claims. It is clear to me, as I think it is to everybody in this House and elsewhere, that we desperately need a specific quantum book of damages. We all know that the amount of law being practised in the High Court in this area today is practically nil. Something approaching 80 per cent of cases are agreed on the steps of the High Court, less than 20 per cent actually go to court.</P>
    <P>Who are the beneficiaries of all of this? It is the legal system. Who are the people <Col N="906" /> who should draft a quantum book of damages? The legal people. They have a vested interest in not going down the road of putting in a very specific quantum book of damages which limits substantially the type of claims and the value put on injuries. I believe in the UK a whiplash claim is £1,500. That is it, that is specific. People know what they are getting. We know it can run to £40,000, £60,000, £70,000. You can put any figure you like on it. There is an incentive for people to pursue claims in a legal sense with all that entails. It suits the legal profession. They are not necessarily working on a percentage basis but in many cases it is a case of &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo;. There is an incentive to go for the highest possible claim in terms of their reward. That is a fact of life and there is no point in pretending it does not happen. You will not begin to seriously tackle the high levels of claims until a specific quantum book of damages is introduced to deal with the many types of insurance claims. It is my view and it is something that has been said to the legal profession on many occasions. If they have not responded it is the duty of the Government to force them to do so. Enough signals have been sent to them to get their act together to do this. If they do not do it, whether it comes under the Department of Justice or any other area, they should bring in their own people to draft the quantum book of damages and say: &ldquo;That is it; that is what is going to happen from here on.&rdquo; Look at the impact that could have on the level of insurance claims and the attitude people have to going after insurance companies. The perception is that insurance companies have tons of money; it is only the insurance company and there is no problem. People tend to forget that the high premiums they are paying specifically on car insurance are the result of that practice. It is time something was done about this.</P>
    <P>The legal profession have been aware of this for some time and in my view <Col N="907" /> they have not responded sufficiently. The Department of Justice should look at it and get their own people to draft a quantum book of damages. I do not think there should be any major difference between it and what exists in the UK. This would be a basis to work from. The legal practices that have grown up around those opportunities are also questionable, to put it in its mildest form. I have made the point and I do not need to say any more about it.</P>
    <P>A question was raised about impounding non-insured cars. This too could be looked at. I understand there might be an infringement of individual rights and constitutional problems in that area but nevertheless the number of people who drive uninsured cars is nothing short of a disgrace. Some forceful way has to be found to deal with this problem and with the problem of impounding cars.</P>
    <P>One point I want to make which may sound contradictory to the point I have just made is that I do not understand why, if a person is insured he cannot drive any car. I believe it is the person who is insured. Why can it not be as it is on the Continent? There if you are an insured person you may drive any car. It is a nonsensical situation here. Either I am an insured person paying hefty insurance to drive or I am not. I think the business of attaching it to the vehicle is wrong. The onus should be on the person to be insured and should be recognised as such. We should cut out all the codology.</P>
    <P>The question of public liability is causing great difficulty in terms of costs. I come from a rural constituency in Waterford and I know many farmers cannot allow people to cross their land because they are afraid people will get injured and that they, the farmers will be faced with a major claim. The days of holding the old barn dance and all the fun that that entailed are disappearing and the only people benefiting are the insurance companies. All these attendant costs make it prohibitive for anybody to get <Col N="908" /> any kind of function going in rural Ireland today. This is grossly unfair; it is wrong. This high public liability insurance premium is not doing anything for the social infrastructure. There should be reasonable guidelines on the definition of public liability, where it is required, and what the cost should be.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental question to be asked in terms of the social consequences of the level of public liability insurance. There are restrictions on people in terms of the activities that can now be carried out by young people and by families together. We are all saying young people stand on street corners and they cannot do this, that or the other thing but maybe we are part of the reason for that, maybe we are killing the opportunities for the social intercourse that should occur in this country. I wish I had more time but I wanted to make those specific points and hope they contribute to the debate here this evening.</P>
    <P>There is a perception that 1992 and competition will suddenly reduce claims. I do not believe that will be the case. The claims experience will dictate what the outcome will be. If we get those issues that I have referred to in order, we will have greater competition on the marketplace and lower insurance costs because of the competition in a given area and the different types of insurances. If one person has spoken on the record on this issue over the last number of years it is the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I welcome his discussions with the Minister for Justice and the Minister for the Environment. I hope their deliberations will result in fundamental, radical but workable, changes that can make the difference. We all know what the problems are and the simple solutions are there. The three Ministers have the capacity to ensure that young people have the right to insurance but, because of what we and others have allowed to happen, they do not have access to the market.</P>
    <P>

I have great pleasure in welcoming him to his new office and wishing him well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to start by referring to the position of schools and insurance. All professions are now beginning to suffer from this litigation conscious community which, as Senator Cullen said, has led to a new spin-off industry which keeps many of those in the legal profession well looked after. It has become almost a national pastime taking professionals to court for claims of negligence arising from accidents. Senator Cullen referred to the position in farms but the most hazardous occupation in this country at the moment is running a school. There is no such thing as an accident anymore. If a child falls and hurts himself more often than not that is the basis of a claim and so begins the long process of going from one lawyer to another until somebody is found who is prepared to take the case. A schoolyard accident was brought to my attention. It was an accident, there was nobody to blame but the parents, having discussed it with others in the area and being told they had a good case, went to the local solicitor who told them there was no case as it was just an accident. Not happy with that the parents went to another solicitor locally and got precisely the same advice. Still not happy, they went to a third solicitor who was trying to make a name for himself. That solicitor thought here was a great opportunity, schoolyard accidents always make good newspaper headlines and he would take it on the basis of &ldquo;no foal no fee&rdquo;; in other <Col N="910" /> words, if they did not win there would be no fee. I believe that the legal profession should look at this area.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of lawyers are thoroughly competent and responsible in the way they approach things but there is always the temptation to move into this area to make a quick buck and to gain a profile and a bit of publicity. I went to the court to listen and after three days of massive newspaper headlines the case was, of course, thrown out. The judge really castigated the lawyer who had invited the parents to take the case to court and said there should be more of that. This should be brought to people's attention. I want to stress that this is only one aspect.</P>
    <P>The real difficulty very often lies with the insurers or underwriters. At the moment if there is a schoolyard accident there is claim of negligence put in against everybody in sight &mdash; the school, the board of management, the chairperson of the school management board, the principal teacher, the class teacher, the teacher who was on yard supervision &mdash; everybody in sight is sprayed with litigation, everybody is involved. Then a claim is entered. This goes back to what Senator Cullen said about settling on the steps of the courts.</P>
    <P>Nothing pains me as much as that because many of these cases would be better off fought. The reason they are not fought in the court is precisely because the actuarial study done by the insurance company does not make it worth their while. This creates a long term problem. Say there is an accident, a claim is entered for maybe £6,000 or £7,000, not a huge claim. It then goes to the underwriters. They look at it and decide they might win in court. It then goes to the cost accountant in the insurance company. The cost accountant works out that it may be a three day case and will cost about £7,000 but they will probably win it. Next they look at the person taking the case. They may decide he is a man of straw, unemployed, in <Col N="911" /> rented accommodation with no visible means. They might win this case but at a cost of £7,000 whereas if they settle it will only cost £5,500 or £6,000. Ergo settle. That goes down in the insurer's books as a saving of £1,000.</P>
    <P>What really happens is that the parents go home with the £5,000 in their pocket. They have a party. They explain to everybody how easy it was and half the neighbourhood says: I can do that. Then we are into another case the following week, and it becomes almost a national pastime. It is so bad that my organisation on many occasions have asked the underwriters if we could take responsibility for the costs so that we could fight the case and win it. They have never allowed us to do that because the underwriters have always written into the clause that once a claim is lodged they take responsibility for it and it is they who decide whether it should be fought or conceded.</P>
    <P>On numerous occasions we have demanded that the insurance company fight the case and we will cover the cost just so that people can learn that these cases can be lost. The reality is that the case is presented in court, the plaintiff puts the case first, there are three days of publicity telling one side of the story, and even if the case is finally lost at that stage, it is worn out as a story and nobody ever gets to hear the other side.</P>
    <P>There is a hardship side as well. Teachers feel that being charged publicly with negligence is almost a professional assassination. It does not matter whether the case is won or lost, the fact is that a teacher against whom a claim for negligence has been lodged will live for 18 months, two years, four years, and in one case up to ten years, waiting for the case to come to court.</P>
    <P>I can tell of one horrific case I dealt with. A claim was lodged against a teacher in a large suburban school where a child in a class of 40 fell in the schoolyard and injured a knee. The accident was noted &mdash; they always are in schools <Col N="912" /> nowadays &mdash; in the accident book. Almost ten years later, a claim was lodged against the teacher for negligence saying that the fall resulted in knee damage. The teacher could not even remember the accident. They checked it in the accident book and found it had happened. She could barely remember the child. That teacher was found to be negligent on the basis that she omitted to take the proper action when this schoolyard accident took place. It was a cut knee which the teacher looked after in the best way possible, treated the knee as she would with her own child and that was the end of the matter. Nothing further arose until almost ten years later. That case was settled for £8,000 or £9,000.</P>
    <P>We are being caught every way. I am not saying that every professional person should be above a claim of negligence, I am just saying that the way in which these claims are processed is causing great concern, unnecessary hardship and is leading to concessions of claims on the steps of the court resulting in higher premiums the following year and beyond.</P>
    <P>How does one deal with that? The common law says that in such cases a teacher dealing with schoolchildren should act like a wise and prudent parent. The difficulty is that wise and prudent parents tend not to have 40 children. It is very difficult to deal with this and to know what is demanded. While it is quite acceptable for a parent to let a child play on the street or in the back garden, where they are not under the constant supervision of the parent, a lot more is demanded of any professional person dealing with children. They are supposed to have full visual supervision at all times. Even at that level we need to have a good look at what is demanded of a professional, what is meant by &ldquo;the wise and prudent parent&rdquo; and what is expected of them.</P>
    <P>The question of insurance in schools is the single greatest bugbear in teachers' lives. They never know when a claim is <Col N="913" /> going to be lodged. I can fully appreciate the points Senator Cullen made about farmers having events on their land or allowing people on their land. It is precisely the same in schools. When an accident occurs the first thing people think of is whether this is going to lead to a claim. Very often there is a sense of panic created. People wonder how many years of hassle will result from this. Inevitably the claims come flying in and inevitably it creates more and more problems at school level. It is an issue which is among the most serious.</P>
    <P>The cost of public liability and specific insurance to cover for negligence claims is huge. It is grossly unfair that where somebody who is looking after many pupils in the school yard, if one of the 100 falls in a corner of the yard and cuts himself or herself, that teacher, doing his duty to the best of his ability given all the problems that exist in any educational structure, can have a charge of negligence sustained against him that attaches to him professionally for the rest of his career. That is an aspect we perhaps do not think about a lot but it is there. We are all very sensitive to criticism about how we do our job.</P>
    <P>I want to look briefly at car insurance. A recent OECD study noted that the accident risk presented by young drivers is almost four times the average. The risk of fatal accident is two or three times greater for young men than for young women. This is a fact and there is no way around it. There is no gainsaying it. What is important to note is that this affects car sales and increases the number of uninsured drivers.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on record that the cost of claims taken against or because of drivers in the 26 to 30 age group is just about average. There are two ways of looking at that. It is important to note that the 25-30 year old driver is very often given a penal rating on his or her premium but the figures show the average cost of claims arising from drivers in that age group is £4,500 and the average cost <Col N="914" /> of claims for all ages is £4,400 &mdash; almost the same, higher for drivers in the 17-20 and 21-25 age groups. I believe these people should be encouraged to drive and I agree fully with what Senator Cullen said. The problem begins with the application for a driving licence. There is a written test in Denmark and the Scandanavian countries. There, drivers learn how to deal with all road hazards.</P>
    <P>I want to add to what Senator Cullen said. It is not just the driver who is insured. In some Scandinavian countries, Sweden for instance, they do the opposite; they insure the car for any driver. You either insure a driver to drive any car or insure a car no matter who drives it. Either way is cleaner than the mess we have. I read my insurance policy every year to see how it has changed from the previous year. Some years you are insured to drive any car, others your own car has open driving and it goes on and on.</P>
    <P>On the question of uninsured driving &mdash; I do not like the idea of mandatory sentences &mdash; until we grasp the nettle and insist that uninsured driving will lead to a prison term, people will not take it seriously. We are paying the costs of uninsured driving. There is no escape from that. We are all paying for it and we should put the boot in hard. This practice is negligent and irresponsible and cannot be sustained. In that area there is a lot of work to be done.</P>
    <P>We need to look at the inter-ministerial group chaired by the Minister for Industry and Commerce which dealt with enforcement, driving laws, tuition and the operation of the courts. The proposals brought forward by that group should be given serious consideration and, in the main, should be implemented. It could lead to cheaper car insurance for all but especially for the younger driver. That together with action against uninsured driving would vastly improve the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the words of welcome to the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, on his first visit to this House. His appointment is most popular <Col N="915" /> and well deserved. Having shared an office with him for many years. I am very conscious of his capacity for work. Hence I am satisfied that he will make a tremendous success of his new portfolio. I will share my time with my colleague, Senator Hugh Byrne.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this very important motion that Seanad Éireann notes with concern the cost of motor and liability insurance and requests the Minister for Industry and Commerce to take urgent steps to remedy the position.</P>
      <P>The situation with regard to young drivers seems to be deteriorating day by day mainly due to the very high level of insurance premiums they are quoted. The position has now been reached where, in many cases, they cannot even get a quotation. I was present at a youth forum some months ago where the high cost of motor insurance for young people was discussed at length. It is now accepted that insurance premiums for motor insurance, employers' liability and public liability are very high in this country. We are told it is due to the high level of claims. The level of accidents on our roads and in the workplace has increased out of all proportion over the past number of years and, as a result, the cost of settling these claims has also increased.</P>
      <P>I understand from many insurance brokers that one of the main causes of high premiums is due to the many uninsured vehicles on our roads. It has been brought to my notice over the past number of months that many young people, especially if they are under 30 years of age or if they have no previous insurance, now find it impossible to get cover especially if they are provisional licence holders. No company seems interested in their case. In the few cases where they have been quoted, the figures are beyond their means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the situation recently checked through one insurance broker with regard to one of Lloyds syndicates. I <Col N="916" /> found that the premiums for similar type risk in the UK would be only one-third the premium quoted here. It is now an accepted fact that motor insurance premiums are much higher in this country than in most European countries, and not merely for young drivers. I understand that young drivers constitute a very high risk group for the purposes of motor insurance. Where they are quoted, their premiums tend to be well above the average. I believe also that male drivers constitute a higher risk than female drivers. For this reason young male drivers pay the highest premium of all.</P>
    <P>As I already stated, Ireland has a very high accident rate which results in a large number of claims in proportion to the number of insured vehicles on the road. We also have a very high level of compensation for personal injury. This also applies to damage or repair costs. We have very high legal fees. This combination of factors results in a very high average cost of claims compared to other countries. As a result of our very high premiums another situation arises where young people have accidents and convictions. They do not disclose the fact that they had an accident and it is only when a further accident occurs that it comes to light. The Motor Insurance Bureau are then asked to deal with the claim because their policy will be null and void. It would help if insurance companies' claims bonuses would reveal accidents or convictions as it would deter people from making a false declaration. At present they do not show any claims history, etc., or convictions.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years, insurance companies have made substantial losses. As a result they have had to apply for a number of increases in motor insurance premiums. I understanding that as a result of the serious situation in which they find themselves, they will be seeking further increases in the year ahead.</P>
    <P>If we were to make comparisons between insurance costs in this country <Col N="917" /> and in other European countries one thing stands out: we have more accidents than any other European country; we pay accident victims substantially more compensation than most European countries. I know of a case where a victim who lost sight in one eye was compensated by a sum in the region of £85,000 whereas in the United Kingdom a corresponding injury victim would receive approximately £30,000; in other countries, like Portugal and Greece, this figure would be well below the region of £5,000.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned in this House last week that compensation for a whiplash injury in Ireland would cost in the region of £15,000 to £18,000 whereas in America a person would be lucky to get $4,000 to $5,000. I understand that the level of uninsured drivers here is between 8 per cent and 10 per cent of the total number of registered vehicles, whereas the average in Europe is less than 1 per cent. This problem must be tackled. If not, the cost of motor insurance will escalate further, especially for young people. Steps must be taken to reduce the accident rates on our roads and the level of compensation paid to accident victims. There is no doubt that with the right commitment from the relevant authorities progress can be made in these areas.</P>
    <P>Last December the Garda authorities introduced a major clamp down on drinking and driving. During that period the number of deaths were reduced by almost one-third. I welcome the recent statement by the Minister for Justice confirming that the same procedures will apply this December. This is a very important decision as it is accepted by the public at large that strong action must be taken against those who drink and drive. The Insurance Federation of Ireland in co-operation with the National Safety Council, recently launched a major publicity campaign which cost a lot of money. Their campaign is to encourage the public to be more conscious of road safety and law enforcement.</P>
    <P>The high cost of public and employers' <Col N="918" /> liability is a cause of major concern to industry, shopkeepers, tradesmen, builders, etc. It is now also accepted that many jobs are lost due to excessive public liability and excessive employers' liability premiums. Local authorities, health boards, vocational education committees and other local authorities find the burden of public liability payments in particular extremely difficult. All these groups operate under serious financial constraints and most of us, as councillors are dealing with our local authority estimates at this time. We have been informed that there is a substantial increase in public liability insurance, in many cases so substantial it will result in increased rates for the coming year.</P>
    <P>I have been given some figures in the last few days for local authorities public liability insurance. Limerick Corporation were quoted in the region of £2.2 million; it is now £1.8 million. Cork County Council were quoted £1.5 million while Kerry County Council are being charged a premium of almost £430,000 for the current year. It would be much higher but for the fact that Irish public bodies are handling the business. It must be appreciated that they are doing great work for local authorities.</P>
    <P>Another matter of concern is the number of fraud claims coming on stream. They are increasing all the time. While many genuine claims are made, fraud must be faced up to by the relevant authorities. I look forward to 1992 when European companies will be allowed operate fully in this country. I hope this will lead to keener competition. I understand that over 70 per cent of the total premium incomes generated in the Irish market are now controlled by overseas companies. Most of the major European countries already have an interest in the Irish market.</P>
    <P>I hope the Garda are given more powers to impound cars.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Foley for allowing me to comment on what is <Col N="919" /> a particularly difficult situation in rural areas and I am sure it is the same in the city. As in 1798 when the people of Wexford were the first to rise, on this issue they have again risen by setting up a motor insurance action group. The group have already held three meetings &mdash; one in Enniscorthy, one in Wexford and one in New Ross &mdash; and they now intend to go national. About 200 people attended each meeting to discuss specifically the cause of young drivers. I am delighted this issue was raised today. I know the Minister present and the Minister who has just left will be aware of the situation because we all hear about it in our clinics from time to time.</P>
      <P>Like other Senators, I will give some examples of issues raised at the various meetings; insurance on a 1989 Ritmo was £750; insurance on the same car this year was £1,200. This was for a 25 year old person with a full driving licence and two years no claims bonus. It is very difficult for anybody to understand that. A 19 year old with a full licence was quoted £2,049 third party insurance cover on a Mini. The Mini itself was not worth what he was asked to pay for insurance. That is an absolute disgrace.</P>
      <P>Very recently I met two young people who had the same story &mdash; they had no claims, were 22 years old and were quoted £800 last year and £1,300 this year. Neither could afford to pay insurance this year which meant they had to do without their cars which in turn, meant they had to do without a job. This is a serious aspect of this problem. They needed a car to get to work and they could not afford to pay the insurance so that either left them as uninsured drivers or unemployed. In either event it is terribly wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The MIAG, as they now call themselves and about whom you will be hearing much in the very near future, feel that the Government impose too many things they consider it their right to impose. For instance, they impose 50 per cent tax on <Col N="920" /> the price of a car at the point of entry; they increase the price of petrol by approximately 70 per cent through various taxes; tyres or spare parts, garage bills and everything to do with a car has VAT added to it. Drivers must pay a road tax and, of course, must have a drivers' licence. What does the motorist get back from the Government? Have we good roads? Have we State aided driving schools? Have we State controlled insurance? The Government insist on all their rights but deny that they have a duty to the driver, say MIAG. The State says: &ldquo;I will give you a driving licence but a private company will decide whether you will drive&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The aims of the organisation are: first, third party insurance to be available to all with no categories or age criteria; second, to gain recognition from the Oireachtas as a body representing motorists. They hope to achieve those aims by examining the possibility of third party insurance being provided by the State and funded by a levy on motor fuel. That is interesting. It has been done elsewhere and it should be given some consideration; third examine the possibility of setting up a mutual insurance company; fourth, call for a public inquiry into the cost of insurance. This has been mentioned in every part of the country; fifth campaign for greater competition between insurance companies. When a person is given a quotation by one insurance company he will go to another for a second quotation but both quotations will be identical. There appears to be a cartel operating in this area. People are also worried about the 1992 derogation. Being the responsible group they are the MIAG are asking for better driver education; and sixth, they intend to establish branches countrywide. I do not say that as a threat but that will happen because people are concerned. In short they suggest better driver education, better roads, MOTs open market insurance and life annuities to replace lump sums.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> I will deal with public liability and compo, as it is now known, or &ldquo;compensationitis.&rdquo; About four years ago in Clonroche, County Wexford, Wexford County Council saw there was a nice lime kiln on the outskirts of the village. Through the social employment scheme they developed the Kiln as it was in olden times. It looked tremendous and enhanced the village. Some youngsters from the housing estate across the road climbed up on the Kiln that had been newly refurbished, fell off, sued the council and got £3,000 for what would be regarded as a slight injury. That prevented Wexford County Council developing coastal walks.</P>
    <P>I can identify with what Senator Cullen said with regard to farmers. It was understood that the hunt could come in on the land and people could come in to take a turnip or to pick mushrooms. Now if people walk on the land the farmers ask them to leave because they are afraid of what might happen. In short, we are talking about a very big issue which we must address.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and the newly appointed Minister of State who was here previously. I wish him well in his new role.</P>
      <P>The motion before the House is topical and it is one that we on this side can easily support. There are no simple answers and it is only by concentrating minds that we will solve the problems which exist in relation to the high cost of motor insurance and inter-linked matters like claims, rules of the road, driving tuition and also in relation to the question of civil liability insurance and how it affects business in so many ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that we have become much more claims conscious. Years ago when people were involved in accidents like falling in the street, slipping in a shop or getting off a bus they would just get up and say they were all right. Now the first thing on many people's mind is: what <Col N="922" /> is this worth to me? This can cause problems for the genuine people who claim from time to time. In my practice I have seen people with little or nothing wrong with them and in days gone by they would not have contemplated a claim. Nowadays there are many more litigious minded people out there. It is too simplistic to blame lawyers totally. Lawyers have a certain responsibility and obviously they have a role to play.</P>
    <P>I remember the justification of insurance companies that the reason for high insurance costs was the jury system and having a couple of barristers in on cases. Juries were abolished and what happened? Nothing. If lawyers and other bodies have a case to answer, certainly the insurance companies also have a case to answer. For example, a person of 47 years of age applying for insurance from a Limerick address was quoted £286 as against £588 paid by another person. That is difference of £300. The company charging £286 are not running a charity so how much profit are the company charging £588 making? We must have further discussion and dialogue in relation to this. I welcome the inter-ministerial committee which has met. It should go on meeting and reviewing matters.</P>
    <P>It should go from this House, from the Dáil and from every decent quarter that we will have no truck with uninsured drivers and that they will face the full rigour of the law. I agree with having a minimum jail term in relation to that offence. I know certain justices send people to jail for second offence but the question of their being jailed on a first offence should be examined. I propose that uninsured cars be impounded.</P>
    <P>The insurance disc system has, hopefully, led to an increase in the number of insured cars but there are many cars being driven without insurance. People who drive uninsured cars should be treated in the same way as we treat the crime of attempted murder. If they are involved in a fatality or in a bad accident <Col N="923" /> which affects the breadwinner in a household, many people are affected. We pay for that. It should go out from this House that we are going after uninsured drivers. We should look at the possibility of setting up a traffic squad who would do the rounds of car parks and also deal with cars on the road. Uninsured cars should be impounded and one should not be able to pay later as is the case with a television licence. All Members would agree with that. Driving an uninsured car is one of the most heinous of crimes.</P>
    <P>We must look at the matter of claims, how they are processed and penalties in relation to starting claims in the wrong jurisdiction. There should be some kind of tribunal where certain claims could be dealt with quickly. Mention was made of putting certain values on a whiplash injury or a broken arm or broken leg. One would have to be careful in relation to that because no two accidents are the same. Someone could break their leg and make a reasonably good recovery while someone else with a similar injury might never recover fully. It would be very dangerous if we came to the stage where a certain value was put on say, a broken leg. In one case doctors may diagnose a full recovery and in another case they may diagnose certain medical problems. One has to be careful in relation to that. In recent times certain judges have been taking a much more practical view of things and they are not just dealing in enormous amounts of money in relation to claims.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the insurance industry have given a concrete response to the query regarding costs not reducing despite the abolition of juries and fewer barristers employed on cases. I have not heard much from them. We should ask insurance companies about the quotations they offer. I cite the case of a girl living in Dublin. She is aged 33 and basically uses her car for social, domestic and leisure purposes and for taking her to and from work. She wanted third party <Col N="924" /> fire and theft cover. Without naming any insurance company, I will read the list of quotations. I quote from <i>Consumer Choice</i>, page 349 of November 1991. Premium prices range as follows: £502, £459, £398, £355, £592, £450, £443, £437, £473, £493, £440 and bottom or top of the class depending on which way one wants to look at it are £303, £593 and £441. There is a vast range of quotations available to a woman for third party fire and theft premia. On the presumption that the cheapest company at £303 is not doing it for the good of their health or at a loss, how much profit is made by the company charging £592 or £593, £290 extra? This question should be examined. The inter-ministerial group should continue examining such issues. Public inquiries into all sorts of areas have been requested and there is a case for an inquiry into the excessive cost for motor and liability insurance.</P>
    <P>Anyone nowadays with a pub, restaurant or shop finds public liability insurance an ever increasing burden. All it takes is somebody to slip or fall and ready cash must be paid up front, and people do well out of the accident. In relation to civil liability insurance, some owners can be careless or happy go lucky and they need to get their house in order and look at the problems arising. People who run public facilities such as these should carry certain insurance safeguards and there is a certain amount to be said in favour of insurance companies who demand that the owner pay the first £1,000 or couple of thousand pounds of a claim. These small claims taken when someone slips on a restaurant floor or going into a pub toilet may be irresponsible.</P>
    <P>Young people are heavily loaded by motor insurance companies and they are entitled to drive without excessive burdens. Senator O'Toole mentioned earlier that the difference in premia between the 25 to 30 year old group and older people is not so great, so I do not think the younger group constitute such a liability <Col N="925" /> but at times they are being unfairly penalised.</P>
    <P>At a future date we may debate this matter again but, in the meantime, I hope a report will be commissioned and an inquiry held involving various vested interests such as the Incorporated Law Society, the Bar Council and various insurance companies. With great ado, insurance companies said that once we got rid of juries and second barristers in claim cases insurance prices would drop. How many people here have had a reduction in their insurance bill of late? The insurance industry must also get their house in order.</P>
    <P>This is a very timely motion which we should also address at a future date. I hope that responses will in time be made to what I have said. It is an important matter for many people, particularly as 1992 approaches. We need to look at all aspects of the question but no single person, party or reason is to blame. There are many reasons for the present situation and they all need to be examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will share my time with Senator McGowan if that is in order. God bless <i>Consumer Choice</i> magazine and the Consumers Association; its current issue was timely given the topic of this motion. I am sure Senators on both sides of the House would have found it difficult to procure the relevant statistics but for the assiduous work carried out by the researchers of the Consumers Association of which I am a member. I congratulate them not only on this motor insurance survey which have been rightly quoted voluminously here this evening but on the many surveys they have carried out in the public interest. It was interesting listening to Senator Cosgrave and to other contributions this evening to note that the emphasis is being placed on motor insurers for high premiums and on the legal system for condoning or encouraging or at least accepting very high settlement claims. While I accept <Col N="926" /> that those are valid areas for criticism and analysis, I would like to suggest looking at other reasons many insurance companies now are not prepared first, to give acceptable quotes to young first time drivers but also that premia are so high for seasoned drivers like myself and others here.</P>
      <P>The Consumers Association tell us that on average 9,000 accidents take place on Irish roads every month and I was pleased to learn that the growing level of disquiet in the insurance industry and among consumers led to the establishment in December 1990 of a special inter-ministerial committee to examine ways of reducing insurance cost. I would be interested to learn from the Minister whether that committee is still in being, whether they have actually made a submission to Government and what stage their deliberations are at.</P>
      <P>The main items for discussion by the Committee were road traffic law reform, enforcement of road traffic law, the courts system and the motor insurance market. The first two should be looked at in greater depth than the latter two which have already been the subject of much analysis which should continue. How many of us, however, driving on Irish roads in late evening or at night, have met cars which are obviously not 100 per cent roadworthy, with only one headlight or two incompatible headlights? People make right hand turns without any prior warning and coupled with the poor state of many of our roads bad driving in recent years has led to a high incidence of accidents. It would be churlish of me not to commend the Government's programme for road improvement and all of us travelling to the west must be grateful for the continuing developments on the western side of the city. I am not criticising these commendable improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Road traffic law reform should be looked at seriously. Recently I wrote to the Minister for the Environment suggesting, among other things, that to help <Col N="927" /> the speedy and orderly flow of traffic the Government might consider introducing permission for drivers to take a right hand turn against a red light. This system has been operated successfully in the United States for many years. One frequently finds that this particular prohibition leads to frustration, people break through red lights and accidents happen.</P>
    <P>The other factor to be noted, although I do not know how it might be reversed, is that Ireland has become a more litigious society in recent years. This has been pointed out by several speakers and the whiplash phenomenon seems to be the flavour of the month. This is a bit like the back injury syndrome which has been touted for so long. There is no doctor or medical expert in the world who can disprove a patient's word that they have a back injury because it is such a nebulous form of ailment. Whiplash also seems to be a rather abstract medical condition which is growing in popularity. I am not suggesting that the people with genuine whiplash injuries are not entitled to receive compensation but we cannot expect to be paying cheaper premiums if we are partly responsible for pushing prices up.</P>
    <P>I welcome this inter-ministerial commission and look forward to reading their deliberations, particularly their pronouncements regarding road traffic law reform and enforcement of road traffic law as it applies to motor vehicles and to the standard of driving here. Then perhaps we might be able to start reducing premiums and eliminating, I hope, the most outrageous quotations that many of our young drivers receive. I have heard of a young driver of 24 years who bought a car for £3,500 who, when he received an insurance quotation for £2,100 was obliged to sell the car. That should not happen in a modern democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Insurance companies <Col N="928" /> are quite happy with conditions prevailing here and they will continue to put forward theories and reasons they have to maintain high premium costs. Coming from a Border county I find it difficult to accept that a driver living in County Tyrone can get insurance for about half the price quotable in County Donegal. I do not accept that drivers in the North are better than those in the Republic. There is more competition in the North and the Government there has imposed certain restrictions and controls over insurance companies which we certainly need here. I urge the Minister to pursue this matter because everybody is interested in the topic and many contributions have been made but despite strong, unanimous recommendations, will we achieve anything? Are we moving forward? The Minister would have to convince himself and others that the Government are in a position to take action.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;insurance&rdquo; is important. Nobody running a school, arranging an outing or opening any kind of club can afford to say we will do this, that or the other. The first question is: are you insured to do it? Insurance is now an important part of our economy and the Government must be seen to be taking action. This is an important national issue, and I would like to see progress being made.</P>
      <P>An important aspect of the insurance question is the case of first time drivers. In Ireland one can drive unaccompanied with a provisional licence and I get the impression that insurance companies are quite happy to allow that situation to continue. In Northern Ireland, Britain and other countries, a provisional licence does not allow you to drive unaccompanied. I wonder why the law here is different and why insurance companies are not concerned? The Government should impose rules and regulations on insurance companies operating here so that parameters are established for all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> The level of claims is exacerbated by our lack of success in prosecuting those who vandalise cars, especially in Dublin. Can anyone believe that a car parked outside a house will remain undamaged overnight? Those who vandalise cars are not punished severely enough and that is a significant factor in the cost of motor insurance. I urge the Minister to take a strong initiative to see that the Government set down controls and regulations within which insurance companies would be forced to operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most important motions to come before this House in a long time. The wording of the motion itself is critical because it asks the Minister for Industry and Commerce to take urgent steps to remedy a situation. In other words, the time for talking is long past, it is 20 years past, and the time for action is now.</P>
      <P>The first thing we have to realise is that the insurers are only part of the problem. The basic problem lies with people's expectations of compensation. To pay out high compensation one must charge high premiums. That fundamental situation must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People's attitude to law enforcement is another factor in the cost of insurance. I place no value on the driving test. A survey would reveal high success rate in driving tests for the 20 to 25 age group, particularly among male drivers, in other words, they can drive well when they are put to it and are obliged to learn the rules of the road but that does not mean they drive well all the time, and thereby lies a dilemma. If we are going to do anything about reducing insurance costs we need to ensure that the rules of the road are realistic and that they are enforced. In Ireland we tend to indulge in overkill with some laws then say it is impossible to apply them. The 55 m.p.h. speed limit on national primary routes is a perfect example of legal overkill because even careful, conscientious people do not adhere to it. Laws must be enacted that <Col N="930" /> can be applied rigorously. A very good system applies in Sweden, where, for every mile over the speed limit, one is charged so much until I think, ten or 15 miles over the limit when they go for one's licence.</P>
    <P>We must enforce the rules of the road all the time; we must improve our road conditions; and we must address the problem of young drivers. Many surveys highlight the risk factors involved. I imagine that if a study was undertaken to ascertain when young people are primarily at risk it would be found to be between midnight and 4 a.m. coming home from social events. In my experience except around Christmas time one is rarely stopped in those hours particularly in rural areas. We have all had the experience of picking up a Sunday morning newspaper to read about three or four people killed in a huge accident. In the interests of humanity, and especially our young people, leaving aside insurance costs, it is about time we got tough.</P>
    <P>I suggest that in cases of accidents where no criminal proceedings are taken by the Garda Síochána, that we examine the question of &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; insurance. I refer to smashes where it is very hard to determine who hit who. We get into long legal wrangles as to who is going to mend whose car which seems to be a ridiculous waste of resources, of time and a ridiculous additional cost, particularly where there are no personal injuries. Those who go out on the road, allowing that there is no criminal negligence on the part of either driver, take a risk like going out on a football or hurling pitch that they might be involved in an accident and they should be insured to cover that risk. If one reduces the cost of insurance, one also reduces the cost of comprehensive policies which cover that risk. Some new insurance policies allow one cover on the basis that a &ldquo;no claims&rdquo; bonus is not affected by accidents not involving personal injury.</P>
    <P>Uninsured driving, if we are honest <Col N="931" /> with ourselves, persists because we do not have the willpower to stop it. It is impossible to tax a car in this country without a valid insurance certificate. With modern computer technology it is possible for the authorities to print out a complete list of untaxed cars on the day after tax lapses. I know that, technically speaking, one could have an uninsured driver in a taxed car where there would be insurance but that means narrowing the angle very much. Untaxed cars should be taken off the road because of the high risk that their drivers are also uninsured. If we want to reduce the cost of insurance we will have to take tough measures. Senator McGowan has pointed out that Northern Ireland enjoys low insurance costs but they do not have a similar level of insurance abuse. I favour assessment in cases where there is no criminal liability.</P>
    <P>We also need to be honest about the payments system. Medical costs should be covered by an initial deposit and then by continuing payment as costs occur. A deposit would ensure that no out of pocket expenses accrued to the person making the claim. Loss of wages should be paid on an ongoing basis and not in a lump sum. It is not fair to the person getting the award because it is a temptation to spend money they might need in later life in cases of a serious accident, and it is also impossible to determine what loss of wages a person is going to incur as time goes on.</P>
    <P>We should face up to the fact that no money is going to compensate for pain and suffering. Over-compensation in monetary terms is only pushing up the price of insurance and making it more difficult for some people to get insurance at all. There should be standardised payments here as in other countries for pain and suffering and these should be pitched at a reasonable level.</P>
    <P>I would like to go on to the question of employers' liability insurance. As an employer I know that the cost of this <Col N="932" /> form of insurance is astronomical. There is a common perception that no matter how somebody gets injured in the work-place the responsibility falls on the employer. That is not so and negligence has to be proved. It is about time that employers' liability insurance became mandatory. However, to compensate for the cost involved I feel that unless an employer can prove total negligence on the part of the employee compensation should be paid which is the <i>de facto</i> if not the <i>de jure</i> situation at present. The dispute is taken out of the court, put into the hands of assessors and people are paid on the scale I mentioned.</P>
    <P>As an employer I think the next measure would bring down the cost of employment insurance. In high risk industries, particularly, careless employers are being subsidised by careful operators applying factory law correctly. Similar to the situation pertaining to lifts, cranes and hydraulics, every employer should have to get from his insurance company an annual certificate to display on his premises saying that his premises had been examined and that they conformed to the various factory inspection Acts. A factory inspector could check the book and ascertain that the insurance company were happy that all reasonable care was being taken to ensure worker safety. This would eliminate many work-place accidents and reduce the cost of employers' liability insurance considerably.</P>
    <P>We also have to look at the question of liabilities in such places as playgrounds. It is becoming impossible for schools, county councils etc. to provide facilities for young people. The concept of &ldquo;own risk&rdquo; seems not to exist at all and, consequently, many good and useful activities for young people are being discontinued because it is impossible to insure the risk.</P>
    <P>When it is quite clearly stated that people are doing things at their own risk that concept should be accepted and, therefore, no loss should be incurred <Col N="933" /> unless one could prove seriously defective equipment, etc. Furthermore, the idea that one could have a playground with a fence around it and a gate on it and that somebody getting into that playground at night could make the owners liable for their injury makes a farce of the notion &ldquo;taking reasonable precaution.&rdquo; In public parks etc., which are properly maintained with reasonable supervision the concept of &ldquo;own risk&rdquo; should apply and people should be encouraged to take out cheap insurance in the form of personal accident policies for themselves and their children to cover the type of risk involved there.</P>
    <P>It is about time we took practical steps to reduce the cost of insurance. This time a deal should be done with insurance companies before any changes are made to guarantee that certain Governmental changes which would reduce the cost of claims, of processing claims, of law, etc. should be followed immediately by reductions in the costs of premia. If people could see both things happening simultaneously they would accept a tightening up of the enforcement system which tends to operate very loosely in this country. We need application of the law, fitting compensation to damage and a new attitude towards insurance claims, etc.</P>

      <P>Before Senator Mooney starts I would like to extend a very warm welcome to the new Minister for Education, Deputy Davern, and wish him every good luck in his new post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a singular honour for this House and for me personally that the Minister for Education, Deputy Noel Davern, has graced the Chamber on this his first occasion as our new Minister. May I echo the sentiments expressed by the Chair, not only on our behalf but on behalf of all Members of this House, in wishing him well in his new brief and say that it is a long overdue recognition of his undoubted talents.</P>
      <P>I am especially grateful because the issue I have raised on the Adjournment this evening centres around a problem which, sadly, is an ever growing one. It is not simply a matter of teachers being replaced or being taken off the staff roll, but it is indicative of the demographic trends which increasingly show that major shifts are taking place throughout our rural communities, especially in the west of Ireland and specifically in Drumshanbo, County Leitrim, which this motion addresses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very briefly, the background to my motion is that in the last 12 months the school population of the central school in Drumshanbo has declined. As a result one of the teachers on that school roll has been put on the diocesan panel. This teacher was informed by the board of management during the summer, as a result of a communication from the Department of Education, that she should not be appointed to a teaching position for the new terms as it was likely that she would be appointed to another position in another location. As a result of this directive the teacher was assigned to other duties within the school; but <Col N="935" /> inevitably, as happens in all rural communities, she was visible in the school and was involved in teaching duties. In the last two weeks she has left the school and has been placed on the diocesan panel, much to the disappointment, if one could use that phrase, not only of the pupils and teaching staff but of the parents.</P>
    <P>It is as a result of this action that I, in my capacity as both a member of Leitrim County Council and as a Member of Seanad Éireann, have received substantial numbers of representations from concerned parents in my area who cannot understand that a teacher would be, so suddenly as they preceive it, removed from a teaching post in her home town out of the school and out of the area to the detriment of the remaining children.</P>
    <P>However, that is only half the story. As a result of this continuing decline &mdash; and I am sure the Minister will be outlining the facts in greater detail &mdash; another teacher looks likely to be placed on the diocesan panel at the end of the current school year. That means that in a small area two of our best teachers &mdash; without casting any reflection whatsoever on the others indeed, they are all excellent teachers &mdash; will have been removed from the school and will be teaching outside the area. Both individuals &mdash; the young lady who has left and the gentleman who is now threatened with departure &mdash; have been heavily involved in extra curricular activities in the Drumshanbo area. In the case of the lady teacher, she is an exceptionally gifted young lady and not only renowned for her teaching talents but also for her musical gifts. She has been responsible for setting up and maintaining school choirs in the area &mdash; the resumption of such after a lapse of several decades &mdash; and is widely renowned outside her own area.</P>
    <P>In the case of the gentleman who is shortly to be threatened with moving on to the panel, he is heavily involved in the GAA, both at local and county levels, specifically encouraging and coaching under-age children. The Minister, <Col N="936" /> coming from a rural area, County Tipperary, will, I am sure, recognise the symptoms. I wish that both of us could have a solution that would be acceptable. I understand it is the system, but it does not make it any more palatable.</P>
    <P>I feel that I should put on record, if not a short term solution at least an analysis of current policy, and that the Department might adopt a more flexible policy in rural areas where population decline is now getting out of control. If you pursue Department policy as currently laid down to its logical conclusion, then entire communities will become educationally extinct. The primary school will follow the railway, the post office, the Garda station and local services such as the watchmaker, the baker, the shoemaker, the carpenter &mdash; in fact, the end of a heretofore identifiable and viable community.</P>
    <P>It is universally accepted that class sizes are too large. In that context I commend the Government in their determination to reduce the pupil/teacher ratio but surely the area from which I come deserves better. The west of Ireland has many natural disadvantages, yet traditionally the overwhelming desire has been for more and better educated citizens. Indeed, in my own county of Leitrim, along with, I think, Donegal and Kerry, they have the highest <i>per capita</i> entry into third level education.</P>
    <P>Why then should we suffer because successive Governments since the foundation of the State have for one reason or another failed to stimulate the local economy? This is what is happening. In Drumshanbo since 1986 we have lost over 200 industrial manufacturing jobs in an area which would be nationally perceived as a rural area, not an industrial heartland. A shoe factory employing 100 is gone; a coal mine employing 200, of which 25 per cent came from the immediate Drumshanbo area is gone; Laird's jam factory, nationally and internationally known and which at its peak employed over 90 male and female employees, is gone. Now our central <Col N="937" /> school, the jewel of our community, is on the slippery slope to eventual extinction.</P>
    <P>I refuse to accept that any Minister in this Government would knowingly and consciously condone such a policy, and I do not believe they do. I believe that the system is there and has to be worked, that there must be some order. I accept that, but I would respectfully request that the Minister look at the overall policy for rural schools in the context of what is happening around the country. It is no longer acceptable to hide behind a system that has existed with minimal change for over 40 years.</P>
    <P>The panel system has worked well and, as I said, we must have some order. But demographic trends, as I said at the outset of my address, strongly indicate that there is a continuing population shift. Communities are no longer as secure or as confident as they used to be. This is because of economic changes, changes in economic emphasis. One has only to look at the east coast and see the gradual but perceptible move towards more and more people living on the east coast rather than on the west. I am only a small voice calling attention to a very large problem and, in the major debate about education in general, seeking the possibility that perhaps there could be a reappraisal.</P>
    <P>The system as it currently works means that if numbers decline in a school that school loses its staff. I have already attempted to suggest that there is a continuing shift and that this is now moving much more perceptibly than heretofore. Because the world has got much smaller, people are more inclined to travel, whereas before they tended to stay in their own communities.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is the backbone of our economy and the area I come from was traditionally agricultural in that most of the income was derived from people who worked on the land &mdash; bad as it was &mdash; and supplemented it by part-time off-farm employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="938" /> What I believe will happen in Drumshanbo &mdash; and all the Drumshanbos of Ireland &mdash; is that, unless there is an improvement in the economic situation, on the jobs front and on the industrial front, we will be left with a professional or quasi-professional yuppy generation, the people who can afford to stay because those who cannot will leave, and take their children with them &mdash; our future generations.</P>
    <P>I did not expect the Minister to come into the House tonight and give me an answer to the problems of Drumshanbo. But because of the difficulties my community are facing, and in particular because of the loss from the Central school of two brilliant teachers, who have been making and continue to make a major contribution to the development and well being of the community, I could not let the occasion pass without at least shouting a protest, if not &mdash; to paraphrase John Healy &mdash; shouting stop. Perhaps this contribution and the Minister's fresh thinking in the Department of Education might lead to a reappraisal of the system and we could at least stabilise the communities in which we live rather than looking over our shoulder and asking how many more teachers will be gone next year; how many fewer children will be going to our schools next year; how long more will our community exist?</P>

      <P>I start off a Leas-Chathaoirleach, by saying a very sincere thank you to you and Senator Mooney for welcoming me to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year. This is in accordance with the agreement on staffing made between the Government and the INTO under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> In the case of Drumshambo central national school the enrolment of 250 pupils on 30 September 1990, warrants a staff of a principal plus seven assistants for the <Col N="939" /> 1991-92 school year. The school will also have the service of a full-time remedial teacher.</P>
    <P>The post of the eighth assistant was discontinued with effect from 31 August 1991. The most junior assistant in the school was given the option of having her name placed on the diocesan panel for redeployment to another national school in the Diocese of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise from 1 September 1991. The post of the eighth assistant was discontinued due to falling enrolments, the school having required an enrolment of at least 267 on 30 September 1990, in order to retain the post for the 1991-92 school year.</P>
    <P>This teacher opted to have her name placed on the panel and was included on the panel list issued to the diocesan education secretary in April 1991. She was available for redeployment to any national school in the diocese where a vacancy arose with effect from 1 September 1991. Under the panel regulations a teacher who has his/her name placed on the panel will continue to serve in their own school after 1 September in a supernumerary capacity until they receive an offer of a post in another school in the diocese which they are obliged to accept. A teacher may refuse a post if the distance between his/her school and the school offering a post is in excess of 45 kilometers. The teacher in question was offered a post at St. Emer's national school in Templemichael, County Longford and, having accepted the offer, took up duty there on 4 November 1991.</P>
    <P>The regulations governing the operation of the panel were notified to the boards of management by means of circular 15/91 in March 1991. I can give a copy to the Senator later. The chairperson of the board of management was <Col N="940" /> requested by letter dated 14 June 1991, to ensure that the teacher was not assigned a class in September 1991 as this could lead to disruption when she eventually was redeployed to another school. It was suggested as an alternative arrangement the teacher should be used as a resource teacher to assist with individual pupils or groups of pupils or to support other class teachers.</P>
    <P>The Department have received no communication from the board of management regarding the retention of the post of the eighth assistant. It appears that the school is not in breach of the guidelines on maximum class sizes as laid down in circular 23/88. That circular set out the following maximum class sizes guidelines: 39 in the case of a single class group; 38 in the case of a class group with two consecutive grades; and 35 in the case of a multigrade class group. I would like to say to Senator Mooney that I have every sympathy with the case he is making. I am well aware that the depopulation of rural areas has caused hardship there. If I can find any flexibility in the Department to deal with that, not just for Drumshanbo but for many other rural areas &mdash; with crtain cash backing, of course &mdash; we will find it and see what we can do. Be assured of a sympathetic hearing on it.</P>

      <P>May I very briefly thank the Minister for his detailed reply. It is what I would have expected from a man of his experience. I was particularly gratified by his closing remarks because this confirms the confidence that all of us have in his ability to understand the difficulties facing people in rural areas. Once again I thank him most sincerely for his presence here in the House and wish him well.</P>
