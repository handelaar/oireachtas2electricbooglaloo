      <P>I have notice from Senator Mooney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to outline the reasons Wingrove Foods Ltd., Drumshanbo, County Leitrim, has been refused capital grant aid by the Industrial Development Authority, despite the fact that they are constructing a £300,000 mineral water production factory in Drumshanbo and are promoting employment in a economically depressed area.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Mooney as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>It is intended to take all Stages of Item No. 2 on the Order Paper, the Temple Bar Area Renewal and Development Bill, 1991, from now until not later than 6 p.m. There will be a sos from 6 until 6.30 p.m. and at 6.30 p.m. we will take all stages of the Courts (No. 2) Bill, 1991 until 10 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there has been a tightening up of the rules governing good wishes on the Order of Business but I think it would be appropriate to congratulate Senator Conroy on his election as Cathaoirleach of Dún Laoghaire Corporation last evening and also to congratulate former Senator Dino Cregan on his election as Lord Mayor of Cork.</P>
      <P>I would like to raise a matter which was raised by one of my colleagues a few weeks ago.  Almost every day now we see investment brokerages and houses collapsing with large numbers of small investors left totally unprotected.  There have been four or five such cases over the past number of weeks and more are rumoured.  It is clear that the law in this area is totally inadequate.  The Fraud Squad is not up to doing the job required of it because of lack of resources and I would like to ask the Leader of the House if, before the end of this session, he would devote a short time to discussion on what has become a matter of great concern especially in view of the large number of vulnerable, unprotected people who have lost their life savings over the past couple of weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I, too, extend my congratulations to our colleague, Senator Conroy, and all the other people who were elected Mayors of the various cities particularly some of my own colleagues in the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he would indicate when the Seanad will rise and what legislation it is proposed to take before the end of this session.  I appeal to him to reconsider his attitude in relation to the request for a debate on the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House provide time to discuss the new 1991 colleges Bill in view of the widespread concern that legislation is causing in areas where there are regional colleges? My county is particularly concerned because it would mean that the courses for colleges would be selected in Dublin and that would be totally unacceptable. It would remove the democracy <Col N="1335" /> that exists in the administration, selection of management and the selection of courses.  The Bill would be totally unacceptable if it were introduced in the form in which it is being circulated.  I ask the Leader of the House, before we have a confrontation, before we have serious conflict between rural areas that have colleges and the administration in the Department of Education, that time be provided in this House so that we can have a reasonable and rational debate on that new legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House, in view of the collapse in farm incomes and the crisis in the area of agriculture, the lack of confidence in the future on the part of farmers and the imminent loss of jobs in the food industry, to ensure that a debate takes place on agriculture and on the crisis in farm incomes before the end of this session.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to ask the Leader of the House the same question. As there is a debate on the reform of the CAP in the other House, would he not consider having a debate on the CAP reform in this House?  This is very important and there is a crying need for it.  On Thursday, 20 June, there was a debate here on developments in the European Community and it was adjourned.  Is it the intention to resume that debate before the end of this session?  I would appeal for a debate on the suggested reform of the CAP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate Senator Conroy on his election as Cathaoirleach of Dún Laoghaire Corporation. I am sure, knowing his sterling performance here, that he will do an excellent job in that post.  I would also like to congratulate my colleagues, Deputy Kemmy on his election as Mayor of Limerick and Seán Kenny on his election to the Lord Mayoralty of Dublin.  If anybody is interested in getting a copy of the civic charter which has been devised for the good civic government of Dublin over the next five years, I have plenty of <Col N="1336" /> copies and I will make them available to the Seanad.  In view of the absolutely alarming unemployment figures &mdash; we have the highest unemployment figures in the history of the State &mdash; we should have an urgent debate on unemployment and the economy.  Will the Leader of the House facilitate us in doing that at a very early stage?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible to have a debate on the situation as it affects those suffering from a disability?  I had a letter this morning from a little girl in Waterford who, like myself, lost her hand recently.  Unfortunately, as I know too well, when it comes to looking for motor car insurance she is classed as disabled, but when she goes looking for mobility allowance, she is not classed as disabled. If she is looking for a job she is not classed as disabled.  There seems to be a grey area there.  I would like to have a debate on that to have that grey area cleared up.  It is grossly unfair.  Either you are disabled or you are not.  When it came to looking for a job she was not disabled. Yet, she had to buy a special car, and all the fittings that go with it, but she did not qualify for any assistance towards the purchase of the car.  This is a grey area. People who are industrious and want to make light of their handicap are not getting the assistance they should get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House his intentions concerning item No. 1, the Altamont (Amendment of Deed of Trust) Bill, 1990.  I would like to remind him that he promised before last Christmas that the matter would be dealt with between Christmas and Easter, and subsequently that it would be dealt with during this session.  It must be dealt with next week if it is to be dealt with before the summer recess and if we are to retain credibility on this issue, it has to be dealt with next week.  I would welcome confirmation that that will be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with my colleagues in congratulating Senator Conroy on being elected Cathaoirleach of Dún Laoghaire <Col N="1337" /> Corporation.  I know he will do a very good and balanced job there.</P>
    <P>Finally, I ask the Leader of the House to make a statement concerning a foreign affairs committee which some months ago we were told would be formed, apparently comprising Members of both Houses.  Subsequently we heard stories, which seemed to have some authority, that the Taoiseach does not now intend to agree to the establishment of such a committee.  I would like the Leader of the House to let us know what information he has in relation to that issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put it to the Leader of the House that we have abhorred unemployment long enough but we seem to be embracing it now rather than abhorring it.  I plead with the Leader of the House that if there is to be a debate on the job situation it should be called job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the votes of congratulations to those who have been elected chairman or mayor, particularly to any Member of this House who has been elected.  I congratulate Senator Conroy who has been elected Cathaoirleach of Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  I am not sure if other Members were successful but if they were I would like to congratulate them.  It gave me great satisfaction to see Alderman Jim Kemmy being elected Mayor of Limerick. He has always held fast to his beliefs.  He is staunch in his views and has never wavered.  People disagree with me. and I disagree with them but I always admire people of conviction.  As regards the offer from Senator Costello of a copy of the civic charter, I certainly would like a copy of it before they tear it up.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Manning, for his very kind, gracious and much appreciated good wishes, and also Senators Upton, Costello, Staunton, Hanafin and others.  I would like also to express my good wishes and congratulations to Deputy Kemmy and Senator Cregan and express the hope that it will <Col N="1338" /> be possible on some future occasion to reciprocate some of these good wishes to colleagues on both sides of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with other speakers in congratulating Senator Conroy and, indeed, the other Mayors and Lord Mayors who have been elected.  Now that they have been elected and congratulated will the Minister for the Environment and the Government think about giving them some powers and powers to local councils also?  In reply to Senator Hanafin, what has been wrong with this city for the last six years is that people like himself in Fianna Fáil have been running it, tearing up documents and paying no attention to those who have some ideas about the city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised a matter relating to banks in general last week and this week I wish to raise a question in relation to the Central Bank, the cutting of interest rates and the fact that neither the Minister, this House nor anybody has any say in the reduction of interest rates given the low inflation rates at present and the detrimental effect high interest rates have on employment creation.  I also asked a question in connection with bank charges in general.  We have had something like a 70 per cent increase in such charges. Finally, I asked the Leader of the House about the interview charge introduced which, in my view, would bring into that <Col N="1339" /> bank about £200,000 per week in interview charges alone.  I raised this matter previously on the Adjournment and was informed on that occasion that there was no ministerial responsibility.  This is an extremely important matter.  People are being overcharged, employment is being affected and small businesses are being ruined.  It seems unbelievable that this House cannot debate these particular issues.  I ask the Leader of the House, given those facts, to allow time for a special debate on these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to extend congratulations to Senator Conroy and also to Deputy Kemmy. Regardless of political persuasions everyone in Limerick was exceptionally pleased with the selection of Deputy Kemmy as Mayor.  I would like to add my voice to the voices of those who have looked for a debate on agriculture.  I hope that next week we will have statements on agriculture.  Many people have mentioned a debate on unemployment.  If agriculture is in such bad shape, we will find that unemployment figure will not just be 300,000 &mdash; which is a legitimate figure &mdash; but much greater.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I hope that before this session ends the Leader will come back with concrete proposals for the extension of Seanad voting rights to the graduates of all third level institutions, particularly Dublin City University and the University of Limerick.  It is extraordinary that I have to stand up here month after month looking for this.  I want to know whether it is feasible and if the Leader does not have a reply to day I hope he will have a reply before the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support my colleague from Cork, Senator O'Keeffe, on the question of the banks, the banking system, their profits, our low inflation rate, our high interest rates, our serious unemployment situation and our agricultural crisis.  They are all locked together in a situation that is causing grave problems for all shopkeepers, workers and everyone.  The Minister for <Col N="1340" /> Finance and the Central Bank have a vital role to play in this matter.  The banks seem to be running this country and making big profits and the rest of the country is suffering.  I fully support Senator O'Keeffe because there is need for this Government to make a strong stand on the banks and their vicious control and grip on the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the calls for a debate on agriculture, I would like to point out that independent economists have put the figure of nearly 40,000 on the jobs to be lost as a direct consequence of the proposed reform of the CAP as it now stands.  I also support Senator Manning's call for better protection of the small investor.  I raised this matter here some weeks ago and got very little satisfaction.  I believe the situation has now reached serious proportions and it is entirely irresponsible to stand idly by while old people lose their entire life savings as a result of not having adequate legislation and protection for them.</P>
      <P>Finally, in relation to the banks, interest rates and the economy as a whole deserve a good debate.  The economy is in serious trouble whether we like it or not and that is reflected in our unemployment figures which are rising and will continue to rise for some time.  I like Senator Harte's positive approach to unemployment, to talk of job creation rather than unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was most distressed to read in the paper of your accident, a Chathaoirligh, and I am delighted to see you back, hale and hearty.  I am prompted to say this by the fact that I note Senator Honan is missing and I hope there is nothing wrong with her today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to congratulate all the councillors who have been elected Mayor of the various cities and in particular Senator Conroy &mdash; one of our own &mdash; on his election last evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning raised a question, as did Senator Raftery &mdash; and he also mentioned it some weeks ago &mdash; in relation to problems in the insurance industry. <Col N="1341" /> While I accept fully what Senator Manning and Senator Raftery have said, that it is disgraceful that this behaviour should be allowed, the fact is that two years ago we had an Insurance Bill which was regarded at the time as being the most important legislation dealing with the insurance industry for some 50 years.  It specifically referred to the regulation of intermediaries whereby they now must have consumer bonds and professional indemnity bonds and all other important matters which are relevant to the kind of situation that has been referred to this morning.  I would simply say that obviously anyone who invests with insurance brokers or investment brokers should be sure of the people with whom they are investing.  Obviously the Insurance Bill is there as some form of protection if something goes wrong.  While I accept fully it is a very important matter I cannot say at this point that I will agree to a debate on it.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton asked when it is proposed that the House will rise.  My intention is that we would conclude our business next week, possibly Wednesday. He also asked for a debate on the economy and other matters.  At this point, while I am not confirming that will happen, I will examine the matter and talk to the Whips.  The same applies to a debate on unemployment or job creation and also a debate on agriculture.  They will not take place this week.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello asked for a debate on unemployment and Senator Farrell raised a question which might be more suitable as a matter for the Adjournment. I agree with the point made by Senator Staunton and I will talk to the Whips regarding item No. 1.  I am anxious to move it on if at all possible.  We will see what we can do.  I have no further comment to make on the question of the formation of a foreign affairs committee.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan raised the question of the regional colleges Bill.  The information I have in regard to this matter is that the regime on the boards of management in RTCs will finish soon.  It is proposed.  I understand, that a new temporary, interim board will be set up by <Col N="1342" /> each of the RTCs until such time as the legislation has been put in place and that, I understand, will be early next year. Then when the legislation is passed new permanent boards will be put in place.</P>
    <P>As I said to Senator Neville and Senator Kiely, I have no proposals for a debate on agriculture.  Senator Harte also asked about a debate on job creation.  At this point I have no proposals in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Keeffe and Senator Ryan asked about bank charges, bank interest and banks generally.  Again, I have to say a debate on that topic will not take place in this session.  I said this is a matter which is appropriate to an Adjournment debate and Senator O'Keeffe replied he had tried to raise the matter in that form. Obviously it is suitable for discussion on the Finance Bill or on the Appropriation Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman asked about a debate on agriculture.  I have no proposals in that regard.  Senator Raftery commented on this matter.  Senator Lydon's comment was an expression of goodwill to the Cathaoirleach with which we all agree.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Temple Bar Area Renewal and Development Bill, 1991: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has seven important purposes: to establish, on a statutory basis, Temple Bar Renewal Limited as the company to approve projects for incentives as provided for in the Finance Act, 1991, and to provide that the company shall lay their decisions on the approval of development proposals before both Houses of the Oireachtas for their information; to establish on a statutory basis Temple Bar Properties Limited as the company to implement the development of Temple Bar on behalf of the Government; to provide that the Minister for Finance may guarantee the borrowings <Col N="1343" /> of Temple Bar Properties Limited; to provide that Temple Bar Renewal and Properties Limited will be subject to public service pay guidelines; to provide that tenants in Temple Bar may not assign, sublet or share possession without the prior consent in writing of Temple Bar Properties Limited; to provide for powers of compulsory purchase in the Temple Bar area to Temple Bar Properties Limited; and to provide for the exemption of Temple Bar Properties Limited from stamp duty in relation to the properties they acquire in the Temple Bar area.</P>
      <P>These provisions together with the relevant incentives provided in this year's Finance Act are the basis for a major cultural and tourism development in this our capital city of Dublin.</P>
      <P>Temple Bar combines a strong cultural heritage, especially from Viking and early Christian times, with a strong modern sense of place.  This unique combination make the Temple Bar area ideal for a development that will build on what is already happening there and create a renewed area to attract many people both from Ireland and from abroad to visit, to work in and to live in.  In the renewed area the historical traditions will be interpreted in an authentic yet appealing way to mix with the development of the cultural themes already present in Temple Bar especially of theatre, music, film, visual and graphic art and sculpture.  The renewed area will overlay this with its bustling character especially of its restaurants and second hand shops.  The total mix will have undoubted appeal in generating many extra visitors both Irish and foreign.</P>
      <P>In Ireland we export £700 million out of a population of 3.5 million people in tourism revenue while inward revenue from the rest of the world is £1,000 million. There is, therefore, vast potential to accelerate the numbers of tourists, and the revenue arising, coming to Ireland. This is a prime focus of current Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland offers a unique experience to visitors in terms of heritage and culture <Col N="1344" /> and it is the policy of this Government to promote activities which will enhance our environment and extend a wider knowledge of our culture to overseas visitors in particular.</P>
    <P>This is the policy that is being pursued in the Temple Bar area.  Economic investment by way of tax incentives have been provided in this year's Finance Act, for the reconstruction and refurbishment of buildings in the Temple Bar area.</P>
    <P>In this way the area will be a showcase, both nationally and internationally to indicate the great potential for inner city renewal where there is a cohesive plan, supported by Government, city planners and the people from the area itself.</P>
    <P>The Temple Bar area has spontaneously become a cultural &ldquo;village&rdquo; within the city.  There already exists a vibrant intertrading and interdependence among the tenants involving artists, traders, restaurateurs, musicians, business people, publicans and residents.  These activities will be nurtured by the Temple Bar companies.  Cultural activities which would not in the normal course be fully economically viable, will be supported by subsidised rents.</P>
    <P>As a place to visit, Temple Bar is and will continue to be crucially about the people who work and live in it.  The success of the renewal of the area is critically dependent on keeping and developing its existing character.  The work of Temple Bar Development Council has been a major significance in this process.  The Taoiseach and the Government intend that the consultation and involvement of the people of Temple Bar will continue as a key part of the development process.</P>
    <P>I want today to dispel a number of myths which Opposition speakers have attempted to promulgate about the Temple Bar development.  They have argued that there is something unusual in the Taoiseach's involvement in the project. This is, in fact, perfectly straightforward. The Taoiseach is the leader of the Government and is the Minister with responsibility for cultural affairs.  In that capacity he has responsibility, for example, for the National Museum, National Library, National Gallery and <Col N="1345" /> the recently opened and widely praised Museum of Modern Art.  To ensure that this perfectly straightforward process is clearly seen to work in practice the Bill before us today contains a series of provisions to ensure that the development of the Temple Bar area is, and is seen to be, fully transparent and accountable.  The accountability and transparency of the renewal of Temple Bar will be underpinned in particular by the facts that the decisions of Temple Bar Renewal Limited will be laid before the Oireachtas, the borrowings of Temple Bar Properties Limited will be authorised by the Minister for Finance who will inform the Oireachtas of the outcome and the operation of Temple Bar Properties Limited will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General whose report will again come before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I want to underline that the Minister for Finance, his Department and the Revenue Commissioners will act fully in the normal way in relation to the Temple Bar companies.  The role of the Revenue Commissioners is particularly important because it is they and they alone who will decide what specific expenditure qualifies for tax allowances in every case.</P>
    <P>I believe these key aspects of the development will provide ample opportunity for all in the Houses of the Oireachtas to be fully satisfied that Temple Bar is being developed as it should be.</P>
    <P>Opposition speakers have argued that, in some way, the powers of Dublin Corporation are reduced in the case of Temple Bar.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The approach adopted by the Taoiseach and Government to the development of Temple Bar is to provide for a unique three-way development partnership of the local community, Temple Bar Development Council, the local authority, Dublin Corporation, and the central authorities, the Departments of the Taoiseach, the Environment, Communications, Tourism and Transport, Bord Fáilte and FÁS.  All are involved in the development process <Col N="1346" /> which the Bill underpins.  This partnership of local community, local authority and central Government is one which draws together the key actors in development and has widespread constructive application right across the board.  The Government and the social partners have used the same approach in the new area based response to unemployment.</P>
    <P>I am happy to take this opportunity to wish the new Lord Mayor of Dublin, Alderman Seán Kenny, well for the year ahead.  As the Lord Mayor of the day, he will be Chairman of Temple Bar Renewal Limited.  I am confident he will oversee a major part of the Temple Bar development in the year before us.</P>
    <P>Other myths that the Opposition have attempted to put abroad are that there will be widespread windfall profits in the Temple Bar development, that CIE will lose out in the disposal of the property they own in the area and that there is something unusual in two companies being involved in the Temple Bar renewal.</P>
    <P>The reality of the renewal of Temple Bar is that it will be essential that rents be low in many cases.  That is the nature of the activities that are the heart of Temple Bar.  To the extent that profits are made these will be reinvested by Temple Bar Properties Limited in the overall development.  The keynote of the renewal will be small scale and this does not and will not lend itself to major windfall profits.</P>
    <P>CIE will be fully compensated for their property holding in Temple Bar.  An independent valuer was agreed by CIE for this process.  He has made the necessary valuation.  It comes to almost £4 million.  This will be paid to CIE very shortly after this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>The need for two companies in developing Temple Bar stems from the need to separate decisions on the activities to benefit from incentives from the implementation of the development.  The renewal company will be responsible for the first policy function, the properties company for the implementation function. The companies will operate at arms <Col N="1347" /> length.  I understand, for example, that directors of the renewal company involved in particular projects will not, as is normal, participate in the discussion of incentive issues in those cases.  This will apply to projects coming from the properties company and to any other cases arising.</P>
    <P>I trust that what I have said makes clear that the essential development of Temple Bar is one in which significant imagination will be necessary to achieve a development in sympathy with low cost but one which, if successful, will undoubtedly bring many extra visitors to the area, our capital city and ultimately, our beloved country.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Members of this House will make their usual positive contributions on the important provisions before us in this Bill.  In that way we can all contribute to the partnership that is at the heart of the renewal and development of this unique and historic area of Temple Bar in the heart of our great capital city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  He has been here wearing so many different hats over the past year that he has almost become a permanent fixture but he is always welcome.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in principle and indeed in much of its substance but I still have a few small reservations in spite of what the Minister said and in spite of the fact that he has met very fully many of the objections which were raised in the other House.</P>
      <P>I do not have to say that Dublin, probably more than any other capital city in Europe, has suffered over the past 30 or 40 years from dereliction, neglect, exploitation and lack of civic leadership.  The quays are still in a scandalous state.  There is no coherent plan for the redevelopment of the quays.  Large parts still constitute ugly eyesores.  It is not a part of Dublin of which one could be proud.  There are some disturbing questions to be raised about some of the redevelopment proposals and the way they are being carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1348" /> Parts of St. Stephen's Green still remain as a monument to the ignorance of the fifties and sixties which saw the destruction of what were called worthless gerry built Georgian buildings which were pulled down and replaced by building the fronts of which, in many cases, have not survived 20 or 25 years.  So much for the philosophy &mdash; if you want to call it that &mdash; of the sixties when to be a defender of Dublin's Georgian heritage was branded anti-national.  The parts of St. Stephen's Green where irresponsible damage was done remind us of how shortsighted so many of our policies were in this respect.</P>
    <P>Large parts of Mountjoy Square are derelict.  It must be a matter of astonishment to people who go to Croke Park to see derelict sites instead of a beautiful square which could have been one of the great attractions of Dublin.  They have been there not for five years or ten years but in some cases for 20 years.  Visitors see large holes in the facade of buildings, buildings which were started and never finished, and the general squalor which surrounds part of that area.  North Great George's Street, the home of so many writers, the home of John Dillon the last leader of the Irish Party and the home of one of our eminent Senators today, is a street which cries out for renewal.  So many parts of the inner city are crying out for renewal.  On the Adjournment some weeks ago I raised the question of the destruction, with the willing connivance of An Bord Pleanála, of a listed building in Kenilworth Square, another example of where the planning processes and procedures and, indeed, the planners themselves, have been active participants in the destruction of our city.</P>
    <P>One could travel around Dublin and pick out areas which have suffered over the past number of years from wilful run down, the exploitation of shortsighted developers and the absence of any real civic initiative to put things right.  This Bill will not receive a carping or a negative reaction from me.  I welcome this Bill wholeheartedly as the sort of thing our civil leaders and Government should be doing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1349" /> There has undoubtedly been a change for the better in the public attitude in recent years.  We see it in a whole range of areas.  We see it in the attitude of young people to the environment, partly I suspect because schools, national schools especially, place great emphasis on the environment, both the natural and built environment.  Young people have a much healthier sense of the need to protect what 15 years ago were crank issues; the ozone layer which we did not know about then, the birds, the countryside and the built environment of our town and cities. It would be naive to say that this change in the public attitude is universally accepted.  There is still need for constant vigilence to ensure that depredation does not take place.</P>
    <P>Over the years we have had great battles in Dublin Corporation between the engineers with their particular view of serving the city and the consequences of having that view implemented.  We need people who are a thorn in the side of the officials like Senator Hederman and some of the journalists who have taken up these issues over the years, organisations like An Taisce who have given a lead and are regarded by some people as unreasonable and as cranks.  I take a different view. Such people may not always be easy to live with but they have become a prime national asset in focusing attention and keeping the rest of us up to the mark on matters of this sort, even though the officials might take a different view of their activities.</P>
    <P>The Government have made three great mistakes with regard to the future of Dublin which will inflict long term damage on the development of Dublin. The first was the shortsighted abolition of the Dublin Transport Authority in 1987 &mdash; that was a Fianna Fáil Government and not the present happy arrangement. It was done, I believe, largely because the Government were involved in cost cutting and pruning and this was seen as some new quango which would simply be another layer of semi-State bureaucracy.  It was a dreadful mistake. It is very clear that the traffic in Dublin is chaotic.  Radical measures need to be <Col N="1350" /> taken and at the very least we need an overall co-ordinated transport policy involving rail, bus, roads and ports.  That is one mistake which could be remedied if the Government admitted that they were wrong to abolish the Dublin transport committee in 1987.</P>
    <P>The second big mistake was the abolition of the Metropolitan Streets Commission. This was an imaginative innovation.  It could have given a lead where frankly Dublin Corporation were not leading and where the Department of the Environment were not in a position to lead in the sense of making more habitable and acceptable the streetscape of Dublin.  The biggest mistake was referred to by Senator Hederman on the Order of Business this morning and that was the lost opportunity in the so called local government reform Bill which did not confer a tráithnín of extra powers on any of our local authorities.</P>
    <P>Frankly, the pious platitude this morning &mdash; it was the only one in his speech &mdash; from the Minister about the role of Dublin Corporation is not well placed. The corporation and the local authorities have been denied the power and funds which would make it possible for them to play a leading role in the type of renewal activity we all want.  If we take these three measures we can see how the Government have hindered the development and emergence of a strong sense of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Dublin has lost out over the years because of the failure to create a strong Dublin lobby, which would have its centre in the corporation and which would bring in the chambers of commerce, the trade unions and various groups and be as effective in putting the case of Dublin as groups like the midwestern group who defended their particular interests.  I hope that the new corporation, with or without the civic charter, will have as a priority, this sense of bringing together the great deal of goodwill and voluntary and professional expertise which exists in Dublin to put the case of Dublin more strongly in terms of getting its share of the national cake. Dublin, in many ways, is a more deprived <Col N="1351" /> region than other areas from which we hear the greatest number of complaints.</P>
    <P>The Minister stressed that one of the main objectives of this Bill is to restore the ambience and the elegance of a vital part of our city.  It is right that this should be done, but it is also important that it be done right.  We do not want to see something emerging which is prissy, dinky, contrived or elitist, something which Temple Bar never was.  What we want to see emerging is an authentic part of Dublin city life.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House of what Temple Bar was in 1850 and the sort of people who lived there who made this a vital thriving part of Dublin.  I have an excellent book, the reproduction of <i>The Dublin Pictorial Guide and Directory of 1850,</i> written by Henry Shaw, which was published recently, and, in fact, it has sadly been remaindered in one of our bookshops.  It is a book which I would recommend to anybody who is interested in Dublin.  It has the names of those who lived in Temple Bar and what they did in 1850.  It gives a flavour of Temple Bar as an authentic part of Dublin.  In No. 1 Temple Bar there was Andrew Kelly, a coal factor, in No. 2 Andrew Thompson, the bootmaker, Nos. 3 and 4 were vacant, in No. 5 was John M'Cormick, described as a nailer &mdash; I am not sure what that is. Then there was a dairy, a cork cutter, a tobacconist, a trimming shop, two barbers side by side, another dairy, a cabinet maker, a grocer, wine and spirits merchant, a provision dealer, a dispensary, a metal gilder, a soap manufacturer, another bootmaker, a baker, a provision dealer, a bookbinder, a clockmaker, grocery, a lodging house, Mr. Dignam, a cork cutter, a dairy, a provision dealer and another bootmaker.  Obviously there was great competition.  Upmarket in Nos. 41 and 42 we had Mr. M'Auley who was the hatter to His Excellency the Lord Lieutenant, and side by side with him was John Nowlan who was simply an ordinary hatter.  Then there was Joseph Baker who was a smith and bell ringer and, finally, there was the spirit stores and grocer. The Temple Bar area in 1850 was not <Col N="1352" /> elitist.  It was very much part of the authentic, thriving life of Dublin at that time with ordinary people doing ordinary jobs as part of the living city.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that Temple Bar, when established under this Bill, will be a home for ordinary people doing ordinary work in the ordinary way and part of the living life of this city.  We do not want anything which is elitist, yuppie, dinky, prissy or anything like that.  We want something that is real.</P>
    <P>A number of concerns with the Bill were raised in the other House.  One of them was in the area of planning.  In the other House, the Minister, when replying, indicated that the full planning regime of Dublin Corporation would apply in the case of Temple Bar.  That puts my fears at rest.  I use this occasion to make a point which I made previously, that is, the general lack of confidence not in the planning process in Dublin Corporation but in the behaviour of An Bord Pleanála, as regards their accountability, transparency and judgment.  It goes deeper than that and I want to put that once more on the record here today.</P>
    <P>The question of the transparency of the legislation, the role of the Taoiseach and the fact that in this case the legislation is bypassing what one would expect to be more appropriate to the Departments of the Environment and Finance was raised in the other House.  I listened to the Minister and read the other speeches very carefully.  I do not see anything odd or wrong in this.  It is perhaps unusual, although the Minister gave reasons why it was not unusual.  I do not see anything sinister in it and it should not be any great cause of concern to us.  We should take it as it is written.  The Minister spelled out the range of accounting procedures and devices which are involved in the legislation and I am happy to accept him at his word.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat concerned about what he had to say about CIE and the level of compensation.  The figures I have would place the amount expended by CIE far greater than £4 million and closer to £12 million.  The Minister says there has been an independent evaluation of that.  Will <Col N="1353" /> he assure us that CIE are happy with the figure?</P>
    <P>In welcoming this legislation I pay tribute to Senator Eoin Ryan who did a great deal of the pioneering work for this legislation as Chairman of the Planning Committee of the last Dublin Corporation.  It must be gratifying for him to see so much of his work coming to fruition today. I join with the Minister in welcoming Councillor Seán Kenny, the new Lord Mayor of Dublin, who will be chairman of this enterprise when it is set up.  I congratulate him on his election.  I have known Seán Kenny, who is a Galway man, for a very long time and nobody more deserves the honour of being first citizen of his adopted city.  I wish him every success both as Lord Mayor and in his role with regard to Temple Bar.  I wish this Bill a speedy passage and hope to see it in operation as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. S. Haughey Mr. S. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Manning in extending good wishes to Councillor Seán Kenny on his elevation to the position of first citizen of Dublin and wish him every success in his endeavours. I also wish him success as chairperson of one of the companies being established in the Seanad today.</P>
      <P>With respect, a Chathaoirligh, I think you gave Senator Manning a lot of latitude in his contribution.  Admittedly, it is a Second Stage speech but he roamed into many areas which have no real relevance to the Temple Bar area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We should welcome any discussion on the future of Dublin in the Seanad.  I am tempted to reply to some of the things the Senator said but as they are not relevant to the Bill I will let them pass for the moment.  No doubt there will be great battles fought in the city council in the weeks and months ahead in relation to many of these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Temple Bar Area Renewal and Development Bill.  It is an innovative Bill.  The Temple Bar project <Col N="1354" /> is one of the most exciting and imaginative cultural projects to happen in Dublin for many years.  I pay particular tribute to the Taoiseach &mdash; if that is in order coming from me &mdash; and the Government for their political will in the matter and their willingness to grasp this major opportunity to develop a cultural and recreational centre in the heart of Dublin.  There were many reports circulating regarding the future development of the Temple Bar area but there was no political will forthcoming up to the last two or three years.  For several years many organisation, groups and individuals recognised that the Temple Bar area was something special and that it should be developed in a very special way.  However, nobody was sure of how to proceed.  The Government have now put a plan together.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that the initiative came from the many small artistic and cultural groups that had established themselves in the Temple Bar area.  If Senator Norris were here I am sure he would stress that point very strongly. There were many plans, reports and proposals brought forward on how to achieve the final objective but there was no agreement on how to proceed.  As Lord Mayor of Dublin I had the honour to chair a special Temple Bar development committee set up by the Government to make recommendations for the balanced development of the Temple Bar area and this committee reported in July 1991.  The Government are to be commended for the speed with which the recommendations in that report are now being acted upon.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to Senator Eoin Ryan as Chairman of the Planning Committee of Dublin Corporation for the role of the local authority in this project.  The Dublin 1991 flagship project is now up and running. I also pay tribute to many of the local organisations in the Temple Bar area such as the Temple Bar Development Council and the Temple Bar 1991 Committee. There are also many institutions who are worthy of praise including Dublin Corporation, Bord Fáilte, FÁS and the civil servants in the Department <Col N="1355" /> of the Taoiseach and other Departments including the Departments of the Environment and Tourism, Transport and Communications.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, the Temple Bar area is bounded by Dame Street, Anglesea Street, Bedford Row, the Quays and Parliament Street.  It is fast becoming one of the trendiest places in town.  There is a buzz and an atmosphere there.  Art and culture are flourishing; it is what one might term a cosmopolitan place.  It is vitally important, however, that this area is promoted in a balanced way.</P>
    <P>The aim of this Bill is to develop the area as a major cultural, tourism and recreational centre.  Restaurants, recording studios, galleries, discos, pubs, craft activities, theatres, film and recreational centres and, most important of all, a residential content will be encouraged.  A real community is being created and enhanced.  I agree with Senator Manning that nothing false should be created.  This should be a genuine and real community and the Bill will achieve that.  The approach outlined by the Minister is right for this area.</P>
    <P>The establishment of Temple Bar Renewal Limited as a supervisory body to determine appropriate standards of refurbishment and construction and the setting up of Temple Bar Properties Limited along with the incentives outlined in Chapter 7 of the Finance Act, 1991, will ensure the right type of development. The tax provisions, in particular, including double rent allowance, section 23 relief, 100 per cent allowance in respect of capital expenditure, the offsetting of refurbishment and conservation expenditure against all rental income, are imaginative and unique.  They are also very generous.  This is a unique urban renewal project.  Greater emphasis is being placed on conservation and refurbishment and that is important.  A residential content is also being encouraged and, in addition, a new infill development of vacant sites is being facilitated.</P>
    <P>This is a good package for the area involved.  Of major importance is the fact <Col N="1356" /> that this development will be an economic, viable and commercial project.  I cannot stress that enough.  It is very important.  If this is a unique project there will be many lessons to be learned from it.  What is important is that we are not creating a white elephant for the future.</P>
    <P>The project will be self-financing.  A real partnership will be formed between residents and traders based on sound economic values.  The great fear when the Temple Bar project was being examined was that art and culture could not pay its way, that massive ongoing Government financial support would be necessary, that it would be a drain on the finances of the State and so on.  That is not the case.  The project is based on viable economic principles.  It would seem, therefore, that art and culture can be viable and economic in a thriving, interdependent community between residents and traders.  That is why this project is unique and why this Government package is right.  Critics might say, and have said, that the financial incentives are far too generous to private enterprise and private developers.  The package is certainly generous but what were the alternatives? The alternatives, as I said, were massive grants and subsidies on an ongoing basis to artistic groups with no economic prospect of profitability whatsoever.  This is the best package.  The alternative of a drain on the resources of the State, more grants to the Arts Council and so on, would not be tolerated by the taxpayer.  Admittedly, grants, subsidies and so on, will be necessary, but the institutions involved in the development of the area must be supported.  The basics of the project are right in that economies and a sound trading economy in the area will ensure that the area is economically viable.</P>
    <P>It is important that the two companies involved ensure that the development will be alive not only during the day but also at night. One of the major problems with inner city life is that it closes down after 6 p.m.  We should ensure that this area is attractive and alive at night time. This is something the companies involved <Col N="1357" /> in the promotion of the area should look at.</P>
    <P>As a member of the City Council I would like to pay particular tribute to Dublin Corporation for their role in this initiative.  I was surprised to hear the Minister say that the fact that Dublin Corporation's powers were being reduced in relation to this project was criticised in the other House.  I do not see it that way.  Dublin Corporation personnel have been very much involved and supportive of every aspect of this project. The Lord Mayor, for once, has been given recognition by the fact that he or she will now be involved in this project, in something fundamental in his or her city.  There is an enhanced role for the Lord Mayor in this project and that is welcome.  The corporation are to be congratulated for formulating an action plan for the area.  They were working on an action plan for the development of the area long before it became fashionable to support the concept of the Temple Bar area.  They have put a great deal of money into the pedestrianisation of streets there, promoting cobble-stone streets and providing traditional street furniture. I welcome their role and hope it will continue in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Everybody here, I am sure, breathed a sigh of relief when they heard that the transportation centre, the CIE bus depot, was not to proceed in this locality.  The irony, however, is that if CIE had not been the tenants there for a number of years the new artistic centre could not have been achieved.  As many Senators already know, the fact that CIE are letting out premises there to artistic groups at very low rents ensured that an artistic life was created there.  Therefore, we should be grateful to CIE.  On the other hand, we are delighted they are not proceeding with their transportation centre. As I said earlier, public bodies have a major role to play now that the legislation is in place.  Bord Fáilte, in particular, should set about creating a major tourism centre in this locality, thus enhancing in every way the work of those two companies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1358" /> I am sure at this stage that the constitutional issues in relation to compulsory acquisition and the powers of the two companies involved have been dealt with.  However, I would like reassurance from the Minister that the so-called rights to private property in the Constitution will not be interfered with in any way and that there can be no constitutional challenges in the future.</P>
    <P>We need to examine how best the Temple Bar area should be developed in the future.  There is no doubt the Temple Bar area should be developed and enhanced as a cultural, tourism and recreation centre.  Overall, the development should operate on a commercial basis. The streetscape and building pattern of the Temple Bar area should be conserved. The buildings must also be conserved and refurbished.  That is what makes this project unique.  Traditionally, when dealing with inner city renewal and rejuvenation, we dealt with the demolition of buildings and the construction of new buildings.  This package and that announced in the Finance Act are very sensitive and I have no doubt will ensure that those buildings are conserved.  The existing buildings should be retained and sensitively refurbished.</P>
    <P>There are also some vacant sites in the locality and infill development is necessary but that, too is dealt with in the Finance Act and in the establishment of the two companies.  Of vital importance also is the need to ensure a residential content, the need to ensure an active, living community in the locality.  The package announced will ensure that but it should be kept constantly under review. People are now willing to move back into the centre city area but this must be encouraged and if the measures announced do not facilitate that, they should be reviewed.  However, I am confident that the residential nature of this project will be encouraged and enhanced. Existing tenants in the area should also be encouraged, consulted and should have a major role to play in the development of the area.</P>
    <P>This is a very exciting and unique project and I wish it every success.  I am <Col N="1359" /> delighted the Government have had the political will to get the project up and running.  They have consulted widely and there were many reports to consult.  The best of all possible recommendations have been brought together in legislation and have been given priority by the Government.  I have no doubt that this project will be exciting and successful and I wish everybody involved every success in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in welcoming the general thrust of this Bill as somebody who has long been interested in the city of Dublin, the conservation of its best features and the promotion of the idea of the living city.  My residents' association in Upper Leeson Street started about 23 or 24 years ago, and I am very heartened that that thrust of the idea of the living city is now gaining considerable momentum and that we are here today to talk about some aspects of it; part of what we are talking about is the idea of the living city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the area we are talking about appears on the back of our £10 note.  It shows the very old historic part of the city we are talking about, 17th Century, with the street patterns relatively the same as they were. During medieval times, during the Viking and Georgian period this part of the city was probably relatively unknown.  I was very impressed with Senator Manning's reference to the various inhabitants of that area and their activites.  It gave a clear picture of the sort of bustling mixed activities that took place there.  I had not thought of referring to that book, which indeed I have, and which gives one great amusement and entertainment.  I remember speaking to the proprietor of Read and Company Ltd., Cutlers, a shop in Parliament Street which is still there; although Mr. Read is still alive he is no longer running it.  When I was Lord Mayor, I visited him and he gave me a vivid description, very much borne out by Senator Manning's contribution, of the life he remembered 30 or 40 years ago in Parliament Street.  He rattled off <Col N="1360" /> to me what each shop and house was used for.  He described a sunny day when those who lived on the upper floors would come down to sit outside and women would do their knitting, children would play around on the footpaths and so on.  We are talking about an area that had a very exciting, bustling and busy life.  It is also an area which has a tremendous architectural wealth of interesting and varied buildings.</P>
    <P>Why has the area changed so much?  I totally disagree with Senator Haughey, my esteemed colleague on the council and here, that Senator Manning's contribution was not relevant.  Senator Manning's contribution dealt with the nub of the problems.  Why are we now trying to attract people back to this area?  Why did they leave in the first place?  Why did the residents of that part of the city and other areas of the city centre depart to outer suburbia?  He mentioned some of them and I will mention others.  I urge Senator Haughey to consider these points because they are absolutely relevant to the way this city has developed and will develop. We cannot take in isolation the Temple Bar area and try to attract the residents back there unless we consider their reason for leaving in the first place.</P>
    <P>One of the things which has undoubtedly militated against the centre of the city has been the policies adopted.  I disagree with Senator Manning on some aspects; I am not sure whether in this instance he blamed Dublin Corporation. Dublin Corporation cannot be blamed for many of those policies because they were Government policies.  Government incentives and tax policies encouraged people to go out into green field sites of suburbia and build there.  There were considerable tax incentives and benefits to build new factories and houses outside the city.  There was nothing, there is still very little but it is improving, to encourage people to stay in the city, to refurbish in the city.  Everything was loaded to encourage people to the outer suburbs. To a large extent we have what is called in America the doughnut syndrome.  We have an empty centre with people living all around it.  That is undoubtedly part <Col N="1361" /> of the problem, that there are so few residents in the Temple Bar area, although other areas have suffered greater, and we are now trying to attract them back.  It was a milestone in this city when, to my knowledge, the first Catholic church, St. Michael's and John's, closed in the inner city.  Sadly, many of the Church of Ireland churches and the Presbyterian Churches and so on, closed in the inner city.  I believe the first bell which rang out after Catholic emancipation, was St. Michael's and John's church.  It was an historic church, it had a huge congregation and it is now closed and is being sold.  I do not know what it will be used for but I hope that one day it may once again be a church for the population living in the city.  We are heading in that direction and I give credit to the Government for the small progress they have made in encouraging, with their tax incentives, development in the inner city, but much remains to be done.</P>
    <P>I put a question to the city manager some months ago with regard to the number of projects that had been undertaken in the incentive areas.  I think the figure was something like 33 or 44 residential units actually going ahead in those areas.  If Senator Ryan can remember the exact figure, I hope he will give it.  We should not delude ourselves into thinking that there is a massive rush back into the city.  People, particularly young people, want to live in the city, but they are still finding it very difficult.  Those who own residential property in the centre of the city are still finding the burden of maintaining it extremely difficult.  Unless that area is looked at more generously we will not achieve what I believe many of us here want.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning spoke about the roads policy.  I have no doubt that is a major contributing factor, along with those I have already mentioned.  Here I must blame Dublin Corporation although they have been aided and abetted by the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fianna Fáil Government most enthusiastically down through the years.  I do not wish to be party political.  I have no party affiliation and I am totally apolitical.  I try to look <Col N="1362" /> at issues so that we can improve the situation and not in a spirit of being party political or controversial.  I would not bother to mention the policies of Dublin Corporation in the matter except that they are still being pursued.  The Government are enthusiastic about many of them and the Fianna Fáil Party on the city council are doggedly determined that many of those policies will continue.  The greatest contributory factor to the destruction of this city has not been the dreaded private unscrupulous developer &mdash; they have done bad things and Senator Manning mentioned some of them &mdash; it has been Dublin Corporation's roads policy.  They have done more to destroy this city than all the developers put together.  I am ashamed to say that, as somebody who has been 17 years on the council.  However, I have a lightness in my step today and I am much more good-humoured than usual because we now have that civic charter which Senator Hanafin wanted us to tear up and put in a waste basket.  This charter will mean there will a change in the unsuccessful policies we have been pursuing to date. I will remind the House of a few of them.</P>
    <P>The Grand Canal, this beautiful waterway which we all appreciate, would be gone if we had allowed the Schaecterle plan to go through.  Travers-Morgan wanted to put a massive high crossing over the Liffey.  All the policies of the corporation have dragged the Liffey quays down and they are the frontispiece of this city.  The area we are talking about today which is on the rear of the £10 note, fronts on to the Liffey quays and I invite the House to look at the state of the area today.  The corporation wanted to widen 17 different stretches along the quays. When the 1980 plan was being adopted I begged them to drop those road proposals. I was told that there were no road proposals, that I was misleading the council, there were only going to be setbacks. Of course, that means that when the whole place is decayed and buildings have fallen they are not rebuilt on the line, but further back.  Thank goodness, most of those proposals have gone but a great deal of damage has already been <Col N="1363" /> done.  I object to the proposal for one or two multistorey car parks in this scheme and I will be putting down an amendment to it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Government decided to do away with the CIE depot on that site which action has allowed this Temple Bar area to develop.  I beg the Minister not to think of these as irrelevancies. I believe that this whole Temple Bar project should be in the hands of the local authority.  Every time we meet in this House Senators scramble to get debates on important issues like agriculture, the economy, foreign affairs, and so on but there is never time.  Why not?  Because this House and the other House spend so much of their time doing work which should not be within their remit, work which should be done by the local authority, in this instance Dublin Corporation, the major local authority in the country.  The Minister will probably say it was because they did not do it that the Government and the Taoiseach had to step in and take over.  This Government and previous Governments, I am not suggesting it is only the Fianna Fáil Party, have been remiss down the years because they have never brought in legislation dealing with local democracy and since then it has gone steadily in the opposite direction.  When Senator Manning said the local government Bill which was introduced recently did not give one tráithin of extra powers to local authorities, he was absolutely right.  In fact, it is still my contention that things are still going in the wrong direction.</P>
    <P>Let us remember the <i>ultra vires</i> rule which has impeded local authorities from carrying out the sort of development work and setting up the kind of development companies envisaged.  I have no problem with that.  What I am saying is that the local authority should have been able to do this but they were not and the <i>ultra vires</i> rule has not yet been abolished. I believe it is due to be abolished on 1 August and nobody welcomes that more than I.  There is some progress in the Bill but there is so much going in the opposite <Col N="1364" /> direction that I am not sure whether we are making progress or going backwards.</P>
    <P>The Government, the Taoiseach or the Departments should not be involved in the development of this area.  It should be done by the local authority.  Why does the Taoiseach have to be the sole shareholder? Why could it not have been the Lord Mayor of Dublin or the Taoiseach and the Lord Mayor of Dublin or the Taoiseach and the city manager?  The local authority would then have some input but no, it has to be the Taoiseach who is the sole shareholder.  I am sure the city manager will be very touched this afternoon when Senator Ryan tells him I was urging that he should be a shareholder in this development.</P>
    <P>I have to take issue with the Minister where he says there is nothing unusual in the Taoiseach's involvement in this process because the Taoiseach is the Minister with responsibility for cultural affairs and he is responsible, therefore, for the National Museum, the National Library, the National Gallery and the Museum of Modern Art.  With the greatest respect to the Minister, he could not have given worse examples.  It seems from what the Minister is saying that he wants Temple Bar turned into another museum, a museum for the tourists.  That is the very thing we do not want.</P>
    <P>I have the highest regard for the Taoiseach's love, interest and sensitivity in cultural matters and in his ministerial capacity he has done a marvellous job in the Museum of Modern Art, but the best job of all &mdash; which I had the great privilege of being allowed to see last Saturday week &mdash; is what is commonly known as &ldquo;Charlie's Palace&rdquo;, the wonderful buildings in Merrion Street which are exquisite. If they get the opportunity, everybody should see them.  I have no doubt that nothing but the best is good enough for the Taoiseach and I commend him for that.</P>
    <P>However, that is not what we want in Temple Bar.  We do not want another museum or anything comparable to those the Minister mentioned.  We want a vibrant part of the city where people can bustle around.  That is the reason the <Col N="1365" /> Taoiseach should not be the sole shareholder. The local authority should be in charge.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment Senator Haughey in his capacity as Lord Mayor, his successor and Senator Ryan, in his capacity as Chairman of the Planning Committee, for the way they worked, to move this project along.  I have a list of the various organisations represented on the board of the Temple Bar.  The Lord Mayor is on that board but he is the only democratic representative of city government. There is nobody else on the board, unless the membership has changed since I was given these lists.  There are two representatives from Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>That is a sad state of affairs.  If it cannot be left entirely to the local authority there should be a large representation of the city government on those various boards. I feel particularly sorry for the corporation officials, who eight or ten years ago were talking about the Temple Bar area and were interested in it, because of the extent to which Dublin Corporation has been cut out.  The project will be a flagship for the Dublin year of Culture and it will be successful and the Government and the Taoiseach will take credit for it.  That genuinely militates against our excellent officials, particularly the younger people in the planning department, who have been working on this project.  For them it is disheartening to be used.  The corporation will be in charge of the work, they will have to lay the cobblestones, and they will be in charge of the street pattern.</P>
    <P>Except for the Lord Mayor the elected representatives of the people of Dublin on the City Council have no say.  One of the reasons we have introduced the civic charter is to try to give some heart to the many good people in the corporation who see everything that is good and successful immediately being taken over by somebody else.  The same applied to the lottery. We came up with the idea of a national lottery, we presented it and the next thing we knew it was taken out of our hands.  If all this responsibility was handed over to a good local authority and <Col N="1366" /> they were allowed to get on with the job, the Minister would be free to deal with much more important matters.</P>
    <P>I am totally opposed to the idea of multi-storey car parks.  The whole thrust of the policy now must be to discourage motor cars coming into the city.  I know we have built massive roads but unless we are prepared to destroy what is left of the city we must not encourage more cars to come into the city.  We must bring people into the city by providing a good public transport system for commuters and shoppers.  I do not disagree with providing short term shopping facilities. Bord Fáilte strongly recommended that the entire Temple Bar area should be pedestrianised but the Minister may consider that is too dramatic or too way out.  The Taoiseach was quoted on one occasion as saying &ldquo;we will never entice the people out of their motor cars&rdquo; but if we must have some cars in the area I suggest that we allow taxis and I would urge that we allow cyclists into the area. I will be strongly objecting to car parks and will put down an amendment to that effect.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the composition of the committees.  They are the only remarks I wish to make at the moment.  I would like to end on a positive note.  In spite of all the reservations I have enunciated all of which I feel most strongly about &mdash; I regret the way this project has moved forward &mdash; I hope nevertheless that it will be successful.  I hope above all that it will not end up as a showpiece to make us look good to our European friends when they come here. I honestly hope that the vitality which, as Senator Manning mentioned, existed 100 or 120 years ago will be renewed in the area.</P>

      <P>The Temple Bar Area Renewal and Development Bill, 1991, will establish on a statutory basis the company, Temple Bar Renewal Limited whose essential functions will be to decide which development policies will benefit from the incentives provided under the Finance Act, 1991.  The new <Col N="1367" /> Bill will also establish Temple Bar Properties Limited as the company which will implement the development of this area on behalf of the Government.  This company will operate as a limited company whose sole shareholder, through his nominee, is the Taoiseach as he is the member of the Government with responsibility for culture.</P>
      <P>As 1991 is Dublin's year as European City of Culture it is most fitting that this exciting development will become a Government flagship project.  As a Dubliner, I am most proud to see the revitalisation of an old and well established part of the city buzzing with the hum of activity and atmosphere which natives and visitors alike can share.  No one can deny the historic character of the streets and buildings in the area.  It is little wonder that many people are now referring to Temple Bar as Dublin's left bank &mdash; the Lord Mayor, in his outgoing speech last night, said it is Dublin's Temple Bar.</P>
      <P>Already well established is a thriving community of artists, traders, publicans, musicians, people in the food trade and, last but not least, those already living in the area.  The new companies intend to attract a host of new businesses, including a recording studio, a film centre, craft and speciality shops, workshops, art galleries, theatres and a large variety of other shops and markets.  Residential units for students and others who may wish to live in the Temple Bar area will also be a feature. The restoration of Temple Bar will be concentrated on various aspects including cobblestones, lamp standards and sculptures.  Also included will be a buskers and speakers corner, a weekend market and wood-panelled shop exteriors.  These will further contribute to the Bohemian character of this district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employment, both new and existing, should not be underestimated or undervalued. Temple Bar can have significant job creating potential, particularly for our young people who have so much to contribute to such a vibrant enterprise. Approximately 500 people are currently employed in small existing endeavours in <Col N="1368" /> this area.  However, we hope to reach a target of nearly 3,000 within three years. The EC, through the European Commission pilot project for the Temple Bar area under the auspices of the European Regional Development Fund, has provided funding of £3.6 million, representing 50 per cent of the total cost.  In addition, the European Investment Bank have agreed to provide a loan of £5 million to assist in the first phase of development and to favourably consider further loans.</P>
    <P>Temple Bar Properties Limited will acquire other key properties in the area needed for the development plan on the basis of an independent valuation.  Some of these will be acquired from among properties currently owned by CIE and Dublin Corporation.  Temple Bar Properties Limited will be treated as any other commercial State company.  The company's accounts will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the company can also be added to the remit of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  The company, Temple Bar Renewal Limited, will be required to place its decisions before both Houses of the Oireachtas for their information under the conditions of the new Bill.  It is essential that Temple Bar Properties Limited and Temple Bar Renewal Limited co-operate closely, and to facilitate this they both share a number of common directors.  Temple Bar Properties Limited will also be required to provide details of their operations to the Minister for Finance as the Minister will give a State guarantee for the company's borrowings up to £25 million.</P>
    <P>As has been said, several tax reliefs have been implemented in the Temple Bar area, including double rent allowances, industrial building allowances, section 23 allowances for residential accommodation and an owner-occupier allowance for private residents.  A new special 100 per cent capital allowance is being given to refurbish existing old buildings which will cover the cost of the restoration work plus either the cost of the purchase price of the building or its value at 1 January 1991, if the amount <Col N="1369" /> spent on restoration exceeds the purchase cost.  This tax benefit has come under much criticism from Members of the Opposition.  However, it must be emphasised that to ensure good development and the success of such a large scale undertaking the conditions must be as attractive as possible to potential developers.</P>
    <P>Other requirements of the Bill are that tenants may not sublet, assign or share possession of the properties without written permission from Temple Bar Properties Limited; Temple Bar Properties Limited will not be liable for any stamp duty regarding premises they will acquire in Temple Bar; compulsory orders will be allowed to Temple Bar Properties Limited, under the new Bill and employees of Temple Bar Properties Limited and Temple Bar Renewal Limited will be governed by public pay guidelines. It seems very fitting that the redevelopment of the Temple Bar area should progress with great strides in 1991 in keeping with our plans for Dublin as European City of Culture.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a Viking adventure in the building known as St. Michael and John's of Fishamble Street will now have greater historic significance as it is located beside Wood Quay.  The restored area of Temple Bar with its ambience of arts, culture and heritage will encapsulate the very essence of Dublin and her people.  Apart from the extra jobs and the increased revenue generated by additional tourism, we will also be leaving behind a legacy of immense cultural value for future generations which should endure the test of time.  It will ensure a vibrant heart in our city which will pump new blood into the core of Temple Bar and its surrounding area.  No one, I am sure not even my colleagues on the Opposition benches, can put a value on the benefits of this enterprising project.</P>
    <P>Finally, as a member of Dublin Corporation I would like to congratulate the elected members and officials of Dublin Corporation for their co-operation in this project.  As Senator Haughey said, Dublin Corporation had an action plan <Col N="1370" /> for this area long before it was fashionable. As a Dubliner, I wish this project well.  I know it will be successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, congratulate Seán Kenny on being elected Lord Mayor of the City of Dublin.  I have known Seán since 1985 when I was first elected to the city council.  I have always found him to be a very fine, hard working councillor and I have no doubt that he will continue that work as Lord Mayor of Dublin.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Government on this Bill.  The Minister said that the reason the Taoiseach is taking such a personal interest in this matter is that he has responsibility for cultural affairs.  In 1985 I was involved in a group called the Irish Visual Arts Foundation who ran an art exhibition in Temple Bar Studios, and we asked the Taoiseach who was Leader of the Opposition at the time, if he would open the exhibition.  Like many other people I also had a great interest in the Temple Bar area.  The people involved in the Temple Bar Studios and others involved in business asked me at the time if, when the Taoiseach was there, they could bring him aside and talk to him about the importance of the Temple Bar area.  The Taoiseach met these people for about 20 minutes or half an hour and they made a very good case for the historical importance of Temple Bar.  They asked the Taoiseach to take a personal interest in the area, and he has done that since. He should be congratulated for taking a personal interest in the Temple Bar area. I have no doubt that if he did not take such an interest in it we would not see this very fine Bill before us today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the corporation planners for putting forward the original plan for the area.  That was very important and was one of the major forces behind this Bill.  I thank those people who mentioned me and, of course, I thank and congratulate the Planning Committee of Dublin Corporation for all the work they have put into the project.  Senator Hederman has done great work in this regard. She and the residents association in her area have highlighted the problems in <Col N="1371" /> other areas of the city over many years. Mistakes have been made in the past, and we should recognise that.  Senator Hederman has highlighted those mistakes in the long term interests of the city.</P>
    <P>I could come back to a point made by Senator Hederman earlier.  She mentioned the reason people left the city centre, but I do not believe it is as simple as she makes it out to be.  One of the main reasons people left Dublin's inner city was that they were living in the most appalling slums &mdash; Dublin had the worst slums in Europe.  The local authority and Government had an obligation to improve housing and one of the ways they did so was by moving people to the outskirts of the city.  Maybe that was a mistake but the idea behind it was a good one, namely to improve peoples' living conditions.  Senator Hederman also mentioned that there was no rush back into the city, and that is true.  She put a question to the city manager in this regard and I was surprised to hear the number of apartments which had been built or were in the planning stage.  However, that trend is changing and I think we will see a significant increase in the next 18 months in the number of people living in Dublin's inner city.</P>
    <P>There are various reasons for this.  The financial incentives which were recently announced will be a major factor, as will the civic charter which was introduced last night.  The Fianna Fáil group and some other groups, unfortunately, did not see that civic charter until last night and even then, I gather, we did not see the completed form.  However, I saw it this morning.  I regret that we, as the largest group in the city council, were not asked to examine that civic charter.  On reading it this morning there was only one thing in it I could possibly disagree with.  We were not the only group who did not see the charter in advance. Deputy Tony Gregory was also excluded for some strange reason.  A man who represents Dublin's inner city, who got 4,000 first preference votes was excluded, <Col N="1372" /> as an Independent, from that civic charter, and I cannot understand the reason. Obviously there were petty political grounds for excluding him.</P>
    <P>Other projects which we are undertaking to entice people to live in the inner city include the &ldquo;living-over-the-shop&rdquo; project into which Dublin Corporation, the chamber of commerce and I have put a lot of work.  We have received a report on that project and I have no doubt that Dublin Corporation, as the local authority in the area, and the Department of the Environment will work together to get the &ldquo;living-over-the shop&rdquo; project up and running in Dublin.  There is a huge percentage of areas in the city that are not occupied from the first floor up, and if we want to ensure that people go back to live in old buildings in these areas we should proceed with that project.</P>
    <P>There is a major parking problem in Temple Bar.  I am on the board of the Olympia Theatre and I regularly use the facilities in Temple Bar at night time, the restaurants, etc.  There is a huge problem there at the moment with people parking on the pavements and all over the place. I agree with Senator Hederman about parking facilities in the city centre.  I have very often voted against multistorey car parks in Dublin city centre except on specific occasions when I believe they are necessary, and this is one of the times I believe that is so.  Maybe Senator Hederman has reasons which she will state later as to why there should not be a car park in the area.  If we are going to pedestrianise all of Temple Bar or if we are going to allow cyclists only and maybe taxis use the area, which I think is a good idea &mdash; commuters should be excluded &mdash; we must provide car parking facilities. I await to hear the reason that Senator Hederman opposes a car park in the area.</P>
    <P>Temple Bar area is obviously of great historical importance to the city of Dublin.  As somebody said to me a number of years ago, from the back of the Central Bank all the way up to Christchurch there is practically a thousand years of history.  There are very few places where that is the case.  We are <Col N="1373" /> lucky that Temple Bar has been left almost intact.</P>
    <P>The tourist potential of Temple Bar is immense.  As far as tourism is concerned, Dublin has been described as a 24 hour city.  Basically, you can see everything in 24 or 36 hours.  We must get people to stay longer if we are to increase the tourism spin-off for the city and tackle our unemployment problem.  We need a Dublin lobby, as Senator Manning has said.  During his term of office as Lord Mayor, Senator Haughey set up a special working group on the economy of Dublin which included the chamber of commerce, the trade union movement, the IDA and various other groups.  That was a very imaginative idea which has been taken a step further by the last Lord Mayor, Michael Donnelly.  I have no doubt that the group will lobby very strongly and will emphasise the problems mentioned by Senator Manning earlier. We have a huge unemployment problem and we do not shout about it enough as do other areas with a similar problem.  I hope, and I have no doubt that the new Lord Mayor, Sean Kenny, will work with these groups to try to create jobs for the citizens of Dublin.  In that way we can tackle the worst problem facing us at the moment, which is unemployment.</P>
    <P>It is thanks to CIE that the unique character of the Temple Bar area remains intact.  CIE did not develop the area and that is the only reason it remains completely intact.  We should be thankful for that.</P>
    <P>The principal objectives and policies for the plan put forward by the corporation are very important.  They are: to conserve the streetscape and to retain, through refurbishment, as many of the existing buildings as is practical in preference to redevelopment; to continue the multi-use function of the area with particular emphasis on cultural, recreational and residential functions; to provide a new east-west pedestrian corridor and to pedestrianise the streets in the immediate vicinity; to preserve existing stone sets and to provide street furniture.  If that is done, we get rid of the only car park facility in the Temple Bar area, and that <Col N="1374" /> brings me back to the point made by Senator Hederman about not having car parking facilities in the area.  If we develop that area there will be a major lack of car parking facilities.  As I said earlier, I am on the board of the Olympia Theatre, and if that area is developed the theatre will lose its car parking facilities, thus causing problems for many people. We may not like it, but that is the reality.</P>
    <P>The other objectives are to encourage and facilitate the use of upper floors for residential use, to expand residential use in the area, to have the cleared sites in the area at present used for long term contract car parking redeveloped, to investigate the feasibility of off-street long term car parking, to provide a multistorey car park to serve the area; shop fronts to be of traditional design and metal roller shutters will not be acceptable. It is proposed that the entire area be designated the Temple Bar conservation area, the interiors to be listed for protection in the development plan.  That has been done.  We listed a large number of buildings in the area, even though certain people at the time in the Planning Department were not very enthusiastic.</P>
    <P>I welcome the whole Temple Bar plan. This is an excellent Bill.  I have no doubt that Temple Bar will now develop as it should.  It is particularly important that the rents be kept low because there are many businesses in that area, as has already been explained, that are not commercially viable but they are attractive for tourists and others including the people in the area who obviously should be able to make a living from the area. We must try to keep the Bohemian, unique character of the area.  I am delighted the rents will be kept low, that the new body will see to it that the unique character will be retained and that the people who have been working in the area for many years will be let stay there and develop their businesses as they see fit in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Once again, I congratulate the Government, the Taoiseach and also Senator Haughey who got the project up and running when he was Lord Mayor.  I <Col N="1375" /> hope the Temple Bar area will go from strength to strength in the coming years.</P>

      <P>I welcome development in the Temple Bar area of Dublin.  I am from Mayo but I have spent about half of my working week in this city for a large number of years and I know the area particularly well, moving up and down from Heuston Station.  It has been an almost derelict part of Dublin, but embraces a great deal of the history of the inner city.  It is certainly most imaginative to undertake this type of development in the heart of the city.</P>
      <P>I read some of the Dáil speeches on this Bill.  I read with interest the speech of Deputy Gerard Brady who gave his views on the Wood Quay development. When driving or taking a taxi or bus up the quays the more I look at the corporation building there the more appalled I become.  That was an absolutely catastrophic development and I hope that in this age, which is a little more enlightened environmentally, people will make certain that there will be no development undertaken in the Temple Bar area to compete with that barbarity. Some people, even on this side of the House, took exception to the Taoiseach moving this Bill, but I do not share their views.  The Taoiseach has specific political accountability for this area and if he should decide to become involved and to take an initiative in this area I take no exception whatever to that.</P>
      <P>Just as I am very interested in what is happening in the heart of the city of Dublin, as somebody who knows the city very well, I am also very interested in the Gaeltacht.  I would like to see the Taoiseach, in his capacity as Minister for the Gaeltacht, making the same personal intervention into Gaeltacht activities as he has done in the case of Temple Bar, but politically he has not chosen to do that.  A personal input by him in many Gaeltacht issues would be appreciated. There is a huge lack of funding in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan spoke about the inner city and said we had the worst slums in <Col N="1376" /> Europe, similar to those at the time of the First World War when people were living in the most appalling circumstances, for example, as dramatically portrayed by Sean O'Casey in his plays. I agree with Senator Ryan that, of course, there was a very compelling case to move people out of these slums, but I would take issue with him in relation to the policies adopted in that regard.  The people had to be moved out of the houses they were in, but there was no reason new houses could not be built in the next street to house them in the inner city where they had traditionally come from and where they would be much happier.  I compliment Dublin Corporation on their sensitive approach in recent years in regard to housing.  When we look back historically at what happened 30 or 40 years ago it was a case of from the frying pan into the fire to move the people out of the inner city into Ballymun-type complexes which were as barbaric in terms of housing development as was the Wood Quay development to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill which deals with Temple Bar Renewal Limited states in section 3: &ldquo;Notwithstanding any provision of the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990, the Taoiseach shall appoint the directors of Temple Bar Renewal Limited.&rdquo; There is a little bit of absolute power implied in this.  It would be much more appropriate if it was agreed that notwithstanding any provision of the Companies Acts the Taoiseach, in consultation with Dublin City Council, shall appoint the directors of Temple Bar Renewal Limited.  That would be a more democratic and more sensitive approach to this issue.</P>
    <P>I have listened with interest to the comments of my Dublin colleagues in the Seanad on aspects of the Temple Bar development, transportation and adequate car parking.  I am a constant traveller to Dublin by train &mdash; I am probably Iarnród Éireann's best passenger on the Westport-Heuston line.  Heuston station is a very fine building and the people working there are very competent but this seems to be one of the very few cities <Col N="1377" /> in Europe in which the central station is not in the heart of the city.  In Brussels, Paris, Munich or any other city in continental Europe in 99 per cent of cases the main train station is in the heart of the city.  Thus, passengers are able to walk to the station which is most satisfactory. In this city we are based here in the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; this is effectively the centre of the city &mdash; and if you want to be certain of getting a train at Heuston you would have to leave about an hour prior to the scheduled time.  That is highly unsatisfactory, uneconomic and ineffective.  Given that the Temple Bar region is midway between this part of the city of Dublin and Heuston Station there is a very compelling case for a rapid transit system from these two points, embracing the Temple Bar area.  It would facilitate the Temple Bar area and bring people from other parts of the city to that area by such a system, linking it with Heuston Station.  I am taking a little latitude here as this matter is peripheral to the main issue.</P>
    <P>For years the Ormond Hotel has been owned by a Westport family.  I have known it for years and I know the background. This part of the quays is very derelict and the development of the inner city area to bring it into the mainstream of cultural, social and tourist activity in Dublin is imaginative and welcome and has my support.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill this afternoon.  It is a great idea and I congratulate the Taoiseach, the Government, former Lord Mayors, people going out of office and those coming into a new term on the corporation who played an active part in producing this Bill and for the speed with which it has been brought before us.  I could not agree more with the Minister when he says that it is another tourist attraction for Dublin considering all the activities proposed for the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As someone who comes in from the country and passes the Temple Bar area every day, in my contributions over the last number of years I have been commenting on the poor architectural <Col N="1378" /> and structural standard of the quays. Over the last 18 months it has been a pleasure to see new buildings and projects starting on the quays giving it a facelift.  Over the last seven or eight years Grafton Street has been pedestrianised and the streets adjacent to Grafton Street around the area of the Westbury Hotel have benefited from fabulous facilities being provided by private enterprise; it is exciting and heartening to see an extension of this activity on the quays.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Staunton's remarks on traffic access to the Temple Bar area and the quays generally; for large numbers of people use the quays when heading to the west, the midlands and the north-west.  I look forward to the speedy development of this area.  There are many projects on that side of the town, such as the Custom House Docks site development; but on the other side of town, north of the Liffey, it is a very different story.  Mountjoy Square and North Great George's Street contain fabulous buildings ready to be put to the use originally intended for them.  The practice of housing people in four and five storey flats nowadays is unacceptable and brings with it many dangers, temptations and potential exploitation and unemployment.  Everything that is bad for society is happening in that part of our city.</P>
    <P>While the Government have to be congratulated on what is happening around the Temple Bar area, the Grafton Street area and the Custom House Docks site, I look forward to the day when we may offer proper housing to the people of those disgraceful four and five storey flats.</P>
    <P>I wish Seán Kenny the new Lord Mayor well and I am glad he will have a role to play as chairman of one of the committees in this particular project.  I welcome the Bill and look forward to the speedy start of development there.</P>

      <P>I would like to sincerely thank the many Senators who have made very fine contributions to this <Col N="1379" /> Bill.  I welcome all their positive contributions because this is a unique, special and important Bill.  I thank Senator Manning for his acceptance that many of the points previously made by his colleagues in the Dáil on the role of our present Taoiseach pertaining to this Bill are, in fact, the myths which I suggested they were in my earlier remarks.</P>
      <P>However, I cannot subscribe to Senator Manning's views on what he terms the failures attaching to Fianna Fáil in Government in relation to the development of the city of Dublin.  In Government we have supported positive initiatives which would achieve progress. Our record shows that under this Taoiseach there has been no support for talking shops.  In Government since 1987 at least we have pioneered the process of involving those implicated in decisions in the making of those decisions.  The greatest example of this is the process of dialogue in consensus with our social partners on behalf of the nation.  I find Senator Manning's views on our involvement with both the trade unions and the other social partners in the development of Dublin strangely at odds with his party leader's views on both the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Does this mark a change of heart in Fine Gael's policy towards those programmes?</P>
      <P>Senator Manning also stated that under Fianna Fáil there was an absence of initiatives to put things right, which is not true.  There are other designated areas in our inner city, for example, which would qualify for significant tax relief.  Arising out of the interest and involvement of Senator Norris, section 4 of the Finance Act, 1989, provides tax relief for up to 50 per cent of the cost of expenditure on the restoration of buildings of historical and cultural value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to give the House some facts on our commitment to city renewal and revitalisation and refute Senator Hederman's allegation that nothing is happening in Dublin.  By 31 March this year we had completed 47 projects at a <Col N="1380" /> total cost of £30.14 million, we have 19 projects in progress at a total cost of £41.09 million and 80 projects at the planning stage which are of a value of circa £150 million.  The urban renewal scheme in Dublin is progressing very satisfactorily. In the entire Dublin designated area 513,000 square feet of property have been completed with 570,000 square feet in progress and 2.3 million square feet at planning stage.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation's planning records show that between 1975 and 1986 no development took place on the quays during the 12 years in which Fianna Fáil were absent from Government.  Since the introduction of the urban renewal scheme, projects totalling over £114 million are in planning, in progress or have been completed on the quays.  I find it strange that the suggestion was made here today that, if Fianna Fáil were in Government or in control of the corporation something might go amiss as we do not understand culture, history, or development.  This view has been circulating over the last few weeks and again here today, and I cannot understand it because we stand on our record.</P>
    <P>I can assure Senator Haughey that the Temple Bar companies will have the issue of activity right through the day and night as a part of their remit which is essential for the most economically viable development of the area.  In another part of the Senator's excellent contribution to which I fully subscribe, his point on the constitutionality of compulsory purchase orders and other provisions is taken.  The relevant provisions have been drafted precisely from that viewpoint; of particular note is the provision in section 12 (2) (a) of the Bill that even when a property is acquired the liability to pay compensation remains which is fair and equitable.  CIE are being compensated at market value and they participated fully in the valuation process.</P>
    <P>Senator Haughey spoke of the residential nature of the development.  A principal focus of the tax incentive package in Chapter 7 of the Finance Act, 1991, is the encouragement of residential occupation in the Temple Bar area.  This <Col N="1381" /> has been achieved by the availability of first, personal tax allowances for residential owner occupiers and second, section 23 tax reliefs for rented accommodation. These are two very welcome developments in our taxation policy in 1991 which are applicable to this Bill and to this area.</P>
    <P>In response to Senator Hederman, I accept that there has not been a vast influx of people returning to the inner city.  However, as the impact of the tax reliefs for designated areas grow, the number of people taking up residence in the inner city will also grow.  A dramatic illustration of this process is the success of residential developments around the Christchurch area.  The Temple Bar package will undoubtedly contribute to this very welcome and continued development.  I am glad Senator Hederman recognises the way the Temple Bar tax incentives encourage more residential accommodation in the area.  A large residential component is intended in the development particularly of students but also of other people wishing to live in an exciting, reinvigorated inner city area.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand the Senator's position on multistorey car parks which are a key part of a viable development.  Clearly they must be in sympathy with the development of the area but without car park facilities how will the people, who will be the essence of the Temple Bar development, be able to locate and visit the area?  Neither do I accept the Senator's contention that the local authority alone could carry out the development. What the Government have put in place is a three way partnership of the local people, the local authority &mdash; Dublin Corporation &mdash; and the central Government Departments and agencies. All are involved and all can contribute to the process in a consensual way.  Would Senator Hederman have excluded the local people who have argued strongly that Government Departments and agencies must be involved and have requested their involvement?</P>
    <P>Senator Hederman confused me with her welcome support for the Taoiseach's <Col N="1382" /> involvement and his good taste but her supposition that this could in any way lead to a museum type development in Temple Bar is ill-founded.  I can assure the Senator and the House that this is not intended.  The objective is to create a vibrant, appealing development, building on what is already evident in the area. Any recommendations with regard to the car park incentive were proper to the Finance Act and not to today's Bill.  In any event, a similar amendment was ruled out of order in the other House.</P>
    <P>I welcome Senator Ryan's contribution, coming from a person who has been very involved in the development of Temple Bar.  I agree with his remarks on the car parking issue; we need to be selective but Temple Bar is a location where car parking is essential and should be supported.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton in his customary positive contribution stated that there is no possibility of a development such as the civic offices within the Temple Bar area and I agree with him.  Both companies involved in the development of the area include on their board of directors, representatives from the area.  More importantly, Temple Bar Renewal Limited can only approve expenditure on small scale enterprises for the purposes of tax incentives under the Finance Act. The criteria for approval are set out specifically in the Second Schedule of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I thank all those who contributed, including Senator Bennett, Senator Haughey, Senator Manning, Senator Staunton and Senator Hederman.  I thank Senator Haughey for his tremendous work as Lord Mayor of Dublin in pushing forward this project and I compliment Senator Ryan who, as chairman of the Planning Committee of Dublin Corporation, made a major contribution to ensuring that a consensus was achieved, that a tasteful development could proceed and that the sensitivities of Temple Bar would be protected and preserved.  I look forward to seeing the new chairman of one of these companies, alderman, councillor and now Lord Mayor, Seán Kenny &mdash; whose parents come from my <Col N="1383" /> own constituency &mdash; make a major contribution and give a positive lead ensuring that when this Bill is enacted Dublin Corporation under his leadership and the central Government Departments in consultation with the Temple Bar Development Council may create a congenial ambience for the people of Dublin and for visitors to our capital city from this country and internationally.  I am confident that all Members of this House and the people of Dublin will be satisfied with the effort we are making to create this new, wonderful opportunity for our capital city.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 10, after &ldquo;Taoiseach&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in consultation with the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Alderman and Burgesses of Dublin&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My proposal is that section 3 should read:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding any provision of the Companies Act, 1963 to 1990, the Taoiseach, in consultation with the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Alderman and Burgesses of Dublin, shall appoint the directors of Temple Bar Renewal Limited.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened with great interest to the replies given by the Minister and am grateful for the courteous way he dealt with all points raised during the debate. I was, however, a little mystified that having given very specified figures with <Col N="1384" /> regard to 47 projects costing £30 million being completed, 19 projects in progress and 18 at planning stage that the Minister did not give the figure for square feet of residential units created in those areas which I requested.  I hope will give me this figure.</P>
    <P>I hope that every member of the City Council and the three other members of that council who are here today will support this amendment and that they and the Minister &mdash; who is most reasonable &mdash; will agree that this is a modest amendment.</P>
    <P>Earlier today I welcomed in many ways the development of the Temple Bar area but I bitterly regret the fact that, to a very large extent, this development has been taken out of the hands of the local authority and that the Taoiseach is the sole trustee.  I do not object to the involvement of the Government Departments mentioned; my objection is to the extent to which the local authority role in this development has been curtailed.  I pay tribute once again to the former Lord Mayors, particularly Senator Haughey, who did what they could to push this Bill along during their tenure of office and to my dear and esteemed colleague, Senator Eoin Ryan, former Chairman of the Planning Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I thought I would be allowed to pay tribute to those two Members on the other side of the House and I would like to pay tribute to the Temple Bar Development Council for all they have done.  As democratic representatives elected by the people of Dublin, if we want to see the City Council, through our Lord Mayor whom we <Col N="1385" /> elected last night, having a small extra input into this Bill it is most reasonable that he should be involved in the way I have suggested.  He should be consulted by the Taoiseach concerning the appointment of the committees.  It is not an extravagant request and would help to redress in some small measure the lack of balance in this Bill which I referred to earlier on.  Much of the good work done by the corporation is the day-to-day nitty gritty work which they have been doing and which they will continue to do to implement the ideas in the Bill and if the Lord Mayor were to be consulted by the Taoiseach when he is appointing the directors of Temple Bar Renewal Limited that would be very helpful.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Minister's comments that we had suggested Fianna Fáil were not getting things done, I never said they were not getting things done.  The question we must ask ourselves, is &ldquo;Are we getting the right things done?&rdquo; There is no point in our going in with a steamroller and flattening the whole city; that would get things done but would destroy the city.  Building roads is getting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the involvement of the local authority in all this and whether the Fianna Fáil members of the local authority feel that we are getting the right things done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will stay with the amendment and the involvement of the Lord Mayor.  I would like to have asked for half a dozen members of the city council to be included as well but I am asking for the Lord Mayor as the representative of the 52 members of the council.  It is reasonable to refer to the input of members of the city council.  The Lord Mayor by his role, in consultation with the Taoiseach, would give the democratic representation which I feel and Senator Manning said in his introductory words is so important. The Minister was absolutely right on one point.  Nothing happened on the quays because of the road proposals.  I hope the <Col N="1386" /> Government have been converted away from those proposals.  Finally, I ask that this modest amendment be accepted by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. S. Haughey Mr. S. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hederman was very forthright in praising me, Senator Ryan and other Senators and it would be ungracious of me not to congratulate Senator Hederman also on her year as Lord Mayor which did a lot for the city.  That should be put on the record since we are throwing bouquets at each other today.</P>
      <P>I have some sympathy with the amendment but I see dangers in it also.  As I said in my Second Stage speech, it was a great boost for the office of Lord Mayor that he was made chairman of one of the companies involved.  The role of Dublin Corporation was certainly enhanced by that appointment.  In my experience as Chair of the special advisory committee, Dublin Corporation personnel were very involved in making recommendations for the balanced development of the Temple Bar area.</P>
      <P>Specifically on the amendment, I have no doubt that the Lord Mayor, the city council and the city manager will be consulted regarding appointments to this board.  The danger is that if certain people are singled out for consultation and named in the legislation then other people who would normally be consulted are omitted and the legislation could be interpreted so that that they would not be consulted.  There is no doubt that when a Taoiseach or Minister appoints a board he consults with all sorts of people and interest groups.  Why not include the city manager in this amendment?  Why not include all sorts of other groups?  There is an inherent danger in listing particular people who should be consulted.  The Taoiseach will consult many interest groups and I have no doubt that, in practice, the Lord Mayor and the corporation will be consulted.  While I have sympathy with the amendment I see dangers in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this modest amendment, as it is being called, for two or three reasons.  A great <Col N="1387" /> deal was said on the Government side during the Second Stage debate about the vital role of Dublin Corporation in the process of renewal.  It was said that much of the groundwork was done by the corporation. Various members of that body were singled out for praise and various officials were also commended for the role they played.  It is clear from that that corporation has a great deal of expertise in this area and a special role to play in all this.  If we accept this amendment we are recognising this on two levels.</P>
      <P>This modest amendment recognises in statutory form that Dublin Corporation has a special contribution to make. Senator Haughey said that, of course, the Lord Mayor will be consulted.  He will be this time, he or she may be next time but a situation of a genuine conflict could arise between the city council and the Taoiseach of the day within the next two or three years.  If Dublin Corporation under its new civic charter finds itself greatly at odds with the Government and if this becomes personalised between the Lord Mayor of Dublin &mdash; not all Lord Mayors may be as placid and even-tempered as the man elected last night &mdash; we could find both sides at loggerheads.  The Taoiseach of the day could decide not to consult the council and the Lord Mayor and might go against what they think is best.  If the duty to consult is contained in the legislation the Taoiseach must do so before he makes his appointment.  The amendment is so modest that it does not bind the Taoiseach but at least those whom the city council consider to be best qualified are more likely to be appointed to Temple Bar Renewal Limited if this provision exists.  For that reason it is an important amendment, if a modest one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Taoiseach, although he gives every sign to the contrary, will not be there forever.  There will be another Taoiseach in years to come and that Taoiseach may not have the intimate knowledge of Dublin and the commitment to renewal in Dublin of our present Taoiseach. We may have a Taoiseach from Cork, Meath, Mullingar or Mayo who would not accord Dublin its present order <Col N="1388" /> of priority.  Another Taoiseach may simply be advised by his officials rather than go to the corporation.  Senator Hederman's amendment is modest and I am sure that in their hearts and minds the Government party probably agree this would be a good thing.  If passed here today the Bill could go back to the other House and even go to the President by the end of the week.  The legislation need not be held up.  I have great pleasure in seconding, if that is what I am to do, and in supporting the amendment proposed by Senator Hederman.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank sincerely all the Senators who have contributed on this amendment and more particularly to thank Senator Hederman for her very complimentary remarks about our mutual friend, Senator Ryan. I am sure, on her own admission as an apolitical Senator, she will do her utmost to ensure that Senator Ryan is re-elected as chairman of the corporation's planning committee, in the interests of the continuation and the maintenance of very caring and sensitive planning decisions in the years ahead.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Pertaining to this amendment No. 1 to section 3, the position on the appointment of the directors of Temple Bar Renewal Limited is that the Taoiseach makes the appointments from clearly defined categories of people, as already set down specifically and publicly, in particular by the Taoiseach in reply to several questions in the Dáil over recent months.  As I said earlier, the renewal of Temple Bar is already a unique three-way development partnership of local people, the local authority and central Government. The Senator's amendment is not necessary.  The process is already a partnership and consequently no amendment is required.  I will, therefore, not accept <Col N="1389" /> this amendment.  Senator Hederman may wish to withdraw it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to withdraw it.  Perhaps the Minister could assist me by telling me what categories of people the Taoiseach will consult when appointing these directors.  I was not sitting in the Dáil and I did not read the Dáil debates on this.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Manning for seconding this amendment &mdash; I was particularly taken with the Senator's second point, which is an extremely valid one and which I think any reasonable Member of this House would have to accept, that we are most fortunate to have a Taoiseach who has taken an interest in the cultural life of the city.  He is living in Dublin.  I do not know whether he is actually a Dubliner, but he has been living in Dublin for a long time.  I certainly consider him a Dubliner.  If, for instance, just to take an example at random, the Minister for the Environment, who is a very able man, were to step into the shoes of the Taoiseach when the Taoiseach decided in his own good time that he wished to retire, we would have a Taoiseach from County Mayo who would now be involved with&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a Taoiseach from County Mayo at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I did not realise the Taoiseach was born in County Mayo, although I should have, of course. That was a very bad slip on my part. Some of these details do not always come to my mind at the right moment.  I think Members on that side of the House have said, and they are proud of the fact, that the present Taoiseach takes such an interest in the city and knows so much about it.  The Minister present is nodding his head in agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning has made a very valid point, that we may find ourselves in the distant or not too distant future with a Taoiseach from County Kerry, County Donegal, County Leitrim or somewhere else.  I have nobody in particular in mind and I would not want anyone to think so <Col N="1390" /> when I mention those counties.  We will then be in a situation where he is the linchpin, a vital part of our capital city, and the whole basis on which that part of the city is run and developed.  I just do not think that is acceptable.  I cannot put it better than my colleague, Senator Manning.  He made the case abundantly clear.  On those grounds, would the Minister and the Members on the other side have it in their hearts to accept that one tiny amendment?</P>
    <P>I wish to alert you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, that I will not accept the ruling which I am told is going to be given on my next amendment, but given that you will certainly win out on that, in spite of the battles I may fight on it, this is the only little amendment we are looking for. Would the Senators who are also members of Dublin Corporation and Senator Ryan, who may perhaps be back in power, and the Lord Mayor of Dublin, I hope he will be in the not too distant future, support the proposal that the Taoiseach should consult with the Lord Mayor before he appoints the directors of the Temple Bar Renewal Committee? I would find it disturbing and very distressing to think that members of Dublin City Council would not support this amendment.  As Senator Manning said we are not trying to hold things up. Senator Haughey mentioned how he found it such a big boost for a Lord Mayor to be chairman of one of the committees. Think what a big boost you might get if you were Lord Mayor and you were at least to be consulted.  We are not asking that the Lord Mayor have a final say or a veto, we are not asking that he have any stringent or extravagant part to play; we are simply asking that the Taoiseach consult him before appointing the members of this committee.  It seems a perfectly valid role for the Lord Mayor of the capital city.</P>
    <P>In relation to what Senator Manning said about the conflicts ahead, I was distressed to hear Senator Haughey, in his previous contribution, talk about seeing battles ahead.  I presume he was referring to the civic charter.  We see no battles ahead.  We want to go ahead together, in <Col N="1391" /> partnership, in the best interests of the city.  It is in that spirit that I ask the Minister to accept this modest amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept Senator Hederman's sincerity in totality.  She talked about proceeding together with the civic charter and she asked for further consultation with the Lord Mayor.  How you could exclude the main political party and another independent person from the totality of consensus to achieve the civic charter baffles me.  I cannot reconcile it with her demand in this amendment to have the Lord Mayor consulted again in this situation.  He will have a key role, at the insistence of the Taoiseach, to maintain that link between the head of the Government, and the head of the civic government in the city.  That is clearly embodied in this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that consultations will take place with the Lord Mayor of the day, with representatives of various Departments &mdash; the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of the Environment, the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications, Bord Fáilte, FÁS, the National Heritage Council, the Temple Bar Development Council, various architects, heritage agencies, and people who have particular expertise.  All that is embodied in this situation of openness, consultation, consensus, dialogue and progress together in the interests of our city and our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are very proud of our Taoiseach and of his contribution not alone to this city and this country but right across the European Community.  His contributions are acknowledged, as are the qualities he possesses, the leadership he gives, the commitments he has, his ability to achieve progress, to get decisions which are sustainable, which can be achieved, which are realisable and practical and which in totality embrace all that is good for our country and for our community. That is the kind of situation we want to continue.  I have no doubt as a public representative and I can assure the House that irrespective of who is Taoiseach that <Col N="1392" /> same attitude will prevail, that same respect will be there for Dublin city, for the Lord Mayor in office, the corporation and for the key role particular people play, whether they be in agencies or in professions or whatever.  We should accept that, as Members of this House, as Members of the Oireachtas, that commitment will be continued and that we have mutual respect for one another, irrespective of the office we hold.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has made my point on this.  He has given us a list as long as two arms of the various bodies the Taoiseach will consult.  Maybe he will and maybe he will not.  I do not see any Taoiseach having consultations with all those bodies the Minister named when it came to filling a number of vacancies on a board like this.  If the Minister says he will, then I suppose he will.  They may well be asked for their views.</P>
      <P>The central point Senator Hederman and I have made, and indeed which has been made over and over again by Members on the Government side, is that in all this Dublin Corporation is not just another body to be consulted, Dublin Corporation is central to the entire exercise. Many of the ideas came from them. Much of the day-to-day underground work will be carried out by Dublin Corporation, with their particular expertise. I do not speak for Senator Hederman but I imagine that part of the purpose behind this amendment is to recognise the special position of Dublin Corporation over and above any of the numerous worthy bodies the Minister has mentioned. In fact, the more the Minister explains the thinking behind it, the more I am convinced that this modest amendment is right.</P>

It was implied in some of the contributions that if a Taoiseach or a Minister does not come from Dublin, he will not be sensitive to the needs of Dublin or aware of the problems of Dublin.

      <P>I want to put the record straight.  I never suggested as Senator Haughey said that, automatically, a future Taoiseach will be insensitive to the needs of the capital. What I am saying is that we might have a Taoiseach who might not be sensitive. I am not suggesting that he might necessarily be from Senator Haughey's party. It is not for always and ever that they will be Fianna Fáil Taoisigh.  We might have a Taoiseach from any party and he might not be sensitive to the needs of the capital city.  If you fail to understand that, sadly, you fail to understand the whole idea of what the city is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no reflection on anybody who comes from a farm in the most remote rural part of Ireland that they simply would not understand the whole idea and vitality of a capital city in the same way as a person who lived in, was brought up in and was familiar with a capital city. The whole idea of urbanity is special to people who live in a city.  The Greek philosopher Euripides said, &ldquo;The first requisite to happiness is birth in a great city.&rdquo;  That in itself implies that people who are born in a great city have a particular understanding.  I am very much a city person and I am the very first to admit that I have a very poor appreciation of many things in rural parts of Ireland, that my husband, for instance, who was <Col N="1394" /> born and brought up in a remote village in County Limerick, would understand. It is rather pathetic for Senator Haughey to suggest that all future Taoisigh would have that appreciation or understanding of the needs of a capital city in the way that we would hope the Lord Mayor of Dublin or a Taoiseach who was living in the city might do.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to bring the business of Dublin City Council on to the floor of this Chamber but since the Minister mentioned them I feel obliged to reply.  No one will be excluded from the civil charter. It will be open to every member of the City Council to support it, to sign it and go forward with it.  No member of the City Council will be excluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is irrelevant whether the Taoiseach appoints the directors or not, it is what they do with the appointment that matters.  As far as I am concerned, the task would be to see that people who are appointed to bodies like this ensure that our cities are fit to live in, not just for certain sections of the population but for the great mass of the people.  This involves the dual problem of keeping the urban fabric and the urban infrastructure in good condition, so that the flight from the city will not happen as regularly as in the past.  With this urban renewal, that sort of flight out of the urban areas will, to some extent, be reduced.  We all want to see a Dublin that works for all the citizens, where all our citizens can work, relax and have good business interests.  It is not a matter of argument to me who appoints the directors of Temple Bar Renewal Limited or anything else.  It is irrelevant.  Their terms of reference, what we expect of them as citizens and whether we will have proper consultation under the local government review should be the real criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also have to think about the integrated plan for Dublin.  You cannot have Temple Bar on its own.  There is the cathedral area, the Liberties and so on. Things must blend in.  We should not get hung up about who will make the appointments.  The hangup is about the abuses that have taken place down the <Col N="1395" /> years and the abuses that can take place if we do not look at how local neighbourhoods are developing in relation to one another and how we deal with the development of the Temple Bar area in relation to urban renewal as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senators are missing the point.  Dublin Corporation are fully involved at every level of the Temple Bar development process.  That will continue. It is absolutely vital to the success of this Bill and the success of the subsequent Temple Bar Act that the development process continue, particularly with Dublin Corporation.  It is more important that this consultation happens.  I do not think there is any necessity for any further formalisation of the consultation process lest we exclude <Col N="1396" /> other key people or key groups who may emerge in the future and because we have included a particular group.  It is important that we maintain consultation, keep the book open and that the consultation process is done through the Taoiseach of the day in consultation with the Lord Mayor of Dublin of the day.  I have no doubt that these lines of communication will always be open and I am very confident that if we leave it open, it will be to the advantage of the Bill when it is passed and becomes law and to the advantage of the whole development of Temple Bar.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is cúis athais dom bheith ar ais arís don dara huair inniu leis an mBille seo.</P>
      <P>This Bill forms the first part of a package of legislative reforms which the Minister for Justice proposes to introduce in relation to the courts and the legal profession.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for substantial increases in the monetary limits of the civil jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts.  These proposals are contained in sections 2 and 4 of the Bill.  In the case of the Circuit Court the existing jurisdiction limit of £15,000 in contract and tort matters will be increased to £30,000.  The District Court's jurisdiction limit in contract and tort will be increased from £2,500 to £5,000.</P>
      <P>The Bill also includes a number of other important provisions.  These include provision for the variation in future by Government order of the monetary limits of the jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts, provisions dealing with the costs that may be recovered when a case is taken in a higher court than is necessary, an increase in the number of judges of the High and Circuit Courts and in the number of justices of the District Court, a change in the &ldquo;style&rdquo; of address of judges of the District Court and provisions for the service by post of District Court summonses in cases of summary jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current civil jurisdiction limits of <Col N="1400" /> the Circuit and District Courts were set in the Courts Act, 1981.  The jurisdiction of these courts were fixed originally by the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, and were increased first in 1953, and again by the Courts Act, 1971 and most recently by the Courts Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>The proposed increased civil jurisdiction limits for the Circuit and District Court, which represent a doubling of the existing limits, are justified on the basis of changes in the cost of living which have occurred since the last revision.</P>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission in its recent report into restrictive practices in the legal profession suggested that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court should be increased to £25,000 and that the jurisdiction of the District Court should be increased to £5,000.  The proposals in the Bill go somewhat further than the limit recommended by the Fair Trade Commission in the case of the Circuit Court and provide that the new jurisdiction limit of that court will be £30,000.  A number of other jurisdictions of the Circuit Court which have traditionally been linked to the contract and tort limit will also be similarly increased.</P>
    <P>The Circuit Court jurisdiction limit in actions relating to the title of land and equity matters are fixed at £200 rateable valuation by the Courts Act, 1981. However, the court's jurisdiction under the Registration of Title Act, 1964, is limited to land with a rateable valuation not exceeding £60.  The Bill provides for an increase in the Circuit Court's jurisdiction in registration of title matters from £60 to £200 which will bring it into line with its jurisdiction limit in other actions concerning land.</P>
    <P>As in the case of the Circuit Court, it is proposed to increase the other jurisdiction limits of the District Court which are traditionally linked with that court's contract and tort limit to the revised limit of £5,000.</P>
    <P>The principal objective in increasing the jurisdiction limits of the lower courts is to make access to the courts cheaper, speedier and more convenient.  The proposed increases in the jurisdiction of the lower courts should allow a greater range <Col N="1401" /> of cases to be dealt with in these courts and thereby make access to the courts less costly though savings in legal costs, travelling costs and time absent from work for both litigants and witnesses.</P>
    <P>The increased jurisdiction limits should result in more personal injuries actions being heard in the lower courts and this should have a major beneficial effect on the cost of motor insurance.  The Government are concerned about the continuing problem of the high cost availability of motor, employer and public liability insurance.  These increased jurisdiction limits are important measures to help deal with that problem by cutting court litigation costs which are a significant element in the cost of insurance claims.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes, in sections 11 and 12, to increase the jurisdiction of the lower courts in important areas of family law.  It provides for an increase in the weekly amount that the District Court, and the Circuit Court on appeal, may order under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, for the maintenance of a spouse and dependent child, from £100 to £200 for a spouse and from £30 to £60 for a child.  These increases will assist many deserted spouses in obtaining substantially increased maintenance for themselves and their children.</P>
    <P>A similar increase in the weekly amount that may be awarded by the District Court for the maintenance of a child under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, from £30 to £60 is also proposed.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Bill contains an important provision which will allow the Government in future to revise, by order, the monetary limits of these courts having regard to changes in the general value of money since the limits were previously revised.  This provision will avoid the necessity of amending legislation each time the Government consider that the jurisdiction limits should be revised to take account of changes in the value of money.  It will, therefore, be possible to maintain the real value of the monetary limits of the lower courts at the levels approved by the Oireachtas in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 16 will apply <Col N="1402" /> to all monetary jurisdiction limits conferred on the courts in civil matters, whether conferred in courts legislation or in other enactments.  It will also allow for the variation of amounts specified in section 14 of this Bill in regard to the recovery of costs by a plaintiff in a civil action.  I will return to this matter later.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that, because of the importance of any decision to increase the jurisdiction limits of the lower courts, a motion of both Houses of the Oireachtas approving of any proposed Government draft order will be required before the order can take effect.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes provisions at sections 17, 18 and 19 for increasing the numbers of the Judiciary.  The maximum number of High Court judges is being increased from 14 to 16, in addition to the President of the High Court.  This increase will allow the High Court to cope with the increased workload resulting from the Criminal Law (Rape) Amendment Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>The number of permanent ordinary judges of the Circuit Court is being increased from 15 to 17.  Provision is being made for eight Circuit Court judges to be assigned permanently to the Dublin circuit and two to the Cork circuit.  At present six judges are permanently assigned to the Dublin circuit and one judge to each of the other circuits.  The number of permanent justices of the District Court is being increased from 39 to 45, in addition to the President of the District Court.</P>
    <P>These increases in the numbers of the Judiciary in the lower courts are necessary to enable these courts to deal with their current workload which has necessitated the appointment of two temporary Circuit Court judges and six temporary justices of the District Court.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides for a change in the mode or style of address of judges of the District Court from &ldquo;justice&rdquo; to &ldquo;judge&rdquo;. Under the Constitution, district justices are judges but they have been styled as &ldquo;justices&rdquo; since the foundation of the State.  The existing statutory provisions are contained in the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Act, 1961, <Col N="1403" /> which provides that each judge of the District Court shall be styled &ldquo;justice of the District Court&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The proposed change in the style of address from &ldquo;justice&rdquo; to &ldquo;judge&rdquo; will come into effect three months after the Bill is passed.  This will allow for the passing of other Bills currently before the Oireachtas which contain a reference to a &ldquo;justice of the District Court&rdquo;, without having to amend them.  As and from the commencement date, all references to &ldquo;justice&rdquo; contained in any statute or statutory instrument in operation on that date, will be construed as references to a judge of the District Court by virtue of section 21 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The District Court deals with a substantial amount of the business which comes before our courts.  It has a significant and vital role in the administration of justice.  It is, therefore, appropriate that a judge of the District Court should be addressed as &ldquo;judge&rdquo; and I am sure that this proposal will be widely welcomed.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill is a comprehensive provision which proposes to amend the existing law governing the recovery of costs by a plaintiff in a civil action by substituting a new section 17 in the Courts Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>It is essential if this Bill is to lead to a reduction in legal costs that plaintiffs are encouraged to take actions in the lowest court with jurisdiction to hear them.  The principle of limiting the costs which a plaintiff may recover when he proceeds in a higher court than is necessary was given statutory effect in section 12 of the Courts Act, 1936.  However, that section applied only to certain types of actions.  It was replaced by section 17 of the Courts Acts, 1981, which extended the principle to all types of actions.</P>
    <P>Section 17 of the 1981 Act gives a wide discretion to the courts to award costs in excess of the level of costs appropriate to the lowest court with jurisdiction to hear an action.  Experience has shown that further restrictions are necessary.  Section 14 of the Bill, therefore, proposes to limit the courts' discretion to award higher <Col N="1404" /> costs to cases in the High Court where damages between £25,000 and £30,000 are awarded.  In such cases Circuit Court costs only will be payable unless the judge certifies that it was reasonable, in the interests of justice, that the action should have been determined in the High Court. In the case of an action taken in the High Court, where the damages awarded are between £15,000 and £25,000, Circuit Court costs will only be recoverable and where damages are between £5,000 and £15,000 a successful plaintiff will be entitled to recover the lesser of an amount equivalent to the damages awarded or the amount of costs at the Circuit Court level.</P>
    <P>A further disincentive to taking an action in a higher court than necessary is included in the provisions of subsection (5) of the new section 17 of the Courts Act, 1981.  The courts are being given a new discretionary power to penalise a successful plaintiff who takes an action in a court other than the lowest court with jurisdiction, by requiring the plaintiff to pay to the defendant the equivalent of the additional costs incurred by the defendant in having to defend the action in a higher court than was necessary.</P>
    <P>This provision reflects the Government's determination to effect a real reduction in legal costs as a consequence of the increases in the jurisdiction of the lower courts proposed in the Bill while at the same time providing reasonable scope to a plaintiff in deciding on the appropriate court in which to commence an action if he is not to be penalised in relation to the amount of costs he might recover.</P>
    <P>A further provision in the Bill in section 15 will enable the Circuit Court to transfer actions to the District Court at the request of a party to an action where the court decides that the action should have been commenced in the District Court.  In an action for unliquidated damages which is remitted to the District Court that court will be empowered to make an award up to £10,000, that is, twice its proposed new jurisdiction limit. The High Court has power already to <Col N="1405" /> remit a case to the Circuit or District Court on similar grounds.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides that the District Court will be empowered to hear and determine an action above its statutory limit of £5,000 where the parties to the action consent.  This section should further assist litigants to keep legal costs as low as possible.  A similar provision operates already in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>A further reforming measure in the Bill, in section 22, provides for the service of summonses by registered post in summary cases.  Under the existing law summonses must be served personally by the gardaí.  The vast bulk of these summonses relate to road traffic offences.</P>
    <P>Personal service of summonses is a costly and time consuming procedure. The proposed mode of service, when implemented, will release about 60 gardaí in the Dublin area who are at present assigned to summons service duties.  When the new provision is fully implemented it should be possible to release a further 70 gardaí in the rest of the country who are fully occupied on this work for operational duties.  In addition to releasing gardaí for operational duties, the new system should effect an improved rate of summons service and result in an increase in revenue to the State.</P>
    <P>This new mode of service will not replace the existing system of personal service of summonses which will be retained for summonses which cannot be served by post, but it will provide a more efficient method of summons service suited to modern circumstances and will allow for the reallocation of Garda manpower resources to deal with the problem of crime.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill effecting changes in the jurisdiction limits of the Circuit and District Courts will come into effect one month after the passing of the Bill.  Other proposals that require rules of court to be made as a procedures will come into force after three months.  The proposal to change the style of address of judges of the District Court will also come into effect three months after the Bill is passed.  The proposals for increases <Col N="1406" /> in the judiciary will come into effect immediately.</P>
    <P>As I indicated at the outset, this Bill represents part of a package of legislative reforms which are planned in relation to the courts and the legal profession.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice proposes to introduce a Court and Court Officers Bill which will include provision for establishing a new Court of Civil Appeal.  Generally, the intention is that the Court of Civil Appeal would hear appeals from decisions of the High Court, other than appeals in the more important cases involving issues of law and appeals in constitutional actions.</P>
    <P>Last year the Fair Trade Commission published a very comprehensive report on its study into restrictive practices in the legal profession.  The Minister for Justice will be introducing a Solicitors (Amendment) Bill very shortly.  It will be major legislation which will take account of the various recommendations made by the Fair Trade Commission for changes in the law relating to solicitors.</P>
    <P>The Bill will include important provisions relating to the disciplinary provisions governing solicitors, including the system for dealing with complaints and various new measures for the protection of solicitors' clients.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has had discussions with the Bar Council about the Fair Trade Commission's recommendations relating to the barristers' profession. The Council have recently decided to introduce a number of changes in the profession and this is a most welcome development.</P>
    <P>A new procedure in the District Court for dealing with small claims, which will not require legislation, is being established. The small claims procedure will be established as soon as the necessary rules of court have been made.  Small claims procedures operate successfully in other jurisdictions and it is hoped that the new procedure will provide a mechanism for resolving small claims against suppliers of faulty goods or services.  A problem up to now has been the prohibitive cost of taking an action to court where the claim is for a relatively small amount.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1407" /> The procedure will be established initially on a pilot scheme basis in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court, in Cork and at two other District Court venues.  It is intended to extend the procedure to all District Court venues as soon as the pilot scheme has been fully evaluated.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes a major contribution in the area of access to justice and reform in the law relating to the courts.  It allows for an increase in the judiciary and the introduction of a modern system of summons service which should release more gardaí for operational duties.  The main objective of the Bill is to make access to the courts cheaper and quicker by increasing the civil jurisdiction limits of the Circuit and District Courts and this is being done by doubling the existing limits.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes other important measures which should assist in securing the efficient administration of justice in our courts.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has often been said that justice delayed is justice denied and it is true to say that going to court nowadays in civil cases is too often unduly complex, takes too long and can be disproportionately expensive.  The fundamental aim of a legal system and, indeed, any reform of the legal system should contain two basic criteria.  On the one hand, it must seek to improve the position of the consumer, in other words, it must seek to improve the machinery of civil justice by making access to justice simpler, quicker and more convenient and by reducing delay, costs and complexity and on the other hand, any reform must not weaken the independence of the judge and the legal practitioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas should attach special importance to the independence of the Judiciary which is enshrined in our constitution and is of special importance and significance to the continued existence of a vigorous and independent Bar.  An independent Judiciary, an independent <Col N="1408" /> Bar and two separate branches of the legal profession have been the greatest protectors of the liberty of the individual in a free society such as ours which continues to be admired throughout the world and is envied in many countries.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the courts is to serve the State and the citizen and in so doing to hold the balance between the State and the citizen and between citizen and citizen.  The legal profession is the servant and the agent of those needs and it exists for that purpose.  The qualities of integrity and fearlessness are, of course, preeminent but it is also highly important that the legal profession is responsive and sensitive to the needs of people who require the services of lawyers.</P>
    <P>As a barrister, I believe that we must never give the appearance of being remote.  It is for that reason that I welcome the statement by the Minister for Justice in the other House and the Minister of State in this House that he has made it a priority to initiate dialogue with the Bar Council on the subject of change in the profession.  I note with satisfaction that he has met with Niall Fennelly, Senior Counsel, the chairman and the other members of the Bar Council on 10 April 1991 and that he is encouraged &mdash; as he has said here this evening &mdash; by the response he has received from them and by their comprehensive proposals to make certain changes in the profession voluntarily.</P>
    <P>The road leading to reform will have to be travelled in many stages and the Minister states that this Bill is the first instalment of a programme of legislative reform in relation to the courts and the legal profession.  The main thrust of this Bill is to allow all civil cases to be dealt with at the appropriate court level and no higher.  This key conclusion is based on the view that many of the cases now being heard and handled in the High Court need not be handled there because they are not of sufficient weight or complexity to justify that.  The result should be to speed up the handling of cases remaining in the High Court and to make the cheaper, speedier and more convenient procedures and services of the <Col N="1409" /> lower courts, namely, the Circuit and District Courts, available for those cases which are smaller and less complex.  That is the intention.  The Government's intention is excellent.  We can all sit back here and admire the intention.  However, that intention will not be realised, and this is one of the glaring omissions in this Bill, unless there are adequate resources, funding and recruitment of the staff that the changes will require.</P>
    <P>At the moment we have overworked Circuit and District Courts, staff shortages on an unbelievable scale, awfully cramped court buildings and totally inadequate back-up facilities.  In this regard, the Fair Trade Commission, which has been mentioned here this evening by the Minister, in their report on the legal profession which was published on 5 March 1990 stated:</P>
    <P>The Commission has serious reservations about the extent to which the court system has been underfunded by the State.  We believe that there may not be sufficient judges or adequate numbers of court staff and it appears that court facilities are totally inadequate. While much can be done to improve the efficiency of the legal system by its participants, the Commission believes that the provision of sufficient resources and funding by the State is essential in the interests of the common good.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to increase, as the Minister has indicated, the monetary limits of the civil jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts, in the case of the Circuit Court from £15,000 to £30,000 and in the case of the District Court from £5,000 to £10,000. Thus section 2 (1) of this Bill extends the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court in contract, tort and related matters to cases where the claim does not exceed £30,000 as against £15,000 at present.  Section 4 of the Bill extends the jurisdiction of the District Court in contract and tort to cases where the claim does not exceed £5,000 as against £2,500 at present and in the case of ejectment for non-payment of <Col N="1410" /> rent or overholding in any class of tenancy to cases where the rent does not exceed £5,000 per annum as against £2,500 at present.</P>
    <P>Under the Courts Act, 1981, the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court in actions relating to title to land and in equity cases was increased to a rateable valuation not exceeding £200.  However, the Circuit Court's jurisdiction under the Registration of Title Act, 1964, remains limited to land with a rateable valuation not exceeding £60.  There is no good reason for this difference in jurisdiction and, accordingly, I welcome section 3 which increases the rateable valuation limit to £200 in the case of registration of title matters.</P>
    <P>The limits of the civil jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts were fixed originally by the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, and were increased in 1953 and 1971 largely to take account of inflation. These limits were last fixed by the Courts Act, 1981, and on that occasion the civil jurisdiction in contract, tort and related matters was fixed at £15,000 in the case of the Circuit Court and at £5,000 in the case of the District Court.  The representatives of the legal profession in their submissions to the Fair Trade Commission said they saw no good reason the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court could not be increased to £25,000 or, indeed, £30,000 where the case could be handled by a junior counsel or, where the amount was still important to the plaintiff, perhaps by one senior counsel as well.  This would probably, as they pointed out, necessitate increasing the jurisdiction of the District Court to relieve some of the additional burden on the Circuit Court which would probably in turn make the creation of a special small claims court below the District Court all the more urgent.  The representatives of the legal profession also pointed out that previous increases in the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court had not been accompanied by an increase in the number of judges or resources with the result that certain areas of Circuit Court activity might have to be transferred back to the High Court. <Col N="1411" /> The Bill proposes to increase the jurisdiction of the lower courts in important areas of family law and I welcome the proposals here.  Section 11 of the Bill increases the maximum maintenance order available in the District Court under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, from £100 to £200 per week in the case of a spouse and from £30 to £60 in the case of a child.  Section 12 of the Bill increases the maximum maintenance order available in the District Court and in the Circuit Court on appeal under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, from £30 to £60 per week.</P>
    <P>In the past it has been necessary for the Government to bring in amending legislation each time they wish to increase the jurisdictional limits of the Circuit and District Courts.  I, therefore, welcome the proposal in section 16, an important provision which will enable the Government in future to vary by order the monetary limits of the lower courts having regard to the changes in the general value of money since those limits were last fixed.  However, because of the importance of any decision to increase jurisdictional limits of the lower courts, a draft of any proposed order must be approved by each house of the Oireachtas before such an order can be made.  This is also welcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the Dáil and the Minister of State here referred to another initiative in the courts area which they say does not require legislation, and that is the introduction of the small claims procedure in the District Court.  The representatives of the Bar Council in their submission to the Fair Trade Commission stated they felt that the original concept of the District Court has unfortunately been lost because it has become too formalised. Indeed, it has to deal with some very complicated matters.  They could see no objection to there being a separate and smaller lower jurisdiction of absolute simplicity to which people could resort without a lawyer.  Moreover, they felt that if the burden on the District Court <Col N="1412" /> was increased as will be done under this legislation, this would probably make the creation of a special small claims court all the more urgent.</P>
    <P>The Royal Commission which reported on the courts and on the legal services in the United Kingdom examined the small claims procedure as it operates there and found that it has proved its worth.  I suggest that the pilot schemes should be of short duration and this system should be extended nationwide.  Under the procedure a claimant may, instead of issuing a civil process in the ordinary way, apply to have a claim not exceeding in value £500 processed through the small claims procedure.  That procedure, of course, will not apply to claims related to personal injuries, damages arising from a road traffic accident, hire purchase, leasing or other loan arrangements.  Application will be made on the appropriate form to the small claims registrar at the nearest District Court.  The registrar will attempt to settle the claim between the parties; he may interview the parties themselves or any other person who may be relevant in assessing the claim.  If a settlement between the parties is reached particulars of the settlement will be recorded by the registrar.  If the registrar cannot effect settlement between the parties he will refer the matter for hearing to the District Court.</P>
    <P>The Minister also indicated that he intends to bring in another Bill, the Courts and Courts Officers Bill, which will deal in particular with the setting up of a new Court of Civil Appeal.  Practice has shown that many of the cases now being handled in the Supreme Court need not be dealt with there because they are not of sufficient weight or complexity to justify it.  The setting up of a Court of Civil Appeal should make it possible to reserve for the Supreme Court cases of unusual substance, importance and difficulty. However, I think the Minister and the Government would do well to take to heart the editorial in the June 1991 edition of <i>The Irish Law Times</i> which states:</P>
    <P>The Government is considering the <Col N="1413" /> establishment of a new Court of Civil Appeal, which will be above the High Court level, and below the Supreme Court in the hearing of appeals.  What is needed first is a general review of the organisation of the Courts system which, compared to other Common Law jurisdictions is badly suffering from a lack of infrastructure.  Article 36 of the Constitution requires that the organisation of the Courts and the distribution of jurisdiction be regulated by the Oireachtas.  Accordingly this is a subject that requires periodic review.</P>
    <P>News of this move by the Government appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 16 May 1991, although no formal Government announcement, to my knowledge, has been made of such a development.  There is no argument that there are delays in having appeals heard before the Supreme Court.  However, before embarking on the establishment of a new tier in the court structure the Government could usefully embark on a general review of the administration of justice in Ireland for submission to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  If such was done one of the most obvious defects which would require immediate redress is the complete lack of back-up facilities for judges. I would like to emphasise that fact to the Minister of State here this evening.  For example, our Supreme Court office has a registrar, an assistant registrar, who is also responsible for the Court of Criminal Appeal, and three office staff.  That staff has to deal with all matters related to the processing of appeals, inquiries from judges and the legal profession, members of the public and other matters not connected with litigation.  The Chief Justice and the President of the High Court are the only judges who have their own secretaries. On appointment to the Bench a judge receives a set of the Acts of the Oireachtas, a room and nothing else.  The judges have to buy their own books, although there is a haphazard and poorly stocked official library in the Four Courts which supposedly serves the needs of the Judiciary, from the Supreme to the District Court, a total of 84 members of the <Col N="1414" /> Judiciary and all court officials.  Usually there is only one up-to-date copy of text books and the law reports are so inadequate that it is impossible to deal with the needs of more than two or three judges at any one time.</P>
    <P>In contrast with other common law jurisdictions our courts system is desperately lacking in infrastructure.  In the United States Supreme Court judges and most superior court judges have comprehensive back-up facilities in the form of legal clerks and secretaries.  The Australian Supreme Court judges are provided with FAX machines, a library and full back-up legal services.  Not surprisingly in England, from which much of our legal system is derived, there is also a deficiency in back-up services with consequent bad results.  The editorial in <i>The Irish Law Times</i> concludes:</P>
    <P>Instead of adding yet another level, would it not make more sense to review the existing system and reform it, combined with giving the Judiciary the very basic working tools, e.g., secretarial services and proper research and assistance materials.  That would result in greatly improved productivity but to add another court without very substantially improving on the back-up facilities is to add another floor to an already shaky structure.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for an increase in the number of ordinary High Court judges, permanent Circuit Court judges and permanent district justices and this is to be welcomed.  These courts deal with a substantial volume of cases.  In this regard I welcome the statement by the Minister of State in regard to the District Court dealing with a substantial amount of the business which comes before our courts.  It has a significant and vital role in the administration of justice.  It is, therefore, appropriate that a judge of the District Court should be addressed as judge and I am sure this proposal will be widely welcomed.  I endorse what the Minister of State said in regard to the excellent work of the judges of the District Court.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the workload of those <Col N="1415" /> courts.  In the year ended 31 July 1988, the number of cases dealt with by the District Courts amounted to 729, 329, three-quarter of a million cases.  The number of cases dealt with by the Circuit Court in the period 1988-89 was 50,148 and the number of cases dealt with by the High Court in 1988-89 totalled 22,350. The effect of this very heavy workload on our judges and on our courts clearly means that the number of judges will need to be regularly reviewed and increased.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal in section 21 for the service of summonses by registered post in summary cases.  This represents, as the Minister indicated, an important change in the existing law governing the service of summonses which dates back to the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851.  At present summonses must be personally served by the Garda.  The new mode of service will be additional to and not in replacement of the existing modes of services of summonses, such as personal service.  I am glad to note that the Minister is of the opinion that with the introduction of this new system it should be possible to release about 60 gardaí who are currently full time engaged in summons service duties in the Dublin area for operational police duties and that when the system is operational nationwide it should be possible to release a further 70 gardaí outside the Dublin area for operational duties.  I hope when the Minister is considering those matters and allocating extra gardaí he will consider cities such as Limerick, Cork, Galway and Waterford.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Bill is an extension of the provisions in section 25 of the Courts Act, 1924, and section 2 of the Courts Act, 1988.  It empowers the Circuit Court to remit or transfer an action to the District Court at any time before the commencement of trial where it is satisfied that the action is fit to be prosecuted in the District Court or if it is of the opinion that the action should not have commenced in the Circuit Court in the first instance.  A similar provision already exists for the remittal or transfer of cases <Col N="1416" /> from the High Court to the Circuit and District Courts.  Section 15 (2) provides that where the case remitted is for unliquidated damages the District Court will be empowered to make an award of up to £10,000, that is twice the proposed new jurisdictional limit.  It is essential that these increases in jurisdiction, provided for in this Bill, will effect a real reduction in litigation costs and that plaintifs are encouraged to initiate their actions in the lowest court which has jurisdiction to hear them.  Thus, section 17 (1) of the Bill provides that, subject to a limited number of exceptions, a plaintiff who takes an action in a court other than the lowest court having jurisdiction, will be restricted to recovering costs appropriate to the lowest court of jurisdiciton.</P>
    <P>Finally, in regard to the commencement of the various proposals in this Bill, it is important to note that the changes in the jurisdictional limits of the Circuit and District Courts will come into effect one month after the passage of the Bill.  It is most important that practitioners, solicitors and barristers throughout the country are aware of that. Secondly, the proposals for the increase in the Judiciary will come into effect immediately and that is also welcome. The other proposals which will require rules of court to be made as regards acceptable procedures will come into force after three months.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope it will mean that litigation will be cheaper and speedier and will facilitate more convenient access to our courts.  However, I urge the Minister to consider the question of funding and the total lack of resources in our courts.  The people would be well served by that examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Indeed, the number of times I, as spokesman on Justice, have spoken in this Chamber since my election here less than two years ago clearly indicates the commitment this Government, the Minister and the Minister of State have to the reform of legislation.  It is a clear indication of the hard work the Government are doing.  I could name at <Col N="1417" /> least a dozen Bills or amending legislation that have gone through this House.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I sincerely compliment the excellent contribution by my colleague, Senator Kennedy, which was not alone excellent but was from a professional viewpoint and I fully agree with much of what he said.  I urge the Minister of State and, the Minister, Deputy Burke, to take a serious look at the lack of infrastructure which Senator Kennedy constructively criticised.  From my practical experience in the Circuit Courts of a large county like Cork there have been instances recently where Circuit Court judges refused to sit because of lack of facilities in certain outlying Circuit Courts.  As the purpose of this Bill is to bring justices to local community level, both District Court and Circuit Court accommodation must be greatly improved, plus the services that go with them.  This point was raised by Senator Kennedy and I fully support him.  Admittedly, because of financial constraints, it is impossible to cover all of this overnight. I agree that some of the Circuit Courts in the Cork area have been improved over the past number of years but much work has still to be done.  If we are to have an increased workload, whether it be in the High Court, the Circuit Court or the District Court, it is imperative that the services available to the Judiciary be improved.</P>
      <P>I also concur with my colleague in his general praise of the Judiciary from the Supreme Court down to the district justices. I am delighted that this change in title from district justice to judge will soon come into effect.  It is a welcome change and a title they deserve because District Court justices do an excellent job.  For the past ten or 12 years I have had dealings with a number of district justices and their quality, professionalism and contribution to the Judicial system are worthy of the highest praise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall work, communication and liaison of the Bar Council and the Law Society with the Minister and the Government in helping to bring in reforming legislation must not go unnoticed.  I compliment the Law Society <Col N="1418" /> in this regard and welcome the fact that negotiations are ongoing with the Bar Council in an effort to reform and speed up legislation to make the courts more accessible and cost efficient to the general public.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specifics of the Bill, I made written submissions to the Minister before coming into the House about the clogging up of our courts system, particularly in relation to civil matters. Basically, my submission was that the jurisdiction in the Circuit Court should be doubled to £30,000, which has been done and is most welcome and prudent. My submission in relation to the District Court was a little more ambitious.  I felt they should have jurisdiction up to £7,500 and I regret that this level has not been achieved.  However, there is an inbuilt provision in the legislation whereby at a future date, either the current Minister or a future Minister, with the co-operation of both Houses of the Oireachtas, can, by order, increase the level of jurisdiction of the various courts.</P>
    <P>This is a very sensible provision.  It eliminates the need to introduce new legislation, a procedure we all know can be cumbersome and slow.  This in-built provision will enable us in the future to widen the jurisdiction in line with inflation.  I consider the sum of £7,500 to be more appropriate to the District Court.  Having practised for some years in the District Court and observed that in many minor accident cases where there are no personal injuries involved and there is a simple material damage claim, bearing in mind that very few cars are valued at less than £10,000 or £12,000, it would be more appropriate to have these matters dealt with by the district justice. Nevertheless, the provisos in the Bill in relation to the District and Circuit Courts are most welcome.</P>
    <P>It will alleviate the backlog in relation to the High Court in particular and this is one of the purposes of the Bill.  In Cork there is a backlog as far as High Court cases are concerned with delays of up to three and four years.  Admittedly, those <Col N="1419" /> provisions will help but I urge the Minister to request the Government to appoint at least one, if not two permanent High Court judges in Cork.  Those appointments would alleviate the problem there.  Of all the High Court sittings throughout the country in which I have been involved &mdash; in Limerick, Sligo, Galway and Kilkenny &mdash; Cork is the slowest.  If one takes a High Court action in Cork the case may not be heard for three to four years; in Dublin the delay is less than 18 months or a year.  The delay in Cork should be thoroughly examined. The increase in the number of appointments of High Court judges, Circuit Court judges and District Court judges is welcome and will help but Cork deserves special attention because of its huge population.  The High Court service there is less than adequate.</P>
    <P>Like my colleague Senator Kennedy I, too, welcome the announcement that a small claims procedures is to be set up in the District Court.  I urge that this be implemented, if at all possible, in the next session by the Government.  Fewer cases would then have to go before the District Courts.  Many minor claims could be settled by a small courts registrar where the complainant and the other party could meet and try to resolve a trivial matter without going to litigation. As a practising solicitor I know how frustrating it can be at times to deal with claims of less than £100 or £200 where they drag on for months through the District Court and may be appealed to the Circuit Court.  Many of these cases, if tackled early could be dealt with by a small courts registrar which I understand, would be operated by the District Court clerk.  This procedure would alleviate the current problem in the courts.  It would be almost virtually free &mdash; only a nominal fee would be payable &mdash; and it would be efficient.  Hopefully, this legislation will be implemented in the next term.</P>
    <P>Another welcome provision has been announced today, that is, the setting up of a Court of Civil Appeal.  The Supreme Court would then be free to deal with <Col N="1420" /> urgent, constitutional and serious matters and the Court of Civil Appeal would deal with matters of civil appeal from the High Court.  I understand the point made by Senator Kennedy in relation to whether the creation of an extra tier alleviates or resolves the problem.  In my view it will help.  While I support the Minister's call for better infrastructure in the courts and better back-up services for judges, I believe setting up this court would free the Supreme Court from a mass of unnecessary appeals which clog up the highest court in our land.  The Supreme Court should confine themselves to dealing with very serious matters, particularly constitutional matters with which the High Court does not have jurisdiction to deal.  I am sure the Minister will take on board the points made by Senator Kennedy reported in the <i>Irish Law Times</i>.  It is important that the Bar Council and the Law Society are consulted about the setting up and operation of this court.</P>
    <P>Apart from an increase in the jurisdiction in the Circuit and District Courts, in cases relating to land disputes and equity matters the jurisdiction has been increased from £60 to £200.  This is a welcome provision.</P>
    <P>The courts have also increased jurisdiction in relation to family law matters and the maintenance and support of spouses and children.  This is a very crucial decision.  Since I qualified as a solicitor 12 or 13 years ago, these matters, unfortunately, have come more and more to the fore.  Marital breakdowns are reasonably common nowadays with more applications to the Circuit Court and many are initiated in the District Court, for the support and maintenance of children. I welcome the provision to increase the maximum allowed in the District Court for the maintenance of a child from £30 to £60 and for a spouse from £100 to £200.  This is a far seeing provision; it is prudent and necessary.  It will certainly give greater scope and importance to an application by a spouse or a child in the case of desertion in both the District and Circuit Courts.  This too is most welcome.</P>
    <P>I touched on an issue earlier, and I now <Col N="1421" /> want to expand a little on it, that is, the important provision inserted in this legislation in relation to the index linking of claims and jurisdictions for future reference. Over the next five or six years, depending on inflation, this situation will have to be looked at again.  Rather than having to go through the process of bringing a Bill through both Houses, this can now be done by a Government order.  Of course, it will have to be sanctioned by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is a prudent and welcome decision.</P>
    <P>The increase in the number of Circuit Court judges from 15 to 17 is most welcome. The increase in the number of District Court judges from 39 to 45 is also welcome.  In both cases the number of 17 and 45 excludes the President of each court.  This is certainly a step in the right direction.  Another important provision in section 21 of the Bill relates to the service of summonses by registered post in summary cases.  As a practising lawyer I know the time consumed, even in rural Ireland, by gardaí trying to locate people to serve them with summonses.  This provision is covered in the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, where summonses were obliged to be served by members of the Garda but this has now been repealed. We will see the spin-off effect to the benefit of the Garda force whereby I believe 60 gardaí in Dublin who were totally taken up with the bureaucracy involved in serving summons will now be released for other duties which is most welcome.  A national figure of 70 gardaí engaged in serving summons is mentioned and if we were to quantify the amount of time spent by gardaí in rural Ireland trying to serve summons then the figure of 70 would be the lowest estimate and it could be much greater.  In rural areas it is sometimes necessary for a Garda to make four or five visits on a bike or in a squad car to serve a simple summons in a summary matter.  This most welcome provision will not alone create revenue benefit but will improve the operation of our police system and will relieve gardaí of an onerous and difficult task by allowing summons to be served by registered post.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1422" /> The Bill also provides for the transfer of a case to the District Court from the Circuit Court if one of the parties applies and the figure for unliquidated damages with which the District Court may deal has been raised to £10,000.  This is a welcome provision and I would also like to welcome a matter touched on by my colleague &mdash; the disincentive written into this new legislation to discourage litigants from going into Circuit and High Courts where it is obvious that a court of lower jurisdiction is sufficient.  Congestion in the courts system is frequently caused by litigants who insist on taking their case to the High Court although advised by solicitors and counsel that their action could be resolved at Circuit Court level and these new provisions, coupled with the increase in jurisdiction, will make people think twice in this regard.  Some people have the idea that by getting into the High Court they win the lottery and under this provision people will be discouraged from taking High Court action since if the amount awarded falls below a certain level the litigant will be penalised financially.  Discretion in this matter existed in previous legislation but this new legislation makes it more or less obligatory to penalise where certain jurisdiction limits are exceeded and this in important.</P>
    <P>As my colleague on the other side will be aware, there is already sufficient clogging up of the High Court and Circuit Court with petty cases which should be resolved at District Court level or, in the Circuit Court where the figure for awards is now £30,000.  There are times when marginal cases arise and here the practising lawyer will have an obligation to his or her client to advise them to take a case to the High Court if the limit of £30,00 may be exceeded.  In the event of a marginal case no penalty will be imposed by way of costs.</P>
    <P>I have covered most of the points in the Bill and in the Minister's speech and, like Senator Kennedy who made an excellent professional contribution, I welcome this Bill and urge its speedy passage through the House.  It is notable that while the past three or four debates <Col N="1423" /> here concerning the Garda, justice and the prison system attracted a full bench on the left, including Independents, to criticise the Minister and the Government, they are absent tonight.  They should be present here to welcome this legislation; when there is good news nobody is here to welcome it except our friends in Fine Gael and in most justice debates they have offered constructive criticism.  Tonight the Labour and Independent benches are empty although it is not long since they were on their feet here criticising the Minister, Deputy Burke, the Minister of State and the Government for their management of the prison services, and Garda, etc.  It is a shame they are not here tonight to commend this excellent legislation and to urge it through the House.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Senators who have spoken, in particular Senator Kennedy and Senator O'Donovan, for their very positive contributions. I understand for Senator O'Donavan's information that the members of the left are overseeing the printing of the new civic charter so perhaps that is the reason they are not here.</P>
      <P>Senator Kennedy in a very wide-ranging and excellent contribution spoke about the strengths of the legal profession and welcomed the dialogue which the Minister for Justice has initiated with the Bar Council in relation to the barristers profession.  He welcomed the proposals in the Bill which are intended to make access to justice cheaper, speedier and more convenient but argued that the objective will not be achieved due to lack of provision for support staff, for court facilities and more judges.  This was also referred to by my colleague Senator O'Donovan in another excellent contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Criticism had been levelled for sometime at a number of aspects of the court service, in particular the staffing of court offices and courthouse accommodation. In considering this criticism the overall question of financial resources is a major <Col N="1424" /> factor.  Money for the court service is, of course, voted annually by the Houses of the Oireachtas; the courts Vote for 1991 contains the substantial sum of £11.63 million for salaries for a total staff of 700 officers.  I should mention that until the legislation has been in operation for some time it will not be possible to say definitively what effect it will have on the business of the courts and whether in time it will have staffing implications.  I can assure the House that the position will be kept under review by my Department and the possible need for additional resources will be fully considered should it arise.</P>
    <P>I accept that many of our courthouses are not up to the standards which we all aspire to and desire.  The provision and maintenance of most courthouse accommodation is the responsibility of local authorities.  This arrangement has not worked satisfactorily over the years because of the reluctance of local authorities to spend money on these important buildings.  Many of them are special, unique period buildings with a distinctive architecture and in my view not alone have they a legislative and a legal function to perform but it is important from an architectural and a heritage point of view that we preserve many of these outstanding buildings.  It is for this reason and also because it was considered that courthouses should be a central rather than a local responsibility that the Government agreed in March 1990 to transfer this financial responsibility to the Exchequer.  An allocation of funds in this regard has been provided for in the courts Vote of 1991.</P>
    <P>A number of major improvement works are already underway and my Department are reviewing the question of courthouse accommodation with the intention of drawing up a list of priorities and a programme of refurbishment.  I can confirm to the House that the Department are in favour of refurbishing courthouses according to the order of priority which is being drawn up.  A number of courthouses have already been improved.  Facilities have been upgraded and better services are being provided <Col N="1425" /> for Judiciary, litigants and the public in general and we will continue with this programme as resources become available.</P>
    <P>Senators Kennedy and O'Donovan expressed a worry that the District and Circuit Courts will not be able to cope with the huge increase in cases that will arise in those courts due to the doubling of their jurisdictions under the Bill but the increases in jurisdiction limits of the District and Circuit Courts relate only to the civil business in those courts.  In the case of the District Court, civil business accounts for about 14 per cent of total business in that court.  There has been a decline in the number of civil cases dealt with in that court in recent years due no doubt to inflation of the present jurisdiction limits set in 1981.  The initial effect of the increase in the jurisdiction of the District Court would be to restore the volume of civil business to that handled in that court a few years ago.</P>
    <P>There has been a decline also in the volume of civil business handled by the Circuit Court in recent years.  The number of ordinary civil bills entered declined from 31,758 in 1981 to 25,885 in 1989, the most recent year for which complete figures are available.  Here, again, the effect of the increase in jurisdiction will be to restore the volume of civil business handled in that court to previous levels.</P>
    <P>Another consideration in the case of the Circuit Court is that the trials of rape offences and offences involving aggravated sexual assault have been transferred now to the High Court.  These cases are often complex and time consuming.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy raised points about the availability of legal books for judges and the question of back-up facilities in the courts.  There is no difficulty in providing legal books to the judges' library and we will have a computerised system of judgments available to the judges' library very shortly.</P>
    <P>As regards computerisation in the courts, our Department are continuing with the ongoing development of computerisation <Col N="1426" /> for the courts.  A number of projects are in hand at present which will make existing manual systems more effective.  For example, in the central office of the High Court work has commenced on computerisation following the successful completion of two feasibility studies.  The Probate Office in Dublin is being linked by computer to the 14 local registries throughout the country which, when completed should improve the issue of grants of probate.</P>
    <P>Word processing facilities are now available in an increasing number of court offices and a network is at present being installed in the Dublin Circuit Court office to assist in case tracking.  Plans are well advanced for the introduction of a computerised jury selection system in Dublin and at certain other provincial venues.  The testing of a computerised package for dealing with accounts in the family law area will commence later this year in Dublin.  Our Department are keeping in close touch with developments in other jurisdictions in relation to computerisation and plans in this regard for the further development of our own court system are under continuous review.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan would have preferred a new limit of £7,500 for the District Court.  The Government decided to implement the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission to set a new limit of £5,000.  That limit would also be closer to what would be justified by reference to inflation since the limits were last set ten years ago in 1981.</P>
    <P>I would like to re-echo my sincere gratitude to the House and to the Senators who have so eloquently contributed to this important Bill.  I am confident that with their co-operation we can have this Bill enacted into law during the summer recess.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his comments in regard to Senator O'Donovan and myself and I thank Senator O'Donovan also for his very kind remarks.  It is most important that the Minister would consider reviewing and increasing the number of judges for the future and the level of staffing also should be urgently examined.  I do not want to go over the debate again but it is not good enough to suggest that it may not be necessary to provide any extra staffing.  It is quite clear that the Circuit and District Courts will now have a very heavy workload and I think that the Minister, being a reasonable man would agree that the level of staffing will have to be examined.</P>
      <P>I welcome his comments regarding the need for back-up services for judges but I think he will appreciate that the situation is very bad at present.  Judges are very patient people when one considers that only the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court currently have full-time secretaries.  The question of back-up service facilities for judges will have to be examined, especially if we want, as Senator O'Donovan has indicated, judges to travel in circuit and indeed to become High Court judges in Cork, Limerick or elsewhere.  I urge the Minister to examine these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food for coming into the House on this motion and I look forward to his reply with great interest.  I would like for the benefit of the House to briefly outline the background to this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company concerned which is situated in the heartland of Leitrim launched a mineral water product called Blue Mountain on a test basis on 1 August 1989 and it is now a commercial reality. The company controls 100 per cent of the Irish five litre market and hopes to break into the market in the United Kingdom, <Col N="1429" /> Germany and the Benelux countries. They have tapped into a niche market which they wish to expand and to do so they require a new plant.  The company has worked with the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to acquire recognition for its natural mineral water. They also intend having their water tested by the FRESIMUS Institute in Germany and the valued endorsement of this renowned centre will give them a decided marketing advantage.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of Industrial Development the recently formed Arigna task force recommended that all natural resources should be explored and this is what Wingrove Products intend to do by marketing their Blue Mountain product.  As the Minister will be aware, the Arigna task force was set up under the aegis of the Department of Energy, the Department of Industry and Commerce and representatives of the local authorities directly affected by the closure of the Arigna mines in north Roscommon-mid Leitrim last year with the loss of 150 jobs.</P>
    <P>My concern centres around the perceived attitude of the Industrial Development Authority towards applications from this company for capital grant aid. To exploit the natural resource located at the facility in the form of mineral spring water it is bottled in distinctive packaging and is distributed direct to supermarkets, hotels and health shops throughout Ireland North and South.</P>
    <P>The principal involved in the company has a proven track record in the mineral water business going back over 20 years. It is an act of faith on his part that at this stage in an illustrious business career he has launched yet another enterprise in his home town.  The difficulty the IDA face in attracting enterpreneurs and industry to this country is well known.  It is a highly competitive market and the impressive document which contains the 1990 annual report of the Industrial Development Authority refers repeatedly to the difficulties encountered by the Authority in attracting industry here in the present economic climate.  The difficulty seems to <Col N="1430" /> centre not only on the location of industries in various regions but in getting them to come to the country initially.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that the Department of Agriculture and Food are responding to this motion because the Minister of State who is with us this evening and the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, have repeatedly referred to the food sector in Ireland as one which should substantially grow in the years ahead in the context of 1992 and the completion of the Single Market.  After all, the main perception of Ireland abroad is of a clean environment whose food products are second to none.</P>
    <P>The term value added is often used by the Minister.  My native town has a natural resource, a company has been set up, a substantial amount of money is involved, the principal shareholder is prepared to invest a certain amount of that money in this plant and in his very detailed business plan has made it quite clear that the company is viable, that its products are saleable and that he can provide much needed employment in an economically depressed area.  Market research carried out by the company found a considerable market for the five litre bottle among cruiser traffic on the Shannon.  Continental holidaymakers indicated that the five litre bottle was excellent value for money.</P>
    <P>The significance of this aspect of the business report might be lost on the Department and on the Minister, which is understandable as he may not be familiar with the immediate area around the production facility in Drumshanbo.  Let me enlighten the House by briefly referring to the significant growth in cruiser traffic up the Shannon in recent years as boating holidays become more popular.  The House will be aware that the Government are committed to the spending to almost £30 million on the reopening of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal, a major engineering project and probably the biggest engineering project here of its type this century.  When opened in the mid-nineties this canal will link with the Erne and Shannon waterways to provide one of the longest stretches of navigable <Col N="1431" /> waterway in Europe.  The hope is that the remainder of the Lough Allen Canal will be reopened to allow access into the first lake in the Shannon which would further enhance the tourist potential of the area and attract substantially more visitors as years go on.</P>
    <P>The company has obviously done its research well and see this as a growth market.  It makes the point that there are at present 500 cruisers for hire on the Shannon for six months of the year along with 1,000 privately owned boats.  It states that if it could penetrate this market it would sell 24,000 containers annually.  It hopes to attract 75 per cent of this market and also to break into the casual private boat user market as well. The report goes on to give in great detail the projections over the first number of years and what is of importance in the context of this motion is that the employment potential in phase one according to the company would be 37.</P>
    <P>The company is also anxious to erect a blow moulding plant at its facility in Derryhollow just outside Drumshanbo to achieve a substantial saving on the purchase price of bottles from Suffolk, England, where the company curently gets its raw material.  No company is currently carrying out this type of operation in Ireland and consequently they are anxious to have the means of production of this important raw material attached to the production facility at Derryhollow. The transport costs alone is currently 15p per bottle or 60p for a five litre bottle, adding substantially to the cost of production and ultimately to the consumer price.  The company state that the advantages of production at Drumshanbo of a blow moulding plant would reduce the cost of a five litre bottle by 30p and this would make their operation in the mineral water market extremely competitive. It would also reduce the storage problem as bottles could be blown as required. The company say the job potential in year one in the blow moulding plant would be six.</P>
    <P>Costs involved over the three phases would be of the order of £300,000 and <Col N="1432" /> the principals involved in the company believe they are as entitled as any other company in Ireland to be sympathetically considered by the Industrial Development Authority who are charged with encouraging and attracting not only foreign owned but indigenous industry.  It is unerstandable that the principals should feel somewhat frustrated and disillusioned at this point in their industrial development at not having received a more positive response from the Industrial Development Authority as regards capital grants.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Minister, not that he needs any reminding, to the report of the IDA. Under details of capital expenditure, the Industrial Development Authority define their new industry programme, and under the heading of capital grants they state:</P>
    <P>Capital grants are provided towards the cost of fixed assets including site development, buildings, new machinery and equipment.  The IDA also provides rent subsidies towards the cost of leased premises.</P>
    <P>I know that it is probably a little spurious to quote the total grant aid in County Leitrim relative to other counties in the region because it might be interpreted as a distortion of the reality because industrial development is piecemeal by its very nature.  Some areas will benefit more than others in particular years but, for the purposes of this motion, it is important to put on the record of this House that in the north-west IDA region, the total amount of grant aid is of the order of almost £6 million for 1990.  Yet, of that County Leitrim has received a little over £750,000, with the balance going to Sligo and Donegal and that is only in the current year.  I make that point only in passing because it could be argued, if one looks at the report in further detail, that other countries other regions have received considerably less. In the Minister's own county of Cork and his constituency which borders on Kerry, I note that the allocation to Cork, the south-west region, is substantially higher <Col N="1433" /> than that going to Kerry.  This is for very obvious reasons of location and the population size of Cork city, as the capital of the south.  It is relevant because there is a perception in County Leitrim that the Industrial Development Authority have, as their preferred option, development outside the county rather than in the county.</P>
    <P>I can understand an emphasis being placed, for example, on Sligo.  Sligo town is a growth centre.  I applaud and commend the IDA's activities in that area and their success over recent years in attracting substantial and significant industry to what is essentially now accepted as the capital of the north-west. In the regional development section of the report, Mr. Eamonn Howley, the regional manager, whom I know, respect and admire for the work he does in attracting industry to what is a difficult peripheral region, makes the point that:</P>
    <P>To create a resource for attracting industry to the smaller towns in County Leitrim, the Industrial Development Authority is offering a special incentive package for its advance factories in Ballinamore and Drumshanbo.</P>
    <P>Obviously Mr. Howley, and the Industrial Development Authority in general, are very aware of the continuing frustration felt in County Leitrim at the perceived lack of success in failing to fill the advance factory at Ballinamore which has never been occupied since it was opened and the 10,000 square foot advance factory in Drumshanbo which, for five years of its 11 year life, housed a shoe factory which closed with the loss of 100 jobs in 1986.</P>
    <P>It is against that background that I put this motion before the House for consideration by the Minister.  I genuinely believe that there is a case to be answered by the IDA, where you have a local entrepreneur who has a proven track record in his particular area of expertise, who has spent money, time and that expertise on drawing up a viable business plan and who is then faced with <Col N="1434" /> the reality that all the Industrial Development Authority will offer are employment grants which would total a derisory £40,000 in the context of the overall cost of £300,000.  I accept that the type of product the company are involved in could be seen to be adding to an already overcrowded market.  However I ask the Minister to consider the location of this plant, the extreme difficulties the IDA themselves are facing in attracting outside industry and the substantial loss of jobs, not only as a result of Arigna but in my own town of Drumshanbo.  Some 60 jobs have been lost in the Laird food group since 1988 and almost 100 jobs in Mattil since 1986.  Coupled with those lost in Arigna, over 200 industrial jobs have been lost in what is effectively a rural area.  Here we have a man and a company who are prepared to put their money where their mouth is, as an act of faith in the area in which he lives and to provide real employment, not just medium term.  He is not just somebody who will come in, take the money and run because this man has nowhere to run to.  He lives in the area with his family and, like the rest of us, he has to stay put.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will re-examine the application before the IDA and come back to me at some point and at least give me an indication that the matter will be re-examined and the company concerned treated in a much more favourable manner than they have been to date.</P>

      <P>Let me explain in the friendliest possible way to my colleague and friend, Senator Mooney, that the Industrial Development Authority are an autonomous body charged under the Industrial Development Act, 1986, with the implementation of national industrial policy.  The specific matter raised by the Senator relates to the day-to-day activities of the Authority in which the Minister for Agriculture and Food has no direct function and is precluded from becoming involved in.  It is, <Col N="1435" /> therefore, not appropriate for discussion here.</P>
      <P>In a personal capacity, I want to say I will be very glad to arrange a meeting for Senator Mooney with the appropriate personnel from the Industrial Development Authority.  From what I have heard, this appears, on the face of it, to be a worthwhile project and I would like to see that it gets a fair crack of the whip.  I would like to see progress made to assist this development in Drumshanbo.</P>

Indeed, it would <Col N="1436" /> have been nothing short of a minor miracle if he had been able to be more specific than he has been.  I wished, in the context of the motion, to question an overall policy that seems to have developed within the IDA towards specific projects of which this is one.  In that context perhaps the Minister could examine it and take a more favourable view? I am very grateful to him for his promise of further examination of the specific issue before us.  I hope I can have discussions with him and his officials as to how we can proceed.  I thank the Minister again for his courtesy in the matter.</P>
