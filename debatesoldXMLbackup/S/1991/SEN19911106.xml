      <P>I have notice from Senator Finneran that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Government to support the establishment of a local and regional authorities tier in Europe as proposed by the European Commission.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Dardis of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to investigate the circumstances which caused the contamination of the water supply in Naas, County Kildare, and the need to review the response of the relevant authorities to the incident with a view to minimising the risk to public health in the future.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to fulfil her commitment to rebuild the old Model Schools in the grounds of the Department of Education in Marlborough Street, Dublin 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="422" /> I also received notice from Senator Hederman of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to proceed with the cycleway around St. Stephen's Green as prepared by Dublin Corporation in 1980 and as discussed with the Office of Public Works at a meeting on 21 April 1983.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to take immediate action to resolve the serious courts dispute involving 274 clerical staff.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Kennedy of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to intervene in the industrial dispute affecting the courts which is having a crippling effect on court procedures, probate, Land Registry and other significant legal matters.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Finneran, Dardis, Costello, Hederman, Neville and Kennedy as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Finneran's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Dardis, Costello, Hederman, Neville and Kennedy may give notice another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed today to take Item No. 1 &mdash; Statements on the Role of Seanad Éireann &mdash; to 6 p.m; there will be a sos from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. and from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. we will take the Labour Party Motion No. 46.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of matters I would like to raise on the Order of Business. First, on behalf of the Members of this Group, and I am sure I speak on behalf of all Members of the House, I would like to condemn in <Col N="423" /> the strongest fashion the outrage at the weekend of the bombing of the Musgrave Park Hospital, which has been described as another new low in relation to atrocities up there. It is an absolute disgrace. I know that at times condemnations are ten a penny in the North in relation to one outrage following another, but I think this represents a new low in the context of outrages committed by the IRA.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I would like to mention the Middle East peace talks which began last weekend in Madrid. I am sure all of us wish those talks well in what no doubt will be difficult days ahead. Having regard to the peace-keeping role which Irish troops have so long played in that region, I am sure all of us hope that progress can be made.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, on the Order of Business I would like to refer to a request which was made last week for a debate on the ongoing political situation and, as was stated last week, this House has not as yet discussed any of these matters. I know the Leader of the House is indicating he will come back to it, but we will be saying if he does not come back to us positively very shortly it will be our intention to propose an amendment to the Order of Business. Obviously, it is important that even a short debate should take place to discuss ongoing events, which are changing practically by the minute. I look forward to the leader of the House responding positively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business, &ldquo;That Item No. 10, Register of Members of the Oireachtas Interests Bill, 1991, be inserted before Item No. 1.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader if he will name a day on which a debate on the banking system will take place following the requests of Senators O'Keeffe and Lanigan and indeed some of my colleagues on this side of the House. May I also ask him if there is any significance in the fact that these Senators are now raising this matter some 25 years after <Col N="424" /> the Labour Party first drew attention to problems deriving from the banking system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the condemnation of the bombing of the Musgrave Park Hospital in Belfast. It does the Irish people no good to be silent, because not to condemn such an atrocity would be giving tacit support to those who carried out that outrage. I do not think it helped one bit the cause those people believe they are furthering. Many Irish people are living in England and it certainly makes life difficult for them. Any organisation that bombs a hospital actually has no future and there are very few people on this island who support those who committed that outrage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he will convey to the Minister for the Environment our disappointment at his failure to inform local authorities of the level of rates support grant. Local authorities are at present organising their estimates and they have no information on the level of rates support grants they will receive. I think it is contemptible that the Minister has not informed local authorities of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, if I may, to join in condemnation of the bombing of a hospital. It is one of the civilised norms that even in the most brutal open warfare hospitals should be spared from involvement. It was an appalling atrocity. As Senator Cosgrave has rightly said, many expressions of condemnation have been made and I join in them. It emphasises the necessity for the people of peace to get together on some agreement in relation to the North and resume negotiations as, I am sure, the vast majority of people in this House and the vast majority of the people of Ireland would wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a second matter I would like to raise on the Order of Business. It also in a sense involves hospitals, because also in Europe over the past few days hospitals have been deliberately bombed and patients, including civilians, women <Col N="425" /> and children, have been killed in hospitals in Croatia. This was a shocking atrocity. The situation there is deteriorating. Our Minister and the other European Community ministers have tried to bring about a reasonable settlement there but one party refuses to negotiate. I would like to suggest to the Leader of the House that if this situation deteriorates any further he consider the opportunity for a debate in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House why there is no Minister present for the resumed debate today on the role of the Seanad? I understood that when this item was discussed on previous occasions, in 1987 and prior to that, there was a Minister in the House. I do not consider that the reforms that are required are simply a matter for ourselves. That is only tinkering at the edges. What we require is fundamental reform, which we cannot bring about ourselves, one of the most important being that the two elections be held on the same day. I am seriously questioning whether we are in a position to fulfil our functions as Senators as defined by the Constitution. I do not think that it is a trivial or an irrelevant matter and I would like to know is there any reason a Minister is not here to listen to the deliberations. They might at least show some interest in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader if it would be possible in the near future to have a debate in this House on the role of defence in Europe and on our position in regard to that policy and also a debate on our position in regard to neutrality. We should have an open debate and it should commence in the Houses of the Oireachtas, not outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the integration of Coláiste Mhuire gan Smál, or Mary Immaculate Training College, into the University of Limerick and wish them well in the establishment of their two new courses, B.Ed and B.A. degree, and hope that the concurrent <Col N="426" /> models of education would be maintained and developed rather than the consecutive models that are in the established universities. I am glad to note that in the Seanad reform many Senators have looked for the extension of Seanad voting rights to the graduates.</P>
      <P>I would also like to ask the Leader of the House if he could seek clarification from the Minister for Education that the promised Green Paper on Education will be before us. I ask if the accord in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> still exists and if the Green Paper will be before us before Christmas, as promised, because the educational issues at the moment are being hotly debated in the media and it is essential that Members of this House would have the opportunity to debate those issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Miss Keogh Miss Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Miss Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join in expressing my abhorrence of the appalling occurence in Belfast over the weekend. There is a terrible irony in that the most bitter of enemies are sitting down together in the Middle East while we still have a vacuum in Northern Ireland which underlines, as other Senators have said, the need for talks to get underway as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to second formally the proposal by Senator Ryan to put the Bill formerly before us. This was raised over the past number of weeks and I hope the Government will show positive response today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to bring to your attention &mdash; I consistently do this before the House &mdash; that the number of papers laid before the House today is 29 or 30. There is no possible way that we, as legislators can keep a check on those papers going through. As a matter of interest I try to look through them to see if there is anything of interest. Today, for instance, I looked at Item No. 5, State Property Act, 1954 &mdash; a report by the Minister for Finance on the sales, exchanges, grants, leases of State lands and waivers, releases and discharges in respect of rents etc. on State lands for the first half of this year. <Col N="427" /> When will we get an opportuntiy to question these matters?</P>
    <P>I would like to question a paper laid before the House and to ask when I can raise in debate why the Minister for Defence sold 22 acres of prime land in the Curragh of Kildare to the trustees of the Turf Club for £76,000. I would like to have had the offer to tender on that myself. I would like to know how that decision was made and where we can query it. I would like to know why the Galway Diocesan Trustees were able to buy the national school in Rosmuc for £3. I would like to know where these decisions are taken, how they can be justified, where the accountability lies and indeed was there any mezzanine investor along the way and so on that. It is important that we should check such matters. I have no doubt that some of these properties will be sold on. If I could buy a national school for £3, I could certainly sell it on very quickly and easily for a very substantial profit. As watchdogs we are failing. I am not saying this in any critical way in regard to the Government. It is the way business is done here but it is something we would need to address.</P>
    <P>I raised a matter with the Leader last week and I want to raise it again today. I am going to be quite specific so there can be no question or doubt about it. Could we have the names of the next two measures that will be initiated in this House? I have stopped looking for a programme. I just want to know the next two Bills that will be introduced in this House. I do not want anything else except that information.</P>
    <P>The final matter I want to raise is the amendments to the Treaty of Rome. The meeting of Heads of State is going to take place in Maastricht within five weeks. I would say without a shadow of doubt that I am probably the only person in this House who has seen the complete version of the proposals on the European treaty. I just happened to come on them by accident rather than anything else because they are confidential documents. We are now heading into something that <Col N="428" /> will affect the lives of generations to come. Senator Honan made reference to one part of it, and I thoroughly agree with her. It is irresponsible of us not to have that debate.</P>
    <P>I also think we should use the opportunity to allow MEPs to contribute to the debate here, because there is much here to do with the European Parliament. We have already paved the way for that in the Committee of Procedure and Privileges and I think we should now use the opportunity to allow a full debate and at least to bring to the notice of the Irish people the proposed amendments to the Treaty of Rome. I will not refer to the Continent any more except to say to the Leader that this is not a question of developments in the European Community over the past six months; these are proposals for changing the whole basis on which we operate. Every one of us has a vested interest in it and I ask the Leader, as a matter of priority, that that debate be started in this House as soon as possible. It covers all the areas that have been raised &mdash; the whole question of neutrality, sovereignty, foreign policy, the question of the European Parliament, its powers, devolution of powers, the question of legislation, directives, etc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind Senator Upton that Labour were in Government in 1973-1977, from 1980 to 1981 and from 1983 to 1987. During that time they did nothing to the banks and their operation. I can understand that it is very easy for somebody in the Opposition to talk freely, but when they had an opportunity to take action they did not. May I say I am obviously very pleased that Senator Upton is at one with us on this side of the House on this occasion and we will welcome his support when that debate takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, may I ask the Leader of the House, if view of the fact that he has given an indication that he is going to allow a debate on the banking system, that that debate would take place sooner rather than later, because there is clear evidence now that the operation of the banks is hampering the growth in <Col N="429" /> employment levels in this country. I view it as an extremely serious matter that deserves the attention of this House in the short term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in the condemnation of the bombing of the hospital in Belfast over the weekend. I would like to ask the Leader of the House if it would be possible to give the House an opportunity of having a greater input into North-South co-operation. I know we have an opportunity of expressing how we stand and how we react to these ever-increasing horrific acts perpetrated by these paramilitary organisations; but could we, as a democratic House, not have a debate to see if we could further North-South co-operation in the economic and social fields and perhaps make a further approach to the leaders of political opinion in the North of Ireland at least to talk to one another? Perhaps they prefer the situation as it is, but that seems to be an extraordinary thing to contemplate.</P>
      <P>I would like to join with Senator Conroy in again raising the very difficult situation of the Croats. It seems horrendous that even in the European Community, who have devoted considerable time over the past number of months to this question, nothing tangible is being achieved except witnessing the slaughter of the Croatian people. That question is a very old one. The very first lobby that we, as members of the European Parliament, met in 1973 was a delegation from Croatia looking at that time for independence even though there was a very tough regime there. It is on ongoing problem. I think free Europe should be more responsive to the heartrending pleas of those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to support the call from Senator McDonald for a debate on Northern Ireland. I think it is long overdue. I do not accept it is a matter that is too sensitive for us to discuss. There is remarkably little sensitivity on the part of the Provisional IRA who have sunk to a new low in bombing a hospital. I would like to see that debate, among <Col N="430" /> other things, if possible even today, because it looks as if the Fianna Fáil councillors in Dublin City Council are going to vote in a certain way which will allow Provisional Sinn Féin to sit in the Mansion House and gloat over their carnage. It is very important that we have a debate. Some insensitive things deserve to be said.</P>
      <P>I would like also to suggest that we have a debate on the Middle East. I am sure that Senator Lanigan would support this; he has frequently called for it. I support the state of Israel, but I am concerned about the fact that the leader of Israel is somebody whose political bible at the moment appears to be the Old Testament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to be associated with the condemnation of the bombing of the hospital in Belfast. Indeed, I have condemned those atrocities over the years. I am one of the few here who has attended some of the funerals there and I can assure members they are sad occasions. It is brutal. However there is an old saying: it takes two to tango, and until the UDA and the IRA decide to give up violence no one will give it up. I would suggest that we make a special appeal from this House to both parties.</P>
      <P>We know from a recent television programme that at the top the two groups are playing ball with one another and doing business with one another. I believe much of the trouble in the North stems from big business as much as politics, and maybe more so. We know there are problems there with business, all the protection rackets and so on and we know that both groups are involved in this. It is well documentated. I appeal to both of them to come together and issue a statement saying they are going to put down arms to sit at the table and talk. Until both agree to lay down arms we will not have peace in the North. I think the majority of the Unionists are as fed up with the UDA as we are here with the IRA. Until both parties sit down we will not have peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="431" />
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I would like to raise with the Leader of the House. First, I support totally what Senator Hederman said with regard to the presence of a Minister for the debate on the statements on the role of Seanad Éireann. I believe it would be indicative of the Government's attitude to the whole concept of this debate and would indicate how important or otherwise the Government viewed it. I further submit that the presence of a Minister would mean there would be a direct report to the Government on the debate itself. At this stage it might not be inappropriate to suggest that as there is much of that debate to take place yet &mdash; perhaps more than two-thirds of it &mdash; some arrangements might be made, if possible through the Leader, to have a Minister present. It is a very important point. There should be a ministerial presence for such an important debate as statements on the role of Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I would like to join with the various speakers who uttered total and outright condemnation of the atrocities in Northern Ireland and in particular the most recent atrocity at the hospital in Belfast. I will make one point in this whole area. Unfortunately, we are all beginning to become conditioned to the developments up there. It is regrettable that while we condemn and deplore them &mdash; we are all in agreement on how horrible and horrfic they are &mdash; I believe we are taking them now as an everyday occurrence. I believe we all must be more vocal in our condemnation of these acts. In fact, we must take more positive action &mdash; whatever positive action we can take by way of debate in this House or whatever.</P>
      <P>I conclude by reverting to my original point: that I believe very strongly we should have ministerial presence, if at all possible, for the rest of the debate on the statements on the role of Seanad Éireann, today, next week and for however long the debate lasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reply, may I say in relation to Motion No. 46, that I propose, as on similar occasions, that the time <Col N="432" /> allowed for the debate shall not exceed one and a half hours; that the speech of the Senator proposing the motion shall not exceed 20 minutes; and that the speech of any other Senator in the course of the debate shall not exceed ten minutes. I hope the House will agree to that.</P>
      <P>In regard to the recent bombings in Musgrave Park Hospital, to my way of thinking it was the worst form of depravity. Anyone who would suggest adding a hospital, no matter who were in the beds of that hospital, to the list of what they call &ldquo;legitimate targets&rdquo; is an unbelievable suggestion and certainly I, like other Senators, condemn this barbaric act in the strongest possible way and indeed violence of all kinds in the North from all sides of the divide up there.</P>
      <P>Senator Cosgrave mentioned this point. He also referred to the Middle East; and, of course, we will share his views on that. I have no plan for a debate either on Northern Ireland or the Middle East at this time. The Senator also asked for a debate on the ongoing political situation in the country and perhaps the Whips might come together and discuss that matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Brendan Ryan proposed an amendment to the Order of Business in regard to Item No. 10. The Senator has again requested &mdash; this is the second or third time or perhaps more &mdash; that the Order of Business be amended with a view to having leave granted to introduce a Bill. If that happens, an order of course can be made for Second Stage thereby enabling the Bill to be printed and circulated to Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the information of Senators, the background to this is that the initiation of Bills is governed by Standing Orders 79 and 80. Bills presented under Standing Order 80 are automatically printed and circulated. However, there is a proviso in Standing Order 80 which states that a Bill can only be presented by a Senator provided there is not before the Seanad a Bill presented by a Senator nominated by the group. In this case Senator Ryan was precluded from presenting the Bill <Col N="433" /> because Senator Norris has already presented the Interpretation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1989, on behalf of the Independent group.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of weeks Senator Ryan has consistently sought leave to introduce his Bill. I pointed out to Senator Ryan that the kernel of his proposal is included in the Programme for Government, which specifically states: &ldquo;a register of all Members' material interests will be established from September 1990 and available in the Oireachtas Library&rdquo;. Despite this, Senator Ryan still wishes to pursue the printing of the Bill. I have listened carefully to many Senators from all sides who spoke in support of Senator Ryan's proposal and I certainly do not wish in any way to be restrictive or obstructive. I do not want it to be seen that I am in any way endeavouring to curtail Senator Ryan's rights or those of any other Senator. Therefore, in the interest of co-operation and subject to the agreement of the House, I am prepared to accept Senator Ryan's proposal and include Item No. 10 in today's Order of Business.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton referred to the banking system and asked when we may have a debate on it, as did Senator O'Keeffe who has consistently raised this matter. My hope is that in three or perhaps four weeks time or as soon as possible we can have a debate on the matter. I am anxious that should happen.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan referred to the Northern Ireland problem. I will bring to the attention of the Minister for the Environment the comment made by Senator Neville. The question of Croatia was raised by Senator Conroy and others. Much as we would like to see that issue settled I have no proposal at this point to have a debate on that matter.</P>
    <P>On the point raised by Senators Hourigan and Hederman in regard to the debate on the role of the Seanad, it was agreed by both sides of the House that there was no need for a Minister to be present. It was agreed that we would conduct our own inquiry and make our <Col N="434" /> own case and that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges would meet subsequently to see what it would do.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan and others referred to our defence policy and neutrality after 1992. As I mentioned last week &mdash; I have checked further on it &mdash; a White Paper will be issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs soon. It would be wise to wait until we get that paper and then have a full discussion on it. As Senator O'Toole said, 1992 is only five weeks away.</P>
    <P>I have noted the points made by Senators Jackman, Keogh and O'Toole. I referred to the other points raised in general. Senators Norris, Farrell and Hourigan raised the Northern Ireland problem and also the Middle East.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the role of the Seanad. I was amazed recently to see the statistics regarding the number of people who watch &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; each night it is broadcast. The Houses of the Oireachtas have become the focus of greater public interest and awareness. Questions are being asked about the role of this House and it is appropriate that we should have this debate and account for our stewardship.</P>
      <P>As previous speakers said in the debate last week, there is room for improvement in relation to the functions of the Seanad. It is important that the public be aware of the role of the Seanad in the scheme of legislative procedures. The question which exercises the mind in the first instance is the election of Members to Seanad Éireann. A number of review committees were established to report on various aspects of the role, structures and the method of election to Seanad Éireann. In a bicameral legislature it is only to be expected that the role of the second House should evolve over a period of time and adapt to changing circumstances.</P>
      <P>One of the main arguments in favour of a second Chamber is that it helps to safeguard ill-conceived and over-enthusiastic action by the Dáil and provides a means by which a more detailed consideration can be given to different Bills. The Seanad should not be seen as inferior or second rate. In recent times some of the most revolutionary and progressive legislation initiated in this country was introduced in the first instance in this Chamber. A number of important Bills were given an extremely good hearing and a number of amendments were introduced in this House to major legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opportunity for wide-ranging debate in relation to legislation is greater in this Chamber instead of the cut and thrust and the narrow political element more evident in the other House. This House plays an important role in initiating legislation and Bills coming from <Col N="436" /> the Dáil are thoroughly studied. The contributions from all sides of the House are not as political as in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>This House contributes invaluable expertise to the parliamentary process but, unfortunately, this is not perceived to be the case outside the House by a variety of different so-called &ldquo;experts&rdquo;. The problem emanates from the system of election to the Seanad. I referred to this earlier. A number of Senators are not directly elected by the people; with the exception of the Independents and the Taoiseach's nominees they are elected by members of local authorities and that seems to cause confusion. I refute the idea that people elected by local authorities are not a representative group. They are because members of local authorities are elected in the first instance by the general public and they in casting their votes they represent the public in relation to the 43 Members elected to this House by the local authorities. It is not true that there is not proper representation in relation to the election of those Members to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>There are enormous difficulties in relation to the election. Only those who stand for election to the Seanad and travel the length and breadth of the country over a number of weeks fully understand the difficulties involved. It is true to say that one is in a world of one's own. One loses track of time. One has only one thing in mind, to be elected. The difficulties encountered by all candidates are enormous.</P>
    <P>The idea of dividing the areas into Euro-constituencies is worth having a look at because it would tidy up the election process. There would be practical and logistical problems in terms of how to divide the less different seats within the Euro-constituency and fit that in with the provision whereby nominating bodies have the right to nominate individuals on different panels. That is an area we should look at seriously. It would overcome the huge problems that candidates face. Having said that, I do not think there is anyone who has put his name forward as a candidate who has not tried <Col N="437" /> everything in his power, including travelling the length and breadth of the country, to ensure election. Unfortunately there are only a limited number of seats and many people fall by the wayside.</P>
    <P>The Seanad has also been criticised because it fails to reflect the vocational character originally envisaged. It may be said that many of the 43 Members elected by local authorities on the vocational panels tend to be politicians who are either on the way up or on the way down but I refute that. There are a number of people in this House who are committed to it and have no ambition to be a Member of the Dáil.</P>

I include the Independents in that because they have their own political philosophies and there is nobody who will suggest that because a person is sitting on the Independent benches they do not have an attitude and frame of mind that reflects a political philosophy. I am sure that at election time they exercise their franchise and vote for the parties which reflect their philosophy. I do not think there is anybody in this House who is not a party politician in some way or another.</P>

      <P>I was going to reply but Senator Hederman has replied for me. There is no reason why the vocational panel should not be represented by politicians. Many eminent people who came through this House were party politicians. Nobody can refute that and the contributions they made to this House were enormous. Many of <Col N="439" /> them proceeded to the Dáil and made equally outstanding contributions.</P>
      <P>Our system is a democratic one and works largely through the structure of political parties. We cannot deny that and we cannot get away from that point. Before we decide to throw out that system, as Senator Murphy said last week, we need to look very closely at it. To suggest that people who are members of political parties in this House do not have a view is absolutely contemptible. I very much regret the view that it would somehow solve all our problems if party politics were excluded from the Seanad altogether. One can imagine what kind of place it would be without politicians. It would be extremely difficult to imagine how the working of the House would be structured, how contributions would be made and how business would be ordered.</P>
      <P>If we accept that elections to the Seanad should be taken out of the political arena and become the preserve of nominating bodies only, I ask the question, how many nominating bodies do not have some type of political base? Every nominating body I know of has a political base in some shape or form and good luck to them. I welcome the fact that they do not try to hide their philosophies and views. It is a very healthy situation to be in. The majority are composed of people who have political affiliations in some shape or form and to suggest otherwise is ridiculous. I await with interest what Senator Hederman has to say in relation to this.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business every week a number of Senators come in and in order to get cheap publicity, in particular on the Independent benches&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In relation to the Order of Business, there appears to be an orchestrated attempt by certain Members of this House to gain maximum publicity by raising a variety of different issues. But for the fact that we have such a capable Cathaoirleach much of the work would become an absolute laugh. Senators who are inclined to behave in this way should ask themselves what affect they are having on the working of this House and what sort of an image they are giving to the public in relation to the activities of this House.</P>
      <P>The Cathaoirleach has never prevented anyone from making a legitimate contribution or raising something they are concerned about but at times one wonders what is the reason behind some of the contributions made by some Senators in this House. Before we start talking about reform in the strict sense of the word we should look into our own hearts and see in what way we, as individual Members of this House, can in some shape or form improve the workings of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In any consideration of the constitutional and legislative provisions relating to the composition, powers and functions of Seanad Éireann it is useful to put the matter into perspective and examine the political theory underlying the existence of bicameral parliaments, that is, those parliaments which have two Houses and to endeavour to answer the question as to why some countries prefer a bicameral system to a unicameral system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question has been described as one of the most controversial in constitutional law and the answers given to it reflect the diversity of parliamentary institutions. Cogent arguments in favour of bicameralism in a unitary State such as ours are well summed up in the report on bicameral parliaments prepared by the Association of Secretaries General of Parliaments and published as far back as 1966. The protagonists of a bicameral <Col N="441" /> system invoke an argument which seems to them decisive. The work of legislation has more chance of being done well if it is carried through two processes, each process complete in itself. In the words of the late Senator Alexis FitzGerald which I quote briefly: &ldquo;Argument is strengthened in the Seanad by being less partisan&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Inherent in these arguments in favour of bicameralism is the premise that a second House should have lesser constitutional powers and prerogatives than a properly elected House and that it should not be constituted and elected in the same way as the first House. Otherwise it would be superfluous as representing the same type of opinion in the same way. Constitutional powers are, therefore, so bestowed that the Government are responsible only to the first House, thus a defeat of the Government even on an important issue in the second House would not <i>ipso facto</i> involve the downfall of the Government. However, for reasons of prestige and because they may adversely affect public opinion, Government dislike defeats in the Upper House and so many constitutions seek to ensure that the Government have a working majority in the second House.</P>
    <P>How then should a second House comport itself if there is a majority in it opposed to the Government of the day? This situation has been described and indeed analysed in detail by Professor Bernard Crick in his book entitled <i>The Reform of Parliaments.</i> He refers in particular to the work done by the House of Lords in dealing with the Transport Act, 1947, a Bill which was initiated by the then Labour government. Professor Crick states, and I quote:</P>
    <P>There was a real endeavour by the Conservative Opposition as well as by the Labour peers to make constructive amendments. The Opposition sharply criticised the detail but they admitted that the mandate for nationalised transport in some form was definite.</P>
    <P>Professor Crick, therefore, concluded, and I quote briefly:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="442" /> The passage of the Bill in an efficient form would have been impossible but for the existence of a revising Second Chamber.</P>
    <P>The second House in such a case, so runs the thesis, should recognise the constitutional superiority of the first House. It should not capriciously obstruct measures for which the first House has a clear public mandate and in general should use its own powers constructively and with discretion.</P>
    <P>Assuming then the principle of bicameralism, the next question seems to be to resolve what should be the composition and the mode of election of the second House. It has been said of the House of Lords, for example, that if it did not exist then it could not be invented. However, in common with many other unitary States, we have had to invent and the history of the Seanad since 1922 reflects the changing attitudes towards the role of the second House which have manifested themselves from time to time over these past years. Commissions and parliamentary committees have expressed their views on the best method of selecting a second House and political commentators have waxed eloquent on the subject. In all of this discussion, however, Sir Kenneth Wheare in his book entitled <i>Legislatures</i> makes a crucial and important point when he states:</P>
    <P>First of all it may be worthwhile to get out of the way a doctrine about the proper function of a Second Chamber which rests upon an illusion: the notion of a Second Chamber above and beyond politics, composed of eminent gentlemen and ladies of great distinction in various walks of life but politically neutral.</P>
    <P>He continues:</P>
    <P>There is undoubtedly a case for saying that a Second Chamber should contain people who are less dependent upon party considerations than are the Members of the First Chamber but if Second Chambers are to be anything <Col N="443" /> more than debating societies and discussion circles, party is bound to come in.</P>
    <P>He concludes his remarks stating:</P>
    <P>The Second Chamber is invited to give its opinion upon measures and policies initiated and pushed forward by a party Government, supported by a majority party or a coalition of parties and criticised by a minority party or parties in the First House. How can it avoid politics and party politics at that, and why should it? The Second Chamber is part of a political system. Its business is politics. It need not be as partisan as a Lower House but it must, unless it is to be completely powerless, express views and take decisions which usually means taking sides on political questions.</P>
    <P>The report of the Seanad Electoral Law Reform Commission puts the position as follows:</P>
    <P>We would like to emphasise that even if the Seanad was composed entirely of vocational interests elected wholly by vocational organisations, it would still, because of the powers and duties vested in it by the Constitution, have to make decisions which are in the fullest sense political. No alteration in the system of elections or in the composition of the Seanad can alter this fact.</P>
    <P>Like most democracies the Legislature in Ireland has two Houses, a lower or first House called the Dáil and an Upper or second House called the Seanad. The Dáil consists of Members who were directly elected on the basis of universal suffrage, whereas the Seanad consists partly of indirectly elected Members and partly of nominated Members.</P>
    <P>The report of the Committee on the Constitution in 1967 examined these matters. That committee, interestingly enough, was chaired by Deputy George Colley and included Deputies Seán Lemass, Robert Molloy, Don Davern, <Col N="444" /> Seán Dunne, Denis Jones, T. F. O'Higgins, David Andrews, Gerard Sweetman, James Tully and Senators James Dooge, Michael Kennedy and Eoin Ryan. They asked themselves the pertinent question &ldquo;Is the Seanad necessary&rdquo;? and they stated:</P>
    <P>While Constitution makers and political theorists seem in general to prefer a bicameral legislature the problem of devising the perfect second chamber has proved to be almost insoluble. There is no formula which is likely to be acceptable to all people. However, the recognition of the fact that perfection cannot be achieved has not deterred the majority of countries from making the attempt to devise some system which is considered to be at least of some utility in their special circumstances.</P>
    <P>The 1967 committee concluded &mdash; and I believe that this should be noted by the three Progressive Democrats who are nominated members of this House &mdash; and I quote:</P>
    <P>We are satisfied that what most countries expect in providing a second House is that they will thereby have a safeguard against ill-considered or hasty actions on the part of the first House. A second group of public representatives will have the opportunity of examining legislation and commenting upon it. The first House will thereby be given time for reflection on the utility of measures which it has proposed. Furthermore, a reasonable opportunity will be given to affected interests to organise public opinion in relation to controversial matters. In addition, important technical matters may receive in the second House more comprehensive treatment than it had been possible to give them in the first House.</P>
    <P>James O'Reilly, Senior Counsel, and Mary Redmond, Senior Council, in their book <i>Cases and Material from the Irish Constitution</i> have this to say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> The Seanad has made valuable contributions to legislation in this country in recent years. Such notable examples of these contributions include the Redundancy Payments Bill, the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill and the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill.</P>
    <P>Then, of course, there is the Companies (No. 2) Bill and the Environmental Protection Agency Bill which were initiated in this House and every aspect of which was closely monitored and scrutinised by this House.</P>
    <P>The principal provisions relating to Seanad Éireann are to be found in Articles 18 and 19 of the 1937 Constitution. There are, of course, many other clauses in the Constitution which relate to the powers and functions of the Seanad. The report of the Committee on the Constitution 1967 state:</P>
    <P>If the Seanad were to be abolished it would be necessary to go through the Constitution from start to finish and to make alternative provisions for all these safeguards resting upon the existence of the Seanad which are already contained therein.</P>
    <P>Moreover, that report concludes:</P>
    <P>If the Seanad is to be retained it does not necessarily have to remain unaltered in matters relating to its composition and methods of election.</P>
    <P>In this connection they pointed out that the Constitution as at present drafted affords extreme flexibility in its basic provisions relating to the Seanad, such as the composition and strength of the panel, the nature of the electorate, the method of voting and, indeed, the timing of elections. A great many fundamental changes in relation to the Seanad can, therefore, be brought about simply by the enactment of ordinary legislation without any change in the Constitution. I believe, therefore, first, that the Government should initiate and launch Bills in the Seanad in sufficient numbers so as to avoid the bottleneck just before the summer and Christmas recesses which leaves the Seanad with too little time to <Col N="446" /> exercise its revising function properly; second, that Question Time should be introduced as a matter of urgency in the Seanad so that the Government can respond to questions relating to matters of urgent public importance. I believe that this might help to eliminate and, indeed, solve some of the problems that seem to arise here daily in regard to the Order of Business; third, that the Government should introduce legislation for a change in the election of university Senators in accordance with the provision contained in the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution (Election of Members of Seanad Éireann by Institutions of Higher Education) Act, 1979. The 1979 Act inserted a new paragraph 2º in Article 18.4 of the Constitution so that Article 18.4 2º now envisages the franchise being extended to other institutions of higher education and other third level colleges, such as the new University of Limerick, as may be fixed by law. Thus, under Article 18.4 2º a Member or Members of Seanad Éireann may be elected by, as stated in the Constitution, institutions grouped together or by a single institution. I, therefore, urge the Minister for the Environment, as I did when speaking on a similar motion in Seanad Éireann on 3 June 1987, to introduce appropriate legislation to give effect to this provision in the Constitution to extend the third level Seanad electorate and to widen the franchise include graduates of other appropriate third level institutions.</P>
    <P>It was Lord Bryce who said that a second chamber has four major functions: (1) the function of revision of legislation; (2) the function of initiation of legislation; (3) the function of the interposition of appropriate delay in the passage of legislation and (4) the function of full and free debate on large and important questions. Lord Bryce described the revision function as follows:</P>
    <P>The examination and revision of Bills brought from the House of Commons, a function which has become more needed since on many occasions during <Col N="447" /> the past 30 years the House of Commons has been obliged to act under special rules limiting debate.</P>
    <P>We have seen that, of course, so often so far as our own Dáil is concerned. On the function of the initiation of Bills, Lord Bryce says:</P>
    <P>The initiation of Bills dealing with subjects of comparative non-controversial character may have an earlier passage through the House of Commons if they had been fully discussed and put into well conditioned shape before being submitted to it.</P>
    <P>On the function of delay in a second Chamber, Lord Bryce states:</P>
    <P>The interposition of so much delay and no more in the passage of a Bill into law as may enable the opinion of the nation to be adequately expressed upon it.</P>
    <P>This would be specially needed as regards Bills which affect the fundamentals of the Constitution or introduce new principles of legislation or which raise issues whereupon the opinion of the country appear to be almost equally divided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join in your remarks in extending a welcome to the distinguished visitors.</P>
      <P>On the fourth function of general debate and discussion, Lord Bryce states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Full and free discussion of large and important questions, such as those of foreign policy, at moments when the House of Commons may happen to be so much occupied that I cannot find sufficient time for them, such discussions may often be all the more <Col N="448" /> useful if conducted in an assembly whose debates and decisions do not involve the fate of the executive government.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that these statements written by Lord Bryce in connection with the 1918 Conference on Reform of the Second Chamber represent a useful basis for discussion of the role of Seanad Éireann or other Second Chambers, and as a background against which to judge and assess the role and performance of the First Seanad from 1923 to 1935 and of the Second Seanad from 1938 to date. Dr. Donal O'Sullivan, the Clerk of the First Seanad, writing in 1940 has summarised the key role of the First Seanad in the formation of the new State. He made the following pertinent and salient points:</P>
    <P>(1) In these early days the Seanad proved to be of very great value to the new State.</P>
    <P>(2) In personnel it was probably the equal of any Second Chamber then existing and it exercised a considerable and wholly beneficial influence on legislation.</P>
    <P>(3) Its principal achievement lay in the proof it afforded that Nationalists and Unionists could work harmoniously together in a parliament for the good of their common country.</P>
    <P>(4) It would be less than truth to say that each side met the other halfway because in general they never gave the impression of taking sides at all in a Nationalist or Unionist sense.</P>
    <P>Senator James Dooge, former Cathaoirleach of this Seanad, has observed that even allowing for the natural loyalty of Dr. O'Sullivan, who served as Clerk of the Seanad throughout its first 13 year life, this is a remarkable testimony to the role played by the first Seanad in the building of the new State. The performance of the first Seanad and the work of revision was quite impressive while during the total life of the first Seanad, lasting 13 and a half years, the Seanad received 489 non-money Bills from the <Col N="449" /> Dáil, and it amended 182 of these. The total number of amendments made by the first Seanad was 1,831, an average of well over 100 per annum, and practically all of these were accepted by the Dáil, most of them, indeed, without amendment.</P>
    <P>While the revisionary function was the main feature of the first Seanad, the other functions as set out by Lord Bryce were not neglected. In the field of Foreign Affairs there were notable debates on the Briand-Kellogg Pact on the adherence to the optional clause of the Versailles Treaty, and on the report of the Imperial Conference of 1930. In regard to the Second Chamber from 1838 to date, Senator James Dooge observes that in the case of a number of Bills of distinct political significance the number of Seanad amendments is remarkably high.</P>
    <P>Examples are the Land Bill of 1963 where there were 27 amendments; the Succession Bill, 1965 had 41 amendments; the Housing Bill, 1965 had 27 amendments; the Ground Rents Bill, 1965 had 33 amendments; the Health Bill, 1969 had 36 amendments; and the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Bill, 1978 had 44 amendments. These figures indicate both hard work on the part of Senators and flexibility in the attitude of Ministers.</P>
    <P>In regard to the function of initiation of Bills, the Seanad has been used extensively from time to time. A number of these are the Air Pollution Bill, Status of Children Bill, Companies Bill and the Environmental Protection Agency Bill. These fit well, indeed, into the type of Bill described by Lord Bryce as appropriate for the Second Chamber. In regard to the function to delay the passage of a Bill, in practice the limited power of the Seanad to delay a Bill has not often been used. A major exception, however, relates to a Bill of constitutional importance. It might normally have been expected that the Bill to abolish proportional representation proposed by the Government in 1959 would readily have passed the Seanad and been voted on by the people in a couple of weeks. The accidental circumstances of the illness of <Col N="450" /> two Government Senators allowed the Seanad to defeat the measure and so cause considerable delay during which public opinion became more strongly engaged in regard to the question. When the referendum was finally held some months later the proposal was defeated by the electorate. The relation of the delaying power of the Seanad to the formation of public opinion is illustrated by the tactics used in that case by Seanad Éireann of defeating the Bill on Fifth Stage rather than on Second Stage in order to maximise the delay and the publicity. It is, perhaps, ironic that in this particularly apt illustration of the delaying power of the Seanad as described by Lord Bryce, the popular vote endorsed the view of the indirectly elected Seanad against the view of the directly elected Dáil.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I believe that under all these four headings as outlined by Lord Bryce that Seanad Éireann &mdash; the first Seanad Éireann and the second Seanad Éireann &mdash; have made a valuable contribution to the development and to the advancement of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss the role of the Seanad here. On too many occasions the role of the Seanad has been discussed outside the Seanad. In some cases the discussion has not taken place to the benefit of those in the Seanad or, indeed, to the benefit of the people. The bicameral system, works extremely well and has been a great servant of democracy for many, many years.</P>
      <P>There have been moves over various times to get rid of the Seanad and there have been various reasons given for its abolition. There has been no coherent argument which would convince me or the majority of the people that the Seanad does not have a major part to play in the formulation of Government policy, the formulation of Bills, the initiation of Bills and the changing of Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consideration has been given to the fact that many people see this House as a talking shop without power. This is a <Col N="451" /> misrepresentation of the facts as enunciated by Senator Kennedy. The number of Bills which have been initiated here is enormous and in the recent past the number of Bills which have been initiated in this House have been increasing. I sincerely hope that trend will continue. Many important Bills have been initiated in this House and then gone to Dáil Éireann and on many occasions there have been few, if any, changes made to those Bills. However, this does not mean the Dáil has not seen fit to change sections, but the debate that took place in the Seanad helped the other House in its deliberations.</P>
    <P>The Seanad, as constituted, has been criticised by many people as not being a Seanad disagree which represents the people. I would disagree with this argument. The Seanad often represents the people in a more basic way than do TDs. Senators are elected by people who have been elected by the general public. Indeed, they are elected by county councillors who have been elected at local level. Members of the Seanad in general are elected by the TDs who have been elected by the people. Then you get down to another more basic level of representation, the county councillors.</P>
    <P>It has been said by other Senators that possibly there should be a widening of the franchise. I agree that in relation to the universities it seems incongruous that Trinity College Dublin, should have such major representation in this House at a time when the number of their graduates is much smaller than the number of graduates from the other colleges in the country. I am glad to see that recently DCU and the University of Limerick were granted the facility of having representation here. Unfortunately, they have not yet had representation but they will be able to take part in the election process on the next occasion.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by many people that the original idea of vocational education and the panels' system in the initiation of the Seanad by Éamon de Valera was that the panels would consist of people who had expertise in their own <Col N="452" /> fields. Some people now suggest that this is not what happens. Because of the fact that Members, generally speaking, are elected by political parties it should not be forgotten that to get on to a particular panel in the Seanad one must have expertise and experience in the field in which he stands for the panel election. In other words, one cannot be a member of the labour panel if he has not taken part in labour negotiations. One must have been involved in negotiations on either the trade union or employers' side. Just because one is a member of an employers' federation does not mean that one is qualified. For the labour panel, one has to have been actively involved in labour negotiations and in the organisation of labour. Similarly, with the agricultural and other panels one has to have expertise in order to get on to these panels. There is no doubt in my mind but that even though there has been a departure from the original idea we have a system which works in terms of the expertise that is available to this House from each panel. This is very noticeable when a Bill comes up, whether it refers to legal affairs or to agriculture. There are always people in this House who have the expertise to take part in the deliberations that are necessary on such Bills. The parliamentary draftsman drafts Bills and these Bills have had to be changed radically before they went from here to the other House. It is necessary to have this second House whether it be to initiate Bills or to revise Bills which come from the other House.</P>
    <P>There are frustrations involved in being a Member of Seanad Éireann because there is no question but that the Dáil is the place of power. When one talks about frustration one will find the same frustration in backbenchers on the Government and on the Opposition sides in Dáil Éireann as you will find here in the Seanad. We have a Government which includes the Ministers, the Taoiseach and the Attorney General and unless one is a Member of the Government I have a feeling that one is not totally taking part in the operation of the Dáil or Seanad. Backbenchers in the Dáil <Col N="453" /> have the same problems as Members of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad, as a member of the Opposition, one feels that one has not the opportunity to change things. It has to be said equally that if one is on the Government side in the Seanad there are more frustrations because one cannot get involved in the arguments that one would like to get involved in. One is sitting on the Government side of the House and is basically there to back up the Government, even though one can argue a case for changes in legislation. In fact, a Government Senator has not the same scope to attack as a Senator on the other side. The Opposition in the Seanad has the frustration of not being able to influence business at Government level and this will continue.</P>
    <P>There is a necessity at all times to keep examining and revising the role of Seanad Éireann, just as much as there is a need to keep examining the role and operation of the Dáil. Indeed, in the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges there is a debate going on as to what changes can be made to make the House more relevant on a day-to-day basis. If there were more debates initiatied here on issues of importance, Members would feel they had a better part to play in the day-to-day business of running the affairs of State. It is very frustrating to come in here on occasions and find that while a debate is taking place on radio, on television, in the newspapers and on the streets yet, because of the rules of the House it is very seldom possible to get a debate going on an important topic on the day on which the topic arises. There is possibly a need to have some structure, such as Question Time, or an hour or half an hour that can be set apart each day the House sits to debate matters which are of immediate concern to the general public. If they are of immediate concern to the general public they would obviously have to be of immediate concern to the Houses of Parliament. It would not be difficult to allow half an hour each day the Seanad sits for statements on matters of this nature. They could be dealt with in the House without <Col N="454" /> having to call on Ministers to come in to reply.</P>
    <P>The Order of Business should be tightened up. There is no sense in the Leader of the House having to reply to questions which are thrown at him without any notice. It is virtually impossible not to get into a row because of lack of information on the part of the Leader on any particular day. He has to wait to get replies from his Ministers or from the Government side. If we had on the Order of Business a Question Time related to questions which had been submitted beforehand there would be a better organised Order of Business. People putting questions would have a far greater chance of getting proper replies to them.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that the Seanad should be abolished because of the fact that it might become a haven for former TDs, a rest home before they retire finally, or that it could be used by potential TDs. In fact, if one looks at the make-up of the House it will be noted that the present Seanad is composed of people who are, in general, younger than the Members in the other House. I am not sure of the average age here but I have seen it come down dramatically in recent years. If at times the Seanad is used as an apprenticeship or training by people who want to get into the other House, I do not see anything wrong with that as it gives them the opportunity to learn how the Houses of the Oireachtas work. It affords them a unique opportunity to speak to Government Ministers and to higher civil servants. Politicians with ambitions to become Deputies should not be made unwelcome in the Seanad. If people without further ambition dominate this House it will indeed become the kind of rest home people had thought it was in the past.</P>
    <P>It has been alleged that people who have lost Dáil seats use this House as an umbrella to stand under while waiting to regain those seats. I see nothing wrong with that because the vagaries of our electoral system with multi-seat constituencies and proportional representation dictate that certain people of <Col N="455" /> great value to Irish politics can occasionally lose there seat for reasons not connected with performance or commitment. Membership of the Seanad gives such a person an opportunity to fight for re-election from inside rather than outside the Oireachtas which makes for better representation for constitutents; the TD who has been elected in his place will have to work extremely hard to hold his seat with the demoted terrier in the Seanad yapping at his heels. It is a disadvantage of the PR system that people of value can lose their seats regularly. The Seanad plays an active role in ensuring that a high level of parliamentary representation is fostered in this country &mdash; probably higher than in other places where the list system ensures that individual parties dictate who gets into the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is not the same here.</P>
    <P>The role of the Seanad would be enhanced if definite functions were entrusted to people other than the positions of Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach which are at present the only formal positions in the Seanad. All other positions are honourary ones whether as Leader of the House or Leader of the Opposition, as Whip of the main party or the Whip of the Opposition. Holders of these positions are not recognised in the Oireachtas as office holders and consequently they are not entitled to official secretarial services. For many years I was leader of the Opposition and then of the Government Senators and had no secretarial backup service at all; I had to use the same secretarial pool as every other Senator. The job of Leader of the House, of Whip or Leader of the Opposition cannot be done properly without secretarial services including secretarial assistants. Through the years secretaries who worked for me have had to work extremely hard and not only as secretaries; they have had to be PROs and ombudspeople between my office and the offices of Ministers. They have had to do many things that Ministers secretaries do not have to do. Ministers secretaries have <Col N="456" /> secretarial staff to assist them, including secretarial assistants to take care of typing and telephone work. If we are going to examine the role of the Seanad, we should consider placing the officers of the Seanad in positions of real power and responsibility must accompany power. Responsibility without power does not make sense.</P>
    <P>The electoral system for the Seanad was definitely set up by a masochist of some description because only a masochist could initiate a system where by prospective Senators have to travel more than 11,000 miles to get into the Seanad in the first place; they have to travel every boreen in the country. This is an excellent exercise if you are involved in tourism. There is not a Senator in this House who does not know every back road and main road from the tip of Donegal to the tip of Wexford whether in the backwoods of the country or in the larger cities. When a Senator talks about cross-Border relationships and problems on the Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal and Louth borders, we know what they are talking about as we have all been through these areas and we have talked to local councillors there. We have visited the North of Ireland on many occasions to meet local representatives. We are aware of problems with industry, farming and labour in Border areas. We are equally aware of inner city problems. It is a bonus to people outside the House that Senators have campaigned throughout the country in rural and urban areas and from top to bottom.</P>
    <P>This House has a unique basis for the debate of issues of national importance. TDs are generally well informed about the country in general but they are not particularly interested in national issues unless they have ambitions to get into Government and without those ambitions they should not be in the Dáil at all. Basically, TDs interests are confined to the constituency from which they come and the system dictates that they spend three quarters of the week in Dublin and then return home. A Dublin TD's constituency will consist of a small <Col N="457" /> part of the city; there are few opportunities for cross-city talk. The inner city Deputy will not be interested in anywhere except his own constituency; the Deputy for the outer city area will only be interested in that area. Senators on the other hand have to interest themselves in the entire country and in a diversity of issues, and they have a better knowledge of national problems than a hard working Deputy who confines himself to the area which elected him.</P>
    <P>This House should not be a mirror image of the Dáil; that was not the founding intention. If a better Dáil is required the Dáil itself should be reviewed and its membership possibly enlarged. The Seanad should not ape what goes on in the Dáil. We should examine the situation here and establish principles by which we could make ourselves more responsive to current issues. If a matter of public importance requires debating we should take more time in the evenings or on a particular day to deal with such matters rather than retain the present arrangement where a motion on the Adjournment entitles a speaker to 20 minutes while the Minister receives ten minutes to reply. Under Standing Order 29 a matter of urgent public importance can merit special time but often when people look for a debate on a matter of public importance in the Chair will not allow it for procedural or other reasons.</P>
    <P>The image of the Seanad would be enhanced if the working system in the Seanad were improved. A radical change is required here. We have adhered for almost 50 years to certain rules and regulations and the rigidity of the system as laid down by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges does not always facilitate debate on current issues.</P>
    <P>The role of the Seanad has not been fully debated for a long time. The statements made here over the last two days are important because the public is not informed of what goes on. We are not a type of TD; we are Members of Seanad Éireann and we should be proud of that. We take part in the process of legislation and many Bills initiated in this House have been accepted without changes by <Col N="458" /> the other House. This House has also made many amendment to Bills initiated in the other House and has corrected legislation which would otherwise have remained flawed. Good legislation is produced because the second House has more time for debate than the first House; once a Bill is passed here and returns to the Dáil, Members there have a chance to go through the arguments pertaining to all sections of that Bill with more information than they would get from the explanatory memorandum that Ministers hand out with each Bill. Similarly when a Bill comes from the other House we can read through the relevant Dáil debates and get the feeling of the Bill from the Minister introducing it and not be confined to the words on the paper or in the explanatory memorandum. We can avail of excellent opportunities to discuss the Bill with the Minister through the debate on Second and on subsequent Stages.</P>
    <P>The Seanad is of inestimable value to the legislative system. There are certain changes that would improve the performance of the House and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should initiate those changes. Fears are sometimes expressed that changes made here may not be acceptable to the Government. Let us produce the necessary changes and consult the Government afterwards.</P>
    <P>The Seanad could be used to better advantage if MEPs were allowed occasionally to take part in debates. They do not have any opportunity to do so at present and while we might not want to give them many such opportunities &mdash; prospective MEPs would not wish present MEPs to enjoy much publicity in either House of the Oireachtas &mdash; if we are debating EC reports it might be helpful if MEPs would sit in as they do in the European Parliament. Having listened to the debate they could, like a rapporteur, give their impressions of what went on and make certain suggestions.</P>
    <P>At present only Heads of State are allowed to address the Joint Houses of the Oireachtas; when visitors of major consequence come to Ireland they should <Col N="459" /> be given the opportunity to address the Houses on matters of major concern in their own countries. I was glad to see the Mayor of Budapest here today. Public representatives from Eastern Europe would have much to tell us about the changes taking place there. I am not suggesting that city mayors should be allowed in but Heads of State should be allowed to make formal statements to the Seanad on occasion.</P>
    <P>There should be more contact on a formal basis between the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of the Seanad and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of the Dáil. At present there is no opportunity for a formal exchange of views between the two Committee on Procedure and Privileges and because of this, conflicts arise which could be prevented by formal contact on a regular basis. It often appears that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of the Dáil is the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of most consequence but, in fact, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of the Seanad is of equal importance. They should meet on a regular basis to sort out any problems that arise between the two Houses to ensure that Members of both Houses can discharge their duties efficiently; at present we do not have computers for each Senator. PCs are shared between three Senators. There is no other office in the world where formal, private or political information is accessible to two or three public representatives.</P>
    <P>The Seanad has played a major role in the political evolution of this country. The first Seanad played a very positive role in the changeover that took place from British to Irish rule because there were so many Unionists in it. Even without Unionists the first Seanad would have been a good one. The Seanad has fulfilled its role since 1937 to the betterment of parliamentary democracy and changes in its structure and in its method of operation would enhance the role of the Seanad in the minds of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this <Col N="460" /> debate. I have been a Member of the Seanad for two years now and it takes a new Member a certain length of time to get to grips with what is going on. As far as I am concerned this debate is the most important one in which I have participated during my two years in this House.</P>
      <P>It is a great pity that a Government Minister is not present on this occasion as I believe they were on previous occasions when this topic was discussed. I do not believe it sufficient for Members of the Seanad to have a cosy chat about reform and sort out some details. The changes needed are so fundamental that they require serious Government input into our negotiations and deliberations.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that there are but three Members present in the House &mdash; perhaps I am not supposed to comment on attendance but I am used to a city council with active, vibrant, dynamic debate, where people do not make up their minds before they come in. We are talking to ourselves here. Other Senators seem to have a great penchant for stitching things into the record &mdash; I think that is what they call it &mdash; something that has never inspired me because I do not think anybody bothers to read the record. I would like to think I was wrong on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This topic of discussion has come up on at least six previous occasions since 1937 at regular intervals of ten years. In 1937 some very minor changes were introduced in the panels which it would not be relevant to go into. In 1957 when the then Deputy Noel Browne suggested the abolition of the Seanad, the matter was taken more seriously; a Commission of Seanad Electoral Reform was set up which made some worth-while amendments. They suggested something I would approve of, which is that vocationally nominated candidates should be elected by a vocationally established electorate representative of the nominating bodies. That amendment should be considered and implemented. But nothing happened then just as, I believe, nothing will happen as a result of this debate. It is another time filler <Col N="461" /> while we wait for something else to come up.</P>
    <P>In 1967 the role of the Seanad was discussed again by a committee reviewing the Constitution. No major recommendations were made and nothing happened. In 1977 the Committee on Procedure and Privileges tried to initiate a major overhaul of the Seanad but minor changes took place in the Standing Orders only. In 1987 the matter was debated again. I have read those debates and it is interesting to see that some of the Senators, in particular Senators Manning and Murphy, made very similar points in 1987. I mean that as a compliment to them because nothing changed and all they can do is repeat what they said on that occasion.</P>
    <P>It is 54 years since the 1937 Constitution was enacted and nothing fundamental has changed. Surely it would be relevant for us to consider the sort of changes we require to enable this Seanad to contribute to the challenging times this country is facing. Can anybody imagine any other organisation trying to cope with the hurly burly of life and with 1992 coming up, who would proceed with its business, frozen in a framework of rules set up in 1937? I am a member of the board of the First National Building Society and I have learned a great deal from it about how the private sector operates. I cannot imagine trying to operate that building society with rules and regulations laid down in 1937. The thought defies credulity but that is what we are doing in this House.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be accused on this or on any other occasion of suggesting that the Seanad should be abolished. I do not believe the Seanad should be abolished and I would like to stitch that into the record. I would like to put forward the reasons we need a Seanad and, although other speakers have covered some of these points, I wish to put them in at this stage so that my subsequent remarks will be explicable.</P>
    <P>Major problems are now facing the country and a dynamic Seanad could contribute substantially to their resolution. Calm, reasoned, detached and rational <Col N="462" /> debate should take place in this House on major matters, away from the heat and pressures of the other House. TDs represent multi-seat constituencies and are beholden to their electorate in a way that we in this House are not.</P>
    <P>The Seanad is an essential component in the governing process. Legislation is becoming highly technical and complicated. We had a classic example of that with the Environmental Protection Agency Bill. Legislation filters up to this House from the Dáil where the majority are party politicians and it is important that this House takes a long, cool look at all Bills. The Seanad is a layer of throughtful, reasoned democracy which we cannot afford to do without. There are times when there should be a detached judicial view of legislation when it comes before this House, remembering that it leaves to go to the President to be signed and she may refer it to the courts if she thinks it unconstitutional before or after signing it. We should bear that fact in mind.</P>
    <P>We should avail of the opportunity to attract talented people into this House so that their expertise would be generally available to the Houses of the Oireachtas. We all know many fine people who should be in this House but who could not or would not cope with the rigours of a TD's existence acting as messenger boys and carrying out parish pump type politics.</P>
    <P>We, in this House, have an obligation to take a more responsible, less populist view of some of the problems facing us where resources are scarce and demands insatiable. This House should not be competing with the Dáil. Its role is clearly complementary.</P>
    <P>I take my role seriously. I was elected to this House as a watchdog for the ordinary person in the street. Legislation can come through the Dáil in the heat of the moment but we have an important responsibility to make sure that in that mood of over-zealousness, inappropriate measures do not go through. We must be allowed to exercise that right. I find it distressing that small clique who now run the country are dismissive of the local <Col N="463" /> authorities and of the enormous contribution they should and could make. Anybody who knows anything about the country, particularly rural areas, can see the tragedy of allowing that great well of talent and those enormous opportunities exist, come to naught. It is the same as far as the Seanad is concerned. In the same way also, we only allow a member of a political party to run for the Presidency. They must have the support of a major political party. These are all part of the same narrow-minded syndrome.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a large measurement of agreement that there is something wrong. If there were not, we would not be having this debate. We all know we bore the pants off the public. The press find us fairly irrelevant. We are irrelevant and I do not think we should blame the press if they do not cover our deliberations. The press have to sell newspapers. They have to print information news, people are interested in. It must be meaningful. I am not saying we should gear ourselves to suit the media. If we were fulfilling our role in the way it should be fulfilled, the media would be interested and they would cover our deliberations.</P>
    <P>There is agreement on a whole range of points: there should be more time for topical issues; MEPs should be allowed to attend the Seanad; there should be an opportunity to question Ministers; we should have more Bills initiated in the Seanad; we should have more Private Members' time; we should expand the role of the commitees; major interest groups should be allowed to come in to the Seanad to give their case a fair hearing and we should have proper secretarial services, computers and so on. Although I support all the reforms I have just listed they simply tinker at the edges. They do not alleviate the fundamental problem.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the House, Senator Fallon, whom I hold in the highest esteem and believe to be a very thoughtful, intelligent person, has said on numerous occasions that this House should not try to be something it was never meant to be, namely, a mirror image of the Dáil. <Col N="464" /> I agree with him, but has he ever asked why this House tries to be a mirror image of the Dáil? I know the reason and any honest Member of this House must, at heart, agree with me, although I would not necessarily expect Members to say so publicly.</P>
    <P>I have done a small amount of research in <i>Who's Who in Irish Politics.</i> There are a number of these books available. If you look through them you will discover that, leaving out the six university Senators, 41 out of the remaining 54 Senators in this House have previously been in or have run for, the Dáil. That is almost four out of every five Members in this House. The Acting Chairman is an honourable exception as is Senator Honan but there are not many exceptions. The figures speak for themselves. I am happy for anybody else to check them out: I have had them checked and double checked and I believe they are correct.</P>
    <P>Where are the vocational groups, the interest groups, that were supposed to be represented here? Can we genuinely say they are represented? You must obtain a nomination from such a group in order to run for election but that is all. They have nothing to do with the actual election of Members to this House. We have diverted the Seanad from the original premise on which it was based when it was set up by Mr. de Valera in 1937. The problem is not that there are political parties represented here. I do not think anybody would imagine that this House could be made up of 60 Independents similar to the present five. I would ask the Members of this House to differentiate between the words &ldquo;political&rdquo; and &ldquo;party political.&rdquo; People seem to consider those two words synonymous. They are not. Party politics has a place in this House and there have been many eminent party politicians here. From recent memory one can name such Fine Gael Senators as Senators Dooge and Alexis FitzGerald, highly thought of by all. On the other side, Senator Eoin Ryan, Senior, was a most eminent contributor to this House. Senator Mary Robinson, now our President, made a magnificent contribution <Col N="465" /> as a Labour Senator, to this House. Let nobody say I am slamming all party politicians and let no individual Senator take offence at anything I say. No individual or group of Senators is to blame. It is the party system in operation.</P>
    <P>I have read the contributions to <i>Essays in Memory of Alexis FitzGerald.</i> The laudable sentiments of many of these essays encouraged me to come into the House. Edmund Burke defined a party as follows: &ldquo;A party is a body of men united, promoting by their joint endeavours the national interest, upon some particular principle in which they are all agreed.&rdquo; Another sentence refers to an &ldquo;honourable connection&rdquo;. I know all that. I also know that Wheare, who was mentioned by some of the other speakers said: &ldquo;A Second Chamber... need not be so partisan as a Lower House.&rdquo; I put it to Senators that this House is just as partisan as the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, I did not, unfortunately, hear that. There is nothing more understandable than that men or women united by common ties and interests should work together as a unit to promote those interests but when 55 out of the 60 Members of this House are under a party Whip, that is where the trouble begins. There are I am sure, honourable exceptions.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the Senator did not realise I was being facetious. I knew anarchy was what the Senator was thinking of so I popped in the word. I heard it so many times, &ldquo;we must have the party Whip or there will be anarchy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the two years I have been here I have not seen any member of the Government Party break the party Whip. They may say there was never an occasion. I simply state it as a fact in support of my case. We know what the party Whip means and what a three-line Whip means. I am not very interested in whether it is a three-line or a two-line Whip. All I know is the outcome. I beg Senators not to take anything personally. I want to make it clear I am concerned. I made a speech like this in 1976 when I went to America, long before I knew any of the very honourable ladies or gentlemen of this Chamber. This method of inflicting the party Whip and party discipline on this Chamber is totally undersirable, unnecessary and harmful to the working of this House. It is not democracy, it is hypocrisy.</P>
      <P>As far back as 1930 Albert Einstein saw the dangers inherent in a European system similar to ours. He said that the only thing that has discredited the European forms of democracy was not the basic theory of democracy itself but the impersonal character of party alignments. I presume what he meant was that, when you have a party Whip the humanity goes out of politics. We have people so dedicated to an objective that they disregard the effect the party Whip has on them. They are excused because they were under the party Whip. That excuses everything. That can lead to a very undesirable outcome.</P>

      <P>I am a democrat. I am very happy to put my views to the House and to hear Senators' replies. I will sit here and listen most attentively. I am putting my views and it would be a waste of my time, and indeed the time of the other Senators if I was to come in here and give some sort of patter to fill up half an hour. That is not what I am here for. I have no interest in doing that and it is not what I intend to do. I intend to say what I think and I shall be very open minded and listen with great interest of the replies.</P>
      <P>This excessively rigid discipline, demanding a dog-like subservience to the party line in all circumstances, reduces elected representatives to the status of ciphers, silicon chips, where there is no need to have a mind because other people make up your mind for you. It makes a nonsense of democracy. It also reduces what democracy is supposed to be all about &mdash; Government by the people, Government by a handful of men in control of the party apparatus.</P>
      <P>As a result, party politics and the system that they enshrine are falling into disrepute and in the era of instant communications, the public are now becoming aware of this. I think Senator McKenna touched on this.</P>

      <P>What I recollect Senator McKenna to have said was that because there was more widespread communications now more people could see what was going on. That is why the message is now reaching the public. That is what I mean by falling into disrepute in an era of instant communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When discipline within a political party or a political framework ceases to be something which is natural and spontaneous and there comes instead a mindless imposition, enforced with undeviating rigour, the effect is corrosive and counterproductive. The right to exercise freedom of conscience, at any level in society, and no only in the Houses of the Oireachtas, is not a mandate for anarchy and should not be confused with it any more than liberty should be confused with licence, but this is a chant I have heard over and over again. I have no objection to there being parties in this House. I have no objection to party politicians. I am talking about the system by which discipline is enforced. That is <Col N="469" /> quite clearly what I have said and I am not retracting any word of that.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the nomination by the Taoiseach of 11 Senators. I read, in the Official Report in 1987, a splendid speech by Senator Seán Haughey, defending the importance of the Taoiseach's right to nominate the 11, so that it could be ensured that important groups would be represented in the Seanad, vocational, sectional and cultural. That may have been the case last time and I did note, on the last occasion, that five out of the 11 Senators nominated by the Taoiseach did not take the Whip. On this occasion all 11 took the Whip and nine out of the 11 Senator nominated by the Taoiseach had run for the Dáil. I found it a little amusing to read in <i>Who's Who in Irish Politics</i> that one of those nominated was &ldquo;an able woman with a future, if she can take a Dáil seat&rdquo;; and about a Progressive Democrats Senator: &ldquo;This (nomination by the Taoiseach) gives him a lifeline to work on his base and prepare for next Dáil election.&rdquo;; about another eminent Senator: &ldquo;could be a name to reckon with in the future ... if he can get his seat back&rdquo;; in regard to a Senator who is a colleague of mine in the council: &ldquo;His nomination to Seanad by the Taoiseach is a very pointed ploy to unseat Deputy... next time&rdquo; and in relation to another Senator:&rdquo; An Taoiseach gave him a political lifeline by including him in the `eleven'.&rdquo;. This is the cynical and unscrupulous use of this House to further the political careers of party politicians in Dáil Éireann. I do not think this was what the eminent Leader, Mr. de Valera, had in mind in 1937 when he established this Seanad, nor was it for political patronage or the objectives which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that no Member of this House should ever go to the other House or that no Member of the other House should never come to this House. A Member of this House could gain valuable experience should they decide that this was not the right forum for them and should they wish to use their talents in a different House. That is most laudable and understandable, but it is not so, <Col N="470" /> Members should not come into this House for the purposes I have just outlined, that is, that they should look on this House as a sort of purgatory before they get to the real place. Senator Lanigan made that point. The real power is in the other House. There is a total lack of understanding of what this House is supposed to do or what it could do. The nub of the problem is that those Senators who are really looking to go elsewhere know that if they want to have the approval of central office for their nomination at the next election, they must obey the party Whip. If you wish, I will give you examples. If you do not want them, you may take them as read, I will not inflict them on the House.</P>

I quite agree with the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have reached the stage where members of political parties in this House or in the Dáil have put down amendments which they believed in and subsequently they had to vote against their own amendments when they discovered the party did not support them. I have seen the same situation arise in City Hall on numerous occasions. Members of parties say to me, &ldquo;The party Whip was on&rdquo; as though I should accept it and should not be so awkward and difficult. That seems to give everybody in a party the right to, vote whatever way they are told to vote. I have had a Member say to me, &ldquo;The party Whip was on. I did not agree with it but, I was under the Whip&rdquo;. I am <Col N="471" /> sorry the Senator in question is not here because he could nod his head in agreement.</P>

      <P>I may seek re-election if there is any sign of this House reforming itself.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy in his thoughtful contribution mentioned that the Dáil tended to see the Seanad as a threat. If things were working properly the Dáil should be concerned about changes made in legislation here. They should recognise the legitimate power of this House. That is part of our role, to make certain that we control or curb an undemocratic institution. The threat we present to the Dáil at the moment is that there are 41 Members of this House who apparently want to be in the other House. That may well be the reason the Seanad does not have the high profile it would like and why it does not get as much work to do. We should have Senators here who want to be Senators, who are interested in the Seanad <i>per se</i> and are not frustrated would-be TDs. The media often ignores the deliberations of this House. Is it surprising? They consider us irrelevant, and we are irrelevant. I do not think we should blame the media for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said during the course of this debate on the noise and general brouhaha that erupts during the Order of Business. It has been said that we must bring in new regulations to prevent that from happening. Perhaps we should look at the fundamental reason why it happens. Members are frustrated because everything is so irrelevant and boring, as far as the public is concerned, because we do not do the job we were originally founded to do. I would ask Senator McKenna to exclude me from his remarks. I have never, as yet, made any fuss during the Order of Business. I have always behaved as I have been asked to by the Cathaoirleach. I do not say that I will continue to do so. The frustration of <Col N="473" /> other Senators who have been here so much longer than I have may get to me. Can one blame Senators if they look for headlines during the Order of Business? It is the only time they, or this House, are likely to get coverage. We tend, then, to be portrayed in the newspapers as entertainment value, as space fillers, which I deeply regret.</P>
    <P>This House has an important role to play. The Constitution states:</P>
    <P>Every Bill initiated in and passed by Dáil Éireann should be sent to Seanad Éireann and may, unless it be a Money Bill, be amended in Seanad Éireann and Dáil Éireann shall consider any such amendment.</P>
    <P>That places an obligation on this House to ensure that we have an opportunity to amend a Bill and send it back to the Dáil. Just before we broke up for the summer recess the Competition Bill, 1991 and the Payment of Wages Bill, 1991 came to this House and I remember the other side of the House agreed we would not really have any effective opportunity to amend the Bills because the Dáil had gone into recess. The Bills had to be passed and could not wait until after the summer recess and what happened here was irrelevant. That denied us the opportunity to fulfil our functions as defined in the Constitution. We could not discharge the responsibilities placed on us.</P>
    <P>As an elected Senator I have to look to my electorate and be answerable to them for what I am elected to do. There is an honourable option: It is to resign. I am not one to resign, I am not a quitter, and I do not think there is much point in throwing in the sponge in protest in a hotheaded way. Many of my colleagues, like Senator Honan and others, have been here a great deal longer than I have and I must ask them seriously what we should do if we cannot fulfil our obligations in a constructive and positive way. I suggest that unless radical reforms are forthcoming the only option open to us may be to resign.</P>
    <P>I believe that if there was just one change we could bring about &mdash; and that is not a lot to ask &mdash; if the elections to <Col N="474" /> this House were held on the same day as the elections to Dáil Éireann, in one fell swoop, that would solve a great number of problems and a great deal of what is wrong with this House. I am not going to go back on the reasons; I hope for those who are here it is fairly clear.</P>
    <P>I reiterate what I said at the beginning: I am not in favour of the abolition of this House. I believe I have outlined clearly on the record that this House has a very important role to play and I would like to see it play that role. That is my preference. But, if that cannot be done, there is a very strong case to be made that the House should be abolished. Mind you, whether anybody outside would care, is probably a moot question, if anyone would even notice is perhaps what we should be considering.</P>
    <P>I would like to invite fellow Senators, and particularly those who have been here longer than I have, to answer some of the points I put forward, and I assure them that I will listen with an open mind. I would like to make it clear I have not thought this up in the last year or two. I quoted earlier on from a speech I delivered in the United States in 1976 when I was asked to speak on democracy as it operated in Ireland. Most of my comments were made then, in 1976, that is, 15 years ago, not today or yesterday. That is why I beg my esteemed colleagues not to take any personal pique at anything I have said. I am really speaking about a system which I suppose we can say we are all caught up in.</P>
    <P>Senator McKenna asked if I would be seeking re-election because of what I said. I hope that will not be the case because, like many Senators, I firmly believe that politics is an honourable profession. I agree with what was said by Andrew Oliver in Boston over 150 years ago:</P>
    <P>Politics is the most hazardous of all professions. There is not another in which a man can hope to do so much good to his fellow creatures. Neither is there any in which by mere loss of knell he may do such widespread harm. Nor <Col N="475" /> is there another in which he may so easily lose his own soul. Nor is there another in which a positive and strict veracity is so difficult. Danger is the inseparable companion of honour. With all the temptations and degradations that beset it politics is still the noblest career any man can choose.</P>
    <P>That is why I hope that I will be able to remain in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to make a long contribution to this debate but there are a few points I would like to develop. Indeed, there are possibly a few points that I would put to Senator Hederman. Basically Seanad Éireann is a vocational body. It can be said that that was the original intention and to a great extent the existence of the Seanad has shown that, politics need not play, and to my mind should not play, a major part in all the activities of the House.</P>
      <P>That does not say that I disagree with the party political system, as Senator Hederman has intimated she does. I think that is part of her frustration at the whole process of the House &mdash; her independence, as she sees it. She says that in a political party people are whipped into business, whipped in to vote, and do not have any say in the decision. Of course, that is very far from the truth. That is not the situation at all. There is consensus and, if necessary, a majority decision inside the party on issues prior to voting. Those are the facts. Of course, in her case, her decision can be made on the bicycle on the way in because she has nobody to dispute with her. There is no conflict. If she makes up her mind on something she can come in here and say it and that is it. In a party there is consulatation, there is consensus, or, if not, there is majority decision. She ballyrags to some extent the whip system, but Senator Hederman herself used the politcal whip system to good advantage to become Lord Mayor of Dublin &mdash; I think it was in 1988 and 1989 &mdash; when the Whips of Fine Gael and Labour whipped her into the Mansion House. That is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> I do not want to dwell on that any further. It is easy to come in here and attack fellow Senators &mdash; and I would consider a major part of Senator Hederman's contribution to be an attack on her fellow Senators, an attack on the party political system and an attack on the House. What I did not get from her were many constructive proposals for the reformation of the House. It is very easy to criticise any structure, but more important is what somebody puts forward to build, develop, change or modernise a structure to bring this House into line with the 1990s, 2000 and beyond &mdash; if such reforms are necessary.</P>
    <P>I am of the opinion that Seanad reforms are necessary, but I do not believe the best way of going about it is to attack Members of this House who are elected through the democratic system and who perform on behalf of this country, because 43 Senators have the country as a whole as their constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not attack any Senator; it was the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and must address themselves on that basis. Indeed, Senator Lanigan outlined in very great detail the efforts and the sacrifices that are made by candidates to get elected to this House, in particular those who are elected through the panel system, who are voted in by members of county councils, county boroughs and Members of Seanad Éireann and Dáil Éireann. For the vote that puts them in here they have to travel 11,000 or 12,000 miles, through the length and breadth of this country, through the cities and towns, meeting public representatives on the ground, dealing as a professional with a professional, and convincing them that they are the best person to represent their point of view on that panel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For somebody to be elected to this House this is an enormous task. It is an enormous challenge to travel 11,000 or 12,000 miles in four weeks and visit four, five or six hundred people who have a vote and try to convince them that you are the best person to be elected. It is <Col N="477" /> inappropriate for a Member of this House, who is elected on the postal vote system &mdash; I speak in particular about the university Senators, who do not have the same task or the same challenge of travel &mdash; to attack those who have put in such an effort to be elected to this House, and who come in here weekly to work on behalf of the nation and to address themselves to whatever legislation is initiated in this House or whatever legislation comes from the Lower House to be amended or passed.</P>
    <P>If I have a crib with the workings of this House it would be with the Order of Business. I think it is totally inappropriate for the Leader of this House to have to respond in a few minutes on business of the day, and on legislation for the week or sometimes the following or consecutive weeks. People jumping in on the Order of Business and expounding, sometimes willy nilly, on personal issues without having given any prior notice to the Leader of the House, is an abuse of the House. I would like to see a situation where prior notice of questions is given in this House, where the Leader has an opportunity to discuss with the relevant Departments what is the approach, the intention, so that on the day he can give a more precise and more informative response.</P>
    <P>The House is comprised of 60 people, 43 of whom are elected through the system I mentioned, that is, by the local authority members and by votes of people in both Houses; six people are elected through the University Panel and 11 nominees are made by the Taoiseach of the day. I can appreciate the situation regarding the Taoiseach's 11 nominees. Indeed, this was a well thought out provision by Éamon de Valera for the composition of Seanad Éireann &mdash; it would be impossible for legislation to get through both Houses of the Oireachtas and get to the President if we did not have a system where, when the Lower House passed a Bill, this House was not in a position to do so also, after consideration and amendment where necessary. I believe that this House should amend any time it feels it appropriate to do so, and the <Col N="478" /> opportunity should always be there for that.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I would go further and say that I think more legislation should be initiated in this House, in particular legislation relevant to the local authority system, because basically the local authority view is very much in evidence in this House so far as it is the local authorities who elect 70 per cent of the Members to this House. In recent times we saw the Environmental Protection Agency Bill come through this House. That was a very helpful development because at the end of the day who will be involved with that agency other than the local authorities. It was very appropriate that it was debated, amended and got the full attention of this House. In fact, I understand that over 40 Members of this House contributed to the debate on that Bill. That is an indication of the seriousness with which Members of this House took that Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to the composition of the House, I feel that, if anything, the local authority system does not have enough say in the number of people who get nominations to this House. If this is to be a true democratic House then there is no better way for democracy to be implemented to the full than by increased nomination through the local authority system. In the thinking of Europe today we are very much moving towards a situation where there is consciousness that the people at the very bottom &mdash; that is, the small local authority, the region &mdash; should be more involved in decision making and in particular in the opinions and the advice given before decisions are made.</P>
    <P>In this House there is only one local authority body with a nomination. That is extraordinary. One local authority body has one nomination to this House, yet 70 per cent of the people elected to this House are elected by local authority members. I do not think that is in the best interests of local democracy. I do not want to say &mdash; and I am not saying &mdash; that any of the nominating bodies should not have a nomination, but what I am saying is that the local authority system <Col N="479" /> should have an increased number of nominations. The General Council of County Councils is the only body that has a nomination to this House. I was fortunate to have that nomination but they have it on one panel only, that is, on the Administrative Panel. Yet the local authority system addresses itself daily to areas such as agriculture, health, education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The local authority system is connected on a daily basis to practically all five panels that have a nomination or in the Seanad &mdash; are administrative, agriculture, cultural and education, labour or industrial and commercial. I would like the local authority umbrella body or bodies to have a nomination on the five panels. Then you would have a truly democratic approach to the Seanad, and, if they were elected here, they could play a very positive role in dealing with the areas of interest to local <Col N="480" /> authorities but bringing a more concise approach on the Floor of this House.</P>
      <P>At the moment their only opportunity for nomination is on the Administrative Panel, with one nomination. I do not think that is giving local authorities a fair crack of the whip. Only a few years back the national umbrella group of the county committees of agriculture had two nominations to this House.</P>
      <P>What were the county committees of agriculture made up of? They were made up of members of local authorities. Instead of the role of local authorities and their involvement in this House being enhanced, it has diminished. If there is to be reform of this House then I would like the local authority to have a bigger involvement in the process of nomination to this House.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to hold up the House any longer. What I would hope is that over a period reforming motions might come before this House. Today and last week we have been discussing the role of the Seanad. I do not see anything wrong with bringing a reforming motion before this House, allowing us to have a deeper debate. I am not sure whether Standing Orders permit this. What I do not want to see is that we talk for two days about reforming this House and then it is dropped; but in two years' time somebody decides we will have two days debating it again. That would not be in the best interest of this House. I would like to see, possibly over the next few weeks before this session finishes, that something definite and positive would take place on this matter, that some structure would be set in place and that we would have some opportunity to take on one, two or three reforms, if the House thought them necessary. I believe there is a consensus in this House for a certain amount of reform. Therefore, I hope that at the end of this debate something positive will have come out of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I tend to agree with my colleague across the way that we certainly want reform here. We are talking about a Seanad which was established under a Constitution in July 1937, more than 50 <Col N="481" /> years away; but in the lifetime of the running of affairs of countries it is not a great length of time. I certainly want reform and I will spell out the areas in which I would like to see reform. However, for many reasons, I do not think there is any need for a shake-up to the radical extent sought by Senator Hederman.</P>
      <P>I see the need for a place in politics for Independents, as the Senator and her colleagues are Independents. Certainly there is a place within a political system but we have about 160 Members of a Parliament in this country and I cannot see how a political system in a democracy could work if you had 160 or 170 Independents. I do not like the notion of the kind of ultimate purity of the Independents and the corruption of the members of the political parties in a politics system. You cannot run a country in that manner; there is scope for both. There is huge scope for a political party system, and I make no apology for being part of that system within the party of which I am a member, but, at the same time, I have a lot of latitude to have independence of thought and independence of movement in the context of that membership of the party to which I belong. To that degree I would not go overboard on this notion of the ultimate purist Independent as opposed to the corrupt politician in the political party.</P>
      <P>The Constitution enacted in 1937 was, I think, one of the wiser moves of de Valera when he was in power in this country. One of his fans is across the way from me. He was a man who raised hackles or was the subject of adoration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1937 Constitution has worn the years extremely well but there are problems when we seek some reform here. Those of us who have been elected through the panel system and who have a loyalty to those who elected us around the country have a great belief in the system that obtains and in the local authority system and all that goes with it. Having said that, I think there is scope <Col N="482" /> for some kind of reform to give a measure of direct representation to certain vocational interests. One of the problems is this. There was a concept in 1937 within the bicameral system of an Upper House that would not be as fiercely political as the Lower House and in which there would be vocational representation. There was a pious hope that by giving nominations to bodies such as the Irish Farmers Association or the chambers of commerce, the ICC, the libraries or the Royal Irish Academy that this would result in a House with Members with an avocation to these types of groups. That has happened to a degree but not to the extent it might have done, because of the nature of the electorate.</P>
      <P>There is scope for reform in certain ways. For example, the newly elected Taoiseach has the right to arbitrarily nominate 11 Senators after a Seanad election has taken place. That is a reasonable provision to give whatever Government are elected a working majority in this House without which you would have legislative chaos. Having said that, in the context of a House with only 60 Members I believe a Government would have adequate control here if instead of having 11 nominees they had perhaps as few as seven nominees. You could still maintain a House of 60 Members by making four seats available for direct election by vocational groups. Alternatively, if there was the political will to do it, you could extend the membership of the Seanad from 60 to 64, 65 or 66 to bring in direct vocational representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am suggesting is that without interfering with the present method of election for about three-quarters of the Seanad you could certainly probably reduce the number of nominees directly nominated by a Taoiseach without affecting the control the newly elected Government would have over the Seanad. You could have a system of direct election by certain vocational groups as we have in the university system; or, if you did not want to touch the numbers the Taoiseach may nominate, you could extend the numbers of the Seanad to incorporate this. If the universities can elect four <Col N="483" /> Senators directly to this House on the votes of their graduates scattered all over the world, it is not unreasonable for farmers who are members of a group such as the Irish Farmers Association, or business people around the country who have links with the chambers of commerce, or industrialists within the Confederation of Irish Industry, to say: &ldquo;What type of system do we have in this Seanad under which a university graduate has a direct vote to have Senators in there but I am an honest-to-God farmer, on 30 acres in Mayo and I do not have that right;&rdquo; or &ldquo;I have a shop in Naas and why can I not work through my local chamber of commerce and build up the same kind of rights?&rdquo; There is a very strong case for that, because I think that was the original concept of de Valera in 1937 which did not work itself through because of the system we have devised.</P>
    <P>Obviously, there has to be reform with regard to the university representation. Of course it is reasonable, if you want vocational representation, that the universities should have it. But there is a huge change in the structure of the universities in the country since 1937. Today, rather than having a situation where you simply have National University and Trinity College, you are dealing with Dublin City University, the University of Limerick and many other institutes of higher learning who want to have their place in the sun as much as other universities.</P>
    <P>If you read the Constitution there is provision for such direct representation under Article 19 of the Constitution, under which there can be direct vocational representation but only if it is in substitution of the relevant number of members from the present panel system that obtains, and in reality it is difficult to arrange that. There is equal provision under the same Article where the universities are concerned for the representation of new seats of learning provided there is a corresponding reduction in the numbers to be elected by the two colleges of university at present <Col N="484" /> represented in this House, namely, National University and Trinity College.</P>
    <P>Article 19 states:</P>
    <P>Provision may be made by law to the direct election by any functional or vocational group or association or council of so many members of Seanad Éireann as may be fixed by such law in substitution for an equal number of the members to be elected from the corresponding panels of candidates constituted under Article 18 of this Constitution.</P>
    <P>There is a scope, while reducing possibly the numbers of nominees of the Taoiseach, to allow these things to happen. I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by Senator Hederman that there is need for a radical streak in Irish politics. I admire her activity in this House and as Lord Mayor of Dublin she was an outstanding success but I disagree with the sentiments she expressed this evening in describing the whip system as hypocrisy, saying there is no need to have a mind anymore and that this is not Government by the people for the people. One cannot run an executive or a Parliament with 150 independent voices. That would lead to utter chaos.</P>

      <P>I make no apology for being part of such a system and it has not caused me any conflict of conscience so far.</P>
      <P>I am amused when people tend to denigrate the Seanad and say it is a joke and a talking shop. I do not know what people want in a legislature. Do we want a place where, instead of talking, people pull out guns or do we want the Legislature to behave like an executive and give orders to people who will not take them? A parliament, in fairly crude terms, is a talking shop. They denigrate the Seanad as a talking shop and hold the Dáil in much higher regard.</P>
      <P>I have had experience in both Houses of the Oireachtas. A Senator, with the exception of not being able to put down a parliamentary question for answer by a Minister, has all the powers of a Deputy. As a Senator, I am a Member of the Legislature, I am a member of my parliamentary party. I am eligible for inclusion on parliamentary committees; I am eligible for inclusion on parliamentary bodies or quasi-parliamentary bodies that are active outside this country. I have the right as a legislator to question and take up issues with civil servants and with executives in semi-State bodies and local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Seanad is a talking shop so is the Dáil, and so are county councils. I do not think the Seanad is unique in that regard. In the Seanad, if one has not an overwhelming ambition to be in the Dáil, given that to a degree, one is away from the localised activity in which every Deputy is largely involved, there is more time to reflect on issues. One or two of my colleagues across the House made some very valid points. As a result of the system of election which bring Senators to the high ways and by ways of every <Col N="486" /> townland and village, they build up an encyclopaedic knowledge of this country and whereas one's background might be in farming, industry or whatever, one tends to acquire a well rounded view of the country, economy and the people and their problems. I do not see us either singly or as a body being in any sense irrelevant.</P>
    <P>We have a bicameral system. The bicameral model is a fundamental parliamentary model which obtains in many European countries. Democracy has faults but this system must be made to work. One delaying power in relation to Bills is a useful tool for public opinon. In the case of a strong Government forcing legislation through the Dáil before public opinion has had time to vent its range against it, if it so decides, our delaying powers, the fact that time must pass before it goes through this House and the blocking powers we have in certain emergencies, are very healthy provisions.</P>
    <P>I read the Constitution to see what was relevant to the Seanad in 1937 and know it differs today. Article 25 deals with the promulgation of laws and presentation to the President for signature. Article 22.2.3º states:</P>
    <P>If the President after consultation with the Council of State decides to accede to the request he shall appoint a Committee of Privileges....</P>
    <P>The President of Ireland is a lady. Article 22.2.3º speaks about the President being a male. Article 25 states that the Bill is to go to the President &ldquo;for his signature and for promulgation by him&rdquo; and Article 25.3 states that the Bill is to be presented to him for signature. Article 25.4.2º states: &ldquo;Every Bill signed by the President shall be promulgated by him as a law by the publication by his direction...&rdquo; Article 25.2.1º states: &ldquo;... presented to the President for his signature and for promulgation by him as a law....&rdquo; Does this mean that we have a constitutional crisis at present in that our Constitution states legislation can only become law if it is signed by a male President? Do we need to have a referendum to sort this out?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="487" /> In Article 26.1.2º there is reference to &ldquo;the President for his signature&rdquo;. Article 27.4.1º states that the President shall &ldquo;pronounce his decision&rdquo;. Article 27.4.2º states that &ldquo;it shall not be obligatory on the President to pronounce his decision&rdquo;. Article 27.5.1º states: &ldquo;... he shall inform the Taoiseach....&rdquo; Article 27.5.2º states: &ldquo;... presented to the President for his signature and promulgation by him ...&rdquo; The Constitution constantly refers to &ldquo;he&rdquo; and &ldquo;him&rdquo;. I am saying this in a slightly facetious manner but only slightly, because it seems an enormous discourtesy to the President if the Constitution only allows for a male President. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges should give some thought as to how this might be amended without a referendum. There is a matter of courtesy at stake.</P>
    <P>So far as the workings of the Seanad are concerned, there is scope for reform. Senator Finneran mentioned the Order of Business. The system unfortunately lends itself to us all seeking to get notice on the Order of Business because we are forced a lot of the time to deal only with very dull legislation. Unless we have a system under which there is scope for us to debate the burning issues of the day such as, for example, the issues in Yugoslavia, instead of debating issues retrospectively and lots of dull, and some very localised ones, then Senators will dive in when there is scope to do so and the only time there is scope on the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>We give ourselves a little too much latitude on Private Members' motions on some very localised issues. There is scope in politics for consideration of the most humble issues at the parish pump. We are talking about a national legislative assembly designed to look at national issues and while we should look at local government and educational issues, we are unduly tolerant in allowing specal debates on very localised issues that are relevant to certain villages and townlands but have no national implications whatever. There is room to tighten up on that with tougher handling.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="488" /> It is patently obvious that there is need for a foreign affairs committee. We are a member of the European Community. We know that European Community membership has huge implications for our people and for both Houses of the Oireachtas. We know that the Houses do not have a fraction of the clout they had in the past because so much power has shifted to Brussels, but we are not paying any attention to the links that are necessary to weld both the Houses of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament and Commission together. There is immense scope for developing links between our elected Members of the European Parliament and the elected Members of the Seanad and Dáil, but we are doing nothing about furthering that very necessary issue.</P>
    <P>Our country is one of 12 members of the European Community. The Taoiseach sits as one Head of State and our Minister for Foreign Affairs is one of the Council of Ministers. Our politics today are much broader than they were in the past. We are concerned on a daily basis with many foreign policy issues in which the Government are deeply involved. If the Government are deeply involved, the Legislature should be deeply involved. It is a fact of life and I do not like to repeat it <i>ad infinitum</i>, but if there is a stark necessity for reform, we have no choice other than to highlight it as often as possible. Apparently this is the only Parliament in any European Community country which does not have a foreign affairs committee. We have other committees but if we had such a committee the talents of our Members would be used and it would take pressure off the House. It is unique, it is regrettable, that such a committee does not exist given all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>We were very pleased some months ago when the Taoiseach apparently committed his support for the establishment of such a committee but it fizzled out because he was no longer going to make Deputy Brian Lenihan chairman of the committee. I want to see that committee established. We could do it ourselves, independent of the Executive. We do <Col N="489" /> not necessarily need the goodwill of the Taoiseach for such a committee to be established. We are having this debate without any presence from the Executive. Unlike other speakers I do not regret that there is no Minister present. It shows we can operate as a forum entirely independent of the Executive. If the Government do not do something soon about establishing such a committee, we should seek with the Dáil to establish a parliamentary foreign affairs committee. If the Dáil do not want to join with us there is nothing to stop us from establishing such a committee. If we do that we will show this House has power and independence of thought.</P>
    <P>There is scope here also to do something as far as emigrant representation is concerned. We had many debates on this issue recently. There are serious problems in Dáil Éireann. There are all kinds of logistical problems about who should vote, how you would monitor and police this voting and ensure it is not abused. Given that we are not in competition with the Dáil and that, whatever Government are in power they have a built-in majority here, any minor abuses should not cost this House too much thought if we establish the basic principle to do something about emigrant representation. If we are looking at the extension of vocational representation to other groups, we should look at emigrants. In my part of the country this is a crucial issue. To people in parts of west Mayo, London is relevant and Dublin is becoming irrelevant. I would welcome a move in this direction because these people would bring a freshness of thought, maybe a certain cynicism. They would probably tell us some home truths we might not like to hear, but it would be a fresh and stimulating approach.</P>
    <P>I welcome reform but not of a very radical nature. I have been pleased and I am pleased to be a Member of this House and I say that without apology to anybody.</P>

      <P>Over the last number of years one of the words bandied about in local authorities, the Seanad and Dáil <Col N="490" /> was &ldquo;reform&rdquo;. I sometimes wonder if we realise the good job the people who set up these Houses did. They just did not pull words out of a hat. There was a lot of work put into them and I think they work very well. We heard a lot of talk about reform in education. We did away with A, B, C, one, two, three and the three Rs, as they were known, and today we have more illiterate people in our society than we had 30 years ago. We threw out what we had too quickly. If we are to have reform, an all-party committee should be set up to discuss it in detail. Some people seem to think that reform means implementing their pet ideas and nothing else.</P>
      <P>Some speakers think there should be no politicians in this House. This is a political Chamber and that is what it was intended to be. I saw in this House recently that some Independents who had been very critical of political parties and said people should declare for this House or for the Dáil but should not have a choice, have changed their minds. I do not blame them for that. They are entitled to change their minds. It reminds me of a little poem that was in my schoolbook. People who are fairly well acquainted with nature realise that a fox at this time of the year likes red berries. In the poem he saw red berries on a cherry tree and, &ldquo;He tried and tried and tried in vain then he tried and tried again&rdquo;. Then turning away, &ldquo;They are sour&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;such food is only thrash to me&rdquo;. The punchline is very important: &ldquo;How many like the fox despise the heights to which they cannot rise&rdquo;. When I hear people criticising things I always think of that little poem. It is a pity so much good reading was taken out of our educational system because in the Fourth Reader there was a story, good English and a poem with a moral.</P>

If they are so good they should be in a political party. They are so dictatorial in their behaviour and manner that they cannot listen to any other views. They are so obsessed with their own views that they will not listen to anybody else speak. However that does not worry me.

      <P>In this House we have a panel system which is very good. It was set up in 1937. We have experts from the agricultural area. People might think that because they do not have university degrees they are not experts in their own field but I can confirm they are. They deal with the problems and they know about agriculture and farming. Those on the commercial and industrial panel know what they are talking about as do those on the administrative and labour panel. We also have the university panel. We have a cross-section of views and experts in all fields. They are experts not just in theory but from a practical point of view. Politicians who are elected here represent a very broad spectrum of society. Other Senators represent a very small group of people so this House is representative of all sectors. Small minority groups would have no voice if they depended on the votes of politicians. The system is very good because it gives those people a platform and an opportunity to have their point of view heard.</P>

    <P>We have initiated quite a number of <Col N="492" /> Bills in this House, I mention in particular the Companies Bill.

Many amendmens made in this House are accepted and Ministers give great consideration to what Senators say so we have a real input into legislation and in that way we do a very important job.</P>
    <P>We want reform but we should not be talking about reform for the sake of reform. I have not heard many good ideas put forward in this debate so far. There was nothing positive. It is very easy to break an egg but nobody has come up with a solution to put it back together again. It is very easy to break everything we have and say this and that are wrong but very few have positive ideas about what we should do and why we should do it, which is most important.</P>

      <P>Politicians must do their job and work at the grassroots. It is great for those who have an elite group to elect them. They can post a ballot paper across the sea and get them back with God knows whose vote. Sometimes they call to the houses and say, &ldquo;Johnny or Maggie is in America but you have their ballot paper and we know how to mark it.&rdquo; It is grand to have that little elite society but politicians cannot do that type of thing. People must come and vote in person for us. We must go out and talk to them. I am proud to be a member of a political party and I am sure Senator Howard is equally proud to be a member of a political party. There is no way in which two elections could take place on the same day. It would be ludicrous. It is not on. I heard another Senator on that side who is now running for the Dáil in the next election speaking just as Senator Hederman is speaking now. I thought I answered that when I quoted the little poem but apparently the moral of my story was not interpreted as I intended it to be.</P>

It is easy for people who do not have that obligation to say what should be done. We are answerable to the people at the grassroots and we must see exactly what they need. Our strength is in this House in that we know what is needed and we make our views known clearly. We are in a position to put forward amendments and our points of view. Even when our party in Government put forward a Bill we can make the point that even though we support it, we would like the Minister to amend it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the failure of the Government to complete a review of broadcasting legislation; and calls on the Government to publish a White Paper outlining a high quality range of options to preserve and develop public service broadcasting in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for talking the trouble to be with us this evening when I am sure he has many other things on his mind. The events mentioned in the 6 o'clock news will have given him all he can do to avoid being distracted. I appreciate his being here.</P>
      <P>It is now just over a year since the Broadcasting Act, 1990, came into force. It has been an abysmal failure. The Minister's remarks to the effect that he is considering reforming the legislation, when those remarks have been coded, are a clear admission of that reality. There is no doubt but that the Broadcasting Act, 1990, has been an unmitigated disaster. At the time it was uncalled for, everybody advised against it. The motive for its introduction had nothing to do with broadcasting or the welfare of the broadcasting community. The motives for its introduction I believe were derived from the philosophy and principles of GUBU. Thy were the overwhelming factors and reasons which gave rise to its introduction. What has happened since is consistent with the principles of GUBU.</P>
      <P>RTE are now faced with the reality that they have more advertising than they are allowed to take. They are in a dilemma if they do not turn away advertising revenue between now and Christmas they will find themselves seriously in hock next year in relation to what revenue they will be allowed to generate. Advertising rates in RTE have been artificially increased by the legislation. Small Irish companies are no longer able to advertise on RTE or with RTE because of the effects of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="495" /> The introduction of capping, which was part and parcel to the central feature of the 1990 Act, has seriously damaged RTE. It has also seriously damaged the private television and film industry. Two hundred jobs have been lost in RTE at a time of very serious unemployment. There have also been serious job losses in the private sector. In addition, one of the effects of this Act has been to halt many very important developments which should be taking place in RTE. There have been no developments in RTE in relational to regional programmes. There have been no developments in relation to education programmes. Schools' television does not now exist in RTE although there is a great need for it. As far as the Open University or any Irish form is concerned, that simply has not happened. We are now totally dependent on the British Open University to provide that facility for Irish people. I have no doubt but that there is a considerable demand for such a system. It is a great pity that RTE have not been able to meet that demand or, at least, to put Irish options and Irish modules on the screen and to devise and integrate them into some of the UK systems.</P>
    <P>The drama department in RTE has been very seriously damaged by what has happened. RTE drama production is now effectively confined to two &ldquo;soaps&rdquo;. They have been unable to produce drama which would give a platform for our Irish authors. They have been unable to produce anything of significance this year in relation to the centenary of the death of Charles Stewart Parnell. We have been dependent on the BBC for those types of productions. We have had to buy in material from the BBC which, while it is in many ways very worthwhile, is not Irish. It has not got the Irish slant on things, it does not give the Irish view, and that is a pity.</P>
    <P>In relation to the changes which have arisen from the capping, which was part and parcel of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, the real gains have been for Ulster Television and for some of the British television networks, particularly Sky <Col N="496" /> Television. In effect, what has happened is that money which would go to RTE and which would work its way back into the Irish economy to provide jobs and employment in the independent film sector, has gone overseas.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that it has taken this time for the Minister to come around to the idea that reformation of the legislation is now desirable. The year and a month in which this Act has been in force has certainly created great difficulties. Late as it is, it is welcome that there are some moves to reform the legislation.</P>
    <P>It can also be said that the Act failed in its main objective, which was to allow TV3 to be set up. Not only is TV3 now blown out of the water but as a result of the Act, Windmill Lane Studios are left in a very difficult position. They had to take appropriate measures to protect themselves from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will. The reality is that television stations such as TV3 or a third television network in this country can only be established at the expense, or cost, of effectively destroying RTE. I do not believe there is enough advertising there to support a third channel. It is also well worth pointing out that the capping proposals contained in the Broadcasting Act did not help TV3. It simply damaged RTE without producing any worthwhile benefit to TV3. As I said already, they have created a considerable degree of difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very disappointed that over the recent years no White Paper has been produced on broadcasting. That is a great pity. Indeed, I would go so far as to say there is no Government policy on broadcasting at present. There is now a great need for the production of a White Paper. There is a need to consider what public service broadcasting is. There is need to consider who should define <Col N="497" /> public service broadcasting. It is very important that that should be debated. All the issues should be examined in a White Paper.</P>
    <P>One person's concept of public service broadcasting, public service radio or public service television can be another person's extremely boring programme. It is very important that the issues involved would be fully discussed. We must debate the resources. We must have a clear idea of the resources which are needed for public service broadcasting and it is important that we would work out where those resources would come from. It is very important that we should have a clear idea of the cost of the television licence and the use to which the revenue it generates should be put.</P>
    <P>We must consider in great detail the role of the independent broadcasting sector. I, for one, believe that the independent broadcasting sector &mdash; the radio and television sectors &mdash; have an important role to play. It is important that we clearly work out their functions, their obligations, their duties, their size, and the restrictions and terms under which they would be allowed to work. There are almost unlimited options in relation to broadcasting now. I am concerned that those options would be discussed and debated, and that they would be debated in a structured manner. For those reasons, it is very important that a White Paper should be produced. It is also very important that a White Paper should be produced because of the developments which are taking place in Europe in relation to television. The developments which are taking place in relation to cable television have very considerable potential. It is important that a White Paper should be produced which can consider the role and function of the proposed television service, which will be an entirely Irish language one and which will be primarily aimed at the Gaeltacht and the Irish speaking community.</P>
    <P>In relation to the proposals for a television service specifically designed for the Gaeltacht and for the Irish speaking community, it is very important that the money would be spent and considered <Col N="498" /> in the context of the role of the Irish language, the Gaeltacht and the preservation of Irish culture. I do not believe that money spent on an Irish television channel &mdash; in other words, a television channel in the Irish language &mdash; can be justified unless that money, which is of the order of £30 million, is spent to enhance the Gaeltacht and develop the Irish language.</P>
    <P>All the issues should be considered and debated in a structured manner. It is important that consideration should be given to the possibility of the production of a comprehensive news service, which is different to the RTE news service, which is separate from it. The development of at least an adequate comprehensive news service seems impossible. I would like to see the issues involved being discussed.</P>
    <P>In relation to RTE itself, I would be very much in favour of a change in the composition of the Authority, in other words, I would be in favour of a change in the manner in which the Authority is compiled. I do not think it is desirable or good that all members of the authority should be nominated by the Government. I would like to see Government nominees on the Authority, perhaps, confined to maybe two members. I would also like to see various interest groups, who have a role to play and a contribution to make in broadcasting, being represented on the RTE Authority. Of course, I would also be very anxious that the people who work in RTE would be represented on the Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not. They are nominated by the Government and not by the people in RTE. I would like to see the workers in RTE elected by the people who work in the station. That is the point I am anxious to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see RTE opened up to a far greater extent to the private film and current affairs production element. There is an important role for that segment of the broadcasting industry. I <Col N="499" /> would like to see that structured and defined over a relatively short to medium term, in other words, that slots of RTE time would, as it were, be contracted out on a structured basis to elements and sources in the broadcasting and television world who are indpendent from RTE. It is important that we have diversity of views in broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I do not think that, at this stage, anyone would say that the introduction of the local stations has been anything but a success and a desirable development. I am fully aware that there are great difficulties being experienced in many of these stations, but I think that the better ones are providing a very useful service for the communities they serve. For example, stations like Clare FM provide a wonderful service for the community they serve. Some of the Dublin stations also provide a very valuable service. Certainly the choice of music, and so on, some of them play is very appropriate, and there is a definite audience for it. They are meeting a clear demand.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of State money being provided for these stations I would not have any particular hangup about that principle. I would have very clear ideas in relation to the purposes that money would be used for. I would have very clear ideas as well in relation to the restrictions which would be placed on what that money could be used for. I certainly would not have any principled objection to money being used in those stations for a public service broadcasting function, if it was essential that that money should be given to some of those stations to allow them to continue to serve the community they now serve. I would like to see that issue fully debated. I would certainly like to see the whole thing very carefully structured. I would be firmly and vigorously opposed to the idea of State money going into the pockets of people simply to make them rich. There is a case to be made for supporting a public service broadcasting function being provided by some of those stations.</P>
    <P>I believe it is absolutely imperative that RTE should not be dominated by any <Col N="500" /> political party, whether that party are in Government or out of Government. I also believe it is absolutely imperative that nobody is left in any doubt that that is the reality.</P>

      <P>I second the motion and wish to follow the line and sentiments expressed by Senator Upton. The last thing I would like to see &mdash; and I hope that sentiment is reflected on the other side of the House &mdash; is that we would have a public service broadcasting that would be controlled by a single party. From that point of view there is a need to ensure that there are democratic structures in relation to the authority of RTE and to its control at all times. It is a shame we have to be here again today debating this issue which we debated only a year ago in this House. At that time we very clearly stated that the proposals by the then Minister for Communications, Deputy Burke, were totally unacceptable to the Labour Party and, indeed, would not result in achieving what he wished. He stated he wished to have a level playing field but the level playing field has not resulted in the establishment of a third independent station. If anything, it has virtually brought about the downfall of Windmill Lane who have just called in the examiner. It has been very detrimental in that sense. The previous Minister for Communications owes Windmill Lane an apology.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the implications of the Broadcasting Act, 1990 and that was one of the effects of the Act. It was a shame that Act was introduced, as I said, to establish a level playing field. The level playing field was effectively to cap RTE advertising so that public service funding could be diverted <Col N="501" /> for the purposes of establishing independent private stations. I do not think that is a basic principle we can accept in relation to any consortium or development in this country, or in relation to any business enterprise. It is not our job to provide or to divert funding from another public service into the pockets of a consortium or any proposed or potential development. I would be very much opposed to that principle. We have seen that it has not been successful in achieving what Deputy Burke sought to achieve.</P>
      <P>I would also question the motives of Deputy Burke at the time. There seemed to be, from many of the remarks made, an inbuilt hostility to RTE. RTE was presented as having an attitude towards Fianna Fáil and the Government as one of opposition to it. Certainly, from a number of the remarks and the whole ethos of the discussion that took place at that time it was seen as the Government getting their own back on RTE by establishing a competitor, rather than looking for sound financial and economic progress or development.</P>
      <P>It is ironic in the context of the tradition of Fianna Fáil, who have had a very fine tradition of public service, public enterprise and State involvement in that sector, that there should be a move away from recognition of RTE as the public service broadcasting station and diverting public money and control of the airwaves to an independent sector. The proposal was badly thought out in the first place. There is no room for a third television station. There is room for two stations and there are two stations there at the present time. They are providing a broad range of services. There is enormous competition from abroad, from across the Border and from Britain. There is not really room for three stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed cost of setting up an independent station is in the region of £40 to £50 million. It is very difficult to see how that can be justified or how advertising is going to enable any consortium to get their money back. Obviously what the Minister was considering &mdash; and maybe the present Minister is <Col N="502" /> considering again &mdash; was allocating a section of the revenue from the licence fee. There seems to be a shift from capping advertising to diverting a section of the revenue from the RTE licence fee into subsidising a third independent station. That would be a bad idea and it should be scrapped before it goes any further. I would hate to see the Minister coming into this House with such proposals I do not think they would be successful.  We would find ourselves debating another measure a year from now to try to undo the mess.</P>
    <P>Neither would I like to see the Minister propose that we privatise our second station, Network 2. I do not think that is the way to go about it either. I would hate the Minister to be tempted to do something along those lines, seeing that TV3 has not been awarded a licence. The Minister should rethink the entire matter. That is why we are proposing a White Paper. The review should be thorough. The Minister has been involved to some degree in a review but I do not know what stage he has reached in it. It must be comprehensive. It must look again at the market that exists here and at the utter failure &mdash; the dismal failure &mdash; of amending what was supposed to be the problem this time last year. He should look again at the value of having RTE as the public service broadcasting, but with a variety of roles.</P>
    <P>RTE should be allowed to operate without a cap on advertising. There should be no monopoly. RTE should operate competitively in the market, whether here, Northern Ireland or elsewhere. There should be no proposal to divert the licence fee. There should be a requirement that RTE commission the production of domestic, native-based programmes that would be used both in the station and sold abroad. There is a precedent in the context of the building up of the Australian network which eventually expanded into the film industry and has proved one of the great international success stories in terms of videos and later films. That would be the way to go about it. There should be the requirement on RTE to ensure that they have <Col N="503" /> another function, a broader function, to commission various programmes from independent operators. These could be shown domestically.</P>
    <P>I would certainly be extremely opposed to the handing over from a State body of funds which would act to subsidise a private operation. If we provided such funds the newspapers could then say they were providing a public media service covering news items. They could look for some subsidisation from the State as well and might say there is considerable pressure on the print media at the present time. I do not think we should allow that principle to be established.</P>
    <P>We should go back to the original proposals of the Labour Party in relation to community-based radio rather than independent radio stations. In fact, the only independent stations that have been established and have proved successful have been those which have responded to local and regional needs. They have not tried to compete with any of the national stations. Century has not been a success. Part of the previous legislation attempted to bail out Century. There would be a lot to be said for that type of approach for locally based stations but they must also be locally controlled.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise what my colleague, Senator Upton, has said, that, it is of the utmost importance to ensure that public broadcasting is publicly accountable and controlled. In other words, the RTE Authority in terms of selection and appointment should be broadened. We must ensure that we do not have members appointed by the Minister or by the Government, but that the majority of the members are appointed by selection by recognised nominating bodies &mdash; bodies that would be recognised by this House and the other House of the Oireachtas. That would be a good day's work for public broadcasting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad <Col N="504" /> Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;supports the action of the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications in completing his review of Broadcasting policy; is confident that the Government will take appropriate decisions on the Minister's review and looks forward to the early introduction of amending legislation which will have the effect of improving the quality and quantity of Irish originated broadcasting available to the Irish public.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the first opportunity I have had to welcome the new Minister for Communications, Deputy Brennan, to the House. I know he is very approachable and that he has vast experience of communications. Not only that but his great talent and ability as a communicator is widely acknowledged.</P>
    <P>This Government's broadcasting record is one of immense achievement during the last four years. Unlike the two previous speakers from Fine Gael and the Labour Party, I sat here as spokes-person for Fianna Fáil in Opposition from 1983 to 1987 and asked on more than 25 different occasions on the Order of Business when we were going to have legislation to legalise the unlicensed stations in operation at that time. We all know the reason for their existence was a conflict of policies and philosophy between the two parties in Government.</P>
    <P>The pirate radio problem has been effectively dealt with since we took office four years ago. Legislation enacted in 1988 established the independent radio and telecommunications facility and introduced independent broadcasting. The Independent Radio and Television Commission was set up in 1988 and three years later we have 22 local radio stations and one independent national station. Having vast experience in this particular area, I can see a problem on two fronts: first, areas of listenership are too small. I and other Senators experienced in the broadcasting business have related experiences we had in America, Canada, Australia and the UK where we <Col N="505" /> researched the feasibility and long term prospects of radio stations. The finding was that a minimum of 1.5 million listeners was required to ensure commercial viability. Many stations are now amalgamating and I welcome that move because it ensures their survival. That was a big worry for me over the last 12 months. Secondly entertainment value is essential in radio and T.V. programmes and the word &ldquo;entertainment&rdquo; is seldom seen in legislation.</P>
    <P>I see a major problem in Dublin city at present. Five stations are playing wall to wall pop music, young people are away at school seven and a half to eight months of the year from 9 a.m. until 4 p.m., and these people wonder why they cannot attract listeners. They are not relating to those available to listen. Their success can be measured by the amount of advertising they get because advertisers are no fools and look for value in the marketplace. A heavy campaign can be orchestrated for the first six months of any operation, but if results do not come from the campaigns, advertisers will not be slow to leave. On that front we are failing miserably as legislators; 80 per cent of the music played across the nation is directed at a small core group of people from 12 years to 22 or 23 years and 80 per cent of possible listeners &mdash; the As and the Bs in the marketing world, with money to spend &mdash; are not targeted. There is a large gap in the market and a great opportunity for anyone who wants to make a financial and commercial success of local radio, and why no one is going for it is beyond me. I say this from experience. I could not make what would buy my breakfast if I went down the musical road these people are taking.</P>
    <P>People with long track records in this area and who have been entrusted with a great national resource, the airwaves, allowed themselves to be dictated to by people with no broadcasting experience. Which Irish acts feature in the current British charts? Irish acts cannot get a play on a national radio station. Daniel O'Donnell and Foster and Allen are number 7 and number 28. They do not <Col N="506" /> sell records by the hundreds, they sell them by the tonne.</P>

      <P>Forty foot containers of records of these Irish artists were shipped out last week. This is commercialism. I have always spoken with the highest regard of RTE television. They give great opportunities to Irish artists and support the Irish music industry. All over the world the music industry needs and receives the support of local radio or television stations, but not in this country. We have a national radio station &mdash; 2FM at present &mdash; and from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., with the exception of the specialised programmes, we might think we were listening to a Los Angeles radio station. This would not be tolerated in any other country. I have aired this view on many television programmes. Too little air time is given to people who do not have records in the charts but who have recorded material. Look at all the people radio stations are missing out on. There is an enormous market there that could be tapped.</P>
      <P>Something will have to be done about capping of advertising and I hope the Minister will have some news about it. In the UK advertising is down 10 per cent on most of the regional and national television marketing channels while our neighbour, UTV, at present enjoys an increase of 10 per cent. That speaks for itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome local radio. Over 700 people are employed there, the majority of them full-time. The independent radio sector provides a considerable stimulus to the economy as a whole. The Government's achievements in broadcasting over the last four years contrast starkly with the years of the previous Coalition Government. The success of the independent sector should be a source of pride to all of us. I was particularly pleased with the most recent three month JNLR-MRBI audience survey which showed in listenership terms that independent stations exceed both RTE services in combined <Col N="507" /> listenership. The objective of the 1990 Broadcasting Act is to create a fair broadcasting environment for all participants. This is commendable.</P>
    <P>In my opening address on the Second Stage of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Act, 1990, I said that we would be back within a short time to amend the legislation before us. In all countries which brought in a broadcasting Bill to open up the airwaves we only have to remember that the UK Government in 1964 fell on such an issue &mdash; it was necessary to amend the Bill during the following three or four years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second the amendment and welcome the Minister for Communications to the House. I understand it is his first visit in this capacity. I know from public utterances in recent weeks that it will not be his last as we all await with great interest the outcome of his Department's review of the Broadcasting Act and the proposals that I hope he will soon bring before this House. It might be helpful to the House if the Minister in his reply gave an indication of when he hopes to do so.</P>
      <P>The nub of this debate is that the capping legislation is the single greatest obstacle to the development of normal relations between RTE and this Government. I invite the Minister to confirm that he intends scrapping this unfair, inhibiting and restrictive section of the Act when he brings forward proposals for the review of the Broadcasting Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been working in broadcasting and until recently working in broadcasting in this country meant working for RTE. I have been with RTE since 1975 and in all that time no single piece of broadcasting legislation has generated so much unhappiness and bitterness among staff in RTE as this present Act. Staff in production, technical staff and front of house presenters like myself have all been affected. Ill feeling has permeated the atmosphere in Montrose to such an extent that this Government have suffered politically, which is unfair. There is, in Montrose a perception that this <Col N="508" /> Government are attempting to get at RTE. I remember arguing when the Broadcasting Bill came before the House that there was a need for an alternative to what then on offer from RTE &mdash; despite my loyalty to RTE and I have been with them for a long time, albeit in a freelance capacity &mdash; if broadcasting in this country was to develop in an orderly way. I believe that the Government were motivated by that particular aspiration when an alternative service was provided for; an alternative news service, sports services and, in short, an alternative national radio station which would give people choice. I believe those elements of the Broadcasting Act worked well. Speaking from inside RTE I can testify that RTE concentrated their minds on their target market more assiduously than heretofore and I am sure all sides of the House will recognise the high standards of excellence provided by RTE programming, especially over the last 12 to 18 months.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Government's initiative in bringing forward this legislation, after waiting many years for previous Administrations to bring forward suitable legislation, local radio and a national radio station were legally established. That alternative service concentrated the minds of programme-makers, planners and other involved in RTE broadcasting, particularly in radio, to the extent that the most recent JMNR report Senator Cassidy referred to shows that RTE Radio 1 and 2FM nationally still hold substantial audiences far in excess of even Century Radio. I do not say that in order to gloat; I am disappointed that Century Radio has not been more successful.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Cassidy's opinion that the main reason for Century Radio's lack of commercial success has been their poor format. Their news service is excellent but their daily music and programme formats are designed to attract a target audience already being adequately served by 2FM and they ignore completely up to 80 per cent of a listening audience who want to hear middle of the road easy listening music.</P>
    <P>My colleagues, particularly on the left, <Col N="509" /> will argue for public service broadcasting and say that people like talking to each other and that the emphasis in public service broadcasting should be on programming that is topical and intellectual. Yet, throughout the developed world 60 to 70 per cent of radio output is music based. That reality has not been brought home to the Century executives; they have provided a music base for most of their daily programming but have gone after the wrong market. Perhaps remarks being made in this House this evening might help to concentrate the minds of Century Radio executives. I say this to be helpful because it is vital for fair broadcasting that we have an adequate commercially viable alternative to RTE.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his review will be looking at the areas that have been at the forefront of the debate over the last 12 to 18 months. In the context of the criticisms levelled by the proposers of the motion who are seeking a white paper &mdash; the proposition being that debate has been inadequate and that the Minister is obliged to bring forward a White Paper for further debate &mdash; it seems that over the last 12 to 18 months, particularly with the publication of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, creative energies have been unleashed concentrating people's minds on the future of Irish broadcasting to a far greater extent than heretofore.</P>
    <P>The broadcasting debate has widened over the last 18 months to such a degree that there is now before the Minister a substantial body of informed opinion that can help him and his Department to bring forward enhanced proposals. There are, however, specific areas that are going to cause difficulty to the Minister and in the present spirit of helpfulness pervading both sides of the House, I suggest that the Minister remove the cap on advertising.</P>
    <P>The transfer of a levy has been suggested as an alternative to the existing proposals for an increase in the four and a half minutes per hour restriction on RTE's advertising. The original proportion of advertising to programmes was seven and a half minutes per hour. I am sure the Minister will be able to find a balance acceptable to RTE because there <Col N="510" /> are few countries in the European Community with broadcasting in state hands where some form of restriction does not apply. That restriction is not sought as a handicap but as a help to non-State sectors of broadcasting. It is in that context that I compliment the Minister for being the first Minister for Communications to go to the front line, as he did last week on RTE television, when he met with those concerned for Irish broadcasting and expounded his views, restricted as he was by the fact that his legislative proposals have not yet been published.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister take on board the strong representations that have been made to him by representatives of the local radio sector. Local radio people are seriously concerned about reported suggestions that the Minister will transfer the licence fee, or a portion of it, from RTE to the IRTC and, in turn, disperse moneys to local radio and national radio to fund news and current affairs programme. I suggest that his officials might consider that much of the success of local radio has been based on an ability to identify with the ethos of a region and with the area in which they broadcast. The most popular programming in the more successful stations is based on what is going on in the community.</P>
    <P>Ireland is extremely well served by national news programmes. RTE's news service is second to none; Century Radio's news service is exemplary. In the age of satellite TV, we have 24 hour international news at the touch of a button. Increasing numbers of people are turning to local radio to listen not just to acceptable middle of the road music but to local news, to hear what communities are saying about each other. In the transfer of the levy the Minister should give serious consideration to subsidising the local news section of local radio programming, rather than giving a once-off payment for capital equipment or transmission. I am sure the Minister has already got a copy of a document I have here which sets out in detail the views and objectives of local radio.</P>
    <P>I am sorry not to have time to emphaise <Col N="511" /> the importance of the independent sector and I am sure other speakers will pick up on this. There is one way in which the Minister could satisfy the important newspaper lobby in this country and that is by removing the VAT on newspapers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this timely motion put down by my Labour colleagues. Fine Gael are happy to support it. I asked last week for an update from the Minister on the present situation in broadcasting in the light of TV3's licence being withdrawn.  Broadcasting and communications in this country should be reviewed given that legislation was rushed through last year. There are many different viewpoints on this subject and the previous two speakers have a personal knowledge of broadcasting that I cannot claim.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senators Cassidy and Mooney regarding the diversity of music played on RTE. At times pop and rock music seem to dominate the airwaves leaving a large percentage of listeners not catered for. Variety in programming must be looked at; do we have too many current affairs programmes? Competition begins daily with &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; after which we move to Gay Byrne who has a slightly different programme to Pat Kenny. I was disappointed to see Val Joyce's Saturday programme axed. Having heard the new programme I think Val Joyce or Senator Mooney could have presented it even if the Senator is biased towards Leitrim footballers.</P>
      <P>It is important that we have a full discussion on broadcasting; I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say about its future. Certain myths have been debunked, one being that local stations were a licence to print money. There is only a certain limited advertising market available and despite certain stations starting off in a blaze of glory, market reasearch soon reveals the response to advertising and underlying trends of the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Competition with RTE should be <Col N="512" /> looked at and it would be worth examining Network 2 to establish what percentage of programmes are home based. Where are licence fees collected? I would be interested to hear from the Minister if progress has been made regarding the collection of licence fees. We steps being taken in relation to social welfare payments abuse and it should be possible for more licence money to be collected with improved methods and detectors. A licence at £62 is good value but, like road tax and insurance, it should be spread across the board with no opting out.</P>
    <P>It is important that RTE as the national broadcasting station do not go unchecked; it is alleged that certain individuals or parties can make a phone call and book a key slot on certain programmes. To be fair, I am not referring to Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. Impartiality is important for public confidence and in relation to calls for a press council there should be independent monitoring of programmes and of complaints about abuses of power. From time to time all political parties feel they may be getting a bad run and that either their members or their Front Bench are being hounded. A complaints procedure is necessary. The Minister would uphold and support such a move.</P>
    <P>Regarding the proliferation of local radio stations and extra TV stations we must remember we have a population of only 3.5 million; England with a population of 50 million does not have many more stations. There is no bottomless reservoir of money available for advertising and broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael would support a full discussion on broadcasting. White Papers conjure up memories of reports being left on shelves but the Minister should tell us if there is going to be a review. We must look at capping and the role of Network 2. Competition must be encouraged. People talk about levelling the playing pitch and moving the goal posts but the danger is that the playing pitch may be getting smaller. It is important for broadcasting that monitoring procedures be established and that a certain amount of <Col N="513" /> the licence fee goes to promote home-based programmes. RTE's position is special; they have a certain monopoly but with that monopoly come rights, responsibilities and duties. It is in all our interests that we work towards achieving certain aims. I hope a review will take place involving an exchange of ideas between the experts in this area, taking in various other connected interests so that we get the best national broadcasting service possible. We have a good broadcasting service now but it could be better.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for agreeing to give me a few minutes. I am very interested in this Bill. I want to join with other Senators in welcoming the Minister to this House. I compliment him on his performance last week when he appeared on a programme with people who held views different from his. He did an excellent job. Everybody who watched it was very pleased with the way he handled the programme. He was fair and allowed everybody a point of view. He was very positive. I compliment him on his fairness and firmness in this very difficult area. RTE is a very substantial organisation with a vested interest. They have been doing an excellent job but as a monopoly they strongly resented the establishment of community stations. While RTE have been an excellent broadcasting media, they should not have opposed the establishment of community stations. I come from a part of the country that found it very useful to have a community station. I am pleased that in County Donegal we have the No. 1 community station, Highland Radio, covering an area from Ballygawley to Burtonport, from Coleraine to the Curlew Mountains, an area RTE did not <Col N="514" /> cover. There was justification for establishing community radio and RTE should have adopted a more helpful approach. They threw many obstacles in the way of private stations being established. Since those private radio stations have been established, RTE have turned up the power above what is permissible under international control. I would welcome any check or assessment the Minister and his Department can carry out.</P>
      <P>I have very little complaint to make about RTE. RTE have an excellent current affairs programme but somebody promoting a book from outside the country finds it easy to ring RTE; they can set the trend of the interview and, at the end, introduce their book. That is not a good development or an acceptable trend. I would ask the Minister to look at the input into current affairs programming in RTE.</P>
      <P>I believe RTE have improved but for a long time, it was a closed shop where a certain political organisation controlled who worked for RTE and, to a great extent, controlled who was invited on their current affairs programmes. That attitude defeated itself and RTE found it wise to discontinue such a practice. There is now a more balanced approach in RTE, which I strongly welcome.</P>
      <P>On the distribution of funds, where he will have discretion, I would strongly urge the Minister to recognise that community broadcasting stations need financial help. What the Minister intends to give those small stations is very little compared to the financial support given to RTE. Fair play must be seen. There is no point in granting licences to rural community stations if financial support is only available to one or two major stations which already have many advantages. It is scaremongering to speak about losing 200 jobs and advertising going outside the country, I do not believe it. RTE will lose nothing, I would ask the Minister to encourage more cooperation between RTE and community stations. There is room for both and there are many areas into which RTE find it difficult to extend their signal, whether radio or television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> Small radio stations have done an excellent job. I compliment the Minister and the Government for taking the initiative in the face of stiff professional opposition. The people are the best judge. Whether on Aran Island or in Dublin 4 they can assess the situation coolly and calmly. It is recognised that the way the Minister has handled this matter is excellent and I wish him good luck.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan) Seamus Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I offer my sincere thanks to Senators on all sides of the House who have spoken in the debate. I listened very carefully and I want to assure the House that it will prove extremely useful to me as I progress with my proposals. I have taken extremely careful note of Senators' contributions. I am also grateful for the opportunity of having some moments here this evening to lay before you some thoughts in regard to the future of broadcasting.</P>
      <P>Before we start is it important to reflect on the chaos which existed in 1987. Something in the order of 70 illegal radio stations were operating at that time in flagrant breach of the law of the land and of the international treaties in the frequency management area. Action was taken and, as a result we now have a fledgling independent broadcasting sector. A multiplicity of Irish generated broadcasting choice and plurality in sources of news and current affairs are central to the Government's approach to broadcasting policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential to balance the plethora of external broadcasting services with good quality home produced broadcasting services. Other central elements of Government broadcasting policy are to ensure that Irish broadcasting becomes a growth industry in line with the growth of broadcasting seen in all other European countries; to ensure so far as possible that Irish broadcasting remains the mainstream Irish viewers' and listeners' choice; to bring new investment and <Col N="516" /> higher productivity into Irish broadcasting; to create new secure employment in the sector and to provide a seed bed for the growth of an independent audio-visual industrial business in the country.</P>
    <P>RTE have had a monopoly in Irish broadcasting since they were established. The process of transition which has been going on from monopoly to a competitive environment has not been painless. New regulations were needed to allow ordered entry into the sector and to create a fair competitive environment. The Radio and Television Act, 1988 and the Broadcasting Act, 1990 both set out to give us this competitive environment.</P>
    <P>Independent radio has been a substantial success in economic and social terms. Most recent surveys by JNLR/MRBI show that, overall, independent services have established themselves in their markets and, in many instances, are passing out, for instance, 2FM, their perceived competitor in &ldquo;yesterday listenership&rdquo; and market share. Independent radio is moving closer overall to Radio 1 according to the surveys. Four local stations, Donegal Highland Radio, Mid West Radio, Kerry Radio and Clare FM exceed both Radio 1 and 2FM in market share in respective franchise areas. Highland Radio is neck and neck with combined market share of RTE's stations in its franchise area.</P>
    <P>RTE have responded magnificently to competition and Radio 1 is still Ireland's most popular radio service, but the real winner in all of this is the Irish public which now has real choice for the first time in terms of access to Irish broadcasting services. The Government's actions, my own actions and my predecessor's actions in the broadcasting area have perhaps occasionally been wrongly portrayed as not being very much in favour of RTE, in fact, on many occasions, as being anti-RTE. That is not the situation. The complaint should rather have been that action was not taken earlier against the pirates who at that time, illegally fragmented RTE's domain.</P>
    <P>The 1988 Act created arrangements <Col N="517" /> for entry into the broadcasting sector. It opened up the business and allowed fresh players in and the Act which followed it in 1990 sought to establish a fair, competitive environment in the Irish broadcasting sector. This limited RTE's advertising capacity and its advertising-generated revenue. It affected both the minutes which you could have on television and also put a cap on the overall amount of advertising which RTE could take. The objective was to have an independent sector which would have an opportunity to compete for that advertising market so as to develop its services.</P>
    <P>The public service broadcasting obligations of the independent services were similar to those of RTE but, unlike RTE the independents had only one source of income. However, it should be recalled that applicants for independent contracts made their applications on this clear understanding. RTE remain the country's primary broadcaster. The future of RTE is, therefore, central to the future of Irish broadcasting but the future of Irish broadcasting is not necessarily synonymous just with the future of RTE. The future of Irish broadcasting now includes the independent sector as well as RTE and the IRTC. The independent sector is here to stay and I intend to ensure that it remains.</P>
    <P>The 1990 Act was designed to divert advertising revenue from RTE to the independent sector, particularly the independent television sector. Expectations at the time were of an early start-up for independent television as an advertising alternative to RTE. The absence of the emergence of a strong alternative to RTE television, coupled with the effects of section 3 of the 1990 Act, that is the cap, has pushed the cost of advertising on RTE up dramatically. There have been negative consequences for the advertising industry, for independent film makers, the marketing of Irish goods and services and the economy generally. There is also evidence of an outflow of advertising spent. It appears to me, at this stage, that there is a real need to bring forward some fresh proposals in this area, which I intend to do. I signalled <Col N="518" /> this last June in the Dáil and on many occasions since then.</P>
    <P>There has been much uncertainty surrounding the prospect of a third channel. We have been taking that into account in our review. My review of broadcasting has been going on for many months and has been exhaustive. I have met all sectional interests, personally and with my officials, and we have fully briefed ourselves on all of the very complex issues. My reasons and the objectives of the review were to ensure that Irish advertisers had adequate space in the Irish broadcasting media, to prevent the leakage of Irish advertising to the UK stations, to protect and enhance the employment in the Irish advertising industry and to ensure the continued strength and competitiveness of RTE, the national broadcasting organisation, in the increasingly competitive broadcasting environment both nationally and internationally. The objectives were also to create and maintain an environment conducive to the successful establishment of an independent television service and to meet as far as possible the legitimate concerns of others involved in the advertising and programming business and involved in the advertising of the broadcasting generally and to promote the development of a strong, Irish independent audio-visual sector.</P>
    <P>The views presented to me were extremely diverse and were expressed very strongly and very trenchantly. RTE sought changes in the Act to enable them to meet advertising demands. They sought a removal of the advertising cap and other changes. The Association of Advertisers in Ireland, the Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland and the Confederation of Irish Industry also sought changes which would allow more access to advertising time and a reduction in cost.</P>
    <P>The independent radio interests sought access to the licence for income, to assist in funding the cost of news and current affairs programmes. These views were expressed here again this evening. The promoters of the then TV3 were opposed <Col N="519" /> to any changes which would put an independent TV station in a worse position, in terms of return to investors, than under the 1990 Act. The independent programme makers sought a lifting of the advertising income restrictions on RTE and they sought a commitment of a substantial part of the extra advertising income to the commissioning of programmes for the independent production sector.</P>
    <P>The National Newspapers of Ireland, with whom I have had many meetings, were opposed to any changes in the 1990 Act as evidenced also by their recent editorials on the subject. The Independent Radio and Television Commission want a degree of licence fee diversion and some additional powers in relation to the performance of its functions. The views expressed were diverse and, in many cases, contradictory.</P>
    <P>My review is now complete and is before the Cabinet. Any comment on it therefore would be premature, other than to say that I have four policy objectives in the broadcasting area and these objectives encapsulate what I am trying to achieve. First, I want to ensure that I maintain a strong RTE because this has to compete internationally and I want to create an environment for a strong privately owned, independent broadcasting sector alongside a strong RTE. I do not believe these objectives are incompatible. Thirdly, I want to bring about and encourage growth in the independent programme-making sector because, in that sector there are extremely talented people all over the country whose talents deserve further outlets. There is great scope for employment in that sector. I would like to ensure that more work goes into the independent programme-making and film making sector. I have also met those people and was very impressed by their determination to play a part in the future of Irish broadcasting.</P>
    <P>It is important for the country that we maintain a flourishing newspaper industry. The newspaper industry here has to compete with imports from across the <Col N="520" /> water, which are sometimes not of the same quality as our own products and are often cheaper. It is my intention to ensure that those four objectives are met in any proposals which I bring forward. None of the Senators here this evening, Senators Upton, Cassidy, Costello, Mooney, Cosgrave and McGowan underestimated the complexity of trying to achieve those four objectives and I appreciate that. They sometimes seem impossible to reconcile.</P>
    <P>I have been asked for a White Paper and I have given that serious consideration. However, I do not believe it is the thing to do at this time. We have been debating broadcasting for three years. I do not know of any other subject that has received more air time and newspaper space than broadcasting in Ireland. Everytime I mention it, it gets a half a page and no doubt that will go on, from time to time.</P>

      <P>I would like, first to thank Senator Upton for affording me this opportunity. I want to make some general comments because this is not the time, as the Minister has indicated, to go <Col N="521" /> into great detail. The amending legislation is not before the House but I welcome the fact that there is a strong indication that there will be amending legislation.</P>
      <P>It would be unfair to describe the present Minister as a repentant sinner because he did not actually introduce this Bill, which was not widely welcomed. We could be in the position of saying &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; to this Government because, as Senator Cassidy indicated, he said at that time that the Government would be back and would have to amend the legislation. It was very useful that the Fianna Fáil side acknowledged this. To me, as an Independent, it certainly looked as if this was vindictive, spiteful legislation not motivated by the high ideals the Minister expressed tonight. It looked like an attempt to limit and damage RTE and to spancel them &mdash; they were trying to hobble RTE. It is astonishing to me that a party committed to free market economics would not allow the play of free market economics in terms of a very successful radio station that is generating substantial revenue. The response of the Government was simply to spancel it, to cap the advertising. I was very pleased that the Minister decided to highlight this aspect which has been very noxious, unwelcome and damaging to RTE.</P>
      <P>My friend and colleague, if I may call him so, Senator McGowan made this point for me when he came out with this odious claptrap about a political conspiracy within RTE, that RTE was in the pocket of a political party. This has been said before. It is a small party that Senator McGowan had in mind, if I recollect his previous remark, and to imagine that the national broadcasting station is in the pocket of a small unrepresentative clique simply does not wash. That is a conspiracy theory and, I am sorry to say that Fianna Fáil appear to feel historically threatened by an independent broadcasting service. Because there were bad feelings they set out to spancel it. That was a vindictive act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Introducing this legislation the Minister said he was looking for a level playing field. This Minister referred again to the <Col N="522" /> newspaper industry and so on. Of course we want a thriving independent newspaper industry but if the Minister chooses to look at the Official Report of the Seanad he will see that I stated certain facts about that level playing field. For example, there are areas where newspapers can generate income but the broadcasting services cannot and I gave a list of them. There were planning applications, various kinds of advertising revenue, etc., and I gave facts and figures. If there is a level playing field such inconsistencies should be borne in mind. There has never been a level playing field. Sometimes it worked to the advantage of RTE, sometimes it worked to the advantage of the newspapers. I am glad the Minister has said he has a balanced view, that he does not want one to overtake the other. Since we want to have a thriving newspaper industry, perhaps the Minister will share my disquiet at a recent article by the Most Rev. Dr. Brendan Comiskey in the <i>Irish Catholic</i> where he took a savage swipe at the <i>Irish Press</i> newspaper because of one rather unfortunate remark. He actually appealed to people to stop their subscriptions to that newspaper, to stop buying it. That is lamentable where there are jobs at risk in this fine newspaper. It is appalling and I hope Members across this House will share my concern.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that he is interested in a good quality home produced broadcasting service, a growth industry. How is that met by capping the advertising revenue of RTE? Many people in this House, not just myself, warned that the impact of this legislation would be to create a net outflow, in advertising terms, from the State. In other words, not alone was it a vindictive piece of legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to respond to one or two points made during the debate. The first is the figure given by Senator Cassidy, when he stated that you need an audience of one and a half million listeners to make a small local station viable. I am reluctant to disagree with Senator Cassidy because of his expertise in these matters, but I would be very concerned if he were correct, and I sincerely hope he is wrong. I am not saying that to be offensive.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator Mooney's remarks about public service broadcasting being intellectual and ephemeral, I suppose there is a degree of truth in that sort of generalisation. I do not see public service broadcasting in that light. I would hate to think that it would be confined to the notions and to the aura of Senator Mooney's remarks. It has been said that the debates on broadcasting have been worthwhile, have made a valuable contribution and that we do not need a White Paper on broadcasting. The debate on broadcasting has been rancorous, contentious and not very enlightened. It has been difficult, and people on both sides of the argument have been seeking to score points and defend positions. I hoped that a White Paper would have taken a more abstract, balanced and even view, where both sides of the argument could be put in a calm, easy manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for coming to listen to the motion I have before the House tonight. I hope he will return to Government with a positive approach following my submission.</P>
      <P>The present structure of local government does not have any constitutional background. It has a statutory back-up but it is not covered in the Constitution. Local and regional government in Europe does not have any institutional back-up. It is not catered for under the Treaty of Rome and we have a situation where local or regional government has neither a constitutional back-up in the national state not an institutional back-up on a European basis.</P>
      <P>The present structures in the EC do not involve a local or regional authority tier under the Treaty of Rome. They comprise the Civil Service which is the Commission. The Commission is different to the Civil Service we have in the national Parliament in so far as it is a Civil Service that can initiate and that would differ greatly from our Civil Service. The Council of Ministers is the ultimate body in the European framework. The European Parliament is the directly elected Parliament of Europe, elected by the people of the 12 member states. There is no other institution and, as a result this country, does not have a direct or institutional voice in Europe. There is a standing conference that is represented by organisations attached to the Council of Europe but that does not have an institutional back-up or framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a recent proposal by the <Col N="528" /> Commission, I am asking that the amended Treaty of Rome include the proposal I have before the House, that is, that institutional recognition be given to a local and regional authority tier in Europe. It is very simple and straightforward. The proposal came from the Commission and has the backing of the European Parliament and a number of member states. Some member states, I understand, are opposed at this stage and some have not made a decision.</P>
    <P>The reason this proposal was put forward by the Commission &mdash; I emphasise that this proposal has come from the Commission &mdash; is that in 1988 the Commission recognised a void in the operation in so far as the discussion in Europe at that time, and since, was that involvment of local and regional authorities was essential to the development of the new Europe. In response, they asked to have a consultative council appointed consisting of 42 members. Ireland got two members. The General Council of County Councils got the opportunity of nominating one person &mdash; myself &mdash; and the Association of Municipal Authorities got the opportunity of nominating the other Councillor, Seán McManus of Sligo. Following the nominations by those two organisations, the Department of the Environment, in consultation with the Government, gave the two names to the European Commission and the Commission endorsed the decision of the two organisations and the Government.</P>
    <P>The consultative council sits three or four times a year and has had special meetings when particular decisions had to be made. It works extremely well. It deals directly with the Commission and it passed an opinion to the Commissioner for Regional Development, Bruce Millan and also to the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Ray Mac-Sharry. It has worked so well and the Commission's response has been so positive that earlier this year they decided the time was opportune to insert into the Treaty of Rome a proposal to cover such a body.</P>
    <P>It would seem that the proposal would have widespread support. The initial <Col N="529" /> response was positive. The European Parliament and different committees come out in favour of it. I understand that at a full debate in the European Parliament there was an extremely positive response &mdash; I am told there was no adverse response &mdash; and very shortly a vote will take place which will copperfasten it. However, recently we ran into troubled waters. This happened during the Luxembourg Presidency.</P>
    <P>I, as the Irish representative on the consultative council, have decided to bring the matter before this House so that the Irish representatives and the people will understand what is taking place and the implications of not having this decision ratified by the national Government and subsequently entered into the amended Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>The proposal by the Luxembourg Government is that the consultative council would remain, in name at least, but that it would affiliate itself to the Economic and Social Committee. I have the height of respect for the Economic and Social Committee. It is an opportunity for the trade union movement and others to voice their opinion on matters that concern them at European level. The Economic and Social Committee is not directly elected by the people and that is extremely important as far as I am concerned. Unless the local and regional authorities of this and every other country are elected by the masses of the people, then they are not the true representatives of the regions in Europe. For that reason in common with the consultative council the Commission and the European Parliament, I am opposed to the proposal of the Luxembourg Presidency. I am asking here tonight that the Irish Government support the proposal of the European Commission. I ask for support for the involvement of local and regional authorities in an institutional framework in Europe. I believe that this is in the best interests of this country.</P>
    <P>I believe the record of the existing consultative council is evidence to the fact that it can be of major benefit as far as decisions of this country are concerned. There is no truer representation than that <Col N="530" /> which comes from the bottom. There is no conflict between representation in the area of local government, the European Parliament and the final arbiter, which is the Council of Ministers. In fact, we are all in the one boat. We are all in the one boat of securing for this nation the best representation at European level and returning the best benefits that can be accrued from the process of negotiation and lobbying at European level, whether it be in the European Parliament, in a new tier of local or regional government or at the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>I believe, indeed, that it will strengthen the hand of Members of the European Parliament. It will also strengthen the members of the Council of Ministers. Indeed, in the whole process of European evolvement and development over the next five or six years, it is imperative that there is a local and regional involvement. We are at a stage where this country can attain great benefits on behalf of its people provided there is a consensus, a concerted effort and unity. At this time there is a divison at national level regarding the opportunity of benefits from Europe. At a conference in Galway last Monday, I was quite taken aback by some of the contributions; possibly they were very near the bone. In fact, they were quite true in many cases. The message coming from that conference &mdash; and which is coming from other areas also &mdash; was that the benefits from the Structural Funds and other funds of Europe are not finding their way very far west of the Pale. That is not fully the case but what is important is that if that perception becomes general it will be very hard for us here to contradict it.</P>
    <P>One of the ways of achieving development in this country is to have a strong local and regional authority tier at European level and not just as regards opinion as we have in the consultative council, even through it was a very productive and very beneficial council as far as the Commission were concerned. The new proposals are that it would be involved to the extent that its advice and opinion would be looked for prior to decisions <Col N="531" /> being made not at the behest of the Commission as they stand at the moment. Even though it is a step in the right direction, it does not allow for full involvement of local and regional authorities.</P>
    <P>I have an involvement in this area for a number of reasons. First, I am a member of a local authority. Secondly, I am a member of the executive of the General Council of County Councils of Ireland. Thirdly, I am the nominee of the General Council of County Councils in the Seanad. A strong and vibrant local government at national level is of particular importance as far as the development of our nation is concerned. We now have an opportunity of firmly establishing for the future an arm of local and regional government at European level tied into the framework of the amended Treaty of Rome. Our Government should not miss the opportunity on this occasion and they should support this proposal. It is in the best interests of all the people of this country that the decisions taken will be taken very much on a consensus basis so that the rural-urban divisions that are inclined to develop at the moment can be eliminated.</P>
    <P>That is my case for the proposals the Commission has made. It is based on a deep and thorough analysis of what is involved and an analysis of local and regional government throughout Europe. I have visited six countries and investigated the whole 12 structures. The German situation would be an ideal one but, obviously, this country is very small for that. The concept of involvement of local and regional authorities under the Treaty of Rome enhances the representation of this country at European level and may prove to be more beneficial than people realise at the moment. The Commission at the moment &mdash; this came through loud and clear at our meetings on 8 and 9 October with Commissioner Millan &mdash; is now looking more thoroughly at the involvement of the regions and the local areas in proposals that are coming forward. I see this as an opportunity for our Government to join with other Governments who support the proposal. <Col N="532" /> A number of Governments are in support of it but I understand the UK Government are not, but then again I would not think much of the local authority system they have allowed to develop in their country over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>I hope our Government, in the interests of local and regional authorities, will support the proposal I am putting before this House and that the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, will go back to the Cabinet with the views I have put forward here and, hopefully, a positive response will come at the Heads of State meeting on 9 December. The future of local and regional authorities and our status here and abroad will be decided. I hope our Government will be to the front in saying that now is the time for institutional representation for local and regional authorities directly elected by the people and not something that is tied to a non-elected committee that is serving a particular purpose but does not, cannot, and never will represent the individual voter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Finneran for raising this very important matter and assure him that, like him, I have been a member of a local authority in the west of Ireland and I appreciate the importance of having a say in the regions in Europe.</P>
      <P>In the course of the opening stages of the Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union, Germany, which wished to provide a forum in which the views of the states which make up its federal system could be put forward on Community issues, proposed that the revised treaties should contain provisions to establish a body made up of representatives of regional and local authorities.</P>
      <P>In line with this, the draft treaty presented by the Luxembourg Presidency in June contained a draft article providing for the creation of a committee of representatives of regonal and local authorities. This would be known as the Committee of the Regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft treaty proposes that the <Col N="533" /> Committee of the Regions be consulted by the Council or the Commission as specified in the treaty. The committee could also be consulted in all cases where the Council or Commission consider it appropriate. In addition, in any case where the Economic and Social Committee is consulted, the Committee of the Regions may also submit a view if it considers that there are specific regional interests involved.</P>
    <P>As its contribution to the debate on this matter in the Intergovernmental Conference, the European Commission tabled its own proposal in relation to such a committee. The Commission envisaged that the new treaty provisions on a committee for the regions and other local authorities should be based on the existing consultative Council of Regional and Local Authorities, set up by Commission decision of 24 June 1988 which was also spoken about by Senator Finneran.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Commission proposal, the committee will be consulted by the Commission on any matter concerning regional development.</P>
    <P>These proposals for a body of representatives of regional and local authorities, having an institutional treaty basis, have not yet been discussed at ministerial level in the Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union. It would not, therefore, be useful to comment on the detailed points of difference between the versions already in the draft treaty and that suggested by the Commission. In our view the committee, as at present proposed in the text of the draft treaty, should be associated with the Economic and Social Committee. Could I emphasise be associated with not subsumed into it? Could I also emphasise that in either version, the committee would enjoy a large degree of autonomy and would be able to decide on its own working procedures? In either version the committee would have its own institutinal basis in the Treaty. I would like to emphasise that point.</P>
    <P>It is our view that the establishment of an additional body may help to support further the interests of the regions and we will consider the proposal in the draft <Col N="534" /> treaty very carefully. Our particular concern would be, as I am sure Senator Finneran's concern would be, to ensure the adequate development of the region.</P>
    <P>As Members of the House are aware, for the purposes of Community policies, in particular the Structural Funds, Ireland is classified as one region so that the whole country gains maximum benefit. We are able to provide views on the operation of the regional policies of the Community in the Council of Ministers, through our representatives in the European Parliament and through the Economic and Social Committee.</P>
    <P>In the Treaty negotiations in both Intergovernmental Conferences the question of convergence between all the regions of the Community has been a fundamental issue for Ireland. While economic and social cohesion policy is already provided for in the Treaty the major steps forward now envisaged in European integration demand, in our view, an enhanced cohesion dimension in the new union. We were very conscious of this in the build up to the Intergovernmental Conferences and we ensured that cohesion was placed on the agenda for both the political union and economic and monetary union conferences. At the very beginning of the two IGCs Ireland submitted a series of Treaty amendments on economic and social cohesion. These included draft treaty texts, in particular to provide that proposals would be made setting out the measures to be taken to strengthen cohesion, that there would be three yearly reviews of progress towards cohesion and the role of various policies in achieving it, accompanied by necessary proposals if progress is unsatisfactory; and that the cohesion aspect to be taken into account in all policies.</P>
    <P>In taking the initiative we were able to set the tone for the ensuing debate and we were able to influence the Commission and the other member states in the evolution of the negotiations in this area. Following on our proposals to both conferences, Spain, Portugal and Greece have tabled their own proposals and we have fully supported their contributions <Col N="535" /> to the continuing debate. The draft treaty text on cohesion now largely contains the kind of elements we proposed. We have made it clear that, in addition to Treaty texts, we will require appropriate assurances that the Treaty provisions will be translated into action.</P>
    <P>The President of the Commission made an important statement to the Luxembourg European Council in June of this year. He raised a number of points including continued growth in the Structural Funds, the setting up of a major infrastructural programme for funds, a possible special Fund for the Environment and the need to take into account the relative wealth of member states in contributions into the Community budget. The Luxembourg European Council asked the Commission to clarify the various ideas it put forward in this statement in time for the next European Council in Maastricht.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from what I have said, that in the IGC negotiations we attach <Col N="536" /> enormous importance to the regional dimension in the Community.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that it has been our firm resolve throughout the Treaty negotiations to ensure that all regions benefit from advances in European integration and that solidarity between regions of different economic strength is improved. I can assure this House that this will continue to be this Government's primary concern in the run up to Maastricht and beyond.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I, therefore, assure this House that, in line with our commitment to a balanced regional development, we will give very careful consideration, indeed, to the proposals I described above, already in the draft treaty texts before the Intergovernmental Conference, for a body composed of representatives of regional and local authorities. I can assure Senator Finneran that his thoughts on the matter will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 7 November 1991.</P>
