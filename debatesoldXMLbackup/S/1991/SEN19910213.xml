      <P>I have notice from Senator Dan Kiely that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to make funds available for the repairs to the coastline in County Kerry damaged in recent storm.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to review the case of a prisoner in Arbour Hill (name supplied) with a view to exercising his ministerial prerogative of commuting the sentence in the light of its comparative severity taking into account the circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Dan Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that the extension to the girls' primary school at Adare, County Limerick is constructed in 1991 and thereby alleviate the present overcrowded conditions.</P>

    <P>I also received notice from Senator Tom Raftery of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to enforce the hormone ban and to intercept the supply of such illegal substances, in order to protect the good reputation of our beef.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Mary Jackman of the following matter:</P>

I have selected Senator Kiely's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Norris, Neville, Ó Foighil, Raftery, Jackman and Ross may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>Before I call the Leader of the House, I would like to ask for the co-operation of all Members of the House today in dealing effectively and efficiently and within a reasonable length of time with the Order of Business. <Col N="1147" /> Last week I do not think we did ourselves any good here or elsewhere in the way we addressed the Order of Business and in the fact that we have been putting questions to the Leader of the House that are not relevant to the Order of Business. I ask for the co-operation of everybody. It is not with the intention of preventing anybody from asking questions appropriate to the Order of Business and doing it in the knowledge that it will contribute to dealing with the Order of Business in a way that is becoming to the House.  I call on the Leader, Senator Seán Fallon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from what the Cathaoirleach has said and before we deal with the Order of Business, and particularly arising from last Wednesday's ordering of business, it is appropriate to put down a marker on the procedural role of the Seanad.  I certainly feel very strongly that the distinctive role of the Upper House of the Oireachtas, whose main function is revising legislation, is diminished or at least blurred by the constant call for debates on everything under the sun.  I am only too well aware of the political pressures on all my colleagues &mdash; we have all experienced them at different times &mdash; and I can readily appreciate their need to voice various demands of Government.  I feel we should not lose sight, however, of our primary function here in this House.  An overt political role of representing a particular constituency or a particular area of locality surely is more appropriate to the other House.  I want to make it very clear that in saying this I am not being protective of the Government and I am not being negative in my outlook in regard to the role of the Seanad but I believe that if we succumb to an overt party political cut and thrust, seeking almost instant reaction to topical events or headlines of the day, the Seanad will lose its way and become a mere mirror image of the Dáil.  The Seanad has its own role to play; and a more measured, considerate response to issues, for which the Seanad has made its mark, would be lost or severely diminished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> I also feel it is fair to say that many people, including politicians of all parties, fail to take the Seanad seriously. Yet, the Seanad does perform a very useful function as a second Chamber.  It can, and in many cases does, highlight issues that are overlooked in the Dáil.  As we know, legislation can be initiated in this House, and hopefully more of it will be initiated in the future.  Legislation can be amended in a less overtly political atmosphere.  We have restrictions &mdash; but there is a great merit in having a second Chamber which can undertake a second and perhaps a more detached examination of legislation.</P>
    <P>There are various procedures and channels through the Whips open to Senators to raise topical matters.  We have Private Members' debates, the half hour Adjournment debates and the all-party motions, which we usually take on a Thursday.  I think that this Seanad has a very good record in providing topical debates for Senators.  I just make those points, a Cathaoirligh.  I feel this should be recognised by my colleagues on all sides of the House.  The constant calls for debates on all kinds of matters should be tempered with the points I have raised.</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business for today, we resume and continue the debate on Item No. 3, the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990.  It will continue until 6 o'clock.  We will have a sos from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. and we will then have from 6.30 p.m. to 8 o'clock the final hour and a half of the Government motion. From 8 p.m. until 10 p.m. we will continue debate on the Environment Protection Agency Bill.  That Bill, on our side and, I know, on the far side, has evoked a great deal of interest.  There are still many Senators very anxious to speak on it but, having said that, we hope, if we can at all, to finish it by tomorrow at 4 p.m.  We will see how we progress on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>If I interpret the Leader of the House correctly on what he had to say before the Order of Business, I have to say I am very disappointed with what he is saying.  Certainly, we want an <Col N="1149" /> orderly and efficient Order of Business and all Members of my group will certainly contribute to that but there is a sense in which the Order of Business often represents frustration.  It is the only opportunity Members have to get across a point of view where there are no other immediate and adequate channels to express it.  It is a very important point and we need to keep a sense of balance in dealing with it.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with the tone taken by the Leader of the House, because what he is seeming to suggest is that the Seanad should seek out a more restrictive role for itself rather than seek out a more positively distinctive role.  The Leader of the House, when he was appointed, and indeed the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach, all indicated their desire for genuine Seanad reform and for seeking a more meaningful role for this House.  As far as I can see, that particular process has come to a halt.  I do not know whose fault it is, but certainly there have not been any meetings, nothing is happening, there are no new ideas.  I would hate to think that the Leader of the House is going into some sort of bunker at this stage, that he wants to put a stop to what was a hopeful movement and that he is in some ways trying to restrict the ordinary powers of the House.</P>
      <P>It is important that we recognise the inadequacy and total failure of, for example &mdash; and I raised this point last week &mdash; Private Members' Business where a group like ours, the main Opposition party, will have three or four occasions a year to raise Private Members' Business.  We could look at that as a starter towards having at least one Private Members' motion per week to at least use the means we have available. If the Leader does that and if he is positive, he will find that trouble on the Order of Business will become a thing of the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Order of Business today I would like to ask the Leader of the House, first, if he could indicate if any progress has been made on Item No. 2 &mdash; he spoke on it last week &mdash; if, and when it is proposed to take No. 6, if it is <Col N="1150" /> proposed to take it this session, and if he will indicate when he will make time available for the general debate on agriculture and GATT, which I think he promised us last week.  Further, would he again look seriously at the possibility over the next couple of weeks of making time available for a debate on Northern Ireland, which I believe his own group would like to have and which I am sure the Progressive Democrats would like to have.  I know that everybody on this side of the House would like to have an opportunity to discuss what is happening in Northern Ireland.  Finally, I am not sure if it is appropriate to the Order of Business, when will a Clerk Assistant be appointed to this House?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should respond to that part of the Senator's question. There is a certain statutory function that must be pursued in that regard.  I have undertaken to exercise that in the first instance and I am waiting for a reply or confirmation.  It is only in other unusual circumstances that the House would be required to deal with the matter.  I can assure the Senator that I am as concerned as he is about the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In deference to yourself, I certainly do not wish to open up a debate on the role of the Seanad but I want to make three points.  Over the past year we have proposed from these benches either to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or the appropriate subcommittee three changes which would relieve all the difficulties we are experiencing on the Order of Business, because those difficulties are simply the need for ideas to find expression or articulation in some form or another.  One of our proposals was that there would be a topical hour where issues could be raised in an orderly, designed and modelled way.  Secondly, we have asked that Private Members' time would be extended to once a week.  Thirdly, we have asked that two matters on the Adjournment might be taken on occasions.  We have offered full co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1151" /> I am not going to get into a wide debate on those issues.  I have made the points. I have argued them time and time again. They are agreed on both sides of the House.  It is not a question in terms of individuals on both sides of the House. It is a matter of grasping the nettle.  We have to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business, I want to raise one issue.  It is an issue of topicality to all of us &mdash; not because it is in today's headlines &mdash; but one cannot but note the fact that again hundreds more have been killed in Baghdad today.  I would appeal to the Leader of the House again to consider a discussion on the events in the Middle East in a general way and not in an immediate reaction to what happened today, but since the war has gone on for so many weeks we should have a proper debate on it and discuss it perhaps next week.  I would like to hear a commitment from the Leader of the House to have such a debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I was somewhat late for the earlier part of the speech of the Leader of the House.  I hope I am right in interpreting it as one basically of complaint without any proposals to provide solutions to the problems that are being experienced on the Order of Business.  I certainly agree with the Leader of the House.  It seems to me to be improper that the Order of Business should go on and on.  It goes on for a reason.  What I find disappointing is that the Leader of the House is not coming up with any proposals which would relieve the problems which are giving rise to these inordinately long periods on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been a number of suggestions, including some made by Senator O'Toole.  I have long held the view that speeches in the House are far too long and that we would all benefit greatly from cutting down on what we say.  I also feel that we should have the opportunity to respond to topical matters and that, in particular, the matter on the Adjournment should be extended to allow for perhaps two or three topics to be raised <Col N="1152" /> so that everybody would have a chance to raise what they feel is important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could you help me a Chathaoirligh, with a matter that is giving me some difficulty?  I refer to the papers that are laid before the Seanad.  One such paper is the Fair Trade Commissions annual report.  I ask your guidance and the help of the Leader of the House, because there are matters in the reports laid before the House that it is important to discuss.  I am not going into detail. There is a serious situation in which I would question the Fair Trade Commission's report.  That is in relation to the price of bread being sold in one shop for 79p and the same bread from the same bakery being sold elsewhere for 39p.  I am not trying to raise the issue but I believe it is equally as important as the Gulf crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that what the Senator is addressing is important but he is going down the very road we are trying to avoid.  I want to ask your co-operation. There is a procedure for discussing any matter and the Senator can use the procedure of motion.  It is also fair to say that the documents referred to are laid before the two Houses of the Oireachtas and they are not a matter for discussion on the Order of Business as such.  The only way that you can have recourse to such a discussion is by way of motion.  I suggest that the Senator take that line.  Otherwise, we are going to go down the road we are trying to avoid.  If it happens in one instance it will happen in another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Cathaoirleach that I will not be the person to disrupt the proceedings of the House.  I totally support your attempts to run a more orderly House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must protest at the innuendo that this is a disorderly House, a phrase that has very sinister <Col N="1153" /> connotations indeed.  I support Senator O'Toole's plea for a debate on the Gulf War because the situation has deteriorated so alaramingly since we last debated it.  That is a matter of great priority.  Perhaps the Leader will inform us when it is proposed to take Item No. 5, the debate on the Appropriation Bill.</P>
      <P>For a long time now I felt an <i>Urbi et Orli</i> speech coming on me, which I would like to get rid of.  I was sorry we did not have some notice that the Leader of the House was going to make us privy to his philosophical deliberations on the role of the Seanad.  That, in itself, should have required some notice.  Since he has chosen to do so, I would like to make some comments on that and on your own remarks.  It is true that there are Senators who, on the Order of Business, waste time, as some people might say, in order to attract publicity; but we are all publicity seekers and it is interesting to observe that very frequently the Senators who thus &ldquo;waste time&rdquo; are those who make the most substantial contributions to legislation in this House.  That should be put on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week reference was made to the deplorable fact that a Minister was kept waiting while the Order of Business was going on.  With respect, I submit that the role of the Seanad is not to accomodate Ministers but <i>vice versa.</i>  It is by definition the role of the Minister to wait on the convenience of the Seanad.  I would make rather a different point to that made by Senator Manning.  I would refer the House to a long record of debates on the Order of Business.  Custom has the force of law and a long-standing custom is that it is quite legitimate for Senators to bring up matters from week to week which they think should be brought up on the Order of Business.  It is for you, a Chathaoirligh, to deal with them if they are irrelevant, but I put it to you that custom suggests you should give them maximum flexibility and I will expect that continuing flexibility on the Order of Business.  Like Senator McGowan, I am not one of those who deliberately disrupts the Order of Business; but I do expect reasonable flexibility and I certainly will strenuously <Col N="1154" /> resist any attempt to impose an artificial strait jacket on the discussions on the Order of Business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Leader of the House if it is the Government's intention to set up a relief fund for those people who suffered severe losses during the floods and storms of early January.  I understand that the Minister for Agriculture and Food at the time went on record and said he was contemplating setting up such a fund.  I would like to know if the Government decided to set up this fund and when it will be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like also to speak on this delay which takes place every week on the Order of Business. Obviously something has to be done about it.  I would think it is the duty of the Cathaoirleach to be very strict on this matter and it is the duty of the House to assist him.  In fact, it is almost an obligation on the Cathaoirleach to be unpopular with the Members here because of the strict measures he might take to make sure that the House is run in an orderly fashion.  In spite of whatever protests might be made to the Cathaoirleach if he were to curtail speech on any debate, I think, nevertheless he would have the respect of the House if he was strict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On other matters, I am not too sure what provisions there are here to raise immediate matters, and by &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; I mean something of international or national importance that occurred the day before we meet or the day we are meeting.  There should be some arrangement among Members &mdash; and I do not mean the Committee on Procedure and Privileges; I am not too sure about the effectiveness of that body &mdash; I think there should be some group here that could decide on matters of immediate importance that should be or could be raised. For instance, Senator O'Toole and Senator Murphy raised the matter of the Gulf War.  Baghdad is no longer a long way away.  In fact, there is no place on earth a long way away any more; it is all <Col N="1155" /> very close to us and it all affects us.  The invasion of Kuwait was barbaric and I think the bombing of Baghdad is barbaric. The bombing of Israel was worse, if there is a stronger word than &ldquo;barbaric.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are drifting slightly from the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Having asked you to be strict, I did not expect you to be strict that quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Having said what I have said &mdash; and I stand over what I have said that these countries are no longer far away from us &mdash; I believe there should be a provision whereby a committee of this House consisting of all the groups, could sit down and decide if there is an immediate matter to be debated and I do not think it should be left all the time to the Cathaoirleach to decide these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a provision in Standing Order 29 for Members to raise any matter they feel concerned about and consider urgent.  That provision obtains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.  A Senator may well raise a matter and it may be ruled out of order.  I am talking about a group who would decide with the Cathaoirleach what would be in order &mdash; even though it was not on the Order Paper &mdash; because of its immediate importance.  That is what I am talking about.  However, I think we are going through an age of savagery, with all the bombing and everything that is going on, affecting children and women in Baghdad. The whole thing is sick.  It is horrifying. I wish somebody would just say: let us sit down and talk and stop all this killing of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>With due deference to what you said earlier, a Chathaoirligh, I beg leave to ask the Leader of the House <Col N="1156" /> if he would make some time available for the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to make a statement in relation to the situation which has evolved, particularly over the past week, in relation to An Post.  This has a particular concern for us all.  It has rocked the country, in particular the rural parts, in relation to possible job losses and subpost office closures.  No doubt&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, Senator, it must be by way of motion.  While not wanting to be absolutely restrictive, at the same time I cannot allow what is tantamount to a speech to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>If I could briefly conclude, all of us here are elected to a greater or lesser degree by a rural constituency. We have all had representations on that.  I would ask the Leader of the House to consider favourably my request.  This is a very important issue and I would ask him, if possible to make some time available for a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Senators who have asked for a broad debate on the implications of the current horrific war in the Middle East.  As Senator Hanafin has said, it is a war that is impacting on us very closely and it could have a much more dangerous impact in the future.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom arís comhghairdeas a dhéanamh le gach éinne a bhí ag obair chun an córas aistriúcháin seo a chur ar siúl sa Seanad.  But, having said that, I must refer to something I think highly insensitive and I would like to request either the Leader or the Cathaoirleach to ask the Office of Public Works why, when we are looking for a tool to change from Irish to English or English to Irish, that the implement we get is made in England. I think that is very insensitive when we all know that these instruments are available in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise a couple of matters directly on the Order of Business, but I would like to make a <Col N="1157" /> few comments, if I may, about the general discussion.  I think it has been very useful.  I am glad that the Leader of the House opened it up.  It might perhaps indicate that there is an opportunity coming for a full debate on the role of the Seanad, because I recognise the fact that we are all dealing within parameters that constrict us.  I do not think there is necessarily ill will.  I think it is time we looked at the procedures in some depth. I note my colleague Senator O'Toole has indicated that certain suggestions have been made and I hope they might be implemented.</P>
      <P>It seems very clear to me that there is a lot of intellectual energy in this House on all sides and it simply seeks an avenue of expression.  The way in which the Seanad is composed at the moment apparently does not allow for that expression, according to the existing channels.  It seems to me that the channel is not simply to deny expression of that energy, which could be most useful, but I imagine the Leader will agree with me that the thing perhaps to do is to seek some method of harnessing that energy in the interests of the State and I am sure that all sides of the House would cooperate in that.</P>
      <P>You yourself, Sir, referred to Standing Order 29.  I have no intention of drawing yourself or your Office into it but I would just like to say in general terms that it is difficult sometimes because of the way Standing Order 29 is written.  There is no clear guidance as to what constitutes a matter of urgent national importance, so that matters may well be raised by people who, with the best will in the world, consider them to be such, but they are ruled out of order and it is impossible to discover the criteria by which they were ruled out because the Standing Order is vague.  That is no attempt to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, Senator Norris, but really you are engaging in a very wide area now if we are going to debate Standing Order 29.  I just gave you a moment on it due to the fact that it was mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1158" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much appreciate that.  Could I say that it is just one example?  Senator Hanafin suggested that perhaps some kind of sifting committee might be established.  This might be a good idea; it might be a bad idea.  Again, perhaps it is something that could be considered, because I believe we all wish to see the House operating as efficiently as possible.</P>
      <P>In deference to your remarks, Sir, I will pass from this, but I will raise three items which are on the Order Paper.  The first one, I think, gives an illustration of what we have been talking about today, because I am well aware of the fact that it will not be possible to have it raised today.  It is Motion 71, which states:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann expresses the hope that the Government has monitored and intends to continue monitoring meetings such as that sponsored by the National Front of France in the conference chamber of Dublin Castle with a view to ensuring that Irish domestic law concerning Incitement to Hatred is not breached and that in the event of any such breach occurring those responsible are prosecuted with the full vigour of the law.</P>

      <P>I want to remind you, Senator, that you are not entitled to read the motion, but seeing that you have it read there is little I can do about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not realise that.  Can I just use that very briefly as an illustration, because I am aware that it could be taken that I was being fractious and tendentious and really wasting the time of the Seanad, but I do not think so because that meeting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <P>Senator Norris, have you a question for the Leader of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have.  The question I have for the Leader of the House is: will the Leader of the House, despite the fact that this matter is most unlikely to <Col N="1159" /> be taken today, draw the material substance of it to the attention of the Government so that the law of this land may not be flouted and so that Seanad Éireann may be demonstrated, despite the antiquity of its machinery, to play a vital role in the day-to-day running of the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, but there was not a full stop, as you may have noticed, a Chathaoirligh; there was only a comma, so I think that it falls within&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, perhaps a semicolon. That was my first request.  There are just two others about which I would like to ask the Leader of the House.  The first is Item No. 10 on the Order Paper for today, and I do so because I believe the Leader of the House has given an opening for it.  I am not going to propose an alteration to the Order of Business but I would like him to give time for it.  An adoption Bill has been accepted by the Government and this is a related matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has made his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to give time for this because he indicated that legislation should be initiated in this Chamber and that the issue should be dealt with in a less overtly political manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no necessity to make such an emphatic statement. The Senator has put the question to the Leader of the House and I am sure he will reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>My third question is whether in the light of recent newspaper speculation which indicated that there <Col N="1160" /> might be a foreign affairs committee established of one House and further newspaper speculation which indicated that certain elements of the Opposition appeared to give only marginal standing to the Seanad in any possible Oireachtas joint committee on foreign affairs, the Leader will give time for Item No. 49 on the supplementary Order Paper which looks for the establishment of a foreign affairs committee.  If there is not to be a joint committee, will the Leader immediately table a resolution establishing in addition to the Dáil committee on foreign affairs a Seanad committee on foreign affairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We might need a sifting committee to go through what the last speaker has spent so long debating.  It is vital that we have a debate on agriculture. This has already been mentioned by Senator Manning.  I suspect that because of the pressure for other debates the debate on agriculture may be relegated but because of the great uncertainty in agriculture I plead with him to have a debate on it next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Put down a motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the statement made by the Leader of the House concerning his perception of the function of the Seanad.  He spoke in an <i>ex cathedra</i> fashion and since he put some very profound words on the record I would like to add one or two.  I do not entirely agree with him.  I take his point that this is a legislative assembly.  That may well be our primary function but that is not the totality of the Seanad.  The totality of the Seanad is the various functions in which we are engaged which include the Order of Business, motions, debates, and matters on the Adjournment.  I do not think we should get carried away with the notion that merely because we are one of the Houses of the Oireachtas concerned with the enactment of legislation we should put other areas of activity into a peripheral role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the call by Senator Manning <Col N="1161" /> for an urgent debate in this House on Northern Ireland.  Also, given the present situation in Brussels, a debate on agriculture is extremely compelling and pertinent at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on agriculture and on Northern Ireland.  There was a debate on agriculture in the past but there has not been one on Northern Ireland.  I would like to add to that a request for a debate on prisons.  These are areas that have been raised with the Leader of the House.  He has indicated his intention of having a debate on Northern Ireland and prisons and I would like him to give us some indication as to when he thinks both of those areas will be addressed.</P>
      <P>Those are medium-term urgent debates but there are the specific areas of topicality in the context of what the Leader said.  Three were raised here today; the closure of 550 post offices and the effect that may have on the rural population; the question of the bread war and the question of the horrendous developments in the Gulf War.  We have an obligation to discuss these issues.  I do not think the Leader of the House can come in and say that it is not the function of the Seanad to deal with day-to-day, topical, current issues, otherwise it would be a mirror image of the Dáil.  That is not the way we should be going forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admire and appreciate the work the Leader of the House has done in terms of initiating major legislation in this House but he will have to give more thought to the area of current issues and affairs.  There is a major role for this House to play but it cannot be done within the terms indicated by the Cathaoirleach, namely, Standing Order 29, the Adjournment or Private Members' time.  They are not for urgent matters and I am not aware of a single matter which was dealt with under Standing Order 29 since I came into the House.  Perhaps the Whips, the Leader of the House, the Cathaoirleach and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, if that is the appropriate body, need to <Col N="1162" /> address this.  There is a need for somebody to look at the structures to ensure that this important area which takes up time on the Order of Business has a particular slot in which it can be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the NUI decision recently to break up its constituent colleges structure and confer independence on its four universities and the Minister for Education's promise to bring forward the necessary legislation, I ask the Leader of the House if he could convey the view to the Minister for Education that when she is doing that she should take the opportunity to confer the additional Seanad votes on the two universities and other appropriate colleges. For the past 15 months I have constantly raised this issue and it is frustrating to be told that when it went to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges the feedback was that it was not the business of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges but of the Seanad.  It came back to us as the business of the Seanad and I have heard nothing since.</P>

      <P>If there were we would all be assigned to asylums at this stage because of the level of frustration and stress.  I consider this to be the business of the Seanad and I have yet to get a satisfactory answer.  Students and graduates of the universities will take to the streets one of these days.  They feel they are being discriminated against and cannot vote.  I would like an immediate answer to that question from the Leader of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is seldom that I interrupt or disrupt the Order of Business but I add my concern to Senator Cosgrave's in asking for a debate on An Post.  It will be over and <Col N="1163" /> done with and we will not have had an opportunity to discuss its implications. Surely it is the business of the Seanad to represent the views of the people who elect us.  I hope to get two positive answers from the Leader of the House today in relation to those requests.</P>

      <P>I add my support to Senator O'Toole and a number of other Senators including, Senators Manning and Hanafin, for a debate on the horrific events that have developed in the Gulf, particularly today. I am entirely in sympathy with Senator Murphy who said last week that it would not be a debate of &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; or anything like that.  It is a debate about a tragedy which is unfolding before our eyes.  We should be talking about the end of it not about who said what and who was right and who was wrong.  I appeal to the Leader for such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue the Leader of the House raised, it is not my usual function to be in sympathy with him but we should all take ourselves a little less seriously. There is perpetual tension between the Government and the Opposition in a House like this.  I do not find this House frustrating.  I find it difficult.  Sometimes I do not get my way and sometimes I do. <Col N="1164" /> I do not always get what I want done and sometimes I do.  I have no great patience with anybody who gets up and says that because an issue he or she wanted debated was not debated in the time span they allocated themselves that somehow this House is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Some Senators including Senator Manning said that I was putting a stop on the debate, as it were.  I am not. We have a Whips' meeting every week at which we order and finalise business for the day and for the week; yet we still spend an hour and a half asking questions on items we know cannot be taken.  I have been as helpful and as innovative as I can but I have to work within the rules of the House.  If Senators and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges want to meet and change them, that is fine with me.  What I am saying is that we should work with what we have before us.  That is what I am trying to do.  I should not lose sight of our primary function here.  I feel very strongly about that.  I am not trying to protect the Government or negative the role of the Seanad in any way.  I am as open to change as anyone and if the Committee on Procedure and Privileges want to meet and change the rules I will not try to stifle them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not on that we should debate the headlines of the day.  That is not feasible in this House and we know that.  We have Whips who meet every week and there are channels and procedures whereby topical matters can be raised.  There is provision for a half hour Adjournment debate, for taking items under Standing Order 29, for Private Members time, and soon but if Senators want an extra topical hour or whatever it is to be called, that is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  If that comes into play, <Col N="1166" /> that is fine with me.  I am simply saying that we should do our very best with what we have.  I do not think the Order of Business should take an hour and a half every day.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning again asked about item No. 2.  I met the parliamentary agent and explained to him that there was priority legislation and he seemed to understand that was the situation.  The Senator also asked for a debate on agriculture and Northern Ireland.  Hopefully, a debate on agriculture will be arranged within the next two weeks.  Senator O'Toole spoke about allowing time to discuss topical matters and also Private Members' time.  If that is to be changed, that is fine with me.</P>

      <P>Senator Upton said speeches are too long.  If the Committee on Procedure and Privileges want to curtail debate that is a matter for them. Senator McGowan asked about documents laid before the House.  That is not a matter for discussion on the Order of Business.  Senator Murphy asked for a debate on the Gulf War and he asked about the Appropriation Bill.  That will be taken within the next two weeks or threreabouts.  Senator Naughten asked about a relief fund.  I do not know the position on that but I will try to find out and let the Seantor know.  Senator Hanafin asked about the procedures to <Col N="1167" /> raise urgent matters.  I have given the procedures and the channels through which we can raise such matters.  Three weeks ago we had a debate on the Gulf. Senator Cosgrave asked about a debate, as did Senator Jackman, on An Post. That seems to be suitable for a debate in Private Members' time.  Senator Lanigan also asked about a debate on the Gulf War.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris supported some form of debate on the role of the Seanad.  If the Committee on Procedure and Privileges want to change some of the rules or regulations of the Seanad that is a matter for them.  I have no plan for a debate on Item No. 71 or on Item No. 10.  As regards the committee on foreign affairs I replied last week to Senator Cullen that discussions were still going on with the other parties and I said I was hopeful that it would be a joint Oireachtas Committee.  Senator Byrne asked for a debate on agriculture. We will have a debate on that matter within two weeks.  Senator Staunton also asked for that debate.  Senator Costello asked about agriculture, about Northern Ireland, An Post and the possibility of raising topical matters.</P>
      <P>We have very important legislation for the remainder of the month.  Sentor Jackman asked me to convey her views to the Minister.  She also spoke about a debate on agriculture and An Post.  I have no plan for a debate on that at present but it is suitable for Private Members' time. Senator Brendan Ryan spoke about extending the franchise and also about a debate on the Gulf War.  Senator Neville asked about a Bill on criminal insanity.  I understand one is in the course of preparation. I understand from Senator Neville that he would like, if possible, to initiate it here.  I will ask the Minister about that and see how we get on.  Senator Hourigan asked me many questions on agriculture.  We will have a wide-ranging debate on agriculture hopefully within two weeks.  The questions he asked me would be far more appropriate to the Minister who will be here on the day. That is where he should direct his questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Harney to the House and congratulate her on this legislation which I welcome although I have reservations with regard to certain aspects of it.</P>
      <P>The Minister in her address to this House some weeks ago, made it very clear, and it is worth emphasising, that the environment has been brought in the last four or five years from the position of being an unknown quantity to a position where it is now regarded as top of the league in relation to importance, relevance, the need for attention and so on. We all can recall a time when we did not have a Minister for the Environment.  We had a Minister for Local Government who dealt with environmental matters. The establishment of the office of Minister for the Environment and Minister of State with responsibility for the Environment indicates the importance that has been attached to the environmental area in recent times.  With the collapse of the Iron Curtain we have seen the terrible devastation of certain East European countries and the loss of life as a result of disease and so on.  In Ireland we can be justly proud of our position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain reservations I have about the Bill but generally I welcome it and I compliment the Minister on her endeavours.  One of my major reservations relates to the appeals procedure. This matter was raised by a number of different interest groups and has been raised by the Minister and by my colleagues in the House.  The position with regard to appeals is not what it should be from a psychological or practical point of view.  As I understand it, when the agency proposes to grant a licence it shall first indicate its proposals and interested parties will then have an opportunity to comment on them.  These comments will be <Col N="1169" /> taken into account by the agency in making its final decision.  Therefore, the agency would appear to be the final arbiter in the matter.  Now while I have every confidence in the calibre and expertise of the persons who will handle this operation, I would have grave reservations about the acceptability of that procedure which, to my mind, does not conform to the average person's idea of an appeals mechanism, which people regard as something separate and different.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister has already stated that the best possible expertise will be available within the agency and the agency will, from a practical point of view, cover the area quite effectively.  However, I stress that a system of appeal to another board or body which would also, of course, have expertise would be desirable.</P>
    <P>With respect, the Minister is not having sufficient regard to what I referred to earlier, that is the psychological benefit to an objector in having his or her appeal heard by an independent third party.  This could lead to a lack of confidence and to a certain degree of mistrust which could undermine what would otherwise be an excellent body, doing excellent work in protecting our environment.  I do not wish to stress that point, but it is important. As I said earlier, it has as much to do with the perception of people of the situation as it has with its practical application.</P>
    <P>It has been stated already that one of the prime reasons for introducing this legislation is to ensure that public confidence and independence will be to the fore.  The lack of a proper appeals procedure, to which I have referred, will affect this perception by the ordinary people. I want to stress again the mental and psychological effect on an objector who has recourse to a third party.  It will be a great pity if we are again to witness scenes where potential industry, which may be very badly needed, is lost to an area because of protracted disputes and protests. I agree that nobody should accept or want industry at any cost but it would be very much regretted if such protests were to continue for a protracted period <Col N="1170" /> simply because people were crying out for a proper appeals procedure.  If public opinion is to be satisfied that there is an adequate appeals procedure built into this legislation, then it must be through an independent third party organisation or body.  Public confidence, can only be enhanced if we have such an appeals procedure.  I know the Minister will take cognisance of that point with regard to appeals which I have emphasised at some length.</P>
    <P>Some of the financial implications proposed in the Bill will cause concern, in particular where they relate to local authorities. I fully appreciate it is not intended that this Bill should remove local authorities from the entire scene as regards environmental protection.  In fact, it is envisaged that they will continue to play a very important role in the whole area. In other words, in conjunction with this Environmental Protection Agency, the efforts of local authorities and other bodies will be synchronised or co-ordinated. I have no fear about that.</P>
    <P>What concerns me about the Bill is that we could have further erosion of the financial base of local authorities. Members here who sit on local authority bodies will appreciate the serious problems that could cause.  Large industries which currently contribute towards local authorities by way of monitoring and treatment of discharges as conditions of their licences will now become licensed under the agency, thus removing this source of revenue from local authorities. It is essential that they are provided with adequate finance from the State to ensure they can continue to play the important role envisaged for them in environmental protection.</P>
    <P>While many aspects of the Bill are very much to the point, the provisions must be implemented fully if the agency and the local authorities are to adequately police and protect our environment and this will be dependent to a great extent on the finance made available to them.  It is absolutely imperative, therefore, that the whole question of financing for the <Col N="1171" /> agency and local authorities in the context of environmental protection should be clarified by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I referred last week to a number of points and I want to elaborate on some of them.  I stressed how important the environment is now rated by all concerned with environmental matters; it is a very complex area.  Very few people appreciate the number of areas of activity and the matters that come within the ambit of and under the control of, the Department of the Environment. Frankly, in a changing world the environment is a very important barometer of the well-being of our country and, more importantly the well-being of our people. We have seen examples throughout the world of the environment causing major problems with regard to the health of the population.  We are fortunate here in having a clean environment and I believe those vested with the responsibility up to now have done a good job.  I am certain the Minister and all the other people concerned in the future with the environment will continue that good work.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the Environmental Protection Agency and the fact that they will have direct responsibility for licensing, control and other major functions. This speaks for itself, it puts the agency in a very special category, where it will be the apex of all activity with regard to environmental matters.  We must take into account the vast amount of waste we have to dispose of annually here.  For example, each year more than 28 million tonnes of solid waste are produced in this country and agriculture accounts for 22 million tonnes of that figure.  I am talking about solid waste which is domestic refuse, industrial and commercial waste, litter, waste from mining, quarrying, construction, agriculture, sludges and semisolids that cannot be discharged in water or air.  The figures I have given bring home to us very forcibly the problem we face and it will take a united effort on the part of everybody to ensure that we deal with it.</P>
    <P>There are many different ways of disposing of waste at present.  Almost all <Col N="1172" /> non-sludge waste goes to land fill sites in the various local authority areas.  46 per cent of sewage sludge is discharged at sea, 28 per cent is dried and spread on agricultural land, 18 per cent is disposed of in land fill sites and 8 per cent is disposed of otherwise.  With regard to sludge and waste being discharged into the sea, there is an urgent need for a greatly increased number of treatment plants or processing units here to ensure that our seas and major rivers, like the Shannon, are not polluted to an extent that people cannot swim in them or fish cannot survive. We must ensure that leisure activities are not affected because of pollution of major and minor rivers and, indeed, the sea.</P>
    <P>Various methods of waste disposal are carried out by private firms.  Many firms adopt measures of a fairly sophisticated nature and are doing a good job.  Others, it is true to say, leave a lot to be desired and are not disposing of waste in the proper way.  There are certain dangerous wastes, such as toxic waste, which have to be treated very carefully.  There are in all 27 categories of waste and those are defined under various EC Directives.  In Ireland 52,000 tonnes per annum are produced and 19 of the 27 categories are toxic waste materials.  Of that, 63 per cent is chlorinated and organic solvents, followed by biocides and other chemical materials, are used to make the material safe.</P>
    <P>One could go on and on about waste, its volume, its disposal and so on.  In many parts of the country, be it Clare, Limerick, Kerry or elsewhere there is a greater awareness of the problem of pollution but unfortunately our major rivers are very often dumping places for motor cars and other major objects.  In the River Shannon, for example, many items such as cars, lorries and so on are discarded.  That affects boating activities and leisure activities such as swimming and so forth, as well as causing serious pollution.  We must be very mindful of that and ensure that it is not allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I referred already to the complexities of the problem confronting the Minister <Col N="1173" /> and other persons with responsibility for dealing with this issue.  There is provision in this Bill for the appointment of a director general, four directors, an advisory committee, a certain number of staff, specialists and others who need not necessarily be in the specialist area.  As I said already, it is essential that there is an independent appeals procedure.  The Minister to an extent has taken care of that but not to the required extent.</P>
    <P>With regard to the appointment of the board of directors, instead of appointing a director general and directors from a number of persons from nominating bodies, the directors should be nominated directly by the nominating bodies and no Minister or Government would hand pick from, say, four persons.  In that way the agency will be more independent.</P>
    <P>The whole area of the environment is vital if we are to maintain the flora which in parts of our country, such as the Burren in County Clare, is very special and many other places have special types of rare plants.  There will be, and are, various international agreements which will be made with regard to environmental policy because at this stage &mdash; and I stress this &mdash; we must not attempt to legislate for pollution control in Ireland in isolation. We must attempt to take account of the position in Europe and further afield in so far as it is relevant to us. However, the most immediate and important point is that we tackle the pollution problem in our island.  Following that we should monitor the position in other countries and reach agreement with regard to wind changes and so on.  There are many different ways in which this can be done.</P>
    <P>Essentially, as I see it &mdash; without going through the Bill line by line, which is a matter for a later Stage &mdash; the Bill is an updating of existing legislation and a centralisation of activities now being carried out by other agencies.  I urge the Minister to insure that those other agencies, which by and large are local authorities, should continue to have a function, a very important function, in the whole area of environmental control <Col N="1174" /> in the future.  Before I leave the position of the director general I should say that we must have the highest level of confidence in this area.  The director general must be highly qualified, with good commonsense, capable of doing a good job, backed up by a good board of directors, working satisfactorily as independent as is necessary, to enable them to do a job without being told what to do or what not to do.  Equally, an advisory committee have been talked about.  It is essential that this advisory committee should consist of persons who are useful, appropriate, helpful and meaningful for the agency.  Likewise it is of paramount importance that all the staff, particularly the specialist staff, engineers and scientists of various types are well trained and well suited for the particular function they will carry out.</P>
    <P>We will need to have constant monitoring of the quality of the environment. The position as of today may be totally different in six or 12 months time.  Therefore I would emphasise the importance of constant monitoring of the quality of the environment.  We have a good environment and let us keep it that way.  Of course, there are certain inadequate aspects also such as the many fish kills in our rivers.  I have already referred to the many undesirable incidences of polluted rivers, lakes, and seashores, which the public cannot use in a pleasurable way. That must be resolved.</P>
    <P>By and large, we must take account of these matters and embrace the other non-obvious environmental matters.  One that strikes one very forcibly, and which is mentioned in the Bill as far as I can recollect, is that of noise.  In regard to noise from discos and the like in residential areas, will the Minister outline what is envisaged for taking care of that problem?  In many residential areas in Dublin, Limerick, Cork, Galway and in major towns such as Ennis, Nenagh, Clonmel and so on, noise from discos is a big problem.</P>
    <P>Those are the less obvious pollutants of the environment.  There is also pollution from traffic and from the burning of certain coals and so on.  There are problems <Col N="1175" /> with regard to paints and many other things.  Will the Minister address what may seem the non-obvious areas of pollution in this regard?  I mentioned, in particular, discos and how they can and are affecting the lives of many people in residential areas in our cities and towns throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There must be access to information because many people can play their part, and play their part very meaningfully, provided they have access to information. Many persons, genuinely and through ignorance, are polluting the atmosphere and the country generally. Litter, to which I have not referred, is a major pollutant here.  Monitoring reports should be examined, say, once in every two or three years.  When there is a monitoring process on an ongoing basis one can decide how often these reports should be brought forward for a thorough and positive examination.</P>
    <P>Fines and penalties are referred to in the Bill.  Perhaps in some of these cases the fines and penalties should be greater than they are because, quite frankly, anybody who blatantly pollutes the environment deserves to be heavily fined.  We do not have the sort of resources they have in other countries in Europe, for tackling environmental problems.  Even though we are many years late compared to places like Denmark, Holland, Germany and other European countries with regard to what they have done over the last 20 years <i>vis-á-vis</i> pollution control, I am certain that we can now deal with the problem of pollution.  I urge the Minister to ensure that at the end of the day this Bill does not contain too much ambiguity because if we have too high a level of ambiguity we will only provide a bonanza for those in the legal profession.  While I have nothing personal against that profession, there is no point in creating situations that could be avoided by more commonsense legislation on day one.</P>
    <P>We are in danger in this legislation, as in all other legislation of its type, of establishing a further layer of bureaucracy. This is something we must and <Col N="1176" /> should avoid.  Agriculture has been a major factor with regard to pollution.  I believe that in the context of this Bill we cannot leave the various pollutions that are now caused by agriculture to a peripheral group.  We have lagged seriously behind many other European countries in the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>We have now before us a set of regulations from the EC Commission which are due for implementation on 1 January 1993.  They will have to go before the Council of Ministers but are unlikely to go through in the form in which they are now laid down.  These apply to a number of areas in agriculture such as dairying, beef production and so on.  I wish to refer to the position with regard to persons involved in milk production.  We have dairy farmers who produce milk for processing or manufacture and we have dairy farmers who produce milk for liquid consumption in our large towns and cities and throughout the country.  In 1993 there will be a major overhaul of many production units, especially at the assembly point of the dairy animals, at the milking area where the milk is cooled and where the milk is stored.  Very stringent rules will be laid down concerning, for example, the storage of milk which will not then be permitted where milk is cooled and compressed.  There will be very definite rules with regard to milking parlours, to the housing of stock and the collection of stock in the summer months which, effectively, will mean a major cost increase to many of our farmers.  We are talking, in total, of figures of perhaps £25,000 or £30,000; these are the sort of costs with which many of our dairy farmers will be faced from 1 January 1993 if they want to continue in dairying.</P>
    <P>High levels of hygiene will be required. I do not disagree with the hygiene standards that have been passed.  Perhaps certain modifications here and there could be questioned but a high level of hygiene is generally essential.  That is going to be a major cost factor and our Government should take cognisance of this.  A system of grants would enable farmers to meet the requirements demanded of them when the time comes <Col N="1177" /> if in the first instance we do not succeed in getting the required moneys from Europe.</P>
    <P>We also have a major regulation which is part of the 1993 regulations.  Under this regulation milk from a restricted herd cannot be used for any form of human consumption either in milk form or in processed form.  In other words, milk from a restricted herd cannot be used directly as milk, it cannot be used as cheese or skim milk powder, as butter or in any other form.  That would mean, in practice, that a dairy farmer could not supply milk to the creamery for a period of at least four months.  If a person found himself in the month of March being restricted from supplying milk to the local creamery for a period of four months, the entire season would virtually pass by. There may be some form of payment made but that is a development we must keep in mind.</P>
    <P>There has to be an adequate supply of potable water; in simple terminology that is water fit for human consumption.  That water must be available for all cleansing of milking machines and milking systems generally.  In the milking parlour there also has to be a sink.</P>
    <P>Another major area is that of abattoirs. We know now that meat and bone meal are banned for use as animal feed and this has created a major problem with regard to the disposal of offal.  At the present time, relatively small operators are paying as much as £50 per tonne for offal disposal through incineration and so on.  I know of one small operation where offal disposal is now costing £400 per week whereas before the BSE or the mad cow disease problem arose those persons were making a profit of perhaps £400 per week.  There is a potential loss here of between £600 and £800 per week.  On a <i>pro rata</i> basis of £50 per tonne losses in a larger operation would be greater; each tonne would not necessarily cost £50, but the loss would be significant.</P>
    <P>I believe that this area is the concern of the Department of the Environment in close co-operation with the Department of Agriculture and Food.  Similarly, when animals die on farms, the farm <Col N="1178" /> owner now has to pay as much as £10 for the removal of the dead animal.  Death of an animal is a serious loss to farmers, which is compounded by having to pay for the removal of the animal.  Smaller animals cost less than £10 to remove but £10 is now required instead of the small nominal payment which was sufficient up to now.</P>
    <P>There is a very serious danger that unless we have a satisfactory means of disposing of dead animals from farms and of offal from abattoirs serious pollution of areas such as boglands, rivers and so forth will result.  I am not suggesting that people would readily go out and dispose of their animals or their products in this way but there is a danger of which we should be mindful for the sake of efficiency and for the sake of the well-being of our community.</P>
    <P>Fishing has been very seriously affected throughout the country.  This is a great tragedy.  One of the highlights we offer to visitors to this country is fishing. When fishing is affected in major rivers and elsewhere it is a very bad thing.  I could take the Bill section by section but I do not propose to do so.  Before I conclude, may I say to the Minister that this legislation is very welcome as far as I am concerned.  I have pointed out certain areas that might need attention and this has been done in the spirit of absolute co-operation and in the interest of ensuring that this legislation will achieve optimum results for this country now and in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús, cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach seo agus déanaim comhghairdeas léi as ucht an Bille seo a thabhairt os ár gcomhair.  Tá súil againn go mbeidh toradh a cuid saothair ag an Aire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that this legislation has been brought before this House and I congratulate the Minister on doing so.  Its implementation will have far-reaching effects and consequences for all people and I hope that it will have an extremely positive effect on our environment and will ensure that the unique <Col N="1179" /> natural resources which we are so fortunate to have will be protected.  It is very important that the public understand that the passing of this Bill will result in people having to adapt to a different and better way of doing things and that the indifferent attitude of many to the precious natural assets we are blessed with, will have to change in the future.</P>
    <P>Economic development, the environment and population are all inseparable issues.  Unless environmental issues are dealt with effectively, sustainable development will never become a reality.  One of the great scourges and difficulties we have in this age is poverty. People might ask what poverty has to do with the environment.  Poverty can be both a cause and a result of environmental degradation.  The village or the slum that lacks clean water and sanitary facilities harbours sickness and death. The uneducated often lack the know-how to maintain a healthy environment.  It also follows, however, that higher standards of living will result in more goods being required so it is essential that they be produced in an environmentally efficient way.  This would mean saving energy and reducing pollution.  A given water system can cope with a reasonable amount of pollution since nature has a certain but limited capacity to absorb and cleanse itself without upsetting the balance of the system.  However, once these limits have been passed, problems arise. On an international scale, the polluted Baltic and Mediterranean seas are obvious examples.  Rectifying the problem can be both costly and difficult.</P>
    <P>The balance has been lost in many areas throughout the world.  In this country we are very fortunate to have the opportunity to do something about the problem before it is too late.  This is why this Bill is so appropriate at this time. It is a great step towards rectifying the problem we have.  Everyone must learn to achieve or maintain development using less of the kind of energy that uses up environmental assets.  There is a great need for compatibility between growth and the preservation of the environment <Col N="1180" /> and one has to warn against a shortsighted approach to development and to economic modernisation.  We do not have to look very far for sufficient evidence that a mindless pre-occupation with modernisation at any cost can do irreparable damage to the environment.  The harmful effects on land and water and on afforestation already constitute a serious threat throughout the world.  It takes a long time for measures designed to protect the environment to yield results, so we cannot afford to lose any more time before implementing measures that will redress the damage already done and protect the environment from further destruction.</P>
    <P>Society must be educated and directed towards lifestyles that do not put excessive pressure on scarce natural resources. It is important that environmental issues should become an essential part of all educational programmes.</P>
    <P>This Bill describes an emission as (a) an emission into the atmosphere of a pollutant within the meaning of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, (b) a discharge of polluting matter, sewage effluent or trade effluent within the meaning of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977 to waters or sewers within the meaning of the Act, (c) the disposal of waste and, (d) noise.  Quite a substantial number of contributions in relation to (a), (b) and (c) have been made and I am glad that Senator Hourigan referred to (d), which relates to noise.  I would like to refer to that item also and to compliment the Minister for including it in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Many people might wonder what noise has to do with the pollution of the environment. In fact, it is considered to be one of the main causes of the decline in the quality of life.  All the forecasts for the trends in noise environment up to the year 2000 point to further deterioration unless action is taken soon.  Noise is constantly spreading geographically because of the development of suburban and tourist areas and over time because of the increasing mobility in towns at night time.  I was interested to listen to a doctor speaking on the Gay Byrne Show about noise in relation to discos, etc., and of <Col N="1181" /> the enormous damage that has been done to young people.  Senator Hourigan referred to the noise suffered by residents near discos but we must also consider the enormous damage done to the young people who attend these discos, not realising how serious the consequences may be.  That is an extremely difficult problem to overcome and to legislate for in terms of the relative degrees of noise, etc., that could be permitted.  We have to take a stand on the issue, however, and make efforts to regulate that problem, apart altogether from the nuisance which noise causes to people who would not be attending discos, etc., and, as Senator Hourigan said, from all other related noise problems from vehicles of all descriptions.</P>
    <P>The educational sector can make a significant contribution to the task of protecting the environment.  Young people should at all times be encouraged to realise that they can contribute to society through activities and that they can influence the world in which they live. The resolution on environmental education passed by the EC Council of Ministers of Education in May 1988 links environmental conditions directly to economic activities.  It points out that education and training in environmental matters are priority activities.  In this regard the An Taisce-Opel &ldquo;Work for Ireland Schools Environmental Project&rdquo; competition is an excellent method of encouraging young people to get involved in environmental awareness programmes. All schools should acquaint themselves with these types of projects and competitions and get involved in them at every level.  All schools should encourage their students to participate in them.</P>
    <P>In the area of packaging there is tremendous difficulty regarding recycling.  This process will play an everincreasing role in improving our environment. The Government have already given £750,000 in grants towards that purpose and are doing an excellent job in towns throughout the country in the area of recycling.  It is interesting to note that McDonalds, the fast food chain, have <Col N="1182" /> yielded to the pressures that have been put on them by environmentalists and have moved away from polystyrene packaging. The pressure for a continual move away from all types of plastic packaging is increasing.  It is difficult from time to time to know what direction to take for the best because while polystyrene has always been condemned as a tremendous pollutant, it was interesting to note last week that a survey showed paper packaging to have more harmful effects in certain areas than polystyrene packaging. It is very difficult to know what road one should go down.</P>
    <P>Up to recently in Ireland we tended to take the environment for granted.  We had a careless attitude towards environmental issues.  It was not a question of people consciously wrecking destruction and causing environmental problems. They did not think about what they were doing and they did not see that the activities they were carrying out were presenting a threat either to the environment or to anybody else.  This brings us back to the problem of educating people in the right treatment of the environment.  We can no longer continue as we have done in the past.  It behoves everyone to play his or her part in protecting our greatest asset which is our environment.</P>
    <P>The power which the agency will have to prosecute, to hold inquiries and to publish reports is a very important factor in the Bill.  I note also its power to seek a High Court injunction to prevent serious pollution.  I presume that where the agency directs a local authority to take specific remedial action regarding pollution the funding for such action will not be an expense on the council itself and on the scarce resources a local authority would have in relation to local county roads or something like that.  One finds from experience that where extra funding is to be needed for a project over a period of time that invariably it is the old county road structure that gets the hammer.  I do not know why that is but it is a difficulty we always envisage with local authorities. I hope therefore, that in the area of local authorities getting their own house in order in relation to pollution control any <Col N="1183" /> directives given and any remedial action taken will be funded by the Department.</P>
    <P>I welcome the idea that standards should be uniform and consistent in relation to environmental monitoring and control.  This is extremely important.  It is difficult to explain a situation where certain controls obtain in one area and not in another.  I am particularly pleased the Minister should involve herself in ensuring that there will be standard policies and controls throughout the country. I hope the requisite extra funding will be made available.</P>
    <P>If I may be parochial for a moment, the Minister may remember some time ago that we had a deputation from Lough Derg in relation to problems there concerning pollution of the lake.  Lough Derg is one of the three lakes of the Shannon. We regard it, I suppose selfishly, as the best of the three but we also regard it as one of the most outstanding lakes in Europe and the potential for development and tourist development in particular in that area is enormous. However, as the Minister is aware, the lake receives pollution from all other areas of the Shannon in terms of sewage and of other matter.</P>
    <P>There is also a difficulty with silting in relation to Bord na Móna and with the presence of peat.  There are areas in the Shannon from Portumna, coming down towards Lough Derg where the silt, if one was to test the areas there, would produce peat to the extent of three and four and in some areas ten feet deep.  The silt has built up to that extent.  We hope some remedial measure will be undertaken to ensure that that problem is alleviated.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous emphasis on Lough Derg at the moment on promotion of the area.  A number of organisations have been set up in co-operation with Shannon Development who have responsibility for tourism in the area, and in co-operation with the county councils in areas adjacent to Lough Derg.  All of those organisations, both voluntary and statutory, are doing tremendous work in promoting the whole area but all of that <Col N="1184" /> will be for nothing if the lake continues to be polluted.  I appeal to the Minister &mdash; I know she gave us a very warm reception and was very sympathetic to the case and will be looking at that area with great interest &mdash; to try and find solutions to that problem.  Lough Derg is only one such area of many throughout the country.  I appeal to her to take a particular interest in trying to ensure that the difficulties there are resolved.  I know that it takes a lot of money which cannot be picked off the trees but I feel that the people of the area have shown a willingness to co-operate in every way.  Local authorities and all the interested parties and the farming community have combined on this issue.</P>
    <P>If I could reiterate to the Minister the importance of the education sector in the area of environment.  It is the key to proper understanding of our environment. I would humbly suggest to the Minister that when this legislation passes into law a type of school pack should be made available for schools.  I do not know the cost of producing such an item.  I know that environmental studies are undertaken in different schools but it is now opportune in terms of the Environmental Agency legislation to re-emphasise to the schools, both primary and post-primary, the need to protect our environment. As an example of what can be done, I draw your attention to a place called Terryglass on the banks of the Shannon which won the National Tidy Towns Award a couple of years ago.  That stemmed from the local national school where the children decided to clean up the yard and the refuse.  It extended to the rest of the village and, as a result, the entire community became involved in the whole environmental area.  This led to that little village winning the National Tidy Towns Award.  Education played a major part in that development.  They are extremely proud of their area to such an extent that that pride is spreading throughout the area.  Would the Minister consider issuing schools with a type of environmental pack as a follow-up to educating the young children on exactly what this legislation is about?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1185" /> As another example of what can be done, I read recently that in the River Forth in Scotland the fish have returned to the estuary there after an absence of 25 years.  The fish used to breed in that estuary at one time and they supported an industry comprising of 80 fishing boats.  By 1965 all the fish had disappeared because of pollution.  The return of the fish now is attributed to the purification board's legislation and the control of organic effluent from distilleries and municipal sewage works. They did this as a special project and the result is that the fish have returned and are breeding there again.  I think that is a marvellous development.  I know there are different areas throughout his country where that type of activity is taking place as well.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on bringing it into this House.  I know it will have a speedy passage and I congratulate the Minister on a major piece of legislation.  It is not before its time and it can only have tremendously beneficial effects for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Bill as being a progressive and positive piece of legislation.  I would compliment the Minister and all those responsible for drafting and bringing it before us.  Obviously it is in the nature of things that is easy enough to find faults in a Bill of such length and to pick holes in it.  I certainly intend doing that as I go along.  It is fair to say that in the last few weeks most Members of this House have presented themselves as being environmental experts.  I certainly would not put myself forward in that category.  I do propose to make a few loose and disjointed comments on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the previous speaker leaves the Chamber, I would like to take some credit for my family for the movement of McDonalds from CFC-emitting materials to non CFCs because my children and all of us have hassled McDonalds for at least five years.  Everytime they went in there they ensured that they got whatever they were looking for in non-CFC emitting substances.  Indeed, we had at home for <Col N="1186" /> quite some time the first bag that came into McDonalds stating &ldquo;This product does not contain CFCs.&rdquo;  I also believe I was the first Member of either House of the Oireachtas to raise the question of CFCs a number of years ago when it came to my attention at that time.</P>
    <P>I also would like to outline what will be the basis of any development from this legislation and the effect it is going to have on competitiveness, on trade, on business and on industry.  It should not be ignored.  I want to see exactly how the &ldquo;cowboys&rdquo; are going to fit into this.  I want to establish the difference between the free trade regulations and the free riders.  I also want to look at our own position in that.  By the &ldquo;free riders&rdquo; I mean those people who want all the benefits of a free environment themselves but who are quite prepared to export and output environmentally damaging products and sell them wherever they can.  In many cases, perhaps, we could deal with that and respond in a very positive way.</P>
    <P>To take the very simple example of the CFCs to which I have referred, the reality is that we are still allowing into this country ozone damaging &mdash; as I understand it &mdash; aerosols.  I do not see why we should do that.  I think we should take a decision not to do it anymore.  It does have a certain affect on trade but that is one of the prices we have to be prepared to pay.  The Minister's Department took an initiative some years ago against the increase in the number of canned drinks or cans for holding drinks.  It was seen as somewhat cynical response in that we used fewer of them proportionately than other countries in Europe.  I do think we can make a start on something like the CFC emitting aerosols at this particular point.  I would also like the Minister, when she gets around to responding to this very long Second Stage, to offer a view on discriminating between protecting and protectionism.  The realities really are that if we want to protect our environment this may well have to mean that we fall back on the taxation of environmentally damaging products or put a stop on the import of environmentally damaging products.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been some criticism of the Bill inasmuch as it is proposed that it would only have an advisory or supervisory role governing the activities of public and local authorities.  I am sure there is a very good reason for this and it may well have to do with things like local autonomy.  I am sure it is something we will debate on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, I would like to say that I have some difficulty with that but there may well be a very good argument against it, to which I would be prepared to listen. I want to give an example of why that particular aspect of the legislation concerns me.  I have been investigating the position of, let us say, the area of water, the quality of water and the way in which <Col N="1188" /> local authorities deal with effluent, for instance, in the Dublin area.  I do not understand why we are not demanding that there will be tertiary stage treatment for all sewage effluent from every council and every local authority in the country. I just do not know why we do not do that. I am not saying this could be done under this Bill but under this Bill, again just quoting from memory, the authority will have control over effluent which has come into the waterways from the jurisdiction of local or public authorities, etc, and are responsible for them at that point.  I do not quite know what that means.  I hope it refers to the quality of the water coming from a local authority area or a local authority sewage treatment station into a waterway, a river, or a lake.  If it is found not to comply with the requirement what authority do the environmental protection agency have? Do they have authority over, let us say, semi-State companies which could also be in this area?  I would just like to have those matters teased out a bit.  As far as I know in terms of sewage treatment the only local authority in the country which has a tertiary stage treatment is in Cavan. This may not be the case but that is my understanding.  We have had over the years, a lot of difficulties arising from the lack of industrial and urban tertiary water treatment which has led to the putrification of rivers, waterways and lakes in many different parts of the country.  It is also significant that the second greatest culprit in fish kills in the 1988-89 period, as far as I can recall &mdash; I have not got the reference to hand &mdash; came from local authorities.  That point needs to be addressed at some stage.</P>
    <P>Secondary treatment from what I have read about it, only removes approximately 25 per cent of the phosphates. Anybody with a septic tank has vivid experience of the need to have a tertiary stage treatment.  Because of this lack of tertiary stage, the water retains substantial capacity to cause detrimental nutrient enrichment particularly in lakes.  That occurred in Lough Lein in Killarney and it occurred in Lough Ennell in the Mullingar area.  In both areas, steps <Col N="1189" /> have since been taken and certainly in Killamey they are doing an excellent job trying to clean up the lake.  Nevertheless, these problems have been created.  I want to know how we can address these under the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is also important to know that compared to other EC counties we have quite a good record.  It is not widely recognised and we do not very often give ourselves credit in this area.  I would like to put it on record that certainly, from information I got in the EC library, in terms of the volumes of waste delivered, for instance, for disposal at sea by member states Ireland has by far the best record.  That is something we should be proud of and it is also something we should protect.  I think this is what the Minister intends in bringing in this legislation.  That particular aspect of our Government &mdash; in the broadest sense &mdash; should be retained.</P>
    <P>Our objective must be to protect the environment, to create a positive and progressive economy.  In other words, the protection of the environment is something that should give a &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; to the economy rather than otherwise.  One thing about this Bill which gives me some difficulty is that I would want to be absolutely certain that it will be implemented and that the penalties will be implemented properly and severely.  I am not saying that in the context of hanging or flogging offenders.  It is simply that all over the private sector those people who do not pay their taxes are more competitive than the employers who do. People who do not pay their PRSI are more competitive than employers who do.  People who do not pay their VAT to the State are more competitive than employers who do.  In other words, at the moment there can very often be a premium for those who do not keep the law of the land.  The last thing I want to see happening here is good companies, good employers and concerned companies being made less competitive than the &ldquo;cowboys&rdquo; who will undoubtedly always be with us.</P>
    <P>I would certainly like a reassurance from the Minister that in that area we will have a control, a system of imposing <Col N="1190" /> penalties and monitoring, etc., that will work, so that we can have confidence in and, also, that it will be given the resources needed to do the job it has to do.  I wonder if it is all right to think that the payment of penalties will fund the agency.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that all fines are paid to the agency.  This is a very useful and practical way of dealing with things. I have no difficulty with that.  I just want to make sure that this will not mean that there will be a low level of resouces, particularly at the starting off point.  If we reach a situation where companies and people are concerned about the environment and keep all the regulations under this Bill, where then will the funding for the agency come from?</P>
    <P>There is also the question of whether or not the environmental impact assessment goes far enough.  Does it assess the risk factor, the externals down the line which will be created by the setting up of plant or any other proposed development, inasmuch as the second, down the line, impact on the environment, not perhaps the immediate impact, in some cases can have a beneficial impact?  I am not saying this is always negative because very often developments can have a beneficial down the line impact on the environment.  I would like to be clear about how the environmental impact assessment will operate.  Are we going to make that connection between benefit and risk?</P>
    <P>The danger about discussion on the Irish environment has, for a number of years, been left to a group of zealots.  I say that with some sense of conviction, left to people who feel that the environment is their area.  One of the great developments that have taken place in Irish politics over the last number of years is that the environment has become a matter of concern for all parties and for all groups.  That is important.  Since I first stood for election in 1982 I have always had it as a major issue in my election addresses.  I am not saying that in an &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; manner.  I have always found that politicians of all parties have had a serious interest in the environment but it has not found expression, it has not been <Col N="1191" /> articulated, and we have had to wait until now to find a response from Government, a comprehensive response, it must be said.  Nevertheless, it is a pity that we had to wait this long.  I would like to assure those people who feel that it is their area that it is not anybody's area.  It is everybody's responsibility, the responsibility of all parties and groups.  There are no oppositions on this one.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister will listen to our views, that he will address any proposed amendments and will iron out any difficulties with a view to making this stronger legislation when it leaves this House. I want to make another point in relation to that.  Some of these people who have made the environment their baby, as it were, have found themselves in a situation where they believe that what they say is right, that they are the resource person to make any statements on the environment.  I do not accept that point of view.  I do not accept that the so-called environmentalists know more about the environment than anybody else.  I have seen them make many mistakes.  I have no problem in saying that and I say it to them whenever I get the opportunity of saying it.</P>
    <P>I also want to say that it is the essence of life and living that there always needs to be an element of compromise.  It is a question of the balance of convenience, having the right balance.  That is what the agency should set out to do.  It does not mean that we can decide tomorrow moming to use recycled paper in Government offices.  We just could not afford to do that.  That is the reality at the moment. On the other hand, we also need to assess whether it is more energy-efficient to grow more trees to make more paper than it is to recycle existing paper.  We need to address these issues in a pragmatic way.  Views on the environment are being offered to us every day, many of which I feel are not beyond contradiction. We should listen to what people have to say, examine it, and not just accept proposals and viewpoints offered by people just because they present themselves as being the environmentalists.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> That comes to mind when one thinks of those who say you should never cut down a tree.  Trees are one of the most renewable energy resources at the moment.  Trees will grow more quickly in this country than in any other part of Europe.  We need to talk to these people and say, well, it depends on what you are cutting and on what you are sowing, and it depends on the balance.  Recently people were saying that burning firewood was damaging trees and the environment. The fact is that you can grow timber almost as quickly as you can burn it.</P>
    <P>It has been acknowledged by the OECD that the penalties will raise the revenue necessary to finance measures to protect the environment.  I would like to hear the Minister respond as to how that is going to work in our situation, how it will be policed to the extent of the money being directed back towards the agency and how she would see that whole process taking place.  It is covered in the Bill but I would like to hear the Minister's views. It nationalises some requirements about licences while leaving some control with the local authorities.  Other past legislation where only particular developments were covered will now, I suppose, be modified and changed in some way.</P>
    <P>It worries me that certain aspects have not been addressed.  It would appear that the whole concept of the danger of radon gas &mdash; it may be a separate issue to talk about at the moment &mdash; is a factor and is a problem and it does not appear to be covered by the Bill as it is at present.  I may be wrong about this but I wish to hear the Minister's viewpoint on the matter.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that at the end of the day decisions on the environment will be made for political reasons rather than for objective scientific reasons.  This is the reality and it is something we should accept.  The area of where we make decisions and how we make decisions needs to be addressed.  I want to talk in detail about some aspects of the Bill as we go along.  I wish to refer again to the problem created where in some countries in Europe protecting the environment has led to an element of protectionism <Col N="1193" /> in the economy, in other words, if, for instance, a country chooses to put a tax on non-refillable bottles is it protecting the environment or is it protectionism of the economy?  Have we addressed this issue?  Can the Environmental Protection Agency make recommendations that could lead to new legislation or the initiation of legislation?  Does it have that function in terms of the way it advises?  I realise it will give an annual report to the Minister and I will have something to say about that when dealing with the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the different types of environment impact of various industrial sectors, whether it be emissions into the air from the chemcial industry or from the iron and steel industry inasmuch as we would have for instance a smelter in this country, would this be covered by the Environmental Protection Agency?  If somebody seeks planning authority to set up a smelter, at what stage does the agency have an input into the granting of permission to go ahead?  How does it actually work?  Is it that the local authorities have been told beforehand that in certain circumstances permission has to be obtained from the agency or from somebody else or, is it just written down on a list of by-laws that have to be complied with by anybody seeking to go ahead with any kind of plant?  How do we see that happening?</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to section 4 which refers to the condition of waters after the entry of polluting waters within the meaning of the Local Government Act, 1977 and where that ties into the responsibility of the local authority.  I wish to make a number of comments on subsection (3) and the setting up of the agency.  It states the agency shall consist of a director general and four other directors. It seems a small number to me and I would like to know if that is a sufficiently large number to carry out the business.</P>
    <P>In terms of the legislation as it is framed, I have difficulty with regard to the sequence of the provisions.  I think the cart comes before the horse in a number of places.  Section 21 states that the director general shall be appointed <Col N="1194" /> by the Govenment.  We need to state at that point, &rdquo;subject to the following procedures&rdquo; or something on those lines. It then goes on to set out the way in which it can be done.  I welcome the areas and the interests represented on the committee. It makes interesting reading for us.</P>
    <P>On section 21 of the Bill there is a confusion in that it says the Minister can make a request under subsection (7) or (9).  I do not see any provision for a request under subsection (9). It is subsection (7) and only (7). I am also concerned that the Minister may appoint a person to be a member of the committee and that such person shall remain a member of the committee until such time as a selection by the committee pursuant to the request is made.  I have some difficulty about the Minister being able to make an appointment without putting a time constraint on the period of time. There is potential for interference there which we should not allow.  It is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister may, by order, amend subsection (2) which refers to the makeup of the committee.  The committee will consist of the Secretary to the Government, the Secretary to the Department of the Environment, the chairperson of An Taisce, the Managing Director of the IDA, General Secretary of ICTU and the Chief Executive of the Council for the Status of Women.  It is stated that the Minister may amend subsection (2) or is that subsection (2) of section 6?  That would appear to refer to those named people.  I am not sure what is intended by that and how it would be operated.</P>
    <P>In terms of the appointment of the director general I find it very confusing and I would like if the Minister could clarify the matter.  Subsection (8) states that except in the case of a reappointment etc. the Government shall not appoint a person to be the director general unless the person was among those or was the candidate selected by the committee pursuant to a request under subsection (7) in relation to that appointment.  It goes on to say that the Government shall <Col N="1195" /> appoint a person to be the director general who was among those or, as the case may be, was the candidate selected by the committee pursuant to a previous request in relation to that appointment.</P>
    <P>The second provision is in the event of the committee being unable to select a suitable candidate.  I do not understand how that is going to work.  It appears that this refers to a second request if the first one has failed.  In subsection (9) it refers at one stage to a request.  It states &ldquo;If the committee is unable to select any suitable candidate pursuant to a previous request&rdquo; and it then refers to &ldquo;a previous request&rdquo;.  There is a confusion there.  Perhaps it is logical but in terms of trying to understand the process it may well be that it is an attempt to cover all the problems that might arise.  Subsection (9) (b) (ii) states:</P>
    <P>the Minister may make a further such request.</P>
    <P>this again is in the event of no suitable candidate</P>
    <P>to the committee and the Government shall appoint to be Director General a person who was among the candidates or, as the case may be, was the candidate selected by the committee pursuant to that request or pursuant to another such request, made in relation to that appointment:</P>
    <P>In other words, it is either the first or second request made regarding the same appointment.  In that situation, does that lead to a full re-run of the appointment procedure, or do they just go back over and say.  &ldquo;We gave those names in the first time.  They did not seem to work. We will give another couple of names this time,&rdquo; or do they start again from scratch?  I think there is a genuine attempt here to cover the problems that might arise.  Perhaps I am misreading it.  I do not want to be profound about the thing. It is just there.  I feel, reading through it, that I am having difficulty making logic of it.</P>
    <P>I also feel that the section which says <Col N="1196" /> the Government may appoint the Director General should more correctly come later or at least should be tied into that in some other way.</P>
    <P>Subsection (15), on page 19, says that:</P>
    <P>The Director General may be removed from office by the Government if, in their opinion, he has become incapable through ill-health of effectively performing his duties, or for stated misbehaviour...</P>
    <P>I do not know what that means.  Coming from a teaching background, I know there were certain &ldquo;misbehaviours&rdquo; in which teachers were not permitted to join.  I do not know who is stating the misbehaviour.  Is this to be stated in the Schedule to the Bill?  Is this a list of particular misbehaviours, or is this a decision that is made by the agency at some stage afterwards?</P>
    <P>That reference runs right through it. That reference runs through it referring to the Deputy Director General and also in reference to the directors.  The change in language is interesting.  The Director General may be removed from office if in their opinion he or she has become incapable for stated misbehaviour. But the Deputy Director General has to go a step further.  He or she may be removed from office if he or she has become incapable through ill-health or if he or she has committed stated misbehaviour.  First of all, I have a language problem about committing behaviour.  That is just the syntax.  Then we come to the Advisory Committee. On page 25 of the Bill we read that the Minister may remove from office a member of the advisory committee if he has &ldquo;committed stated misbehaviour&rdquo;.  I feel we should not be over-prudish with this kind of thing.  I just want to know what we are talking about here.  It is simply that, no more.  Are we talking about sex?  Are we talking about bribery? What are the morals we are talking about here?  I would prefer to define or delete it.</P>

      <P>Section 22 (3) states:</P>
      <P>The Deputy Director General may, in addition to his remuneration as a director, be paid such additional remuneration (if any) as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may determine.</P>
      <P>Is this salary?  I am not sure what this refers to.  Is this person a salaried person and, if it is a salary, is this just simply allowing the person to be paid, or is it some sort of a premium?  I am not just sure.  Another part of the Bill goes into details about ensuring that the person is not paid more or less, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would prefer that we dealt with the appointment of directors before we dealt with the appointment of a Director General and a Deputy Director General.  I just feel it is going in the wrong order. That is just in terms of reading through it.  One reason why my attention was drawn to this is that we say the Deputy Director General will be appointed &ldquo;for such period as shall be specified in the appointment&rdquo;.  That has to be subject to Section 24 (8) (a) where it says that a director &ldquo;shall hold office for such a term (not exceeding five years) ...&rdquo;. Obviously, those matters seem to be reconciled somewhere in the legislation, that it would have to be subject to that.  The point I am making is that somebody could be a director and could hope to be reappointed as a director.  Let us say his or her term of office is going to finish in the next year and he or she is now being appointed Deputy Director General.  I do not believe it would be proper to appoint that person for five years on the assumption that he or she would be reappointed as a director at the end of the next year. <Col N="1198" /> I do not think it is a conflict, but the thing needs to be put together there.</P>
    <P>On section 26, I have some worries about the quorum for the meeting of the agency.  I have never seen a quorum of two before.  I am sure it does exist somewhere. Perhaps I have a dirty mind, but I feel it sets up problems.  A quorum of two should not be allowed.  I would prefer to be talking to myself &mdash; a quorum of one &mdash; particularly when it can be the Director General and the Deputy Director General.  To me, that is one person. In any job or any operation I know of, if it is the boss and the assistant boss, there is only one person at that meeting.  It is such a small group that I can see how we came up with the two.  It makes a lot of sense.  But I think the four should be five and the two should be three or something like that.</P>
    <P>Section 26 (4) (a) states:</P>
    <P>Where, owing to the illness of the Director General or a director, or for any other reason, a sufficient number of directors of the Agency is not available to enable the Agency effectively to perform its functions, the Minister may, as an interim measure, appoint from among the officers of the Minister who are established civil servants... one or more persons to be a director and, where necessary, one to be a Deputy Director General.</P>
    <P>I can see the point of having to fill the directorships but I would feel that the position of Deputy Director General should be on the recommendation of the committee.  It would not create a huge problem.  Perhaps that does not fit in with the earlier method of appointment, in the sense that there must be an appointment from within the directors, but I feel that that is too open there.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to what Senator McKenna said about education and it was very much in line with what I was saying myself.  I want to make a few points here. The Minister and I came from a generation of people who went to school and left school, I would venture to say, with knowing the names of birds and trees and without being able to identify trees, <Col N="1199" /> leaves, barks and that kind of thing.  We came through a lost environmental generation in terms of nature study and the environment.  The generation before us knew the names, in Irish and English, of every tree, of every leaf, of every bird &mdash; knew all about them.  When I was in primary school in the sixties, it began: nature study had in a sense become less important.  Perhaps it was because there was no threat to the environment then.</P>
    <P>I believe strongly &mdash; and I am not plugging my own profession &mdash; that the new awareness, the re-awakening of an awareness of the environment, began in 1972.  I was a teacher in the classroom at that time.  I, myself, had to re-learn about nature.  The generation ahead of me, the generation of my parents, etc., had learned, as part of their nature study at that time, all about the environment in a very practical and real way.  My generation did not and those of us who became teachers had to re-learn it.  We had to become retrained in understanding the environment.  I must say I have enjoyed educating myself about the environment over the last 20 years.</P>
    <P>The introduction of environmental studies in the primary school curriculum in 1972 has created a major impact. Young children nowadays, primary school children in the sixties and seventies, and now post-primary and third level people, began with an awareness of the environment which was second to none.  I can see one development as a result of that.</P>
    <P>I know a person who is a schools inspector at the moment.  I knew that person as a school pupil and I know that, as a school pupil, that young person put considerable pressure on his or her teachers in the area of the environment just by wanting to know more.  He generated an enthusiasm that had a very positive effect and there was a great learning effect and an awareness of the environment.</P>
    <P>Young people nowadays have a great awareness of the environment.  There were some horrendous films of the war on television over the past couple of <Col N="1200" /> weeks, but the memory that will live for most people will not be of the truck going across the bridge and the bomb landing behind it, but it will be the image of the oil-soaked cormorant pulled out of the water by the environmental protectors or the sight of the birds not able to get out of the water or into the water.  Those are the images at which people cringed. Perhaps it is a reflection on our society but it is true.  I was in a room with about 15 people when the news came through of a number of things that happened that day.  It showed direct hits on buildings, but people did not blink.  The next thing it showed this little bird in the water that was covered in oil, not able to move, and everybody was aghast at it.  In a way it is a reflection on our society, but nevertheless people care about the environment and nature.</P>
    <P>Why did I go into all that?  I went into it because section 27, on the functions of the agency states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may prescribe for the purposes of subsection (6) &mdash; (a) organisations which in his opinion are representative of persons whose professions or occupations relating to environmental protection etc....</P>
    <P>I am not going down all the way through it; but it does say at paragraph (d):</P>
    <P>...organisations which in his opinion are concerned with the promotion in relation to the community of social, economic or general interests.</P>
    <P>It goes on in paragraph (e):</P>
    <P>organisations which in his opinion are representative of persons concerned with environmental education or research.</P>
    <P>I feel that one of the defects in this Bill is the lack of representation from the actual education area.  I am speaking as an educationlist, but I believe that it is very important.  I listened to what Senator McKenna &mdash; a teacher himself &mdash; said about a pack for schools.  It is a very valid thing to say, except that I just turn off when I hear that the answer to every problem in society, whether it be <Col N="1201" /> AIDS or drugs or litter or delinquency or whatever, is to get it right at school.  That is not going to happen.  We would not have this legislation here before us today if the Minister did not agree with me on that point.  But we do have to promote environmental studies, we have to promote that in a way that will work.  It is all right to say set up a pack for schools. There is a lot of merit in that and I do not object to it.  I think many teachers would welcome it &mdash; packs for schools and any other resources in order to raise the consciousness and awareness of the environment. But all I would say is that there is a lack of representation in that area.  I believe we need to look at the role of education, that is, the education service as it stands at the moment in this general area.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the parliamentary draftsman who came up with the word &ldquo;effluxion&rdquo; of time.  It is a lovely use of the language.  Section 28, on the functions of the advisory committee, says that in that area, without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the advisory committee may make recommendation to the agency in relation to, and it goes down through paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) &mdash; all of them very positive and progressive.  I support the intention, but I think there should be another element added, and that is the one I was just talking about, the environmental education.  I think it just needs to be brought into the main stream.  It is different from the other demands that are made on the education service to solve the problems of society in this way. Environmental studies is on the curriculum at the moment.  It is there; it is a matter of developing it and giving it direction.  It is something that teachers are extraordinarily keen on, to develop an awareness of the environment.  There is hardly an area in the country where the local school, with the parents and community and children, have not done a clean-up of some section of the river or of the local park and so on.  There is an awareness there and this is a good opportunity to push that forward.</P>
    <P>On section 31 (2) I am not quite clear <Col N="1202" /> on the part in parenthesis &ldquo;(other than those relating to tenure).&rdquo;  This is the section that deals with the conditions relating to transfer of staff.  I am delighted the rules of the trade unions are recognised there and also recognised throughout the Bill.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the unions are close to it. They have taken a very keen interest in it and have had long discussions with the Department on various aspects of this legislation as it has been going along and have made various contributions to it.  I also recognise the fact that 18 months ago in this Chamber we had a very full discussion on a document produced by the Union of Public and Technical Civil Servants on the whole area of the environment. I do not want to go into those areas except to say that I want to give them recognition.  I welcome the recognition that is there.  I am not quite clear on what is meant by &ldquo;other than those relating to tenure&rdquo;&mdash; in other words, what we are saying there in subsection (2):</P>
    <P>Save in accordance with a collective agreement a person referred to in subsection (1) shall not, while in the employment of the Agency, receive a lesser scale of pay or be made subject to less than official terms and conditions of service ... than the scale of pay to which he was entitled and terms and conditions of service (other than those relating to tenure)...</P>
    <P>Maybe this just refers to tenure within the Agency &mdash; in other words that the person could be moved back to his or her Department.  If it is that, I would ask it to be made a little bit clearer.  If it is there I would like to have it explained to me.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a few other points. I am raising issues which I would prefer to raise now rather than wait until Committee Stage.  I will just bring them to the attention of the Minister and the Department. Section 37 is vitally important as far as I am concerned, the whole question of the disclosure of interests.  To me this is very positive.  Indeed, we on the Independent benches &mdash; and I think the Minister's party as well &mdash; have strong views <Col N="1203" /> about the whole area of the disclosure of interests for people in public life in general.  I certainly feel that anybody elected to public life should make a full and comprehensive disclosure of interests so that there is no doubt about them.  I am not saying that they should be available to every Tom, Dick or Harry, but I certainly feel that there should be somewhere where people would make a disclosure and that perhaps they should be retained by an honest broker.</P>
    <P>What we are doing here is that we are protecting the work of the agency by demanding that certain requirements be implemented &mdash; for instance, that a person &ldquo;shall disclose to the agency committee or consultative group, as the case may be, the nature of his interests in advance of any consideration of the matter&rdquo; and that &ldquo;he shall neither influence nor seek to influence a decision in relation to the matter.&rdquo;  I think that is a most important subsection because it covers a multitude.  That means whether inside or outside the committee rooms or the meeting place, that this is not allowed.  That the person should take no part in any consideration of the matter gives me just a little bit of worry, and I will tell you the reason.  Normally in situations like that the person would be required to absent himself or herself from the deliberations.  &ldquo;He shall take no part&rdquo; is just open to a different interpretation. If somebody is sitting in the room he or she may not be physically taking part in the discussion but it could certainly create a difficulty if people were not allowed to speak freely.  We should tighten that up a little and require a person to absent himself or herself as appropriate.  I am not being simplistic about it.  I am making the general point at the moment and I will come back again to it.  What I am not clear about is this.  Perhaps I missed it in my reading of the section.  This is not allowed and, therefore, I am to assume that it is a penalty for a person to go ahead, that it would be a penalty to be in contravention of that section, that nondisclosure could mean that a person could be penalised.  How does that process take <Col N="1204" /> place?  Is that clarified in the legislation? How would we act against the director who would fail to comply with section 37?</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) states:</P>
    <P>Where a disclosure is made to the Agency, a committee or consultant group pursuant to subsection (1), particulars of the disclosure shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting concerned and for so long as the matter to which the disclosure relates is being considered by the meeting, the person by whom the disclosure is made shall not be counted in the quorum of the meeting.</P>
    <P>That is where I think we should make the change.  I think that the person to whom the disclosure relates should absent himself or herself from the meeting.  That is the neatest way of dealing with that and that that is the place to deal with it.  I have made the general points I wanted to make on the Bill.  I am conscious of time and that we will have another opportunity of going through the Bill to deal with all those areas.  In relation to section 50, I was flabbergasted to hear on the Order of Business today one of the Government Senators asking how he might raise the question of a paper laid before the House.  I have been expending almost my total energy here at times on certain legislation quite simply to stop that happening, to put an end to the difficulty that Senator McGowan was having today of not being able to deal with an issue, one of the many papers laid before the House.  I am raising that in the context of section 50 (1) which states:</P>
    <P>As soon as may be after the end of each financial year, but not later than six months thereafter, the Agency shall cause a report on the performance of its functions during that year to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I feel that that does not go far enough. There are three processes really.  There is the process of laying a paper before the Oireachtas.  There is the negative process <Col N="1205" /> of laying a proposal, a schedule or a ministerial order before the Houses of the Oireachtas and, provided it is not annulled, declared void, or rejected within a period of so many sitting days, then it becomes law, or variations of that &mdash; it becomes law and is law until such time as it is rejected.  But I have always gone for the positive one.  I feel that, particularly in the early years of this Bill, rather than having it just laid before the Houses which is, in polite language, saying dumped in the Library, it should be presented to the Minister who would present it to each House of the Oireachtas for adoption, discussion or whatever.  I do not want to be too strong on that, but I feel that this should be addressed at this stage and I ask that it be done.</P>
    <P>On the question of the functions of the agency, the promotion and co-ordination of environmental research &mdash; that is section 51 (1) (d) &mdash; that should also include environmental awareness, environmental studies and environmental education.  That should be tied into that area.  It is easy enough to go on through the Bill and to raise things here and there. I presume we will have a lot of time on Committee Stage of the Bill.  Somebody had to write this legislation, consisting of 80 pages or so.  In general terms, there are exclusions in it with which I do not agree.  There is the question of sewage to which I referred, the question of the local government matter, the question of certain gases like radon gases, which I understand is probably in the radiation section rather than in this section.  Those are minor things.  I welcome this legislation. It is very easy for anybody to stand up and find flaws here and there.  I relate to those points simply on the basis that they are issues I will be raising on Committee Stage and perhaps tabling amendments. But I would prefer if the Minister would take these points on board, look at some of the points I have made and perhaps consider them and come back on them.</P>
    <P>It is too easy to make a long speech on the environment at this stage.  I have confined myself as far as possible to the Bill and just made a few general points. <Col N="1206" /> At the end of the day we will probably get down to more detail when we come to talk about the other aspects of the legislation.  I congratulate the Minister &mdash; I am not saying this in any patronising way &mdash; and the officials in the Department who put together this fine legislation which will certainly point the direction in which we all want to go. Whatever difference of opinon we might have on minor aspects of the legislation as we go along, this is positive, it is progressive, it is the way forward.  It is a feather in the hat of the Department of the Environment, a Department who take a lot of hammering at different times.  I certainly welcome the legislation and I still welcome the further and more detailed discussions as we go along.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could just continue on the theme which Senator O'Toole just ended his contribution by also saying that his legislation is to be welcomed and, indeed, is progressive.  It is also rather sad that we need legislation of this nature.  I could not but reflect on the attitude of our founding fathers in the early part of the century that, if a proposal were to come from an embyronic environmental lobby, if there were such an animal in existence at that time, for legislation as far-reaching as this, what the reaction would have been.  Perhaps it would have been that our country was environmentally pure, that our waters and our air did not need the protection of legislation to ensure that they remained so.  However, we are a rather filthy species, <i>homo sapiens</i>, according to a survey in the current edition of the <i>OECD Observer</i>&mdash; this is rather timely foi Senators on all sides of the House &mdash; which devotes most of its issue to the environment.  I do not intend to quote at any great length from it other than one of the two stark statistics for the record of the House that &ldquo;the OECD countries are still responsible for 45% of world CO2 emissions, 40% of SOx emissions and 50% of NOx emissions, all related to human activity&rdquo;.  We produce &ldquo;60% of the world's industrial waste&rdquo;.  The report continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1207" /> In the OECD area, 330 million people live in areas that are still not served by water treatment stations, and 130 million are subjected to unacceptable levels of noise.</P>
    <P>These are two areas that are covered quite comprehensively in this legislation. To date, action has been concentrated on a limited number of traditional pollutants. Yet I was astonished to read that about 100,000 chemical compounds are in current commercial use and several thousand new chemicals are manufactured and marketed each year.</P>
    <P>It is in the context of those type of frightening statistics that this legislation has been nurtured, encouraged and brought before the House.  I would like to compliment the Minister personally, apart from her officials in the Department of the Environment, for having the foresight and the commitment to ensure that this legislation was not left to rot in some dusty cupboard somewhere in the Custom House for a further day or a further era, but that it has now been brought before this House and, hopefully, will become law.</P>
    <P>The area of interest to me, coming from County Leitrim, is the impact of forestry and unplanned afforestation on the environment and the functions of the proposed agency to limit and reduce the dangers inherent in unplanned afforestation. It is a matter of fact that planning is not required for forestry plantations in this country, but I should put on record that there is in existence a number of checks and balances operated by the local authorities and more especially by the Department of Energy in this area.  However, I am not so sure that, even with these checks and balances, the damage which is being done to our environment does not need the force of this legislation.  While there is no mention of unplanned afforestation under section 70 one would hope that this is an area that may be taken on board.  The only reference to another Minister other than the Minister for the Environment is to the <Col N="1208" /> Minister for the Marine.  There are certain licences and regulations which the Minister for the Marine can make in section 70 under environmental approval.  I was a little disappointed that the Department or Minister for Energy is not mentioned. Perhaps the legislation does not require it but, for the record, unplanned afforestation comes under the aegis of the Department of Energy.</P>
    <P>The environmental impact of forestry on our lakes and rivers cannot be underestimated. The adverse effects of forestry on fresh waters are well documented in Europe and North America.  Extensive research has linked coniferous forestry to a reduction in numbers or a total loss of salmon and trout stocks, changes in the fly life of rivers and lakes both in terms of the range of species and actual numbers present, and at higher levels there are effects on birds and amphibians.  I come from Drumshanbo and behind it there is a mountain called Slieve Anierin, the Mountain of Iron, which has been planted progressively since I was a small boy.  As a small boy, I remember scrambling along the rocks and the hillside as I made my way close to the top of the mountain which is about 1,900 feet above sea level.  It is rather unique in that there is a lake at the top of the mountain. Although I was not the greatest fisherman in the world, I have very happy memories of attempting to catch brown mountain trout.  The perceived wisdom was that if you tickled them under their stomach they would roll over and all you had to do was to pick them out.  The reality was different.  I am sad to report to the House that as a result of extensive afforestation in that area many of these small streams are now heavily polluted and there is a noticeable absence of the small brown trout which ultimately made its way down through the tributaries into Lough Allen and into the Shannon waterway. They provided sport for coarse fishermen and women and a staple diet in my part of the country.  I raise the aspect of the impact that man can have on our environment in the context of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Forestry is adversely affected by acid <Col N="1209" /> rain.  There are now indications that trees may be involved in the acidification of fresh waters.  Evaporation of water from the forest canopy concentrates these pollutants and during periods of heavy rainfall they make their way to our rivers and lakes as acids capable of affecting the whole ecology.  I wish it were not so but unfortunately the environment in which I live tends to be rather damp &mdash; not something we like to say too much about. I am sure many parts of Ireland do not like to emphasise that they have more than the average rainfall.  In fact, we have all gone to considerable lengths down the years to hide the fact.  My late father often referred to rain as not being rain at all but a slight sensation of dampness. The reality is that we get a lot of rain perhaps because of the fact that we have the last mountain range before the central plain and when the rain clouds hit us we tend to get more rain.  That has an effect on the ecological balance.  The release of acids from the litter of needles that proliferate in plantations of Sitka spruce, the super tree, the cash crop, may also contribute to the acidification process.  While there are many other theories, most evidence to date supports those I have just described.</P>
    <P>In a report, &ldquo;Environmentally Friendly Forestry?&rdquo; in the autumn, 1990 edition of <i>The Badger</i> in relation to the small streams I referred to earlier, the writer of the article says: if these streams, which often appear to be no more than small drains, are destroyed then we simply will not have stocks of wild salmon and trout in our rivers and lakes.  A book by Steve Tomkins called <i>Forestry in Crisis: The Battle for the Hills</i> which was published in 1989 and draws substantially on statistical research in the United Kingdom and especially on the Scottish experience so not all of Mr. Tomkins' argument would be relevant to Ireland.  Nonetheless he makes some telling points, for example, that the process of afforestation comes as a shattering intrusion into a semi-natural environment.</P>
    <P>Unenclosed land is first fenced, itself a violation of open landscapes that are <Col N="1210" /> cherished for their atmosphere of freedom, the site may then be ploughed and drained with forestry ploughs that can cut to a depth of two to three feet.  He says that these trees when they are planted may be fertilised or sprayed with insecticide from the air before they are clear felled and replanted with similar crops. Professor Holmes in a report in 1979 stated:</P>
    <P>In establishing forests and bare uplands it is hard to imagine a more dramatic change in the ecological conditions including the soil, the flora, the fauna and not least the introduction of trees for the first time in centuries.</P>
    <P>Such is the devastation that can be caused by unplanned afforestation.  The change in animal life is dramatic and some of the open country birds disappear at once, with others lingering for just a few years. Particularly worrying is the loss of open ground predatory birds caused by blanket afforestation.  Wet ground vegetation tends to dry out through a lowering of the water table.  Many plant species have declined in abundance through afforestation and wet ground species have been particularly adversely affected.</P>
    <P>These dire consequences are seen in countries where unplanned and massive cheap afforestation, particularly that of the Sitka spruce, has been evidenced. What is of particular concern, as I said earlier, is the effect it would have on fish life in my own part of the country where there is an increased concentration on both public and private forestry.  When I say my own part of the country I include the counties of Leitrim, Cavan, Roscommon, Sligo, south Donegal and north Mayo.  Since the first of the heavy plantations in 1988 the Government have been particularly conscious of their obligations in this regard.  I mentioned earlier about the Department of Energy who monitor closely all these particular&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>That Seanad Éireann, noting with concern the increasing threats to the natural environment posed by chemicals and poisonous compounds used in agriculture, and while welcoming the scheme of grants to assist farmers in carrying out pollution control work, calls on the Minister for Agriculture to introduce more stringent regulations to control the use of pesticides and to ban the use of strychnine to ensure human safety and the protection of wildlife.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have fairly strong views on this subject.  It is important to <Col N="1212" /> arrive at a fair balance.  There are different interests at stake and I totally understand those who are concerned about foxes and different species of wildlife but it is also important for the farmer to eradicate dangerous animals like foxes.  I have seen young lambs killed by foxes.  There is a problem for the farming community: how to accept the terms of the motion before the House and at the same time survive economically on a farm.</P>
      <P>Not long ago in Donegal there was a serious problem in relation to exploratory mining tests for uranium.  We had all kinds of experts telling us what we could and could not do.  One fellow who described himself as a doctor had a beard and a title.  We established later that he had been drawing the dole for 30 years in England and had few if any qualifications. I question those people who put themselves forward as experts and hold extreme views on any subject.  If we wanted to preserve our natural beauty we would never use fertilisers, pesticides or sprays.  We would not use anything at all. We would all be naked.</P>

I do not know what the answer is but perhaps the Minister would indicate his thinking on this.  The Minister comes from a farming background and knows both sides of the argument.  His concern for the environment would be as great as that of any Member of the House.  I hope that we reach a satisfactory conclusion and that the Minister responds in such a way that farmers will believe they are not being got at again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the main thrust of this motion but I have reservations about tighter controls on the use of certain chemical pesticides.  Presumably this would extend to fungicides and other items also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1213" /> I support without qualification a total ban on the use of strychnine.  It is dangerous to human life and a very severe method of eradicating vermin, foxes or dogs.  Strychnine was the customary way of dealing with sheep-worrying dogs.  I have seen it used and unless extreme caution is taken in its application it can be highly dangerous to human beings. The smallest particle &mdash; any medical person present could vouch for this &mdash; of strychnine even under the nails would have a lethal effect.  On those grounds alone it should be banned.  It causes violent death to any unfortunate creature, human or animal, who consumes it.</P>
    <P>Pesticides, weedkillers and fungicides all have a place to play in progressive agriculture.  For example, over the years the proper application of fertilisers and pesticides have ensured good crops with the minimum amount of waste in the form of weeds, dirt and so on.  We must be careful about the precise wording of this resolution.  When we advocate more stringent regulations to control the use of pesticides we must question if it is right that enlightened, well-informed persons will be restricted in their use of certain pesticides.  In many instances people are capable of safely using different pesticides, weedkillers and fungicides and this is one area where I have reservations about the motion.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the famous famine 140 years ago was caused because fungicides to control potato blight were not available. Half the population died as a result. There are many instances where production could be increased with the effective use of different chemicals.  There is nothing wrong with using these various products.  It is the abuse and misuse of them that cause the problems.  For example, there are many medicines available in the farming sector which people are restricted from getting even though they are essentially harmless if used carefully. I know that one must legislate for all people but competent people should not be precluded from having many of these products available to them under certain conditions.  Take MCA, for example, which is used for spraying <Col N="1214" /> rushes.  People use this product every day and get excellent results.  There are no side effects or difficulties with it.  There is no danger to health.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier today about the environment and the danger of having an oversupply of chemicals in circulation but we must be careful not to go too far in the other direction and limit or make unavailable products which are essential if we are to produce crops.  For instance, it would be totally and utterly uneconomical for farmers to avoid using all forms of chemicals, fertilisers, pesticides, weedkillers, fungicides and so on. Organic farming is costly but if people are prepared to bear the cost then that is fine.  However, on a commercial basis it is essential that these various products are made available.  I would like to know what people have in mind when they talk about stringent controls.  Perhaps the Minister &mdash; whom I should have welcomed to this House in my opening remarks &mdash; will tell us about that.</P>
    <P>Strychnine should be taken off the market; it should not, under any circumstances, be made available to anybody. As far as many other products are concerned, exaggerated claims have been made about their side effects.  Apart from cigarette smoking, there is medical evidence to substantiate the point that cancer and other major illnesses are not caused by the fumes or are the side effects of these products.  There is a totally wrong belief &mdash; it is damaging to agriculture &mdash; that the use of fertilisers, pesticides, weed killers and fungicides has increased the incidence of cancer dramatically.  That is not the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Hourigan for giving me five minutes of his time.  This is a complex motion.  There are three key issues and they could have been debated separately.  The first issue relates to the increasing threat to the natural environment posed by chemicals and poisonous compounds used in agriculture. Farmers are judicious in their use of chemicals and poisonous compounds and the weather dictates when they <Col N="1215" /> should be used.  If you take the compounds used on cereals, alphidicides, a balance must be found and it is when we have inclement weather conditions during the summer months that the problem arises.  Sprays should not be used in mid-summer but if nature decides otherwise and if there is indiscriminate use by the operator the bumble bee will be at risk.  Autumn is the prime time for such spraying.  The slug pellet does not cause a problem.  The snail obviously eats it and that is that.  A small farmer with a low income can hardly afford to pay £3, £4 or £5 per acre for those compounds.  Specialist advice is needed and the farmer should be told when he should spray.  We would not then have indiscriminate use of sprays.</P>
      <P>Looking at the budget figures in relation to Teagasc, £1.25 million was allocated but farmers and farming organisations have talked about a £0.5 million shortfall.  I know the Minister said that £0.5 million may be made up later but the service has disimproved.  We have heard over and over again that the small farmer cannot afford to pay.  At the end of the day we are talking about specialist advice and education being given to farmers.</P>
      <P>To move on to the second point &mdash; pollution control and grant assistance &mdash; with the depression in farm incomes obviously there is great need for grant assistance.  We know that 60 per cent of farmers have incomes under £5,000. Current grants fall behind actual costings. Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> there is agreement for them to be index-linked and we would welcome that.  There are problems for farmers in times of shrinking incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that since 1987 £300 million has been invested by farmers on pollution control measures.  That means 30,000 farmers have carried out works which have resulted in a reduction in the level of agricultural pollution.  The position with regard to fish kills has improved.  Farmers are the first to spend <Col N="1216" /> when they have good incomes.  In 1987-89 when they had reasonable incomes they invested in pollution control measures and borrowings increased.  Half of the work has been done.  However, with the collapse in incomes now farmers cannot afford to do that work.  When you go to the bank looking for an overdraft or to borrow money you are asked what sort of return you will have on your investment.  For pollution control, the return is long term.  Farmers are as interested as the rest of consumers in a fresh food, clean environment policy. They are just as interested in preserving the environment.  I do not particularly want them to be solely regarded as &ldquo;custodians of the environment&rdquo; as seems to be the case with the MacSharry proposals. They have always seen themselves in that role but they must have a reasonable income to enable them to carry it out.  If we want a clean, unpolluted environment we must grant aid them.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to refer to the use of strychnine I welcome the input from the Irish Wildlife Conservancy whose spokesperson yesterday spoke so passionately about the rate of kite deaths as a result of their feeding on a poisoned sheep carcase.  I support the spirit of the motion but at the end of the day if we want a clean environment we must pay for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister this evening.  He is a very loyal attender in this House and it is nice to see him again.  The Progressive Democrats will support this motion for one reason and that is in relation to the sentiments about strychnine, the need to ban it and thereby ensure human safety and remove the threat that it obviously poses to wildlife. However, I have serious reservations about other aspects of the motion.  It seems to me rather a hotch-potch in some respects in that it mixes up several items which are not particularly well-related to one another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards poisonous compounds used in agriculture, I know of very many but they are all naturally occurring ones. <Col N="1217" /> Those of you who have partaken of a good meal in the restaurant have probably consumed a good deal of poison during the course of that meal.  You may have had some salt which is a poison, you may have even gone to the bar and had some alcohol which is also poison and you may have had a cigarette which in itself is a third poison.  Poisons are all around us.  They do not just relate to agriculture.  Quite innocuous substances are poisonous if taken in sufficient volume.  That is the point: it is the dose that counts.  We put chlorine in our water and that is regarded as being desirable from the point of view of the general well-being of the community but chlorine is a poison also.  I would not like it to be commonly assumed that there is indiscriminate use of poisonous chemicals or compounds in agriculture.  Pesticides are certainly in use but the Minister knows from the workers in his own Department that there are very rigorous controls on the development and sale of those compounds and that they play a very central role in the economic well-being of the industry.  That is not to say that one would not be very conscious of the environmental aspects of the use of such compounds and of the requirement that they should be monitored very carefully.  I do not like the linking of the matter of pesticides control with the matter of strychnine. These are two completely different things and I do not really understand the linking of pesticides with a scheme for the grants for farmyard pollution.  That seems to me to be a separate issue.</P>
    <P>One of the most notorious chemicals to have been developed this century was DDT.  It was a very pernicious and a very dangerous chemical, considering what it did to wildlife.  It worked up through the food chain and we all know what happened to eagles, to peregrine falcons and so on as a result of DDT.  It had more widespread side effects than that.  Of course, it came to a head when Rachel Carson wrote her famous book <i>The Silent Spring.</i>  It must also be said that despite all of these drawbacks DDT was probably responsible for saving many <Col N="1218" /> millions of lives in Africa by controlling locusts and so on, so there is a balance of advantage and society has to ask itself where the balance of advantage lies.  The balance of advantage from a comfortable western middle class position is totally different from the position of somebody starving in an African desert.  I think this is sometimes lost sight of.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous challenge facing us in relation to feeding the world.  We cannot for a moment defend the sort of position that we have in the EC where we have huge surpluses and significant costs involved in their maintenance.  I have very serious ethical difficulties about a situation where we can spend millions of pounds per day on waging war and, on the other hand, we do not seem to be able to devote resources to disposing of that food to those who are most in need of it.  That is not to say that something should not be done about it.</P>
    <P>On the question of pesticides, I share the view which has been expressed by many Members in the House that they are essential to this task of trying to feed the world.  The population of the world is going to reach 8.2 billion, and double itself by the year 2025.  We are faced with an enormous task in feeding the world. Certainly we have problems in the Community. It is a question of resources; a question of relocating the mountain which is there.  On a global basis there is no mountain.  I think it is quite significant, and Professor Raftery referred to this last week, that Norman Borlang who was the person who more or less created the Green Revolution was the person who bred the dwarf wheats and fed the Indian sub-continent and other parts of the world also.  As a result, he won the Nobel Peace Prize, not a Science Prize, for his work.  He has said that he believes it is the judicious use of agricultural chemicals, especially chemical fertilisers, which is necessary to produce the food needed to feed today's population of 5.3 billion and to feed that growing population into the future.  He said he wanted to stress that agricultural chemicals and fertilisers are like medicines; when used appropriately they are beneficial but when used without <Col N="1219" /> proper caution they can be deadly.  That is the essence of the problem.  It is to do with how these substances are used rather than the nature of the substances in themselves.</P>
    <P>In relation to naturally occurring substances, very many of them are toxic in their own right.  I know that there is a unit in the Department which monitors agrichemicals and one of its chief concerns is the accumulation of the toxicological data relating to pesticides and its perusal.  I sometimes wonder why data that is acceptable in other European countries, such as Germany where they have very rigorous standards in relation to agricultural pesticides, have to be presented in this country in a different form and somebody has, as he told me on one occasion, to come in with 50 lb. or maybe 5 cwt. of literature to satisfy the requirements.  We have got to the point where analytical procedures can detect one part per billion of a substance within a pesticide, within a chemical, or within an agrichemical.  As somebody said, that is like trying to find one Chinaman.</P>
    <P>We focus very heavily on that aspect and that is not to say that environmental protection is not important.  Of course it is.  It is something we must all subscribe to.  It is essential to the development of our agricultural economy that we be able to stand over the products we sell on the world market as being of superior quality, produced on an island which is perceived to be one that is environmentally friendly.  The problem about all these things is that we leave out the efficacy factor.  We do not care enough about how a substance is used at ground level and what it does to the crop.  We are obsessed with the science of analysing what is in the substance without paying a great deal of attention to what the thing actually does.</P>
    <P>In relation to the strychnine problem, it is only a matter of time before there is a human tragedy and a child or an adult &mdash; more likely a child &mdash; comes in contact with the substance and I understand that it is far more lethal to a human than it is <Col N="1220" /> to a dog.  It would require a much greater dose to kill a dog than it does to kill a human, but I would stand corrected on that.  Of course, sheep farmers have an immense problem.  I come from an area around the Curragh where there is devastation and you only have to see what dogs can do to a flock of sheep to want to do something very serious in retaliation. However, I do not think that excuses people who go around throwing meat over garden walls and killing dogs.  We had a situation like that locally not so long ago.  I do not think it is open to sheep farmers, whatever the provocation, to take the law into their own hands.</P>
    <P>Strychnine is a totally indiscriminate killer.  Apart from killing foxes and grey crows, it will kill other things.  I notice from <i>The Irish Times</i> of today's date that the Irish Wildbird Conservancy has called for restrictions on the use of poisons on baited carcasses because they believe that two red kites died from feeding on such carcasses.  I also note that the IFA last night strongly attacked any move to ban such poisons, calling it a retrograde step. I have to say quite explicitly to the IFA that I do not think that that is acceptable. I think that a grave responsibility exists in relation to human health and in relation to endangered species.  I also have information from the International Council for Bird Preservation which says that the substantial use of strychnine, allegedly for pest control, which is not done in accordance with the regulations, does huge damage.  Ireland is the only EC country to permit the sale of the substance.  It cites the example of the buzzard which comes our way occasionally and is nearly always poisoned by strychnine.</P>
    <P>I also note that the Taoiseach may wish to re-establish the sea eagle on Irish-vickillane, so if we were to facilitate the Taoiseach so much the better.  Let us try to facilitate the Taoiseach.  I do think that a balance is required in relation to the whole question of pesticides and their use in agriculture.  I think it was Swift who said that the man who could make two blades of grass grow where one previously grew was worth more than the <Col N="1221" /> whole band of us in here.  That is still the position.  Despite all the problems which we have within the European Community and despite the food mountains, we are faced with having to feed a world which is going to demand more and more food in the future.  I think the position which we take from comfortable dinner tables in middle class houses may not be the position that the world which is starving requires of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share my time with Senator Ross and with Senator Norris if that is all right.</P>
      <P>I welcome the motion.  It is a pleasant change that I am in agreement with everything that is on it.  I do not know whether that should be worrying for me or for Fianna Fáil, but that is the way it is.  I believe that there is a great need for more stringent regulations in relation to the control of pesticides.  Pesticides are a threat under two broad headings.  First of all, they present a threat to the environment and, secondly, a threat to human health.  In relation to the threat to the environment, the use of pesticides gives rise to the generation and production of pests which are themselves resistent to the pesticides; they give rise to the necessity to use larger doses of the pesticides to ensure that the pests are killed.  There are, of course, the well-documented adverse affects of DDT residue in the carcases of animals giving rise to the problems with wild birds, such as hawks and so on, that Senator Dardis has already mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report was referred to in the United Kingdom last October and great concern expressed about the level of pesticides in drinking water which was consumed by the public in Britain.  Those are some of the environmental problems in relation to human health.  I think it should be put on record that the World Health Organisation estimates that approximately 10,000 people are poisoned each year from the use of pesticides.  That takes place for the most part in the Third World.  But of course some deaths have also taken place in this country.  There are well documented cases of accidental <Col N="1222" /> poisoning due to the use of paraquat. Quite a lot of effort went into trying to diminish the risk of that.  There is also the matter of what is not known &mdash; the area of doubt.  American research, for example, suggests that farmers exposed to the weed killer 24D for more than 20 days per year are six times more likely to suffer from certain forms of cancer. Alden, for example, is concentrated in the milk of mothers who are feeding their babies because of the way it is metabolised. That should be a matter for concern.</P>
    <P>All of us are going around with a certain amount of DDT in our bodies; all of us would have a certain amount of DDT deposited in our fat.  It depends on the amount of fat that we have in use, of course, and on our exposure to DDT. That is the reality.  I cannot say that it does any great harm.  I cannot say with certainty that the opposite is not the case either.  The problem with these pesticides is the question of toxicity and there you are into an area of uncertainty.  How do you extrapolate from experiments carried out on laboratory animals to situations involving humans?  Do you do it on the basis of their body weight?  Do you do it on the basis of their surface area? Do you do it on the basis of a whole range of differing indices of metabolic size and so on?  Is there any certainty that the studies which are carried out on experimental animals are relevant to humans? There is certainly well-documented evidence that some compounds are metabolised differently in laboratory and in experimental animals compared to in humans.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis already alluded to the fact that strychnine was metabolised differently in humans and in dogs.  We do not know what effects small amounts of these compounds which are consumed over a long period of time will have on people.  We do not know what their effects will be on various multifactoral disorders &mdash; those diseases which arise from a series of differing factors coming together.  Here is another factor fed into the equation.</P>
    <P>We do not know either what their <Col N="1223" /> effects might be on the manner in which genetic information is passed from one generation to another.  I am saying these things simply to illustrate the point that there is no certainty that these products are not harmful; neither in the case of many of them do we have evidence that they are.  You are left in an area of doubt and it is in that context that you have to make decisions and of course you are talking about risk benefit and all that type of thing.</P>
    <P>I have some concern about the manner in which the residues are controlled in this country.  The main way of controlling these residues and the use of pesticides seems to be to monitor the levels of residues which are found in materials entering the food chain.  That system of monitoring, first of all, does not preclude the improper application of the pesticide; it does not preclude the usage of doses of the pesticide greater than recommended nor, for that matter, does it ensure that the person using the pesticide will read the instructions as to how it should be used.  Even if they do read and understand the instructions there is still no certainty that they will follow them.  These are areas of considerable uncertainty.</P>
    <P>I gather that some 2,000 samples of food material are analysed for a wide number of residues and metabolised residues each year.  That seems a large sample but it is still a relatively small amount of the total food which is consumed. There is no published data on the levels of residues in Irish foodstuffs even if that data were available.  There is no data on the intake of pesticides by various segments of the population; there is no data available on the intake of pesticides by those sections of the population which may be considered to be at risk from exposure to them.  There is no data, for example, available on the intake of pesticides and of various other herbicides by those who are pregnant, by lactating mothers, by the young, by the elderly, by those who have various metabolic and other types of medical disorders.  We are simply in an area of ignorance as far as all these things are concerned.  The reality <Col N="1224" /> is that approximately 2,700 pesticides, herbicides and fungicides can be offered for sale in Ireland.  I suppose that about 1,000 of those products actually do get on to the market.  What we are talking about here is the fact that there at 1,000 products which have the capacity to kill biological material, making their way into the food chain, and we really do not know the extent to which they are being consumed quite simply because we have not done the necessary research.</P>
    <P>As to what should be done about these products and how we might tighten things up, there are a number of suggestions that I would make, firstly, I believe that people who use those compounds should be accountable for the way in which they are used.  They should be answerable for the manner in which they are applied. Those who use them should be properly trained and regulations should be made to ensure that that happens.  I believe that the proper use of these products on farms should be properly monitored and should be used as a last resort and at minimal levels.  I think that that is important from a human health point of view.  I also believe that it is important from the point of view of the welfare of the economy because the big selling point that the Irish food industry has going for it is its image of purity on the European market.  It is absolutely essential that we make every effort to protect that image and that we safeguard it very jealously indeed.  There is little purpose in people making excuses for the use of these products and putting the other side of the case to the one which I am making.  We should reduce as far as possible the level of these things which are used so that we can face the European consumer and assure them that what we are producing here by way of food is the most wholesome material that can be produced anywhere.  If we make the long term investment it will certainly pay dividends. I welcome the motion and the general approach that is implied in it, particularly when it refers to terms of greater and tighter controls on the use of pesticides.  I certainly would be all for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senator <Col N="1225" /> Upton for so generously giving us some of his time.  I have to admit, first of all, that I was not aware, before I was informed by the Irish Wildbird Conservancy Association and by Senator Fitzgerald in the Fianna Fáil motion, of the free availability of strychnine.  I congratulate the Government on producing this motion.  I think it is quite horrifying and it certainly reminds me of the appalling way that we treat animals throughout the world in the interests of selfish commercialism. It reminds me of the seal cull which goes on in Iceland, Greenland and elsewhere, and also of the obligations we have to nature which we do not fulfil.  It is particularly shocking because strychnine is quite obviously a very brutal form of poisoning.  Strychnine, as I understand it, does not kill someone dead immediately but is a very brutal and very painful form of poisoning.  While I and anyone who wants to preserve wildlife understands the need to protect flocks and to protect certain animals from predators, we must do it in a humane way and in one which is recognised as civilised by society.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he can give us some promise that this motion which has all-party support and is welcome will be translated into legislation because everybody here is as aware as I am that passing a motion in this House has absolutely no legislative effect.  When this is passed unanimously, as it will be this evening, farmers will continue to poison dogs, birds, mammals and protected species just as they did before.  It is also quite obvious that it is not just birds, whether barn owls, or buzzards which are at risk but that this poison threatens children, sheepdogs and all sorts of animals which it was not intended this particular poison should kill.  It seems to me that one of the current practices is wrong.  The idea that poisoned carcases should be used to attract predators is utterly wrong.  That seems to me like an <i>agent provocateur.</i>  It seems to be drawing them in from various areas to the exact places where they are not meant to be and sending them away poisoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My understanding is that now is the <Col N="1226" /> right time for a reform of this legislation. When it was originally introduced it appears we did not have alternative means of protecting the species and wildlife we are trying to protect.  It seems to me from the briefing I received that there are now new methods for protecting these species and that they should be used.  I refer to five strand electric fences and sophisticated forms of putting wildlife down which certainly exclude strychnine. It is a pity Ireland is one of the few countries left which actually allows strychnine to be sold across the counter quite freely.  I know there are some restrictions but they are very minor ones. I hope no more wildlife becomes extinct in this country after the introduction of measures which I hope will see the beginning of the end of the use of strychnine in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senator Upton for giving us some time and also thank Senator Tom Fitzgerald who approached me last week and asked if I might contribute in some small way to this.  This is one of the reasons I have done so.  It is an excellent motion and, like Senator Ross, I hope it will be acted upon.</P>
      <P>There are three or four Acts, the Wildlife Act, the Vagrancy of Dogs Act &mdash; going back to the 19th century &mdash; and then an Act of 1965.  If this motion is going to mean anything as Senator Ross has said, it will require amendment of the legislation.  I would like to concur with Senator Ross and ask if the Minister will indicate to the House what he has in mind with regard to such amendment. Otherwise we are going to be facing what was outlined for us in the title of a famous American book <i>A Silent Spring.</i>  In other words, a great deal of our wildlife is going to be eliminated from the countryside. Very rarely now do we hear the corncrake and we are facing the elimination of large numbers of species of birds well known to the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to mention the fact that, in addition to being approached by the Irish Wildbird Conservancy, I have also been approached by a constituent who <Col N="1227" /> is Chairman of the Irish section of the International Council for Bird Preservation. The information which was placed before me from this source is very worrying with regard to the question of strychnine.  Strychnine is an extremely dangerous poison.  In every other European country it is very closely regulated and its sale is illegal in all other European Community countries.  That clearly points to us as an anomalous element in the equation.</P>
    <P>The use of strychnine here for pest control is inaccurate.  It is almost the equivalent of the much vaunted precision bombing of the Allies.  It is simply not precise.  It is not an accurate method and it feeds a highly dangerous poison into the food chain.  I heard someone speak on the radio this morning about the poisoning of two red kites, which are rare birds, in County Wicklow &mdash; I think it was somewhere around Bray, but I may be wrong about this.  These birds are believed to have been killed as a result of eating carcases poisoned with strychnine. So this very week we have a classic example of a situation where bird species are threatened.  It is a very unpleasant way of dying because the animal or bird dies apparently in some considerable agony.</P>
    <P>Another example would be the buzzard, a very remarkable and beautiful bird which my informant tells me would thrive in Ireland if the kind of amendments which are being proposed were passed into legislation.  This is clearly shown by virtue of the fact that strychnine is not available north of the Border.  The buzzard population is quite healthy there but gradually it fades out as you come south.  This correlation is clearly traceable to the availability of strychnine.</P>
    <P>It is also worth mentioning that Irish strychnine is smuggled illegally to Scotland where it continues to do damage.  I have concentrated on strychnine because it is an aspect on which I have been briefed but the Minister will also take into account situations like the import <Col N="1228" /> into this country and the illegal distribution of angel dust which used to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion because every year we read of a number of tragic accidents where people, because of their lack of knowledge of the dangers of certain pesticides either inhale the fumes or in some cases swallow the substance leading often to tragic consequences for the victim.  The utmost precautions should be taken by the manufacturers of those products, by the retailers who are selling the products to the general public and by the general public themselves who are the users of those products.  Very often the labelling on the containers is inadequate and the danger to life is not highlighted enough by those who are selling those chemicals and pesticides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years we have seen enormous usage of pesticides in Ireland though it is still low in comparison to European standards.  This came about because of the increased markets for the farmers' produce and, therefore, the farmers wanted to get the maximum yield from their land.  The use of pesticides contributed in no small way to this high yield. Indeed, without pesticides many crops could not be grown at all and others could <Col N="1229" /> not be grown economically in competition with other EC countries.  Pesticides are essential for controlling vectors of human and animal disease, controlling pests of forest species particularly in nurseries, cereals, potatoes, sugar beet etc. Without pesticides food could not be produced in many countries at economic prices and famine conditions would obtain.  While the use of pesticides is necessary to protect crops, more stringent control is also necessary to protect the environment and to ensure human safety and the protection of wildlife.  That is why we have put down this motion tonight for discussion.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there is excessive use of pesticides and of poisonous chemicals and this is certainly having a harmful effect on the environment and particularly on wildlife.  How many of the birds we were all so familiar with in our youth have now vanished because of the use of artificial fertilisers?  The corncrake, whose call was so familiar in rural Ireland, is no longer there.  There are many other species, which I cannot name at present, that are also extinct.  It is sad to see that happen because of the excessive use of pesticides.</P>
    <P>There are certain regulations in place to control the sale and use of pesticides but, in view of the excessive use of those chemicals, there should be a reappraisal of those regulations.  I would like to hear from the Minister the staff numbers employed in his Department to deal with this problem and also to test the various brands of pesticides and poisonous chemicals that are coming on the market.  My information is that the numbers of personnel employed by the Department who are qualified to deal with this very important matter are inadequate and I ask the Minister to have this rectified.  It would be disastrous if the Department of Agriculture and Food were in any way found to be inadequate in dealing with this very important matter.</P>
    <P>Strychnine is better regulated than pesticides.  It is controlled by the Department of Health but conservationists are still concerned that the quantities being used in Ireland are increasing.  In fact, <Col N="1230" /> strychnine imports into the Republic in 1988 were 40 times the amount imported into Northern Ireland.  The quantities recorded were 22 kilos and 0.5 kilos respectively.  There has been an increase in the use of strychnine and I urge that strictest of controls be enforced in regard to this poison.  It is a very dangerous substance if it gets into the hands of people who are not aware of its danger. It is important that we discuss this matter in this House.  I support the motion and congratulate Senators who have contributed on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion has four parts.  The first is the threat to our natural environment posed by chemical and poisonous compounds.  The second, for which we can congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Food in implementing the control of farm pollution, is a scheme which has worked extremely well and was aided by the EC.  The third is calling for regulations to control the use of pesticides and the fourth is to ban the use of strychnine to ensure human safety and the protection of wildlife. There is a tremendous acceptance and appreciation by farmers in my area of the assistance given by the Minister for Agriculture and Food and indeed, the EC, in aiding farmers to carry out pollution control.  Today I would like to congratulate the Minister, the Minister of State and the EC for providing the necessary finance to ensure that pollution from our farmyards is down to a minimum.</P>
      <P>In regard to the threat to our natural environment by chemical and poisonous compounds, we should look at Ireland and look at pollution in two forms &mdash; atmospheric pollution and ground pollution. Ireland, being an offshore island, has the cleanest atmospheric environment in the Community.  I would even go as far as saying that produce in Ireland is far cleaner due to our clean atmospheric environment.  Environmental issues will be very important over the next ten years.  They are quite expensive to farmers at present even with high grants from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1231" /> The Dutch, who have pollution problems, expect to reduce their chemicals by 50 per cent by the year 2000.  In other words, one-third of the 320 pesticides used will be phased out.  At present, 220 tonnes of pesticides are used in Holland every year and it is proposed to reduce this amount by 50 per cent.  In regard to chemicals, the Dutch will spend £700 million over the next ten years to bring about a change over to organic produce. That will mean a substantial reduction in the use of chemicals.  They have a tremendous problem with pesticides and ground water.  Regulations for nitrogen are to be drawn up and the disposal of manure is of central importance.  They are talking about a processing capacity of six million tonnes by the end of 1994. They have massive problems that will cost a lot of money to remedy.</P>
    <P>In this country we do not have as many environmental problems.  Therefore, we should enter the purer food market more rapidly than the Dutch.  It all comes down to one thing, promotion of our products, dairy, beef, lamb, poultry, vegetables and so on.  We should promote them on the scale of our production, and organically, because any one of the aforementioned products are produced almost 90 per cent organically.  We are very low users of chemicals.  Our underground water is almost totally unpolluted but that does not mean we must not put corrective procedures into place.  We should promote the proper use, instead of the abuse, of chemicals.  We need a minimal use of chemicals in our environment.  Perhaps we should be marketing our produce stating that our residues are at least 50 per cent below the Community acceptable level.  I have no doubt that we will be able to achieve this.  There are regulations under Community law for the control of chemicals.  We do not need any further controls, only better education and awareness programmes within our community on the proper use of chemicals.</P>
    <P>The fourth part of this motion deals with banning the use of strychnine.  In doing so we will be protecting our wildlife <Col N="1232" /> and this will further enhance our reputation for having a clean food environment. We need a proper structure within our agricultural industry, supported by industry, farmers and ourselves to market our produce with extremely low levels of pesticides.  Marks and Spencers in the UK have recently withdrawn all organic produce from their shelves. This has coincided with the change in the American attitude where they recognise the proper use of certain chemicals to aid and enhance their produce.</P>
    <P>As we need antibiotics to get over colds, so also animals and plants need certain chemicals to increase their resistance. Finally, I will stress again that more stringent control is needed on the use of strychnine to ensure human safety and the protection of lives.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food is implementing regulations for the control of farm pollution but a further educational process on the proper use of chemicals which are below normal acceptable standards in the world is needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion on the vitally important subject of protecting the natural environment.  I am impressed by the strong support which the motion has got. That the motion has been put down for debate and has been so fully supported is a clear indication of the welcome growing concern about the protection of the environment in all its forms.</P>
      <P>Tonight's motion covers a wide range of environmental concerns, including the protection of the land on which we grow our crops and feed our livestock, the protection of streams and rivers, as well as the protection of wildlife.  All these concerns fit into a single pattern &mdash; that of environmental protection.  We seek to improve the environment in which we live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are also anxious to continue to let this country be known abroad as a place which not only has a very good environment but that we are anxious to be at the forefront in maintaining that position. Very good economic considerations are <Col N="1233" /> also involved.  Our food export industry benefits from the fact that it is produced in a clean environment.  This point of view is well accepted here by all involved in the food industry and those dependent on it for their livelihood.</P>
    <P>The natural environment and its protection are, of course, a much broader question than that of the agricultural sector alone.  The Government have nominated it for priority attention and, the House will recall, the Taoiseach gave it special designation as one of the subjects for attention during our term of Presidency of the European Community last year.  Within the Government, primary responsibility is assigned to the Minister for the Environment who promotes and operates the broader national legislation relating to the environment. The provisions of that legislation apply to all sectors including agriculture.  There are also areas which are specific to the agricultural industry and control of these falls within the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  It is this area which is for debate this evening.</P>
    <P>The chemicals and poisonous compounds mentioned in the motion consist mainly of chemical fertilisers and pesticides. In the case of fertilisers the main concern is that the over-use and leaching of fertilisers into waterways could create problems of excessive nitrates which could be detrimental to water, wildlife or to public water systems.  The usage of fertilisers in this country is low by international standards and the continued monitoring of water systems has not indicated that fertilisers represent a risk.  We are participating, within the European Community, in discussions to consider whether legislation should be introduced to govern the level of trace elements in fertilisers and also the prospects for introducing new fertilising products such as slow-releasing nitrogen types.  This work could lead to the imposition of more strict control on such fertilisers that might be considered potentially harmful to the environment.</P>
    <P>Pesticides have proved a huge boon to modern agriculture by controlling diseases and pests of crops, and contributing <Col N="1234" /> to the production of cheap, high-quality food, thereby reducing the incidence of under-nutrition in developing countries. However, being biologically active products they are also potentially dangerous to man and the environment.  They are intended to be toxic to the unwanted or pest species, without causing damage to treated species, to man or the environment. It is necessary, therefore, that their use be controlled by laws and regulations which have a wide margin of weighting in favour of the safety aspect. This is the position here in Ireland where two bodies of statutory regulations governing the sale and use of pesticides, are administered.</P>
    <P>The first body of regulations is entitled the European Communities (Classification, Packaging and Labelling of Pesticides) Regulations, 1985 to 1989.  A pesticide may not be sold on the market without getting clearance under these regulations.  The regulations came into operation in 1985 and an arrangement was made that products already on the market could continue to be sold provided they met certain conditions in the regulations.  These old pesticides are being called up in batches for a more detailed examination before getting final clearance.  Any pesticide put on the market for the first time after 1985 has to receive examination and clearance beforehand.  In the process of clearing pesticides under the regulations, safety evaluations are made and a pesticide which is regarded as constituting a danger to human health or the environment may be prohibited or have special conditions attached to its clearance.  Inspectors of the Department of Agriculture and Food carry out regular inspections at wholesale and retail outlets to ensure that pesticides on sale comply with the regulations.  As a result, several seizures were made and a number of instances of court proceedings resulted in successful prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The other body of legislation deals with the level of pesticide residues in or on fruit and vegetables, cereals and foodstuffs of animal origin.  These regulations, which operate throughout the European Community, lay down maximum residue <Col N="1235" /> levels for a wide range of pesticides in designated foodstuffs.  The maximum levels are set at a very safe level.  Regular samples of all designated foodstuffs, both home grown and imported, are taken by officers of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  To illustrate the effectiveness of these controls, out of 547 samples taken in 1989 only four were found to be above the limit.  In such cases a warning is issued and special attention is given afterwards to produce from the same source.  I would like to assure the House that in no case was a repeat discovered.</P>
    <P>A third body of proposed legislation on pesticides is at present being discussed in Brussels.  It will impose a tighter control on pesticides by requiring that all acceptable active ingredients are registered and only pesticides manufactured from these ingredients can be put on sale.</P>
    <P>As in the case of fertilisers, Ireland is a relatively small user of pesticides.  From my presentation here Senators will note that the policy and control measures being operated are designed to retain the high quality of our environment.  This will involve, of course, a continuing vigilance by all sectors within which the agricultural industry will play its part.</P>
    <P>The motion proposes to &ldquo;ban the use of strychnine to ensure human safety and the protection of wildlife&rdquo;.  Over the years, very strict controls have applied to the sale and use of strychnine.  The purpose of these controls was, first of all, to protect human life.  In regard to agriculture it is interesting to note that in the Protection of Animals Act, 1911, passed by the British Parliament, a special provision was made allowing the use in Ireland of strychnine or other poisons on land subject to the precautions of posting a notice and notifying the police.  That permission was continued with some small modifications when the protection of Animals (Amendment) Act was passed by the Oireachtas in 1965.</P>
    <P>I feel it is time we looked critically at that special provision.  I think the time has come to ban strychnine.  I propose to initiate the necessary action within my Department to ban the use of strychnine <Col N="1236" /> in poisoned bait by farmers.  In so doing, we would be bringing our law into line with that in other countries.  That we should continue to allow the use of strychnine is, in my view, likely to do damage internationally to our good name as people who care for the environment. There are many disturbing accounts of damage being done to wildlife, particularly rare wild birds.  It is possible that banning strychnine may cause protests from some livestock owners, especially sheep farmers.  I must ask how so many sheep farmers here manage without using strychnine and how is it that successful sheep farming can be carried on in Scotland, Wales and elsewhere where strychnine and other poisons are banned.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with a number of points which were raised.  Senator McGowan raised the question of alternatives to strychnine.  There are many compounds available which are more toxic than strychnine.  However, none of these compounds is viable without undergoing detailed evaluation and, at present, could not be recommended as an alternative.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey raised the question of the labelling of pesticides.  All pesticides assessed by the Department of Agriculture and Food are then labelled in accordance with EC legislation.  In regard to the numbers of staff involved in the evaluation of pesticides, ten personnel are directly involved.</P>
    <P>The motion makes favourable comment on the operational programme for the control of farmyard pollution.  I am glad to tell the House that it is proving satisfactory in operation.  The position is as follows: the operational programme for the control of farmyard pollution was the first operational programme approved for Ireland in the context of the negotiations on the National Development Plan 1989-1993.  In fact, it was approved by the Commission in advance of the finalisation of the Community support framework for the plan in response to a special request by the Minister for urgent EC assistance to deal with our pollution problem.</P>
    <P>Under the programme grants of 55 per <Col N="1237" /> cent are payable for slurry and effluent storage and 45 per cent for animal housing and fodder storage in the less favoured areas of the country; outside those areas the corresponding grant rates are 45 per cent and 35 per cent respectively. Young farmers meeting certain educational criteria are entitled to grants which are one-quarter higher.</P>
    <P>The date, some 28,000 applications have been received for pollution control work under the scheme.  Of these, 21,000 have been approved to proceed with work representing a total investment of £173 million, while grant aid of £38 million has already been paid.  This represents real progress on farmyard pollution.</P>
    <P>Besides the steps which I have taken to control the concentration of residues in our soil, I also have responsibility for the organic farming unit of my Department. Senators will be aware that a new unit was set up in June of last year following a budgetary allocation of £450,000. Its objective is to develop all aspects of organic production, whether horticultural, tillage or livestock.</P>
    <P>Organic farming is a method of production whose hallmark is an ecologically sound system of farming.  To achieve this, it uses positive beneficial practices such as balanced rotations, extensive use of composts and green manures and specific cultivation techniques as well as a prohibition on the use of agrochemical pesticides, chemical fertilisers and veterinary products.  Clearly from an environmental point of view the development of organic farming is a trend I welcome and during our Presidency agreement was reached by the Council of Ministers on a measure which will regulate the production and labelling of organic produce.  This proposal, which has been agreed in principle, is awaiting the opinion of the European Parliament and other technical examinations before adoption by the Council of Ministers.  Implementation of this regulation will provide a statutory assurance to the consumer of organic quality and environmental conservation and protection of our countryside. <Col N="1238" /> However, Senators will also be conscious of the fact that organic farming results in lower production levels and requires a premium price for its produce in order to sustain this reduction in volume.  The reality is, that only a limited number of people have the discretionary income to afford these higher prices.  The combination of reduced food production and higher prices means, in effect, that for the foreseeable future produce from conventional methods of farming will be the main source of food.</P>
    <P>That being said, it would be shortsighted of this country to ignore the fact that a market exists for premium organic produce.  Not alone is the market growing but present production levels cannot meet this demand, much less cater for an increase.  Furthermore, this is a market for which Ireland would have an advantage by virtue of its perceived image of having a relatively unpolluted environment. It is to ensure that this country is in a position to capitalise on this niche market that the organic unit was established.</P>
    <P>I realise that a major difficulty which this country has is the small number of scale of practising organic producers. There are many reasons for this but the principal ones would relate to a lack of information on what is entailed in the production of organic produce.  This is why the organic unit has allocated a high proportion of their resources this year towards building up a sound information base by giving grants in aid to academic institutions to hold courses on the topic, to research agencies either to provide empirical data on the precise systems which suit our methods of production and to market bodies to ascertain precisely the market requirements and how best to meet them.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on record my support for this motion.  I think I have covered all of the relevant sections of my Department which have an input into the protection of the natural environment. Finally, I wish to thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate here tonight and, indeed, last Wednesday night also.  All the contributions were <Col N="1239" /> well researched and showed a depth of concern and interest on the part of the Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to compliment the Minister on his positive response to this motion.  I congratulate his for stating that the time has come to ban strychnine and that he proposes to initiate the necessary action in his Department to ban the use of strychnine in poison bait by farmers.  This will be welcome news for all the people who have been campaigning and lobbying at every available opportunity for this development.  Everybody who has been involved in promoting this motion and in bringing the ban on the use of strychnine to this stage are to be congratulated.  A special word of congratulations should go to Senator Tom Fitzgerald because he initiated this motion and he gave a brief to all Senators who were interested in following through.  The motion got widespread support from all sides of the House.  Also, I would like to pay tribute to the Irish Wildbird Conservancy who have campaigned for so long to bring about this development.</P>
      <P>In passing it is important to reiterate &mdash; I think it was Senator Dardis and Senator Norris who mentioned this &mdash; the fact that two red kites have been found poisoned here and the strong possibility is that they were poisoned by bait laced with strychnine.  I will explain briefly the background.  As we know, red kite are a rare species of birds of prey.  I understand there is a small colony of them in Wales at the moment and I believe that the two kites found dead here were part of a consignment of 19 that had been released in the highlands of Scotland to try to regenerate the population of red kites. Unfortunately, they strayed over here. That proves, in great detail the difficulty with birds of prey.  The two birds that strayed over here died and the strong possibility is that they died from bait that was laced with strychnine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case anybody is under the impression that those who proposed this motion are a motley crew of do-gooders <Col N="1240" /> I hasten to add that nothing could be further from the truth.  All of us, on all sides of the House, have some connection in one way or another with farming.  A number of us were raised on farms, others have spent holidays on farms and know exactly what farming is all about.  It is understandable that the farming community should try as far as possible to protect their livestock by whatever method but nobody, but the wanting few, would wittingly set about to destroy the beautiful creatures that are part of our heritage.  Some farmers decide on the spur of the moment &mdash; because predators prey on their sheep &mdash; to try any method of getting rid of the predators.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross made an important point when he mentioned the lacing of bait with strychnine.  One part of the law as it stands that bemuses me is that one has to get a certificate from a Garda Síochána to buy strychnine.  One can then go to a chemist and purchase it and use it in whatever careless fashion one likes. There is a regulation which a states that where a beast dies on the land that beast has to be removed, but if the beast is laced with strychnine it can be left there as bait.  That is absolutely appalling because that animal becomes increasingly more dangerous for a number of reasons.  It has been mentioned by a number of Senators that the use of strychnine is very toxic.  There are spin-off effects relating to the animals that eat the bait and also to those that eat those animals when they die.  Even in terms of human tragedy the dangers inherent in the use of strychnine are absolutely appalling and it is most appropriate that the Minister should announce he is putting legislation in motion that will ban its use.</P>
    <P>It is important to put on record that the profesional in pest control will neither recommend the use of strychnine because of the inherent dangers both to man and beast, nor will they use it themselves. Although it has been used for many years, it has not solved the problem.  That is the kernel of the whole matter.  There is not one shred of evidence to show, that the use of strychnine increases livestock <Col N="1241" /> or does away with predators.  In fact, the reverse could be argued.  For the reason Senator Ross mentioned, bait actually draws predators rather than eliminates them.  It does the reverse of what it was intended to do in the first place.  I am particularly pleased that this announcement has been made here tonight.  I am particularly happy that it should be made at a time when we are debating another piece of major environmental legislation. It is appropriate that the two of them should coincide and that the Minister has announced that he will be introducing further very important environment legislation.</P>
    <P>I think it is appropriate that this motion, which has got a very positive response from the Minister, will make people more aware of the responsibilities we have to very rare species of wild fowl. Senator Hussey mentioned the corncrake that we were all very familiar with when we were young, but you will not hear the corncrake any more.  It is a sad reflection on society.  Despite technological development in farming, industry and so on, we can all live in harmony.  We should recognise the problems because we have a responsibility and a duty to protect those species that need our protection.</P>
    <P>It is unthinkable that very rare species of wild fowl, if immediate action is not taken to protect them, will be extinct within a very short time.  Then we will be moaning and wondering why people did not do something.  It is our responsibility to take steps now.  If we woke up in the countryside one morning and did not hear the birds singing, see squirrels running around, see the wild fowl and heard nothing but our sighs for an environment that is gone there is absolutely nothing that could be done about it.  The time to act is now.  The Minister has made a very positive statement here this evening.  I am delighted to have been here when he made it.  I compliment and congratulate the Minister and I congratulate everybody involved in this particular development. It is a great day for the environmental protection of the wildlife. <Col N="1242" /> Question put and agreed to.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Environmental Protection Agency" RHead="Bill, 1990: Second Stage (Resumed)">
    <Title>Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel slightly disorientated whenever I have been in possession and come back on the resumption of a debate some hours later.  Unlike broadcasting, I cannot ask for a playback so that I can pick up where I left off.  I do not intend to delay the Minister or the House much longer on this legislation.  I have dwelt at some length on it already. We are dealing with the possibility, and the reality, sad to say, of the pollution of lakes and rivers.  This relates particularly to the disadvantaged areas, areas where there is marginal land and unplanned afforestation which has resulted in a marked decline in the number of fish, upset the ecological balance in the immediate environment in which specifically the cypress spruce, or cash crop tree, the &ldquo;super tree&rdquo; as it is sometimes referred to, has been planted.</P>
      <P>I indicated at the outset of my contribution that I was aware that the Bill, comprehensive as it is, could not possibly direct itself to every aspect of environmental protection.  I would hope that the Minister might monitor the position under various sections.  Section 51 (1) (a) for instance, deals with &ldquo;the promotion and co-ordination of environmental research, the provision of assistance and advice in relation to such research and the carrying out, causing to be carried out, or arranging for, such research&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law as it stands relates to plantations of 100 hectares upwards, 250 acres approximately.  In my part of the country &mdash; this is relevant to what I am attempting to say because there are many other parts of Ireland which have similar characteristics &mdash; marginal land is very much the dominant feature.  In Leitrim, where holdings are of the order of 15 to 30 acres it is about 90 per cent to 95 per cent.  An increasing number of elderly landowner <Col N="1243" /> are now selling out and these holdings are being purchased primarily by private interests and, more recently, by Coillte Teoranta, the State forestry body.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that guidelines have been put in place and checks and balances are available particularly since 1988, when the main thrust of the Government's policy in the area of afforestation first started to bear fruit.  However, I would like to ask that in the implementation and monitoring of this legislation and particularly, for example where the agency will have the statutory right to carry out environmental impact assessment studies, that they would monitor this aspect of the environment, putting it in the most general way.  Although it is not featured in the Bill, there is obviously an emphasis, and a correct emphasis on matters such as the monitoring of drinking water, the management of sanitary authority treatment works, the management and operation of land-fill sites, the functions of local authorities in relation to environmental protection and the environmental monitoring activities of public authorities.</P>
    <P>I hope I have put forward a strong argument why the monitoring agency, in this instance the Environmental Protection Agency, should take cognisance of the serious potential damage that can be done to the environment adjoining such afforestation.  Tourism, after agriculture, is our second largest industry. There are an increasing number of people in the west of Ireland particularly who, under the benefits of the agri-tourism schemes coming from Europe are beginning to look to tourism and the provision of tourism facilities as a supplement to their income.  I hope the threat which is hanging over Irish agriculture will not impact on the small farmers but we will have to await a debate on another day to tease out that question.</P>
    <P>It would be a disaster for areas such as County Leitrim if the ecological balance were to be upset to a degree where we would lose coarse fishing, where we would find our plant life and bird life &mdash; wildlife generally &mdash; seriously inhibited <Col N="1244" /> from developing.  The oritentation in the past two to three years, particularly since the implementation of the Government's five year tourism plan to 1993, has been towards developing these areas with tourist potential and to attract more and more people, particularly from continental Europe to parts of the country such as my own.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation.  It is sad that in the environment, in the world in which we live this type of legislation is necessary. The Government, the Department of the Environment and the Minister have obviously addressed themselves to the more important aspects of environmental protection to ensure that this country's justifiable reputation down through the decades of being a pollution-free environment will be protected not only in the short term but in the long term.  That can only benefit future generations who, hopefully, will be able to build on the provisions of this Bill and on the statutory backing that is being given to so many aspects of environmental protection. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister for bringing it in.  Indeed, it was a long overdue Bill. Our environment is one of our more important assets and we need to guard it very carefully.</P>
      <P>Earlier today Senator O'Toole talked about zealots among the environmentalists. I think he has a point.  Some of us were environmentalist when it was neither popular nor profitable to be so. Indeed, I remember in the late sixties leading a campaign to prevent the establishment of a heavy smelter plant in Cork harbour.  It was an action which was not very popular in Cork at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then because of the high profile the environment has got we have many people jumping on the bandwagon and sometimes I get the impression that the environment will have to be saved from the environmentalists.  There is nothing in this world that annoys me as much as converts who get over enthusiastic about issues and quite intolerant of any other person's point of view.  I am afraid at <Col N="1245" /> times when they pick upon politically sensitive but environmentally unimportant issues they can do more harm than good by diverting resources to issues which are unimportant thereby leaving important issues unattended to.</P>
    <P>I think, in particular, of my experience in the European Parliament when we had pressure from environmentalists, particularly the German Greens, on the question of animal growth promoters.  Despite the evidence from every scientific body in the world, including the World Health Organisation, they bulldozed through a total ban on the use of these growth promoters. These were not only approved by the World Health Organisation but were actually recommended to be licensed for sale.</P>
    <P>What have they achieved in the process? They have certainly increased the danger for the consumer.  They have increased the cost to the producer.  They have driven downwards the consumption of beef.  They have got us into a trade war with the US and other countries. Most important of all, they have diverted resources from real issues like disease control, tuberculosis and the various other diseases, such as swine fever in Europe and very important ones but, particularly, tuberculosis in Ireland. They have diverted resources into trying to control now the use of illegal drugs and, of course, it is an impossible task. As the World Health Organisation had warned, there would be an explosion of illegal use of drugs but they were not interested in listening to experts.  They were intolerant of any other point of view.  They got their political kudos out of it and they left an unholy mess.</P>
    <P>Beef production in Europe is in a mess at the moment and we have only got to look at the Irish scene where the Minister &mdash; and I wish to compliment him for his efforts in trying to control the use of illegal drugs &mdash; has an impossible task. The beef industry is now sitting on a time bomb.  The control of these illegal drugs is not feasible because to control the use of these drugs you would literally have to have a policeman on every farm.  What have these zealots achieved, I ask you? <Col N="1246" /> That is a good example but there are others.</P>
    <P>Let us take an example nearer to home.  Every environmentalist, and indeed most politicians, spend a fair bit of time criticising Sellafield.  It is right that it should be criticised; we would all be happier if it was not there, and operating there, but there is a great deal of hypocrisy about it when you look at what we are not doing in our own backyard. My information is that between 100 and 160 people in Ireland die each year because of the exposure to radon gas in their own homes.  What are we doing about it?  We are sweeping it under the carpet because it would cost money to do something about it.  It is far easier to shout our heads off at the British Government about Sellafield.</P>
    <P>On the basis of a survey carried out by UCD and by the Nuclear Energy Board there are many people in this country living in homes and suffering radiation levels that are significantly higher than those for workers in the Sellafield plant. We close our eyes to it; we do not want to hear about it.  There is no political capital in that and it would cost money. it is easier to kick the bricks.  We want a little bit of honesty about these environmental problems.  I am told by scientists that there is legislation which obliges companies to see that they do not exceed more than a certain level of radiation. There is no such legislation as far as offices, homes or buildings such as this are concerned.  No, we must suffer the consequences in silence.  Incidentally, if you want to have your home tested for radon gas you can get it tested at a cost of £15 and, for your information, the Minister, Deputy Molloy, had his home checked, was right to do so because the west of Ireland has a particularly large problem in relation to levels of radon gas in the homes.</P>
    <P>I found this Bill very difficult reading. I do not know if the drafters of legislation could write such Bills in a way that would be easier for lay people to understand.  It is not easy reading.  One would imagine that it was drafted to confuse rather than enlighten.  Perhaps that is not fair to those <Col N="1247" /> who drafted it, but I am sure most of you will agree with me that it is not easy going.</P>
    <P>To speak about pollution in general, pollution of course arises from a number of different sources, industry, agriculture, individuals, local authorities, motorists, we are all responsible in one way or another for it.  The Bill, however, seems very much to target industry and commercial enterprises, but what about local authorities?  What about individuals dropping litter, or creating unacceptable noise, such as youngsters on motor bikes, which is quite intolerable?  Pollution prevention need not always cost money.  If we do not drop the litter it will not have to be picked up at a cost.  Sometimes you can actually save money.  For instance, if we insulate our homes and our buildings and prevent draughts, there will be considerable saving of energy.  So there is enormous scope in the area of energy saving.</P>
    <P>Something that many other cities in many parts of the world have considered and implemented is community central heating which is far more efficient and, in the longer term, far cheaper than individual heating of dwelling houses. Community central heating, for instance, might use surplus heat from power stations. Heat which, in going down the river, does environmental damage to the life on the river, to the fish and the various other forms of life.  Or, it might use heat from an incinerator disposing of refuse, thereby reducing pollution in these landfills and tipheads and so on.  It could solve a number of problems.  Of course, in the final analysis the key to the solution of most of our pollution problems worldwide is a solution to the energy problem.</P>
    <P>There is no easy solution in sight, I am afraid.  We are living in a golden age, we are enjoying a standard of living that we are not really entitled to by using up the capital in the form of carboniferous fuels that have built up over millions of years and we are making no provision for generations yet unborn when the carboniferous fuels run out.  I do not think that is a very responsible way to behave <Col N="1248" /> because at the rate at which we are using this fossil fuel we are damaging the environment. We should be making provision, in terms of research, to find alternative sources of energy.  I know it is easy to talk about alternative sources of energy; I know it is not easy to achieve them, but I also know that there are billions and billions of pounds spent each day and each week on less worthy subjects.  One has only to look at what is happening in the Gulf at the moment to realise what the billions of pounds being spend there might do in trying to develop wave energy, tidal energy, wind energy, renewable sources of energy and, perhaps the best prospect of all, nuclear fusion.</P>
    <P>I know the word &ldquo;nuclear&rdquo; drives many people &ldquo;bananas&rdquo; and it is right that people should be worried about nuclear things, particularly since nuclear fission as opposed to fusion, has been so closely associated with the ultimate war weapon, the nuclear bomb.  But nuclear fusion is quite a different matter.  It is derived from a plentiful supply of hydrogen, the world is full of it.  It would have very little waste product.  It would have the advantage that if when in use an accident occurred you could shut down the process by turning off the supply of raw material.  This is unlike nuclear fission, where all sources of energy are loaded into it on day one and cannot be extracted and cannot be shut off safely as nuclear fusion can be. However, the technological problems in trying to develop nuclear fusion are such that it will probably be 50 years or more before we get there.  I do not think there is any one single answer to the energy problem.  The solution will come in the form of several answers but, in the meantime, it would behove all of us to be more careful about how we use energy and to try to conserve it.</P>
    <P>Getting back to other issues in relation to what I have mentioned already, there are other people with responsibilities, local authorities, for instance, who have a huge responsibility as far as pollution is concerned.  Unfortunately, they are amongst the main offenders in relation to pollution.  How many towns in this <Col N="1249" /> country are dumping raw sewage into rivers?  I know that sitution is improving but it certainly was bad until recently. Even a town like Killarney had its problems in regard to damaging the Lakes of Killarney.  Thankfully, that has now been resolved.  I am afraid local authorities are not entirely free of blame.  Of course the problem, as always, is a shortage of cash, but the cash has to be found and the problem can be solved if the effort is made.</P>
    <P>One has to admire the efforts made by the British.  If you recall the Thames was a dead river.  Today, as a result of some efforts they made to clean up the pollution going into the Thames, salmon are again going up beyond the city of London, something that had not happened for 70 or 80 years.  It can be done and it has to be done.  It will cost money but we have found money for less worthy projects.</P>
    <P>Local authorities, too, are, very often criticised, and rightly criticised, for the location and management of dumps.  In Cork the dump for the city is now in the city and is being surrounded by dwellings. It is infested with rats; the emerging gas is being fired in order to get rid of it; there is seepage into the underground and into the local streams, and there are persistent smells which are intolerable to the locals.  The corporation say that to move from it would cost a lot of money. My question is why did they move into it in the first place?  I know the city was not as near the dump then as it is now, but surely the planners must have foreseen that the city was developing in that direction. I have the greatest sympathy for people who have their homes in that area and, through no fault of their own and through no choice of theirs, find themselves with this foul smelling dump, with rats and with seagulls dropping material all over the place and flies in summertime, all creating a possible health hazard.  That sort of thing should not happen.  However, it has happened and something must be done about it before too long.</P>
    <P>Local authorities, too, are sometimes at fault in not enforcing the planning <Col N="1250" /> regulations.  Again, I can think of the situation in Cork.  It is well known that there were some problems with chemical industries, particularly in Ringaskiddy. Smells and occasionally noise offended the locals.  It transpired that the regulations were not being enforced, that the local authorities did not have the resources to enforce them.  If regulations are not enforced they are not worth having on paper.  If you are going to make a law you ought to be in a position to enforce it.  That kind of thing gives a bad name to all industry.  Not all industries there were responsible, but those that were responsible gave a bad name to all industry, and that is a bad thing for the country in general.</P>
    <P>As we saw in east Cork, when Merck, Sharpe and Dohme tried to get a plant built there, it had gone through all the processes.  The county council had given approval, Bord Pleanála appealed to the High Court and so on, and they won every round.  Yet, the resistance of people in east Cork terrified them so much, no doubt egged on by a few busybodies, that they resisted it to the point where Merck, Sharpe and Dohme, despite the massive amount of money they had already invested, walked away from the site.  That kind of publicity outside Ireland, when we are trying to attract industry, is not very good for us.</P>
    <P>That kind of lack of confidence among locals is to some extent, if not entirely, due to the fact that local authorities did not always enforce the regulations.  Look at the mess that happened in south Tipperary, where a farmer took his case to the High Court and then to the Supreme Court and won against the industry there. Obviously, there was something wrong &mdash; I am not sure what was wrong &mdash; but it transpired during all of this that some of the testing by the local authority of discharges into the river and aerial discharges were not as careful as they should have been.</P>
    <P>The court action by this farmer against the company was reported around the world, was known to every chemical company, I am sure, that ever had any interest in coming to Ireland, and even <Col N="1251" /> some who had no interest in coming to Ireland.  Certainly it is the kind of bad publicity we could do without.  That is the kind of thing that local authorities have to take more seriously; and it is only fair to say on behalf of local authorities that they may well be looking for more resources from the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>Local authorities, too, I am afraid, have been negligent in respect of doing anything about recycling.  If you go to other countries you will find that the refuse collection in some of them is divided into a number of parts.  One day they collect the bottles, next day they collect the plastics and paper and next day the general refuse.  It may cost a little more but, on the other hand, if we are serious about pollution control, there is an obvious one &mdash; recycling of paper, recycling of glass and plastic and minimising the amount that goes into the actual dump.  I suggest that this be examined as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>In some countries &mdash; and I am thinking particularly of Denmark &mdash; they have a tax on non-returnables; in fact, two or three years ago they prohibited the use of non-returnable containers.  I am thinking of beer cans, soft drink cans, bottles and so on.  Senator O'Toole remarked this evening about the difference between protectionism and protection.  I am not quite sure if the Danish motive was entirely for protection of the environment. I may well have something to do with the protection of their own brewing industry and their own soft drinks industry and so on.  Maybe it is not right to attribute that motive to them, but certainly we should do something more about recycling.  In that league we are particularly far behind most of our Community partners and, indeed, most of the developed countries in the world.  This is a pity.</P>
    <P>Local authorities also fail to do anything about the population of dogs around our towns and cities that are soiling footpaths and leaving the place in a <Col N="1252" /> disgraceful condition.  I suggested a solution last week in relation to dogs harassing sheep when we were talking about banning strychnine and so on.  I was delighted that the Minister, Deputy Kirk, mentioned he was going to support the idea of banning strychnine.  I suggested that every dog in the country should be tattooed, registered at the local police station and the offending dog could be identified and the owner held accountable.</P>
    <P>That is particularly worth considering for protecting sheep flocks and, indeed, protecting children and adults from vicious dogs, but I think owners ought to be also held accountable for dogs making a toilet of the sidewalks.  We are entitled to have these sidewalks in a reasonable state for walking on.  Dog owners are not entitled to make toilets for their dogs of our sidewalks.  If you go to a city like Paris or New York there are areas the dogs are allowed to use as a toilet.  In Paris they have a fleet of men on motorbikes who go around with a brush and a container on the back of the motor bike which simply zones in on the spot that has been used as a toilet and the street is cleaned up.  You would be literally ashamed of our streets at times to see the way they are soiled by these stray animals.  They are stray in the sense that there seems to be nobody around with any responsibility for them.</P>
    <P>There are other examples of where there are failures to enforce laws; for instance &mdash; and I do not know whether some of you consider this pollution, but I do; of course, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I suppose &mdash; failure to enforce the Noxious Weeds Act.  I see publicly owned land, and I am thinking for instance, of the land attached to the Munster Institute.  Each summer and autumn it is an absolute disgrace with thistles, ragwort, docks, nettles and so on.  Some people might like the flowers and the ragwort and so on, but these are a form of pollution because the seeds spread to surrounding land and so on. There is a Noxious Weeds Act but it is not being enforced and this, again, is bringing the law into disrepute.  If you are <Col N="1253" /> not going to, or cannot enforce the law, then take it off the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>We have other forms of legislation related to pollution which I would be concerned about &mdash; for instance, legislation in relation to slaughterhouses.  An animal cannot be taken from a slaughterhouse; once you take it there it cannot be taken away live from a slaughterhouse. I agree with that, but there is something strange about not being allowed to take the animal whereas, if you kill the animal, the entrails, the blood, washings and everything can be taken out and spread on land.  That leaves the possibility open to wildlife to pick up material and take it, if there is disease on it, to deposit it elsewhere and to spread disease.  There is something wrong about that kind of legislation, apart altogether from the fact that it is not a very pleasant smell for people who have to put up with it in the vicinity of the slaughter houses.</P>
    <P>This morning I was delighted to read that the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, is considering banning smoking in the workplace.  I have to confess I am a non-smoker and I am a bit anti-smoking, but, while I welcome the idea of banning smoking from the workplace, I would like first of all to see the legislation we have about smoking in public places enforced.  I cannot see it enforced anywhere.  I cannot get away from it. Everywhere I go that there is a meeting there is smoking.  What happened to this legislation we had about banning smoking in public places?  The Minister mentioned that up to 5,000 people in Ireland die each year from nicotine-related diseases. We have the legislation, yet, we just ignore it and we talk about bringing in extra legislation.  That is bringing the law into disrepute.  If we are not going to enforce the law I do not think we should put it on the Statute Book.  At the same time it is encouraging that he is concerned about it.  I wish he would be as concerned about enforcing it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill itself &mdash; it took me a long time to get round to it, but however &mdash; there are a number of things which I find a bit difficult and perhaps <Col N="1254" /> the Minister would like to enlighten me on them.  Section 30 states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, from time to time, following consultation with the Agency and any other Minister of the Government concerned, request a public authority to designate for employment by the Agency employees of that authority whose principal duties relate to a function assigned or transferred to the Agency under this Act, or to be so assigned or transferred to the Agency, and the authority shall comply with such request.</P>
    <P>That is a mouthful.  Does that mean the Minister can take over the staff of a local authority?  It looks very like it to me.</P>
    <P>I go further on to page 31.  I was very pleased with this.  It is a matter which gave me a lot of concern when I was in the European Parliament.  I was very concerned that we had a lot of very powerful businessmen in that Parliament and I do not think they were there for the MEP's salary.  They were not obliged to disclose their interest.  I therefore welcome in section 37 the obligation to disclose interest and that a person &ldquo;shall neither influence nor seek to influence a decision in relation to the matter&rdquo;.  That is perfectly right, Minister.  I would be fully in favour of that.  I do not mind people holding certain points of view &mdash; that is their business &mdash; but I do mind if they are holding that view for profit and it is solely related to their own self-interest. We should all be made aware of their self-interest before we hear their point of view on the subject.  As I said, that was a matter which concerned me greatly in the European Parliament because I saw in the Economic, Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy Committee some of the biggest companies in the Community represented by members of staff &mdash; I am not saying represented, but they were staff from these companies.  I do not think, for instance, that the chairman of companies as big as Kloeckner Steel or Ferranti Electronics were there for an MEP's salary, but they were there and they influenced the legislation without declaring their interest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1255" /> I am a bit concerned about the question of duplication with the local authorities, with sanitary authorities and with the establishment of regional environmental units.  As I understand it &mdash; I am talking now about section 42 &mdash; we already have 87 sanitary authorities and I will be surprised if there is not a great deal of overlap and confusion between all the various different interests.</P>
    <P>Section 52 (1) says:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, following consultation with the Agency and any other Minister of the Government concerned, by regulations assign to the Agency such additional functions in relation to environmental protection as from time to time he considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that is giving a lot of power to the Minister.  There should be more provision for consultation with the other agencies, such as local authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 53 (4) says:</P>
    <P>Regulations under this section may contain such incidental supplementary, consequential and transitional provisions (including provisions modifying any provision of this Act or any other enactment) as appear to the Minister to be necessary for the purposes or in consequence of, or to give full effect to, the regulations.</P>
    <P>If we look at that one carefully it almost appears as if it could undermine the whole system, but perhaps the Minister can explain it to us in greater detail; or perhaps there is some way of understanding that legalistic type of language and putting it in simpler words for simple people like myself to understand.</P>
    <P>In section 56, and indeed on page 43 in relation to local authorities, it would appear to me that there should be a right of appeal for the local authority &mdash; I do not see it mentioned in it &mdash; where the Agency is going to take local authorities to task.  Local authorities are not perfect, but I get the impression they are trying to do their best most of the time.  There <Col N="1256" /> should be a chance for them to appeal where the Agency is taking them to task.</P>
    <P>Section 61 (4) says:</P>
    <P>Where the Agency is not satisfied with the response of a local authority to a direction under subsection (3) (a), it shall consult with the local authority concerned, and if the Agency is still dissatisfied with the response following such consultation, the Agency shall carry out ... or arrange for, the monitoring concerned and the costs of the monitoring may be recovered by the Agency from the local authority as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>This will look rather silly: one public body suing another.  That is the only reading I can put into it, that they would recover the money by a simple conract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.  I would hate to see that happen.  I should imagine there would be better ways for public authorities to deal with the matter rather than resorting to the court.  In my younger days I was shown a cartoon &mdash; two farmers, one hanging onto a cow by the horns and the other hanging onto a cow by the tail.  In the middle was a solicitor, happy as could be, milking away.  If we have the situation that we will have public bodies fighting each other in court, who is going to be laughing all the way to the bank?  It will look very foolish indeed should that transpire, and I hope it will not.</P>
    <P>In regards to section 64, I am delighted about the question of transparency.  It is, with some qualifications, in this section Records shall be available for inspection by the public at all reasonable times, and, as the agency considers appropriate, such records shall be published.</P>
    <P>I was in the USA on a number of occasions in regard to the question of food, food quality and confidence in food.  One of the amazing things I found there was the operation of the Food and Drug Administration.  That administration was enjoying the confidence, according to the latest opinion poll, of more than 75 per cent of American consumers. I ask you how many regulatory <Col N="1257" /> authorities in the Community enjoy the confidence of the consumer, or how many Ministeries of Agriculture are believed when they say food is OK?  How many believed the Minister for Agriculture in Britain when Minister Currie said that most eggs were infected by salmonella? You had two Government Departments telling different stories &mdash; and of course you know who they believed.  They actually believed the one who was wrong. That is because there is no confidence anymore.  The worse the story is, the more likely they are to believe it.</P>
    <P>I had a long discussion with the Director of the FDA, Dr. Lester Crawford about why the public in America had such confidence in the FDA.  He had never been asked this question before; it had not occurred to him.  He thought about it for a while and he said, &ldquo;I am not quite sure, but I suspect it is because we are so open&rdquo;.  Anybody can walk in off the street in Washington and look at the files of the FDA.  Scientists can ask to see how the tests are carried out.  You can photostat the material and take it away with you.  Because people know it is so open, they are not actually all that interested in it anyway.  If you try to make getting of information difficult, the first thing that will come to people's minds is, &ldquo;Ah, they have something to hide&rdquo;.  So, while I compliment the Minister for the transparency he is trying to bring about, I hope some busybodies will not be able to turn this paragraph around to make it as difficult as possible for ordinary interested and concerned citizens who want to find out what is going on.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for detaining the Minister but I have a few other points I wish to raise.  Section 82 (1) deals with the question of notifying the local authority as well as applying to the Environmental Protection Agency.  Perhaps I am a bit naive, but it seems to me that, when two are involved and there is a dispute, we could end up having two public hearings, not one.  If that transpires, I can assure you it will not be very attractive at all to intending investors in our economy.  They might find it a lot easier to go somewhere where there would be just one public <Col N="1258" /> hearing.  I would like to have that point clarified.</P>
    <P>On page 70 my concern is that there seems to be no mention of withdrawing functions from the local authorities. Powers are being given to the Environmental Protection Agency, but there seems to be no question of withdrawing any of these powers from the local authorities. If that is the case &mdash; and perhaps it is not; perhaps I have not read the document particularly well &mdash; there is likely to be duplication and that is something we could well do without.</P>
    <P>Finally, in regard to intensive agriculture, I agree entirely that there has to be adequate and strict control in relation to agriculture, food processing and so on. But I would remind the Minister that there is a great deal of pollution occurring on non-intensive farms, on smaller units, smaller beef units, smaller poultry units and so on, and that this should not be overlooked.  I am thinking in particular of silage effluent, cattle slurry, washings from sprayers, sheep dips and a whole range of things.  In that respect, may I say how delighted I was to hear what Minister Kirk had to say tonight about banning strychnine, as well as all the other good things he had to say about the control of pesticides and various other things on the farm.  I do not want to go back over it again, but he did say that he was about to initiate the necessary action within the Department to ban the use by farmers of strychnine in poisoned bait.  That would bring us into line with other civilised countries.  I think it is an uncivilised way to control vermin.  It is unselective, it is cruel and it should be banned.  I hope we will have that legislation before us very soon.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the control of farmyard pollution, and I welcome that.  He has mentioned that to date he has had 28,000 applications from farmers for grants for investment in the control of farm pollution, a total investment of £173 million, and a grant aid of £38 million has already been paid.  However, having said that, I have to say that this is a particularly difficult time for farmers. They have to make this investment, and <Col N="1259" /> it is right that they should, but it is occurring at a time when farm incomes are falling dramatically.  Very shortly they will be forced, in relation to milk production, to change the stanadards in the milking parlour, the cow accommodation, milk storage and so on, all of which will cost extra money.  The net effect of that will be that milk will be forced onto the larger units.  The attraction of being able to sell their quota, combined with the penalty of having to invest to come up to the new standards, will put thousands of our smaller dairy farmers out of business and the milk quota will just go to the larger ones.</P>
    <P>Before I finish, I would again like to compliment the Minister.  I sincerely hope the Bill will have a quick passage through both Houses.  Of course, we will all be bringing in an abundance of amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Bill very much indeed.  It is a very necessary Bill.  It is an extraordinarily thorough and well prepared piece of legislation.  It is very timely and, I think, really expresses the fact that now we are, and rightly so, all environmentalists. I concur very much with many of the points which Senator Raftery made at an earlier stage.  Indeed, I sometimes think that the European Parliament's loss was perhaps our gain here in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister. I have particular pleasure in this, a Chathaoirligh, because not all that many years ago the Minister and I both began our Oireachtas careers here in this very Chamber and it is very pleasant to see her back again, albeit in a very different capacity.  Congratulations and best wishes to her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill in the Seanad is also very apposite in that earlier today, on the Order of Business, we were discussing the functions of the Seanad, the role that the Seanad should play.  It is this sort of Bill really which in many ways is perhaps particularly <Col N="1260" /> appropriate to the Seanad.  This has been shown in the various comments, the various speeches, that have been made so far.  It is a Bill on which, basically, we all agree.  That does not mean to say that no doubt there will be many suggestions made, many amendments put forward, and we are obviously at a very early stage as regards many of the detailed aspects of this very comprehensive Bill.  The Bill is one on which we will have an opportunity to expand on the role of this Chamber as the second legislative Chamber while still being a political one.  It is the Chamber in which fairly detailed reflective consideration can be given to Bills without the immediate pressures which inevitably exist in the Dáil.  On that basis also it is welcome to see this Bill before us.</P>
    <P>We all use the word &ldquo;environment&rdquo; but everyone has a different idea on what the environment is and how we define it. Some people immediately think of the greeness of the countryside.  To another person the environment is our Georgian buildings.  Yet, again, we tend to use the word &ldquo;environment&rdquo; as though it was necessarily something good.  There are very bad environments.  I am sure the last thing that the Environmental Protection Agency would wish to do is protect poor or bad environments.  We want to improve them.  Our attention to the environment comes back to the idea of the quality of life and what we mean by that.</P>
    <P>We would all consider that the environment has a major influence on the quality of life.  In some ways we are in the rather happy position of having the luxury of considering the quality of life in environmental terms.  Those of us who have any connections with the west of Ireland, as the Minister has, will know the saying: &ldquo;you cannot eat the scenery&rdquo;. It is very beautiful and environmentally it is magnificent but unfortunately it does not provide many jobs.  However, we know an attractive environment enhances the quality of life.  We must balance the attractive aspects of the environment with those other necessary aspects which go to make up the quality <Col N="1261" /> of life.  The Minister spoke about this and has attempted to do so in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Some years ago we considered that the quality of life demanded industrial development.  We rightly take pride in the tremendous strides which took place in the sixties in the Lemass years.  We did it at that stage without thinking too much about the environmental aspects of our society.  Today we must be very conscious of the fact that in a poor, poverty stricken nation somewhere in Africa, Asia or South America it can sound very superior, hypocritical and selfish to talk about environmental issues and condemn these people That is not to say that there cannot be a balance.</P>
    <P>Good industrial development can be balanced with and can be enhanced and improved by a proper attitude towards the environment.  It is not easy for someone who is simply looking for a job or trying to feed himself and his family, as Senator Raftery suggested a few minutes ago, if the emphasis is totally on some selfish attitude towards a particular aspect of the environment.  We have a problem here.  We spoke in this House about the developed world in terms of starvation and feeding.  How do you balance the environmental aspects of &ldquo;improving&rdquo; agriculture in Third World countries?</P>
    <P>We come back then to the second aspect of the quality of life in this country. We talk about improvements in agriculture. One very obvious improvement would be to have larger fields rather than the smaller ones which are so very attractive looking but in terms of mechanised agriculture may be inefficient or uneconomic. We encouraged farmers to improve their farms by taking down hedges and so on.  Now we realise that can be overdone.  The destruction of hedge habitat can have a deleterious effect on agriculture and the gain may be short term and limited.  Looking at the quality of life in terms of an improvement here does not necessarily mean that there is not a disimprovement somewhere else. How do you balance, for example, something that we were very proud of and quite rightly boasted of, namely, arterial <Col N="1262" /> drainage, in environmental terms? Arterial drainage is necessary in many aspects, yet at the same time it is extraordinary damaging in other aspects. When we talk about the quality of life we are trying very often to balance various aspects, to balance introducing an industry into an area and the jobs it will create with the inevitable disturbance of the environment, to balance having an agriculture which is efficient and competitive with the inevitable changes it will cause to the ecology or drainage of the area.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the extraordinary growth in the city of Dublin.  For a number of years we were the fastest growing city in Europe.  The Dublin which I and the Minister knew as children has changed out of all recognition.  The constituency for which the Minister sits was non-existent a few years ago.  Tallaght was a tiny rural village.  Now it has totally changed, in some ways for the better, in other ways perhaps not.  There is a quality of life there.  The essential need to provide housing must be balanced with the environmental effects. Yet, we are proud, and rightly so, of the housing which is being provided.</P>
    <P>An aspect which Senator Mooney touched on in his contribution was that for many years tremendous emphasis was placed on afforestation.  We were very concerned about the fact that this country had fewer trees than virtually any other country in western Europe.  In our efforts to right that we encouraged afforestation, mainly of trees which grew quickly.  As Senator Mooney said, we have the fastest rate of tree growth of any country in Europe.  Close to his own constituency when German foresters came here 20 years ago the rate of growth was so much above normal that they had to literally invent a new measure to allow for the rate of growth.  The afforestation of the countryside, very necessary and in many ways, was also injuring the quality of life and the quality of the environment. Again you could look at that in several different ways.  From a scenic point of view, many tourists are devastated to see the way in which we have beautiful hillsides which are covered with nurseries <Col N="1263" /> for evergreen trees.  Some of them are totally unsuitable and do not enhance the reputation of this country.  We are beginning to realise that the various effects which afforestation has on water supplies can be quite significant.  Here is something which, on the one hand, seems to have a beneficial effect and enhances the quality of life, but when tackled in an inappropriate manner it does not necessarily lead to an improvement in the environment or in the quality of life.</P>
    <P>I differ with Senator Raftery in his reference to local authorities.  I am sure he did not mean it quite as it sounded. Some local authorities have been negligent. Many of us serve on local authorities and know that they often, under extremely difficult conditions, make strong efforts to look after the environmental impacts of their activities.  There may be one or two exceptions but most of them are trying very hard.  It takes an enormous amount of time, effort and finance.  We are still learning about various aspects of the environment and its maintenance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator must be going back to Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Honan could be right there.  As regards native areas, if you talk to a real Dub about natural areas, to him that will be a few miles beyond the Minister's constituency where there are green fields.  As far as he is concerned that is nature, away out in the countryside.  Somebody else may consider that a natural area is somewhere you have a national park or something of that kind.  To somebody else it is where you have virtually primeval conditions. Senator Raftery mentioned beauty being in the eye of the beholder and he spoke of various plants and weeds that are found around a certain institute.  There are those who would argue that if you really want to preserve such an area, if you are truly an environmentalist, you should have areas like this since they have ecological attractions for certain types of <Col N="1264" /> birds and so on.  Preserving the environment is relative because while each of us knows what we mean by it, to get a consensus is more difficult.</P>
      <P>One of the aspects of the Bill which I like very much is the fact that there will be a relationship with the European Environmental Agency.  Our agency is primarily, and in some ways very tightly, limited to the situation in this country but there are various aspects of environmental change that do not respect land borders.  Pollution, for example, is no respecter of frontiers.  Acid rain, dust and so on cross frontiers without the slightest respect for any national boundaries. Amid the other horrors of the Gulf war at present is the inevitable ecological disaster which will result from the greatest oil spillage in history.  Whoever is to be blamed for it, the reality is that it is happening and one of the finest seas in the world is now being polluted in a manner which will have an effect for years to come.  Oil pollution does not respect territorial boundaries, be they three miles or 50 miles or 200 miles.</P>
      <P>We have a deserved reputation for our pollution-free atmosphere in terms of fresh air and pure water.  By mainline European standards our fresh air and pure water is extraordinarily high.  Unfortunately if we look at the sea between ourselves and our neighbouring island we have a very different situation.  We have possibly one of the most polluted seas in the world.  I know I am verging onto the territory of the Minister for the Marine but we are talking about environmental protection.  It is an aspect that we need to look at again.  A major international effort is needed to clean up the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>As regards fossil fuels, their use and how we derive energy, there are discordant attitudes and views on this.  We rightly are very annoyed at what has happened in regard to atomic energy stations in the United Kingdom.  It is disgraceful. It is another example of environmental change not respecting boundaries.  Fossil fuels have a pollutant effect of their own. We in this city know the effects of burning coal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some countries regard nuclear stations <Col N="1265" /> as something which must be stopped at almost any cost and there are very good arguments for this.  Other countries believe that nuclear fuel is the answer to environmental energy issues and are strongly pushing the provision of nuclear fuel installations.  It must be looked at on an international basis because, as we saw with Chernobyl, radiation is no respecter of frontiers and we are far closer to a series of nuclear power stations than we are to Chernobyl.</P>
    <P>There are a number of aspects to the Bill and in the explanatory memorandum they are summed up under four headings. First, we have control and regulation of schedule activities likely to pose a major risk to environmental quality.  This in many ways is the prime purpose of the agency in the first instance.  In some ways we have been very neglectful of our environment but however the situation may have been in the past, our interpretation of environmental regulations now is extremely tight.  Probably only Holland and West Germany have an equally strict interpretation of the European Community regulations which have been promulgated over the past few years.  We have far tighter environmental regulations in this part of Ireland than exist in that part which relates to the United Kingdom.  We have very severe and stringent regulations, and quite rightly.</P>
    <P>I suppose in some ways the gauge of whether a Bill is good or bad depends upon the amount of criticism or praise it gets from certain quarters.  I obviously have an industrial interest but one would have to say that this Bill is necessary even though it is stringent, and there are many sections on which we may well have discussions later and even though there are sections which the CII have commented on.  It will be beneficial to those industries and companies who are rightly concerned about the environment.  The environment affects us all.  The workplace is also part of the environment.  We spend most of our time working in a business, factory, school, hospital or wherever, and the environment in these places is of great <Col N="1266" /> importance.  Some modern office environments, for example could bear scrutiny. They are not necessarily beneficial, although they may be very modem.  All this control and regulation is in many ways meaningless unless we monitor the quality of the environment.  This is crucial. We can have a series of regulations and the swingeing fines that are mentioned here of £10 million, imprisonment and so on but if we do not have an effective programme of monitoring environmental quality we have no serious basis on which to maintain the environment.</P>
    <P>This monitoring can cover a wide range of aspects some of them self-evident and obvious, for example, the degree of air pollution.  Fortunately in most areas we have very pure air but that was not the case in Dublin until we brought in the recent smokeless fuel legislation.  It must be monitored.  If you do not have a base line above which you can talk about the actual levels of dust or whatever may be in the air, it is very hard to say if an industry is contaminating it.  When an industry is established it is crucial that such a factor be monitored.  It is, perhaps, even more important to monitor water. It may be that there is sediment in the water or other substances.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects which should be considered in relation to any base line study and these can cover an extraordinarily wide range of factors.  Two of these which, until recently, were relatively neglected, were the archaeological and architectural aspects.  We lost a large number of archaeological sites.  We are fortunate in that we have so many but this has the side effect that we take them for granted.  In the United States or Canada they would literally give millions for what we take for granted.  We have them on virtually every piece of land.  It is essential that such sites be recognised and monitored when industry, agricultural or otherwise, sets up there.  Some of the early environmental legislation related to the maintenance of architectural and archaeological sites.  The United Kingdom Monument Protection Act, 1882, was one of the first cultural heritage protection Acts and it still <Col N="1267" /> applies in this country.  This agency will be a tremendous help in that respect. Although the Office of Public Works have done good work there is much more that needs to be done.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which has to be considered, in some ways perhaps the most important, is the socio-economic environment and what effects any given change, be it an industry, a hospital or housing development, will have on the socio-economic pattern of a given area. We tend to rush where development is concerned.  Dublin County Council were taking about siting new towns on the north and south sides of Dublin, and so on.  One was very worried because one thought of such areas as Tallaght where very well intentioned housing development was not accompanied by sufficient concern for the socio-economic effects. Some of these were very obvious.  We now have a town centre in Tallaght.  It was a long, long time coming.  There were other aspects, such as the social effects of moving people from a city centre area to somewhere, which to them, was virtually the countryside.</P>
    <P>Many environmental declarations have been made at one time or another, but one of the major post-war ones was the Venice Declaration of the conservation and restoration of monuments and sites. Perhaps a more important one was the European water charter in 1968.  That was the first time we really began to take seriously both the effects of pollution of water and also the importance of water and the fact that, strange though it may seem at times to this country, it is a relatively scarce resource.  I have great sympathy with our Celtic colleagues in Wales who feel that they should be entitled to be paid by Birmingham and other urban centres for piping water to those areas.  Why, indeed, should water be regarded as something that is free and oil be regarded as something for which enormous charges may be made?  They are both natural resources.  We might, with great difficulty, do without oil but we certainly could not do without water. <Col N="1268" /> Since we have so many lakes, rivers, streams and rainy days we tend to take water for granted.  This has changed a little over the last few years.  I mentioned arterial drainage and how it could have deleterious effects, but there are other things with which we are familiar, for example, the concentration of pig farming into fairly large units.  This tended-to mean that pig slurry had to be discharged in large volumes in certain limited areas.  Quite apart from any question of odour &mdash; some people would say it is a pleasant odour; others might not perhaps agree &mdash; there were very serious effects on water.  We tend to boast of our tourism and fishing but many of our very good fishing lakes were totally destroyed by discharge of pig slurry.  In fact, water resources in many ways are very limited and they are easily contaminated and very expensive to deal with.  Reservoirs are perhaps among the most expensive of civil structures that one can put up. Pipelines are extremely expensive.  Contamination can occur extraordinarily easily and yet if you have ever been short of water you know how difficult it is.</P>
    <P>I live in an area which has always had piped water but having spent a lot of my childhood where you actually had to go to a well and come back with a bucket of water causes one to appreciate its value and also its weight.  Water is a very precious element and is particularly important in this country.  It is only when we go abroad to certain other countries that we realise that there is something different about the countryside and that there are very few, if any, lakes and relatively few rivers.  When you fly into this country you can see the greenness, the colour associated with a clean environment; certainly just to fly into Dublin Airport enables you to see the difference in the grass.</P>

      <P>Knock also and to any airport I have left out.  What about Cork Airport?</P>
      <P>I suppose one of the most important aspects of the environment is water.  One of the first environmenal Acts in the UK related to waterworks.  The 1847 Act was an Act dealing with water supply and with pollution of water.  Water is very important and perhaps at times its value is taken for granted.  As an independent Government our first Act related to monuments; that was the National Monument Act of 1930.  This was followed by the Foreshore Act three years later.  Then we had a period of many years before we had an Act which had any serious connection with environmental aspects and the next one was a very incidental one dealing with the establishment of Bord na Móna in 1946. There was some mention in that Act, the Turf Development Act, of possible changes; I do not think they were called environmental aspects.</P>
      <P>One of the great success stories of this country has been Bord na Móna and turf development, despite the difficulties of the past few years.  We run into a contradiction here in that Ireland is unique in having turf which we take for granted; we take boglands for granted but there are very few countries in western Europe and indeed throughout most of the world who have such unique and indeed beautiful areas.  Many of us have gone to play or have been in such areas and they really are beautiful.  A lot of them have been destroyed, and maybe for good reasons, but we should pay more attention to retaining these boglands which we take for granted.  We are inclined to laugh at them and yet they are unique to this country and they are something which visitors from abroad find so very beautiful. Scientists and ecologists find these areas tremendously interesting and important and I think we have to try and give them more importance and more emphasis than perhaps we have done to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another environmental area which we have tended to neglect has been the area of town planning.  I think we now have a <Col N="1270" /> much more sensitive outlook on town planning and on its environmental aspects.  The attempted destruction at one stage, of Georgian Dublin by developers, some of them perhaps rapacious, some of them perhaps very well intentioned, was the first major organised movement in this country relating to the environment.  We were destroying one of the most attractive elements of this country and of this city.  We had this marvellous, unique environment, and the environment includes the visual aspect as much as anything else.  Some of our town developments and planning left a lot to be desired.  Thank goodness that is now very much improved.</P>
    <P>I think it is excellent that the agency will be concerned with the promotion and the co-ordination of environmental research.  The whole environmental area covers everything relating to the quality of life as a whole and yet it is relatively new in the sense that only in the past few years we have begun to co-ordinate our thoughts on other developments and on the quality of life with consideration for environmental aspects.  We have so many unique features in this country that deserve to be promoted, whether boglands or water.</P>
    <P>Since Senator Honan has mentioned the Shannon, let us recall that the Shannon is not only the main river in these islands; it is one of the main rivers of Europe.  It is very tiny compared to the Rhine or the Rhone or some of these other rivers but it is by far the least used, the most free, the most open river of any significance in western Europe.  Any of us who have seen such rivers as the Rhine, which sadly these days is extremely polluted, will know it is extremely crowded. Any of us who has visited the Fens in the east of England and the waterways there will know that you have barges and cruise launches forming queues.  There are so many of them that quite often in a whole stretch of waterway you would see 100 or perhaps 200 launches or barges.  On the Shannon you could travel for miles and you would be lucky to see one other cruise launch.  There we have a situation <Col N="1271" /> which is unique, magnificent and which we tend to take for granted.</P>
    <P>I know that more and more Irish people are taking cruise holidays but nonetheless it is my understanding that the vast majority of people who do so are visitors from outside this country, from Germany, France and from the United Kingdom, who find it almost unbelievable that we have such an unspoilt series of waterways.  It is one of the magnificent features of this country.  Perhaps at times we do not fully realise what a marvellous and beautiful country we have.  It is one of the good aspects of this Bill that there is now going to be an agency which will be concerned with protecting our environment and not simply with taking it for granted.</P>
    <P>On the question of the provision of support, back-up and advisory services to the public authorities, we have heard a lot of criticism of our public authorities. They have been trying to do a very good job in very difficult circumstances, but quite apart from the question of the finances and persons involved and quite apart from their many other difficulties, one of the great difficulties was indeed this lack of support, back-up and knowledge of where to turn to get advice.  It is one of the most imaginative and yet at the same time practical aspects of this Bill that this is going to be a major function of the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>At one stage I mentioned the offences and penalties and I think one of our great difficulties here in regard to the environment has been that we have not had an agency such as this, nor a proper monitoring system; neither have we had carefully researched base lines nor any serious system of prosecution.  Unfortunately, it is necessary in what we hope is but a small number of cases to have these powers.  It is very good indeed that they have been made so severe because I think to have had anything less than these sort of fines and provisions would have suggested that we were not ultimately serious about this Bill, or about the environment.  When you are prepared to put forward a Bill and state that on conviction on indictment a <Col N="1272" /> fine of £10 million is liable, it is sufficient to make any company, no matter how large a multinational it may be, think twice before treating the environment without proper consideration.  If you add on to that the possibility of ten years' imprisonment the Minister can reasonably say that the penalties are more than sufficient to make people take the Act very seriously, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>There are a few points I would like very briefly to mention before I conclude. One of them is in relation to noise.  I know it is a very difficult subject, and is particularly so in this country, but there are Acts in North America, the United Kingdom and elsewhere in relation to civil aviation, in relation to noise abatement, in relation to planning and noise and I hope that it will be possible, through this agency, to take steps because noise is a pollutant of the environment and needs to be taken seriously.</P>
    <P>Coming slightly closer to my own profession, I hope that as the research aspect and other aspects of this agency progress and as our thinking and legislation progresses such Acts as ones corresponding to the Poisons Act and to the Carcinogenic Substances Act may be enacted.  The Minister may, perhaps, bear these in mind because there is a great deal that needs to be done in this country in that respect.</P>
    <P>I would like also to pay tribute to all those in the local authorities and in Government agencies who have done a great deal to maintain our environment despite the difficult circumstances.  I express congratulations again to the Minister and to those working with her for bringing in such a thorough, comprehensive, well thought out Act and I look forward to supporting it.  I look forward to discussing its various sections in more detail.  I believe that all of us who are connected with industry and all of us, in our private and personal capacities, can only welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill.  I realise that Minister Harney has put a lot of work into the Bill and <Col N="1273" /> has had consultations with various groups interested in the environment and has sought their views.  That was a very good start in the introduction of the Bill.  It is particularly satisfying to see the Bill being introduced in the Seanad and again I would like to congratulate her and the Government for giving this House the opportunity of discussing this Bill, of teasing it out and making some observations on the legislation.  The Bill is one of the most important and necessary pieces of legislation to appear in a long time.  Indeed, the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency is very much overdue.  The protection of the environment and the promotion of Ireland's natural assets have assumed great importance in recent years.  We have great natural assets and we should be very proud of them.  We have rivers and lakes, which are renowned worldwide, and lush green pastures, and it would be a shame to see those polluted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is now a public awareness of the need to protect our environment and the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency will strengthen our efforts to achieve this worthy objective.  The agency will be charged with the responsibility for overseeing, controlling and regulating various activities which may be regarded as prejudicial to the quality of the environment.  The agency will also provide the supporting advisory service for the benefit of public authorities.  In this way a more informed approach will be taken to environmental matters.  Of course we will now have the benefit of an independent assessor with a bank expertise which will have due regard to all processes which might impinge on the environment.  This will be very useful particularly in the area of industrial development.  We have seen the kind of confrontation that can occur between environmentalists and industrialists and the bad feeling generated by such confrontation. This is where this agency will come into its own in setting out well-defined rational and balanced public policy parameters which any industrialist can follow.  An industrialist will know what the environmental requirements are <Col N="1274" /> for setting up an industry in a particular area.</P>
    <P>We are all anxious to encourage employment but not at any price, and certainly not by sacrificing our environment. Neither would I want to encourage spurious opposition which could have detrimental consequences for employment in the long term.  What is needed is balance and I feel that the Environmental Protection Agency can provide both that balance and the independent approach and advice necessary in such situations and so will allow environmental conservation and economic devlopment to proceed in tandem.</P>
    <P>This Bill will also have implications for the functions, powers and financial resources of local authorities.  Section 60 of the Bill would give to the Environmental Protection Agency, in certain circumstances, power to direct a local authority to perform a statutory function in relation to environmental protection and to require the local authority to carry out specified works.  It also provides that if the local authority does not carry out the terms of the directive the agency can itself undertake the action and recover the cost from the local authority.</P>
    <P>Section 58 deals with sewage and other effluent in a situation where the Minister for the Environment has prescribed standards for effluents being discharged into waters from sanitary authority treatment plants.  The agency is given power to specify the nature and frequency of the monitoring which the local authorities are to carry out in respect of such discharges. If the agency is not satisfied with the discharges or with the activities of the local authority, it may undertake the monitoring itself and recover the costs from the local authority.</P>
    <P>Section 59 deals with landfill sites for waste disposal.  Again, this section empowers the agency to specify criteria and procedures for the selection, management and operation by local authorities of landfill sites for the disposal of domestic and other waste.  Local authorities must carry out whatever monitoring the agency specifies.  If they are not satisfied, the agency may carry out <Col N="1275" /> the monitoring and recover the costs from the local authority.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (5) of this section a local authority is required to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure compliance with the criteria and procedures specified by the agency covering management of landfill sites.  Sections 97 and 98 permit the Minister by order to transfer to the agency any provisions of the Local Authority (Water Pollution) Act, 1977 and of the Air Pollution Act, 1987. Section 30 enables the Minister to transfer local authority staff to the agency in specified situations.  All these provisions are going to impose certain obligations on local authorities but there is no provision whereby the local authorities can recoup the costs from central Government.  I think it is only right that they should be compensated for any work they carry out on behalf of the agency.</P>
    <P>A couple of years ago outrage was expressed at the level of pollution in our rivers and lakes.  Daily we read of stretches of rivers in every part of the country being polluted by effluent from farmyards, silage pits etc.  In recent times we have seen a significant improvement in this area, thanks to grants made available by the Department of Agriculture and Food and by the Department of the Environment and also because of the educational programmes which have made people more aware of their responsibilities to the environment.  I must say that farmers in particular are making a determined effort to clean up their act in relation to pollution and have availed of grants and the advice to do so.  More could be done in our schools to make children aware of their responsibilities to the environment.  They, in turn, could influence their parents and elders and if that happened we might see less of the indiscriminate dumping of rubbish by the roadside in rural areas.  I believe the people who do this should be punished and the local authorities who have the power to prosecute should be vigilant and should let it be known that they are not prepared to tolerate the despoiling of our countryside.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> We all know of areas where rubbish is got rid of during the night hours and the terrible thing about it is that many items of rubbish could be burned in the backyard of the places they come from.  Plastic bags, silage covers; all of these could be burned, they are most unsightly.  The same goes for crashed cars.  We have seen cars and other items dumped by the roadside.  It is shameful that this should be allowed to happen.  I hope local authorities who have the power to prosecute will do so.  I am not sure they make a good effort to catch the people who are doing this dumping but the culprits are known in every parish and I hope the local authorities will take action.</P>
    <P>It is going to take perhaps a couple of years before this agency gets going.</P>
    <P>There will be teething problems but I think it is very important that it be set up immediately.  It must also be given the money necessary to carry out its duties.  I understand there is a budget of £8 million provided for the agency.  I am not sure if that is enough but at least it is getting it off the ground and I am sure if more money is needed the Government will be willing to provide it, because it will be one of the most important agencies to have been set up for a long number of years.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Kiely that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House he wishes to deal with the need for the Minister for the Marine to make funds available for the repairs to the coastline in County Kerry, damaged in the recent storms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I want to <Col N="1277" /> say that I will be sharing my time with my colleague Senator Foley.  I welcome the Tánaiste and Minister for the Marine to the House and I want to thank him sincerely for taking this important matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>For too many years I have seen the result of storm damage all over the country, particularly in the west, in my own county, Kerry.  Over the last number of years there has been some extraordinary storm damage.  One exceptional storm occurred on 5 January this year when gusts reached 100 mph.  At that time I called for a special meeting of Kerry County Council to assess the storm damage so that we could make a submission to the Department of the Environment. I was a little taken a back when I found out at that meeting that the Department of the Environment just covered storm damage to local authority properties, such as harbours and piers, road infrastructures and water installations, things that were under the jurisdiction of the local authorities.  However, they did not deal with damage to boats or gear, coastal erosion and so on.</P>
      <P>Living on the periphery of the country and, particularly, as the most south westerly county in Ireland, we in Kerry and indeed, all those along the west coast, are subjected to severe storm damage from time to time.  We have become accustomed to storms over the years and we do not whinge about them, but the last one was horrific.  However, when there is damage to the eastern side of the country, like the flooding we saw a few years ago, when the Dodder river burst its banks, there was a public outcry.  A fund of some kind should be set up, something along the lines of the fund in place in the Department of the Environment for coastal erosion to private property, in particular, semi-public type property &mdash; such as golf clubs, sporting facilities, community efforts and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much work has already been done by local authorities in counties such as Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Kerry.  In fact, Kerry have got a lot of money; the Ballybunion golf club in particular have got assistance to construct some gabions. <Col N="1278" /> During the last storm, in the region of £300,000 worth of damage was done to the coast line around the golf course.  The gabions that were installed were completely undermined.  The sand shifted and the gabions were swept out to the sea. The Minister knows well that the Ballybunion golf club is rated in the top six or seven golf courses in the world and people like Tom Watson and other international stars have played there.  Indeed, Ministers from various Governments have frequently used that golf course. During the last storm the 18th, 17th and 11th holes were severely damaged by coastal erosion and unless immediate actions is taken this very valuable asset, not alone to Kerry and to the country, but to a seaside town like Ballybunion, will completely disappear.</P>
    <P>There is a logical solution to the problem in Ballybunion and Ballybunion golf course.  A permanent structure on the lines of a promenade of reinforced concrete could be constructed and this, in turn, could be used as a tourist amenity for people visiting the seaside resort for facilities other than golf.  This could be an effort headed by the Minister in the Department of the Marine, the Department of the Environment, Kerry County Council, the Shannon Development Authority, the Ballybunion golf club and the Ballybunion Development Association&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications. The Shannon Development Company are responsible for tourism in that region.  If something like a permanent promenade was constructed over a period of four to five years &mdash; it could not all be done in one year because the money would not be available &mdash; it would alleviate this problem.  Apart from Ballybunion there was damage to the coastline from Tarbert down through Ballylongford into Beale, Ballybunion, <Col N="1279" /> Kerry Head, back into Fenit, Tralee Harbour, Castlegregory, all the way down into the peninsula and into Dingle. Dingle did not suffer as badly as other areas because of the large rock formations there.  They do not suffer from coastal erosion, just from other damage. In mentioning Dingle I must mention the wreck, the <i>Ratanga</i> that was washed up there some years ago and which is still there.  It is an eyesore on Slea Head and nobody seems to be taking responsibility for it.  The local authority say it is not their responsibility and the Department of the Environment say it is not theirs. At the same time, the local authority seem to be responsible for oil spillage on the beach and so forth.  There was a similar type accident off Bantry Bay with the <i>Kowloon Bridge.</i>  That was washed up on one of the best herring beds off the west coast and caused a huge oil spillage. There was also other damage along the coastline.  A fund will have to be set up in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a member of the RDO for a number of years but they have now been abolished.  While I was on that committee I visited a number of PMR conferences abroad.  A peripheral coastal erosion fund was set up through that organisation and I would like to know if the Minister's Department can get any money from either the Structural Funds or through the CPMR for coastal erosion.  It has been brought to my attention that the Scottish Islands got a very substantial amount of EC funding towards remedying coastal erosion.  I was there the time the proposal went through the CPMR.  I would like to thank the Minister for the Environment and the Department of the Environment for their swift action in the response to the recent storms and in particular the local authorities for keeping the networks in operation during the recent snowfalls.  The funding they have put in place over the last number of years seems to be operating successfully and that is why I put down this motion. I again thank the Minister for being here and I ask him to see if some type of fund <Col N="1280" /> could be put in place to protect our very important coastline.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I want to thank Senator Kiely for allocating me some of his time to speak on this very important Adjournment matter.  I also endorse his words of welcome to the Minister for coming to the House tonight.  I hope in the few minutes to support my colleague, Senator Kiely, in the excellent presentation he made of the severe damage done to the coastline in the Ballybunion-Ballyheigue area in County Kerry.</P>
      <P>I want to refer in particular to the championship golf course in Ballybunion. It is world renowned and is so claimed by top golfers throughout the world.  I hope to put in clear and graphic form the horrific damage done to this beautiful golf course during the December storm.  As a member of Kerry County Council I attended a meeting on the beach some three weeks ago.  The county engineer was present and I was shocked at the overall condition of the beach which has affected the golf club.  As Senator Kiely mentioned, it is quite possible they will lose at least three of the holes on the golf course.</P>
      <P>Ballybunion Golf Club forms a vital part of tourism locally and of Kerry's tourism amenity and economy.  An overall programme of conservation must be put in place now for the golf course if it is to be protected from further devastation and so maintain its position as one of the world's top championship golf courses. In the past number of years there has been massive erosion of Ballybunion beach.  A major capital plan is required to deal with the problem and this must be implemented immediately.  While it will be very expensive, it is necessary. Ballybunion Golf Club over the years have spent vast sums of money from their own resources in developing this wonderful club premises and also the beach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Storm damage has also been caused to Cashen in Ballyduff.  This has been ongoing over a number of years.  Many families here depend on fishing for a livelihood and if immediate remedial <Col N="1281" /> work is not carried out, their livelihood will be lost as Cashen will be rendered useless for fishing.  Here, again, a major capital scheme is needed for Cashen.  I appeal to the Minister to give it the priority it deserves as the community have been very patient for years but they are now demanding action, and rightly so.  I look forward to a favourable response from the Minister.</P>
    <P>Kerry Head in Ballyheigue, where a number of families also depend on fishing for their income has been badly affected as the result of the recent storm damage. A submission has been made for urgent repairs to the Dromatoor Pier which services the area.  Many families are also threatened at Carrigisland, Ballylong-ford, and a beautiful beach nearby has been almost washed away.  We in Kerry are very proud of our coastline which is a natural asset and tourist amenity.  This is why I am very concerned about the damage caused to this tremendous asset as a result of storm damage, not alone this year but over many years.</P>
    <P>The general cost of the damage in Ballybunion, Cashen, Kerryhead and Carrigisland in terms of temporary work was originally estimated at approximately £300,000.  That figure now has been updated to almost £500,000.  The extent of the damage caused cannot be overstated.  I ask the Minister to make funds available immediately to Kerry County Council.  The county engineer has recently indicated that he would need approximately £7 million to carry out a proper coastal protection scheme in County Kerry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>Initially I should say that my Department have not, so far at any rate, received a submission from Kerry County Council in respect of damage to the Kerry coastline arising from storms in January of this year.  Accordingly, I do not have the details of the extent of any repairs that may be required.  I have on a number of occasions in the past adverted to the fact that primary responsibility in relation to repairs of coastal storm damage rests with coastal local authorities.  For example, county councils are responsible for the <Col N="1282" /> maintenance of the vast majority of piers and sea walls.  My Department's role is generally to help with development works, usually in the fishery interests, at harbours or with coastal protection schemes of a capital nature.  However, in 1990 as an exceptional measure, the Government approved an £8 million special storm damage package of which £3 million was allocated to Roinn na Mara to assist local authorities with repairs to harbours, piers and other marine damage arising from the abnormally severe storms in the winter of 1989-90.  Of this sum £158,750 was paid by my Department to Kerry County Council.  I notice that Senator Kiely, when thanking the Department of the Marine, did not thank me for that £158,750.</P>
      <P>As to the question of damage arising from the storms this year, I have to be straightforward and say that for 1991 no special storm damage package, equivalent to that of 1990, has been made available as yet.  Accordingly, my Department have no funds with which they can assist local authorities with any repairs that may be necessary following the storms in early January.  Storms are a recurring problem and in 1990 the position was so severe that the Government used the relatively favourable budgetary position to allocate additional funds to coastal local authorities. However, the Government are not in a position to provide such a package every time a storm hits the country.  I fully recognise that storms may create greater difficulties for some counties than for others and my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, is aware of that.</P>
      <P>The two Senators made strong cases for their own county.  I take the point made by Senator Kiely that very often small damage on the eastern coast is highlighted, particularly in the media, while damage in the west or south-west very often does not hit the same headlines, possibly because they are further away and more difficult to examine and highlight.</P>

    <P>I accept that Ballybunion Golf Club is something special.  It is, as has been said <Col N="1283" /> by both Senators, world famous and is a great tourist amenity in the area.  I was interested to hear Senator Kiely mention the CPMR and the Structural Funds.  I tried very hard last year to get money from the Structural Funds for storm damage but there was absolutely no help whatsoever available from the Funds.  I would be interested to hear exactly from the Senator what funds Scotland called upon.</P>
    <P>We must make a distinction between storm damage and coastal erosion.  As I said, the storm damage function is mainly one for the local authority and coastal erosion is dealt with by the Department <Col N="1284" /> of the Marine.  I took over responsibility for that on 1 January 1990 and I had £150,000 in total in my Estimate to cover that particular subhead.</P>
    <P>With the traditional love of the Kerryman for his native kingdom I appreciate what inspired the two Senators to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I have outlined the exact position with regard to my own Department.  If funds are available to me, no doubt I will be in a position to be as generous to Kerry in 1991 and I was in 1990.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 14 February 1991.</P>
