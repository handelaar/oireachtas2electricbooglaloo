      <P>I have notice from Senator McGowan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to outline the progress of the Foyle Fisheries Commission and the problems of alleged pollution of the River Foyle.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to fulfil her commitment to construct a second level school at Rathkeale, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators McGowan and Neville as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator McGowan's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Neville may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to continue Committee Stage of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, item No. 2 on <Col N="894" /> the Order Paper, to 6 p.m. and to have a sos between 6 p.m. and 6.30 p.m.  At 6.30 p.m. we will resume discussion on Fianna Fáil motion dealing with the designation of Dublin by the EC as European City of Culture for 1991.  From 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. we will have a debate on Second Stage of item No. 3, the Radiological Protection Bill, 1990.</P>

      <P>While I do not think it necessary that we would have a debate on it, it is important that the ESB dispute be mentioned.  As Energy spokesperson and on behalf of this group, I support the call of our party leader to have possibly some sort of all-party approach in relation to it.  In the meantime I am sure I speak for all Members of the House when I urge that work be resumed pending further talks and, hopefully, leading&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I must encourage the Senator to ask the Leader of the House a question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to take on board what I have said and I am sure all Members here would agree with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I ask the Leader, first, if he has any further information on a debate on the prisons system and, secondly, could he tell us about any further Government legislation that he anticipates will be introduced in this House?  We can offer him a long list of legislation we will introduce if he is short of business.  I would specifically like to ask him if he will ask the Minister for Education to introduce the Colleges Bill.  There are many Members elected here who represent education and, as has been said before, it is a pity they do not let educationists select them.  It would be a wonderful exercise in democracy if they did.  Nevertheless, there are many Members of this House who have an identification with <Col N="895" /> education and a number of us here represent graduates of a selection of third level education.  It would be useful and I would like the Leader to ask the Minister for Education if the Colleges Bill, when published, is to be introduced in this House.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader of the House if he would be prepared to make time available at some stage in the near future for a debate on broadcasting arising from the difficulties in a number of independent broadcasting stations at present?  Secondly, may I ask the Leader of the House if he would confirm that the document which had just been circulated, which is described as a &ldquo;Suggested timetable for Seanad Committee debate and so on in relation to the Radiological Protection Bill&rdquo; is just a suggestion and can he also confirm that it will not lead to debate being limited on the Environmental Protection Agency Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, may I ask the Leader of the House if he has any further information of any other defections from the Independents to Fine Gael?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not relevant to the Order of Business.  I am sure it is not within the competence of the Leader of the House either.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision has sent a shiver down through the ranks of the whole political spectrum.  I am wondering how the Senator's decision will be received in Fine Gael, particularly in the areas where the Senator has expressed opinions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I must advice the Senator that it is totally irrelevant.  His contribution has no bearing on the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he has any information with regard to the introduction of the Local Government Reform Bill? <Col N="896" /> When will it be introduced and will it be introduced in this House?  I would like to point out to the Leader of the House that there are only eight weeks left for the introduction of this Bill if it is to become law before the local elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to ask about Senator Ross joining the Blueshirts, but you have already ruled this out of order so I probably will not ask it now.  I think it begs the question as to whether the Independents will now be a group without their esteemed Member when he does join Fine Gael?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether to congratulate or sympathise with Senator Ross but I certainly wish him well in his new role.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ross has no special provision under Standing Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am shocked by that omission from Standing Orders.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It covers you though.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was always regarded as an exceptional person here and I am glad you accept that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello without interruption please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely thought it was appropriate to refer to one of our distinguished Members who has made a career move and I wish him well.  In the context of a number of developments in relation to education &mdash; the Minister has made statements in relation to the creation of a new school model which is very vague at present and has also promised that a White Paper on Education will be available early in 1991 &mdash; will these and other matters that we have raised over the weeks encourage the Leader of the House to see if that debate on education <Col N="897" /> could be brought forward as soon as possible?</P>
      <P>Secondly, the other almost perennial question is that of the debate on the prisons system.  I know the Leader of the House has made commitments, but unfortunately these commitments are not coming to fruition and almost weekly now we have one or other very tragic event taking place in the prisons.  I urge the Leader of the House to bring that matter forward also.</P>
      <P>Finally, may I again ask the Leader of the House, in regard to the invitation to Mr. De Klerk, President of South Africa, if there could be some way in which statements could be made, seeing that an invitation from the Government has issued.  He will be here tommorrow and perhaps there is some way that some statements could be made in relation to the situation in South Africa, which has been a matter of very grave concern to Irish people for many decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I repeat my question of last week and ask the Leader of the House to arrange a debate on agriculture as soon as possible in view of the changes that are being proposed in the Common Agricultural Policy at present, changes that will have an effect on agriculture in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he has received any indication from the Minister for Health that he proposes to act on the findings of the high powered commissions that were set up in the health area and if he has received an indication from the Minister for Health that all of these commissions have reported.  It would be appropriate for the Leader of the House to receive this information from the Minister and, if possible, have a short debate in this House and what it is proposed to do about the health services, given that there is a crisis as regards the waiting lists.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Hussey's call for a debate on agriculture whenever that can be arranged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a unique occasion in this country in the past few days when the IFA and the Department of Agriculture agreed on a particular case.  The issue on which they agreed is that farmer's incomes will drop this year by 11 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>A question for the Leader of the House, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and this follows a substantial drop last year.  If any other sector were to suffer any drop there would be an outcry, there would be an ongoing debate in every forum.  In view of that, I am asking now for an urgent debate on agriculture irrespective of the fact that we may have had debates in the fairly recent past.  With the prospect of such a drop, it is important to the agricultural sector that a debate be held immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly would be useful if the Leader of the House could arrange to give those of us who will be demonstrating outside Government Buildings tomorrows between 12.30 p.m. and 2 p.m. the opportunity of a platform here to indicate our views on President De Klerk's visit.  There are all sorts of views on all sides of the House and I request that we be allowed to have that debate. I am not talking about an acrimonous debate.  There are genuinely differing views on it, as there were on the Middle East.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to put something clearly on the record.  We have indicated on two or three occasions over the past number of weeks that we would be amenable to discuss with the Government Whip and the Leader of the House an orderly addressing of the amendments to the Environmental Protection Agency Bill and we indicated that during the course of the debate on at least two occasions last week.  That still remains the position.  I would just like to stress one point: any agreement we might come to could only be entered into on the basis that every amendment would be addressed.  Whatever system we would <Col N="899" /> finally agree on would obviously have to be based on that kind of an arrangement.</P>
    <P>Cúpla bliain ó shin, bhí an tAcht ollscolaíochta faoi chaibidil sa Teach seo, the one that set up the new universities. While we were going through that, Senator Murphy and myself pushed forward leasú ar an mBille sin go mbeadh cúrsaí cultúrtha agus cúrsaí teanga mar chuid de fhreagracht na hollscoile nua.  It was not put in, unfortunately.  We now have a situation where there is a new piece of legislation coming through and I ask the Leader of the House to ensure that any proposals which would bring Thomond in with the new universities would ensure go mbeadh cumas agus cáilíocht Ghaeilge mar choinníoll maidir le haon duine a bheadh ag dul le gairm na múinteoireachta.</P>
    <P>It seems to me there is a major move taking place here.  I ask the Leader of the House to ensure in regard to anybody being trained and prepared for teaching, that that would be done in a university at third level where a responsibility for language and cultural matters was also included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to again raise the position with regard to agriculture.  We have had an extended winter and very late season for grass growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>A question, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>My question is that, while agreeing totally with the figures given in regard to the decline in farm income.  I believe that the prospects for 1991 are worse.  Therefore I am asking the Leader when we can have a meaningful debate.  Would the Leader agree that this position is not covered sufficiently by just having a debate but that it needs to be monitored on an ongoing basis?  When can we have this debate on agriculture and can we have more frequent monitoring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to ask a question in regard to the health services.  I believe they are deteriorating.  Since the position is so dire <Col N="900" /> in regard to the casualty departments and in regard to long awaited operations and so on, when will the Leader give us time to have a meaningful and in-depth debate on health?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the very serious implications of the present industrial dispute at the ESB may I ask that all parties concerned make every endeavour to bring this extremely damaging situation to an early resolution because it will have the most horrendous consequences if the dispute continues.  In the event of it continuing, may I ask the Leader of the House if he will consider giving us an opportunity for a debate on the matter or at least for statements on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator O'Toole's plea to the Leader of the House to try to ensure that the forthcoming Bill incorporating Thomond College in the University of Limerick will have proper regard for cultural dimensions, particularly the Irish language.  It is just as important that the Leader should use his influence, before legislation comes to the House, to provide for the concerns of Members as it is for Members to wrangle about legislation when it comes.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I hope the Leader will enable us today or tomorrow to express our support for the welcome new realism in Government policy towards South Africa as represented by the very welcome visit of President De Klerk.</P>
      <P>Finally, I must confess to being greatly influenced by an old nostalgia for the faith of my fathers and I was wondering if the Leader has any plans for asking the Fianna Fáil Party to make me an offer I could not refuse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain we could make such an offer to Senator Murphy but, given the fact that Senator Ross is taking a career break from the Independents, may I ask the Leader of the House what is the standing of the Independent group as a group in the House, given his defection?  May I also <Col N="901" /> ask Senator Ross if he would enlighten a number of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ross has not moved to the position of Leader of the House and questions cannot be put to him.  Senator Ross is not relevant, as I have said before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of this group, I would like to add support to the several Senators who have requested a debate tomorrow on South Africa.  There are many different views in this House on this sensitive issue and I think this is the place to have it debated sensibly and seriously.  Given the importance of tomorrow, I request that, if at all possible we facilitate that debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been two opinions on the matter of the ESB dispute.  Without going into it too deeply, I think it would be crazy to carry on this discussion any further.  I suggest to the Leader that he might even ignore it in his reply.  Negotiations are going on at present and we have no business interfering with them.  If they collapse, let us look at it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am interested in the comments being made and the questions asked of the Leader about the possibility of a debate on South Africa.  I have been rather interested, since this comment has come up in the last two sittings, that no reference has been made to the commuting of the sentence by the South African Government on Robert Mac-Bride following, I understand, representations from the Irish Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="902" /> Senator Harte has stopped me in my gallop a little because I, too, wish to be associated with the expressions of concern about the ESB dispute, because it affects, for example, the Lough Allen power station in my own area where there is a real threat of the loss of jobs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I allowed Senator Cosgrave a few comments on this and I have been liberal with every other Senator, but there is a point at which we must call a halt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senators O'Toole and Murphy in relation to the proposed amending legislation for the incorporation of Thomond College into the University of Limerick in relation to the cultural and language aspects.  I make a special plea to the Leader that this be taken up immediately because students of Thomond College expect to get their degrees sanctioned in June through the University of Limerick.  I would also like to support Senator O'Reilly's plea for a immediate debate on the continuing crisis in the health services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Leader of the House the same question <Col N="903" /> I asked him specifically last week in relation to Local Government Reform Bill. What I specifically wanted to know was: is this House going to be a rubber stamp and is the Dáil just going to be a rubber stamp for decisions which have been taken by the Department and the Minister? In other words, that all the sub-county local authorities are to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>A question for the Minister &mdash; and the merits of a Bill are not a matter for the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is: will there be time, if this House and the Dáil so decide, for elections to take place to the sub-county local authorities or will it be so late that we well be told it cannot be done and they will be put out of business? This is my question.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>Our beef industry which supplies us with our largest single item of export, is about to self-destruct because of the use of angel dust.  Several times in the past I have asked for an adjournment debate on this subject &mdash; unsuccesfully, may I add.  It is now at crisis point.  The Minister for Agriculture rightly described people who are committing this crime as committing national treachery.  May I ask the Leader of the House if we could have a debate on this topic without delay?  It is extremely serious now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this proposed timetable for the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, if we do not meet this timetable, is it the Government's intention to introduce a guillotine?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no timetable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood there was.  I thank Senator O'Toole for his gracious help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I would like to support what Senator Cosgrave and Senator Conroy said about the ESB and to disagree with Senator Harte and ask that there be some discussion of the ESB strike.  I do not <Col N="904" /> think it is appropriate that every time a sensitive issue comes up a number of people suggest that this Chamber is not an appropriate place to debate it.  Of course it is.  We are letting the people who elected us down if we do not debate it.  For that very reason, despite the chorus it is.  We are letting the people who elected us down if we do not debate it.  For that very reason, despite the chorus of approval from some of my colleagues here when Senator Harte said we shall not debate the matter because it was too sensitive, I put down a motion under Standing Order 29.  I will be interested to hear if this strike is regarded by you, Sir, as a matter requiring urgent national attention.</P>
    <P>With regard to item No. 31, I do not anticipate that the Leader will agree to take it, and I will do not be putting forward an amendment to the Order of Business, but I would like to ask if, in the light of the fact that there is such a motion on the Order Paper expressing concern about the treatment of prisoners of conscience in Iran, the Leader will inquire whether the Government will take the opportunity of the visit of the Iranian Foreign Minister to this country to express just that concern, which is very widely felt in this country?</P>

If it is a discussion in <Col N="905" /> the Seanad, it should be done, because what is happening with the angel dust, as it is so described, is national treachery. It is terrible that Irish meat is being taken off the shelves.  Whoever is guilty of doing this is guilty of a horrible crime.</P>

I would like to suggest to the Leader of the House that it would be very appropriate that this House should have a debate on national mining issues.  Nationally there is a policy of complete indiscrimination where licences are being handed out like confetti.  It has led to major conflicts around the country in areas like Croagh Patrick where the Minister had to make a very welcome intervention, but an intervention at a cost to the State.  Let us have a debate to look at this entire national question to seek a more discriminate policy at national level which would result in less strife at a local level around this country.</P>

      <P>In regard to the point raised by Senator Cosgrave and, indeed, Senators Harte, Mooney and Conroy dealing with the ESB strike, I am of the view that talks are ongoing in the appropriate place and I do not think it would be proper for us to debate that matter at present.</P>
      <P>Senator Brendan Ryan asked for a debate on the prisons system; indeed, he asked previously for such a debate as did Senator Costello and others.  I have been speaking with the Minister and either 15 or 16 May has been decided for that debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan also asked about other matters but I have to say in a general way that we have so much legislation that I think we could well be <Col N="906" /> sitting three or maybe even four days a week in the near future.  Therefore, the call for extra hours for debates on this, that and the other is something I have to watch very carefully.  In particular, Senator Brendan Ryan asked about the Colleges Bill, that is the Bill which gives greater autonomy to the RTCs and permits them to engage in research and development activities.  I have noted what he has said and I will ask the Minister again to have the Bill initiated in this House.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton asked about a debate on broadcasting.  I have no proposals at this time to debate that issue.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators queried the procedure for the taking of Committee Stage of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.  The Whips have in their possession a formula which I hope they will accept and I ask them to meet this evening to agree or disagree to it.  This is the way forward.  If we continue as we have been doing we will be here until July or longer.</P>
    <P>Senator McKenna and other Senators queried Senator Shane Ross' intentions. He is a very charming, witty and good humoured man and I am sure he will be an asset to the Fine Gael Party.  Deputy John Bruton should watch out because his job might be at stake.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten asked about reform of local government, as did Senator Hederman. My understanding is that the Bill will be with both Houses of the Oireachtas shortly&mdash;I hope we will have it first&mdash;and will be completely by the end of May.  It will not interfere in any way with the elections due to take place on 27 June.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello and other Senators asked for a debate on education and referred to the White Paper.  The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, indicated to me that she will come to the Seanad.  It is a question of getting the appropriate arrangements in place.  She is very anxious to discuss all aspects of education.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello also asked about statements on the visit of Mr. De Klerk. I have no such proposals.  Senator Doyle <Col N="907" /> and other Senators asked for a debate on South Africa which we will consider.</P>
    <P>Senators Hussey, Byrne and others asked for a debate on agriculture.  We had a debate recently on that important matter.  I accept that changes are taking place rapidly and if time permits.  I will endeavour to arrange a debate on agriculture as soon as possible.  The same applies to Senator O'Reilly's comments and Senator Hourigan's comments on the health services.</P>
    <P>I hope I have replied to Senator O'Toole's queries on the visit of Mr. De. Klerk and on the Environmental Protection Agency Bill,  I would urge the Whips to get together this evening regarding the Environmental Protection Agency Bill. It is important that we have a proper structure and procedure to avoid delays and problems.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole asked about education. As did Senators Murphy and Pól O Foighil, he asked about the University of Limerick Bill. That Bill provides for the amalgamation of Thomond College and the University of Limerick.  I will bring the points raised by the various Senators to the attention of the Minister.  Senator Murphy also asked about that matter. I think the Senator indicated he would like to join our party.  At this point what we in the party are looking for is nourishment, not punishment.  The question of whether the Independent Members will be a group is more appropriate to Senator O'Toole.</P>
    <P>Senator Raftery and Senator Hanafin asked very important questions on angel dust.  The Minister attached much importance to this when he was with us and I will endeavour to do something on this.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman referred to the University of Limerick Bill.  Senator Norris asked about a guillotine.  I do not understand the meaning of the word &ldquo;guillotine&rdquo; I prefer to use the words &ldquo;allocation of time&rdquo;, which will not apply to that Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris also asked about item No. 31 but I am not a position to take that now.</P>
    <P>

      <P>we handled twice as many amendments as the newspapers reported last week and the average time for an amendment on Thursday was approximately ten minutes, not an excessive length of time.  The suggestion that Members on any side of the House were wasting time for reasons of publicity is belied by the fact that most of the time there was only one person in the Press Gallery and often there was nobody.  If the debating of this Bill proves time consuming it is because it is important and because many amendments have been submitted by Members.  It may also reflect the fact that we knew the Minister involved would listen to amendments, respond fairly to them and accept them if she thought they were reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no fundamental difference between the Minister and myself on the question of a precautionary principle.  I will reconsider the wording of my amendment so as to leave the interpretation of that precautionary principle specifically <Col N="909" /> and clearly to the agency.  I remind the House that scientific proof of many issues can be slow&mdash; we had to wait 20 years for scientific proof on the hazards of cigarette smoking.</P>

      <P>Scientific proof is not the most satisfactory method of dealing with threats to health.  I was at a conference three years ago in Germany when 25 per cent of identified toxic substances available in Germany had been identified as carcinogenic.  A further 25 per cent would be identified as carcinogenic in the immediate future but nobody was not quite sure which substances would be included. If an agency whose job is overwhemingly preventative is to function properly it cannot be constranied by definition of prof of similar to one that would apply in court of law.  The provisions of this amendment would be applied to new projets. If small-scale emissions of a new synthetic substance are to be permitted there can be no scientific evidence about the possibly hazardous nature of something that has never before been released into the environment.  If this substance has a chemical similarity to substances which have been released into the enviroment and which have had scientifically proven damaging effects, should our environmental protection agency then allow a new development to discharge, in however small a quantity, a substance which was not proven dangerous for lack of evidence but which had clear chemical similarities to substances which had been so proven?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the Minister's point that if the amendment is not worded carefully we risk a legal merry-go-round which our friends in the legal profession&mdash;and I love the way we call them &ldquo;our friends&rdquo; and then accuse them of avarice on a grand scale&mdash;would have a wonderful time teasing out.  I would like to hear from the Minister on that.  She did explain the problem but I did not fully understand <Col N="910" /> how she thought the BIll dealt with it. We have to give an agency like this the right to operate on more than <i>post hoc</i> evidence because scientific evidence is by definition <i>post hoc</i> evidence, in the case of harm to humans caused by new substances. Despite efforts to climinate high risks through a variety of tests involving animals and micro-organisms, etc., substances get through which turn out to be hazardous, toxic and carcinogenic.  We need an agency which can say that it is not prepared to tolerate the discharge of substance A into the atmosphere because the balance of argument on the basis of previous evidence indicates a risk.  That is why I am not prepared to argue the wording of my amendment.  I do not think it would serve the purposes of the Bill or time of the House well.  However difficult it may be in principle, the philosophical statement that the Environmental Protection Agency can act to protect us where it is convinced of the existence of a risk, albeit an unproven one, must be clearly stated in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I want to support the whole thrust of having the precautionary principle written into this Bill.  I support what has been said by Senator Ryan.  I also made reference last week to may amendment No. 169 which generally deals with the same area.  The Minister gave the impression last week when she replied to my reference to amendment No. 169 that it would be utterly unacceptable.  This amendment is stating a similar proposal in different words.  I want to ask about the term used in both Senator Ryan's amendment and my own when we say &ldquo;shall have regard to&rdquo;.  I understand that &ldquo;having regard to&rdquo; did not imply being absolutely bound.  If the consequences of something warranted it a nod would be <Col N="911" /> made in that direction.  When an appeal is made to the Planning Appeals Board they are bound to have regard for the development plan of the area from which the appeal is emanating.  In thousands of instances, however, the Planning Appeals Board give a decision contrary to the local development plan.  It is not, therefore, to say that they will have in all cases to abide by it; &ldquo;having regard to it&rdquo; seems to be perfectly legitimate and should be acceptable to the Minister. Senator Ryan makes the point strongly and effectively that if the balance of evidence convinces the agency that there is a possibility of risk, inability to produce absolutely scientific fact should not make action impossible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this important principle.  Other Senators indicated both today and last week that many agencies who lobbied Senators indicated a concern for the precautionary principle.  The Minister will bear in mind the interesting and significant fact that there has been virtually all-party consensus on the principle involved.  It is a question of delicate balance.  One does not want to inhibit entirely industrial development leading to employment. This balance is a sensitive issue because if, as Senator Hederman mentioned if you get into th area of a risk of a risk then you may inhibit industrial development in a regrettable way.  People will agree with the precautionary principle, particularly in the light of Chernobyl, that the accummulation of scientific evidence can sometimes take 15 to 20 years before a case can be proven.  During that intermediary stage while evidence is building up it is wise to take precautions.  The phrase &ldquo;a risk of a risk&rdquo; would stretch in a little far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested and pleased to hear that Senator Ryan is not insisting adamantly upon the exact wording because I would have some difficulty with that.  I hope the Minister will take the principle on board. It is exhortatory rather than anything else.  I am not sure of the legal impact of the phase &ldquo;they shall have regard to&rdquo;. How strong a requirement is this?  How <Col N="912" /> do you detect the fact that an agency have had regard to something?  How is that evident in their decisions?  It may be a nod in the direction.  I do not think it has any real force.  It is an example of nit-picking but I think the proposition is inaccurate.  I think it should be regard &ldquo;for&rdquo;.  I know it is stylistically unattractive to repeat the preposition but it is grammatically correct.  If it is redrafted we could correct the preposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">

      <P>I support the principle embodied in Senator Ryan's amendment. As far as the environment and emissions and pollutants are concerned, we should always err on the side of safety; we should always be extremely cautions.  It is, unfortunately, difficult to obtain conclusive scientific proof in many instances.  Invariably in many cases one can only make a value judgement, which should reflect caution, concern and conservation.</P>
      <P>Some developments that have taken place over the years indicate the necessity for a cautions approach.  Certain chemicals used in some industries generated cancers in the workforce.  We must consider the effects beginning to unfold in relation to the emissions from Sellafield over the past number of years; clusters of cancers are developing here and in areas surrounding the plant in Britain. Drugs used in the fifties to treat impendig miscarriages gave rise to unfortunate cancers in the children of mothers treated with those drugs.  Thalidomide was used by people in good faith and you find tragic effects of that drug two or three moves down the line. That I am advocating is that we be cautious and that the Minister would accept this amendment or at least the principle embodied in it.</P>

The proper balance is essential and we would all support that.  The Minister should examine the possibility of taking this amendment on board while ensuring that it will not damage industrial projects <Col N="913" /> or be the cause of indefinite delays.  We wish to protect the environment on one hand while not inhibiting development vital for the creation of jobs.  I would like to hear the Minister's comments on that.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators for their contribution on this amendment.  I, too, share the concern of all sides to have this principle enshrined in the legislation.  The Government are committed to the concept of precautionary action which was one of the three principles on which the environment plan published last year was based.  However, putting flesh on the beast, as it were trying to put it into the law, is difficult. As Senator Ryan accepted, we do not want to leave more licence decisions of the agency open to court challenge.  That is the wish of all sides of the House.  We do not want to add any further uncertainty to possibility of development.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to examine this to see if it can be enshrined further in the legislation. It is already convered in the definition of the BATNEEC principle.  It is covered in the definition of environmental protection where preventative pollution is dealt with and in sections 103 and 105 on noise where measures to prevent noise are introduced.  The whole concept of prevention is certainly one of the key elements of this legislation.  I do not have a monopoly of wisdom nor do my officials in relation to this Bill.  It is my intention that it would be passed with the greatest degree of consensus from all sides of the House so I am going to have another look at it.  It is more appropriate where Senator Hederman has proposed her amendment on section 51 and perhaps when we come to that section in relation to the functions of the agency it would be reasonable to insert, in legal terms, the kind of principle the Senators of all sides wish to see in this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to withdraw the amendment.  May I say two things to the Minister on the question of drafting an alternative?  Speaking as a scientist, do not let the scientists fool you.  Science is <Col N="914" /> about evidence and it, therefore, always has to work backwards.  In the area of economics there is an growing school of thought among professional economists, most of them outside this country, that what has gone wrong with economics in the past 20 years is that economists stopped looking at the evidence and started building models based on what came into their heads, rather than reality. Similarly, if the burden of proof has to be based on scientific methodology for something like this, then it is impossible.</P>
      <P>I would suggest a wording similar to that in section 82 (6) to do with oral hearing which gives the agency absolute discretion in the holding of an oral hearing. As the Minister knows, many of the environmental groups are less than happy with the absolute discretion.  It was put in, I presume, to ensure that we did not have masses of litigation by people demanding oral hearings because they felt like it.  We have to trust the judgment of the agency.</P>
      <P>On the question of a precautionary principle, the absolute discretion of the agency to make decisions in this area where scientific proof does not exist should be written in so that they can look at the evidence and at their absolute discretion &mdash; I presume the wording is carefully drafted to make it impossible to litigate in the area &mdash; but make it clear that they are not bound by the narrow limits of what will be called scientific proof.  I thank the Minister for the continuing spirit in which she is dealing with this debate and I withdraw the amendment.</P>

Instead these processes, developments or operations will be subject to the requirements of BATNEEC as explained in section 5 of the Bill.  The Bill, as drafted, dealt with this point adequately for activities specified in the First Schedule.  However, section 92 of the Bill provides a mechanism whereby certain other processes, developments or operations not specified in the First Schedule may also be made licensible and subject to the general application of this Bill by ministerial order.

      <P>I move amendment No. 41:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7)  The Agency may, at its absolute discretion, specify that there is no technology available not entailing excessive cost which would enable a particular activity to meet the requirements of this section.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As in the case of other amendments <Col N="917" /> moved by me, I can anticipate the parliamentary draftsman's reply that it is already contained within the definition as stated.  It was introduced by me because many people said to me that it was not clear that the agency &mdash; and I am quite sure it is the Minister's intention &mdash; could say, &ldquo;no, that is a dirty industry&rdquo;.  There is no technology available at reasonable cost which can produce emissions from such an industry which will be acceptable to a country which takes its environment seriously.  Therefore, the Agency does not have to specify BATNEEC in terms of unspecified standards.  I know we have standards in certain areas but, given the complexity of certain emissions from the chemical industry, it is going to be almost impossible to have national standards for emissions of every single chemical and it would be ridiculous if we had to set national standards every time we had a new industry.  We should make it clear that this agency has the right of veto.  I have considerable faith in the chemical industry's capacity to meet whatever standards are set but I do not think we should leave the possibility of a legal loophole, where because it has to specify the best available technology as we have discussed it, the agency would have to permit certain processes to take place because what was best and available at reasonable cost could not actually produce an effluent which was environmentally acceptable.  Therefore, it seems to me that the principle should be clear, that the agency at its aboslute discretion should be able to specify there is no technology available to meet acceptable standards and that, therefore, that process could not go ahead.</P>
    <P>I have to withdraw the amendment because as it stands it seems to me it could easily mean that the agency would say it and that would mean that technology like that would be able to be licensed without any BATNEEC requirement at all simply because the agency would say it.  It is not particularly well worded.  As my amendment stands, it would simply mean that the agency would say: &ldquo;There is no technology available&rdquo; and there would be no guarantee that because there <Col N="918" /> was no technology available it would have to meet any standards at all.  It seems to me a little dubious legally the way I have it worded but the objective is to make sure that the agency can say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to certain processes if it believes that the processes are inherently dirty.

      <P>I am not well disposed to always commenting on amendments that are going to be withdrawn or we will be here forever.  The principle of what is involved here is not acceptable to me for this reason: if certain activities are not acceptable there are policy decisions that would have to be made by the Government of the day.  This is not a policy-making agency.  Obviously the duty of the agency is to enforce standards, implement policy and so on, but it is not the responsibility of the agency to decide the country will not have industry X or industry Y or activity X or activity Y. That is why there is a general provision made in the Bill to allow the Government of the day to give directions to the agency, such as the direction, for example, that no nuclear power stations will be licensed or whatever.  If the country is to make a decision with regard to certain activities that are not acceptable for whatever reason, then I believe that is a political and policy-making matter and not one, in fairness, to be given to the agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Senator knows, BATNEEC is only one of the six matters the agency has to consider when they are deciding on a licence.  If something is going to cause serious pollution then obviously it is not to be licensed.  BATNEEC is one of the six matters when they are specifying the technology that has to be applied but it is not the only matter the agency takes into account.  I think there may be some misunderstanding about that, that once you specify BATNEEC, or if there is not technology and something is going to cause pollution, it goes ahead anyway. That is not the case and it is not the intention under this Bill that that would <Col N="919" /> be the case.  Section 80 (3) requires compliance with standards, noise regulations and so on in relation to emissions.  That deals with the kind of points that Senator Ryan is trying to cover by this amendment.</P>

      <P>At the beginning I was inclined to agree with Senator Ryan but the one thing we would need to watch through all this legislation &mdash; and the Minister has just confirmed my thinking &mdash; is that when we are talking about major decisions it will be national policy. The other worry that surfaced in contributions on Second Stage when so many valuable contributions were made is that we have to be careful, and I accept how concerned Senator Ryan, the Minister and indeed all of us are about the type of industry we allow to be put in place.  We have to be careful to watch the dirty industry or anything that might create a problem.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, we have to watch the job situation and I was quite strong on this in my Second Stage address to the House.  I agree with part of Senator Ryan's amendment but now that he is withdrawing it the Minister has confirmed in my mind that our thinking is right in regard to the power of the agency. The decisions Senator Ryan was concerned about will be made in another place.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 42:</P>
      <P>In page 12, lines 20 to 26, to delete subsection (3) and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Every regulation made under this Act shall be approved by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if the motion is rejected by either such House, the Regulation shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am not sure they are alternatives to each other or options but I see that they should be addressed at the same time.  They are quite different, in fact.  Senator Murphy's amendment is very like my amendment but Senator Naughten's is quite different. The issue here is very simple.  To use an absolute illustration I am reading from today's Order Paper and today the order of this House carries five statutory regulations and they are as follows: &ldquo;Solicitors Acts, 1954 and 1960 (European Community Lawyers) (Fees) Regulations, 1991.&rdquo;  I defy anybody in the House to give me the slightest inkling of what that is about.  That is a statutory regulation arising out of an Act.  The second staturoty regulation is: &ldquo;Qualified Lawyers (European Community) Regulations, 1991.&rdquo;  The third one is: &ldquo;Merchant Shipping (Light Dues) Order, 1991.  Then there is: &ldquo;Social Welfare (Modifications of Insurance) Regulations, 1991.  That is the way items are laid before the House. They come here in a list.  On this Order Paper we have perhaps 20 and I have often seen up to 50 on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well that people understand that this Act will work by way of regulation. The Minister or the Department will determine specific areas of regulation, as they are required to do, and we are all agreed they should do.  This is presented as a paper to the Librarian of the House who enters it in a book, who ensures that it is included in the Order of Business <Col N="921" /> and as far as we are concerned that is then a regulation laid before the House. It is an activity which is unacceptable.  I am sure if we were to check on those five statutory orders before the House today they are there on precisely the same conditions as this one here.  In other words, unless the House rejects this regulation over the period of the next 21 days it becomes law.</P>
    <P>I have always maintained this is not the way to deal with legislation and I have always felt that it should be an affirmative process where the House should decide. In other words, that the Minister should not simply present the new regulation to the Librarian of the House but should come into this House, have it printed for the Members of the House and say: &ldquo;We are now proposing that this be included as the regulations that go with this Act&rdquo; and if it is approved by the House then it would become law.  It is not the way to pass law.  We have seen all sorts of ridiculous regulations coming through, unmarked and unnoted over the past couple of years.  I will give one classic example and this is just by way of illustration.</P>
    <P>The legislation dealing with the granting of licences to restaurants produced regulations which were so impossible to meet that very few restraurants were ever able to qualify for an alcohol licence because they had to put doors here and toilets there.  It was constructed in such a way that it made it impossible.  We never get the opportunity to actually address those things.  They just slip through the House.  I am not saying this is done as a cover up.  The reason it is written in this way is because the parliamentary draftsman feels this is the easiest way to do business with the Department and, of course, he is right because once they get this out the door of this House we will never again see a regulation except as a line on the Order Paper.  We will never get the opportunity of discussing it, we will never get the opportunity of amending it and we will never get the opportunity of rejecting it.  The process of rejection would mean that I would, first of all, have to check what those five papers mean, <Col N="922" /> compare them with the legislation that was passed in 1954, 1960, 1991 and various other years and then say: &ldquo;I do not agree with that and we now need to get this on the Order Paper&rdquo;.  It is an impossible process.  In my time in the House I have never yet heard of a regulation being discussed.  That is the reality.</P>
    <P>Assuming the Minister can stand by the regulations she would wish to bring into operation, then what should happen is that each regulation under the Act shall be approved by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if that is rejected by either such House the regulation shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done hereunder.  That is the process of law, the process of legislation where it is proposed, discussed, amended or changed.</P>
    <P>I used the word &ldquo;amended&rdquo; quite casually. In fact, it is not possible to amend regulations anyway so there is no danger to the Department of having a set of regulations torn apart; they are either acceptable or they are not acceptable. I have infinite confidence in the public service that they would bring forward sets of regulations which would be acceptable to the House on all occasions.  What we need here is an affirmative process to determine the regulations rather than the negative process, as I call it, which means that it just simply slips through, the negative being that it has to be rejected by a House of the Orieachtas.  The proposal here is that every regulation becomes a regulation unless it is rejected by a House.  I am objecting to that because it is a very passive way of dealing with it and, secondly, because we never actually get to see these regulations, they are not even circulated to Members of the Houses and I want to stress that point. They are simply sent to the Librarian. That is the effectiveness of laying something before the House.  The affirmative process, on the other hand, would require that each regulation was circulated, was placed on the Order of Business, was proposed, discussed and accepted.  I think there is no comparison between the two processes.</P>

      <P>During the Second Stage we all agreed, indeed I think the Minister made a point of it in her speech, that it is necessary for the success of this legislation that it has the confidence of the public and that there be an openness about the procedures under the Act. Indeed, the concept of an open-minded Government which does its business in public, as I recall, was part of the tone of the agreement setting up this Government but it is particularly important in the case of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill that the agency in its procedures and regulations made under the Act be seen to have public support and must be seen to have parliamentary support rather than simply ministerial and civil servant approval.  The general principle there is that as far as possible everything done under this legislation shall be seen to be done openly and with the full approval of the Oireachtas.  I fully support what Senator O'Toole has said. As far as I can see, my amendment does not differ at all from his except it is more succinct, if I may say so.  The principle that regulations be positively scrutinised and approved by the Oireachtas rather than slipping in by default, as is the regrettable procedure nowadays as Senator O'Toole has pointed out, is also the spirit of my amendment.  I fully support everything Senator O'Toole has said.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the principle of both amendments.  I take it they are the same.  There may be some technical differences and the Minister may be inclined to introduce an amendment of her own, but it is extremely important because we are talking about parliamentary accountability.  It is vital that the Parliament of this country be seen to approve the regulations because there has been a tendency, not on the part of this Minister but some other Ministers, to govern by decree using regulations. Sometimes regulations do not appear to have to be approved at all by the House and I would like to welcome the fact that the Minister is at least moving in some regard by referring the regulations to the House but it is referring <Col N="924" /> them in a kind of passive way and there is a shift in emphasis in these two amendments which would mean that they would have to be positively approved by the House.  I certainly support them.  I hope we may be pushing at least a half open door with these amendments.</P>

      <P>It is very important that the regulations be laid before the Houses as provided for in section 6 but I believe that 21 days, which effectively is seven weeks, is too long to leave it if, for example, the House decided to reject the regulations and that is why I included seven days.  There is merit in what Senator O'Toole has outlined but we must be realistic and if every regulation has to be discussed by the Oireachtas I think we would have an unparalleled log-jam and that is why I did not go for that option.  I believe that 21 days is too long and this is why I put in this amendment of seven days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose, to some extent, taking these three amendments together is sensible but they are very different in intent.  Senator Naughten's amendment would seek to restrict further the powers the Oireachtas has where instead of giving them 21 days in which to annul the amendment it is only giving them seven days and I think that is contrary to the approach of Senator O'Toole and Senator Murphy.  While I have some sympathy with the point the Senator is making, having sought on occasions to try to annul regulations myself, I have to say in relation to this Bill and the way we do our parliamentary business we give what I would regard as non-controversial powers or housekeeping powers to Ministers to be implemented by way of regulations. If we did not do that we would place a considerable burden on this House and on the Dáil when the vast majority of regulations are totally non-controversial. I think it would be a very unwise way of dealing with legislation and it would delay the implementation of this Bill and other legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Oireachtas has to concern itself with is getting the fundamentals <Col N="925" /> right, setting up the primary legislation and, in relation to regulations, either to amend the First or Second schedule to this Bill, to change the selection committee, to extend powers under the Water Pollution Act or the Air Pollution Act or the Waste Management Act. Those regulations have to be approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas before they have the effect of law.  If we get the primary legislation right then I think it is only fair and reasonable and in the interests of the speedy implementation and establishment of the agency that that would be done by way of regulation.  If there is a problem about how regulations are annulled or discussed, then that is a matter for our own procedures.</P>
    <P>If Senators or Deputies want to set time aside to formally discuss regulations &mdash; the point made by Senator O'Toole in relation to today's Order Paper &mdash; that is a different matter.  It is a matter for our own procedures and the way we deal with regulations.  I do not think it would be fair to restrict and further delay the establishment of this agency and, as I said, the fundamental and important sections cannot be changed by regulations unless they have first been approved by this House.</P>
    <P>In relation to Senator O'Toole's specific amendment, he suggests that the regulations would have the effect of law until they were annulled.  I think that would be unwise.  It would mean, for example, that regulations would be made today, would be legal and subsequently could be annulled by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I think that would lead to a lot of confusion, disquiet and uncertainty. In relation to Senator Murphy's amendment, at least they do not take effect until they are approved, so it does not have that element of uncertainty that Senator O'Toole's amendment has.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I cannot be co-operative on this.  This being a framework Bill, I know a lot of the housekeeping matters are being done by way of regulations because that it the most effective and speedy way of doing them, but if we get the fundamentals right Senators should not be too concerned about leaving the remaining <Col N="926" /> matters to ministerial powers.  In any event, they can be annulled if the Oireachtas so wishes.</P>

      <P>I certainly agree with the tone of the suggestion that every regulation could not be discussed in the House. It would involve excessive amounts of time.  At the same time, the principle which is involved in the amendment has a certain merit.  I would be particularly concerned in relation to developments in technology some years down the road where you may get important new technologies coming on stream and where Ministers may be making regulations determining how those technologies are utilised without this Act having the capacity to, as it were, envisage the issues which may be involved in developments which we simply cannot anticipate now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clarify a few points.  I want to make it absolutely clear to the Minister that what I am saying here seems to have been misinterpreted and that it is not unique and has plenty of precedent in legislation.  I am very careful in framing that amendment even to the extent of replacing the word &ldquo;resolution&rdquo; with &ldquo;motion&rdquo; to clarify what I was doing.  My proposal does not create a delay because, as the Minister says, it does not prevent the introduction of regulation and it does not prevent the immediate implementation of such regulation. That is why retained in my amendment are the words &ldquo;accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that that is not unusual and is not without precedent. In fact, I will give the Minister an example off the top of my head but I am pretty sure I am right about it.  We had amending legislation to a superannuation scheme going through this House over the course of the last year.  The idea was to change the process of regulation from the affirmative process, which was there in the original 1953 legislation, to the negative process we have here &mdash;&rdquo; unless it shall be annulled&rdquo; type one.  In the one we were changing it was clear in that <Col N="927" /> when the regulation was placed before the House it became an operative regulation and remained an operative regulation until such time or until or unless it was rejected by the House and if it were not rejected by the House it operated during that period of time.  That is not without precedent.  The difference between Senator Murphy's amendment and mind is that it allows the regulation to come into operation immediately.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of it is to deal with the issue raised by Senator Naughten. Far from creating a logjam it does not in any sense slow down the process.  I was very careful about that in the amendment. The process is now slowed down. The Department or the Minister do not lose any power or authority; the operation of the Bill is not perverted in any way.  It allows all those things to take place but it also requires the approval of the Oireachtas.  Seeing that the Minister is prepared to do that under section 7 on some of the other orders, it is a very small step indeed to wrap them altogether and to take it in that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reluctant to say this, but I do not think I can support my two colleagues because I do not think you could possibly have a situation where every regulation made under legislation would require affirmation.  One of the problems is a problem of the antiquated, creaking and about to collapse structures of Irish parliamentary democracy.  Huge amounts of quasi-legislation are being issued all around and because the structures of our democratic processes have become so out-of-date whole rafts of stuff never get proper consideration.  I do not think the solution is to make the logjam of matters on the Order Papers of the Houses of the Oireachtas even greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you read this Bill, you will see that the number of sections which provide for the making of regulations must number 17.  I think it is an issue which must be dealt with on specific terms on specific areas of regulations.  The Minister does not have a free hand in this.  The distinctions that the drafters of legislation <Col N="928" /> have to make are not simply the ones that come into their heads.  There would be problems with the courts if the Minister took on himself or herself the right to write law by way of regulations without the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Therefore, certain areas are usually reserved to have to be approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is interesting that the provisions in section 7 for amending the schedules need the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is one of the few absolute powers that this House of the Oireachtas has which, regrettably, we do not ever use, but we have the power to refuse to accept regulations or to annual regulations and there is no way around it other than by way of legislation being introduced to deal with it if either House of the Oireachtas refused to accept regulations.  The Dáil does not have any final power in the issue. It is with regret, therefore, that I must leave my colleagues to argue their case and not support them on this.</P>
    <P>On the question of things coming into force and being annulled, the orders under section 31 of the Broadcasting Act that are made with painful regularity every year all have the provision that they apply from the moment the Minister signs the order but they can be annulled by either House of the Oireachtas on any sitting day for the following 21 sitting days.  They contain the provision that nothing that was done under the orders before they were annulled will not be valid because of the capacity of either House to annul them.  It is well established that regulations can come into force, stay in force and if they are annulled that does not undermine the validity of what was done while they were in force.  I could not see us going through the details of every single regulation.  I am much more concerned that a lot of &ldquo;mays&rdquo; on the Minister's part should become &ldquo;shalls&rdquo; and that the regulations would be published.</P>

      <P>We all share that concern, that an antiquated and cumbersome parliamentary procedure would be further confused and complicated by <Col N="931" /> detailed attention to scrutinising regulations. I really had not intended that and I do not think that, in practice, that is the way it will turn out.  I do not think Senator O'Toole either anticipated the House being tied down in a welter of discussions about improving regulations.  It is simply that to put our amendments into legislation would be part of a general assurance that the Minister does not propose to exercise the wide powers which are available to her under this and every legislation.  It is really the principle of showing the flag, if you like, of respect of Oireachtas approval which, in turn, is a way of signalling to the public that this legislation, its operations and procedures are democratic and open to public scrutiny. That was the spirit in which I offered my amendment.  I take on board what has been said by those who find difficulty with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we recognise what the regulations are about. People seem to take the view that the regulations are different from the law. Senator Ryan listened closely and said that Ministers are not allowed to write the law.  In fact, they are allowed to write the law.  The purpose of regulations is quite clearly to give an enabling power to the Minister to write legislation in those areas which are likely to change at regular intervals.  The idea of the regulation is that the Minister would not be required to introduce new legislation every time an amendment was required to something that was variable in the first place. It is important we recognise that is what it is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now want to address what we are doing in this amendment.  I specifically want the Senators on this side of the House, particulartly Senator Upton, to pay some attention as to what he feels will be a log-jam.  I have certainly heard his party raise queries in the other House on regular occasions as to how they might address certain aspects of regulations where Ministers had discretionary <Col N="932" /> powers which could not be questioned under the parliamentary process.</P>
    <P>Section 58 deals with effluent discharge, and the Minister may, under the terms of the section, prescribe standards for effluent discharged into waters.  That is very important information that people in this House would like to deal with.  I am not going into the details of it.  Section 62, which is a classic example of the Minister writing legislation, outlines the environmental monitoring programme; we are giving the Minister the authority under the section to make regulations specifying the monitoring, the classes of monitoring that should take place, etc. That is a fundamental part of the legislation and I defy anybody to tell me that that would be creating a log-jam.  It is extending the range of the Bill without a shadow of a doubt.</P>
    <P>Under section 68, which is perhaps the best example of all in the Bill, we have a whole section dealing with the functions of the agency in relation to environmental research which &ldquo;shall include the matters specified in this section&rdquo;.  Then we go on to subsection (2) (a), subsection (2) (b), paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii), subsection (2) (c), subsection (3), etc.  It goes on and on with the functions of the agency in reference to environmental research. There are also other functions earlier than that.  We will spend a lot of time discussing those when we come to that section.</P>

      <P>I am staying on the section but I will not labour that point, I accept the Acting Chairman's ruling.  In section 70 we are now giving the Minister the power by regulation to extend the functions and the powers of the agency. The point I am making is that we will spend a lot of time going through the functions of the agency.  Next week the Minister can write a new section.  I am not pointing to this in a sense of a Minister trying to get around legislation, I am simply using it to illustrate the power and function.</P>

      <Col N="933" /> Under section 70 on environmental approval, the Minister shall, with the consent of the Minister for the Marine, make regulations, etc., in relation to all or any of the leases, licences, permits or other authorisations which the Minister for the Marine is empowered under law to grant or to the renewal of such.  Such approval may be given either without conditions or subject to the conditions related as the agency may specify.  We are now giving authority, without parliamentary approval, to extend the licences, leases, permits or authorisations without condition.  These are serious and important matters.  I would like to bring this to the attention of the House.  There are many more in the Bill.  I am not directing this to the Minister.  This is for any Minister for the next 40 years.</P>

      <P>There are a number of things I wish to say.  First of all, Senator O'Toole misunderstands some of the things he has been quoting from.  For example, in relation to the EIS, the Minister has the power to make regulations.  He specified that the agency should get a copy of an EIS.  That is not unreasonable power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I did say at that point that I had become confused and that I was quoting from the wrong section.  The Cathaoirleach pulled me up on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the technical aspects of monitoring and so on, I do not disagree with the principle that obviously legislation cannot be made up by Ministers as they go along, nor should that be provided for.  Regulations can be annulled.  There is no such thing as making a regulation and that is the end of it.  The Oireachtas does have the power to annul regulations.  If we in the Oireachtas have not got our procedures in order to allow us to annul them effectively or easily, that is a different matter. It is not a matter to be dealt with in the context of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the fundamentals are concerned, I was keen to ensure that no <Col N="934" /> extraordinary powers would be vested in the Minister, so the Minister cannot have new categories covered by the First Schedule or Second Schedule without approval.  The Minister cannot change the selection committee without approval. The Minister cannot change a whole host of things in relation to sections 97, 98 and 99, transferring water pollution, air pollution and waste management plants, and so on, to the agency.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is important that there would be approval of this House and the other House, but it would be very unreasonable if, during the long gaps when these Houses do not meet, a Minister was totally handicapped and could not make regulations under this or other legislation.  The vast majority of regulations that are made in this country are made without any controversy and any problem because they deal with very mundane, technical, housekeeping matters. For the few that many cause concern, there is a procedure provided for dealing with them.  If the procedure is not adequate it is a different matter, as Senator Ryan said.  I feel very strongly about that too.  We are being very unreasonable if we want to clog up the Order Papers of this House and the other House by a whole host of regulations having to be approved before they can have the effect of law.  Quite honestly, we are severely delaying and handicapping the implementation of this legislation.</P>
    <P>As we go through the sections we can debate whether or not they are so fundamental that the regulations should be approved.  That may be another way to approach it.  Obviously this House and the other House has to approve this Bill or else it cannot have the effect of law. To require every single regulation about tiny, mundane, non-controversial technical matters to be approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas is, quite honestly, in my view, very unreasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said this twice before and I consider now that I am being misinterpreted.  The Minister made a very valid case for a Minister not being <Col N="935" /> able to bring in regulations during the course of long recesses, etc.  In my first contribution I made it quite clear that I deliberately worded this amendment to ensure that could not happen.  I want to read it again.  My amendment does not prevent the Minister introducing regulations. All it requires is that when it is convenient, as soon as may be after it is made, the motion comes before the House.  It goes on to say: &ldquo;Without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under the regulations.&rdquo;  There is no delay.  It takes into account recesses, it takes into account the need for Ministers to address issues and deal with them.  It is not correct to interpret me as saying that this slows down the process of issuing regulations.  It does one thing only.  It simply requires that they must at some stage be approved by the Houses.  That is all that is required.</P>
      <P>I want to make two positive points to the Minister, I said when I spoke first that I welcome the fact that within this legislation is the need for the affirmative process under the sections named by the Minister.  I take the Minister's point that it seems a bit unnecessary that every single change should have to come before this House.</P>
      <P>For instance, the extension of the functions of the agency is a major decision. That cannot be seen to be a minor decision.  If the Minister would say: &ldquo;as we go through them we will look at those points in the Bill where the Minister has power to issue regulations&rdquo; and that we would then on each occasion say: &ldquo;Is it appropriate?  Should this not be included under section 7 (3)?  We could add to it when it comes to Report&rdquo;.  I would be quite happy with that.  I have no interest in slowing down the process.  I have no interest in creating more paper work for people at any level.  I want to make sure that the monitoring function of this House of the Oireachtas is also reflected in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has really answered my point.  I was going to suggest to her that in the Bill a lot of regulations <Col N="936" /> may be made by the Minister.  I accept Senator O'Toole's observations.  The Minister has just said that other regulations under later sections may need what Senator O'Toole wants done.  When I was looking at the Bill I found that the number of regulations in it are extraordinary. I have seen quite a lot of legislation going through this House.  I have no trouble in saying that I am confused at times.  When draftsmen are drawing up legislation for the Minister, is it necessary that regulations have to be in so many sections of this very important Bill?  The Minister has said that she may take a different stand on regulations in later sections.</P>
      <P>I come back to our input &mdash; it is something I have had strong views on for a long time &mdash; at times some of us should be consulted before legislation is put in place.  Perhaps there should be more talking and more communication.  Perhaps the Minister would take a closer look at this at a later stage and accept one of Senator O'Toole's amendments as he has strong views about the regulations.  It will hit anyone who looks at Bills that it is full of regulations.  Perhaps the Minister will come back on this.</P>

      <P>More to the point that Senator O'Toole is making is the principle. I am not dissenting from that.  It is written here that every regulation, no matter how trivial, no matter how urgent, no matter what the circumstances are, has to be approved.  That is where I part company with Senator O'Toole as far as this amendment is concerned.  It is the sweeping generality of it.  I certainly accept that he has a valid point in relation to some regulations which can be made under this Bill but I do not believe that that concern should extend itself to trivial, routine regulations.</P>

      <P>I have listened very carefully to the extreme good points made on both sides.  In essence, I would not support these amendments.  The principle behind them is good but, as has been said by previous speakers, there will be an enormous amount of very technical <Col N="937" /> matter involved.  It will be very complicated and it could lead to a slowing up of the whole process.  I know Senator O'Toole will say that that does not apply in this case because they can go ahead unless they are annulled at a later stage. It seems to me that it would be a tortuous process.  I wonder would it not be possible to look at them section by section as we go along and see whether they could be included under section 7 (3).  As we come to them we will see whether they should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as stated in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that I do not think Senator O'Toole has gone away from my point.  The principle, whatever about the practice &mdash; the practice is doubtful &mdash; is that if Ministers attempt to make regulations that are effectively writing the law and go beyond their competence, as the courts would adjudicate on it, then they are going outside their brief no matter what the law says.  The only bodies in this State who can write the law are the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>There have been instances where regulations have gone through on positive affirmative votes, the classic one being the one on licences for restaurants to serve restrictive forms of alcohol, for example, beer and spirits, which made a laughing-stock of the Houses of the Oireachtas because of the effort that went into making sure that as few restaurants as possible would bother to apply. My own view is that if the restaurants were to challenge those regulations in the courts they would be ruled to be unconstitutional because they went beyond the spirit of any legislation or the principles of any legislation in creating obstacles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is the frustration of the way these Houses operate.  Huge rafts of material never reach the floor of the House and are never discussed.  In my view, secondary legislation is a particularly appropriate area for a special committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas. There used to be a special committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas to deal with <Col N="938" /> statutory instruments.  It got swallowed up in the Committee on Secondary Legislation of the EC.  It is an area that deserves to be scrutinised and the reports of bodies like that should be put before the House.</P>
    <P>The real solution to this is to make sure that the sections which involve regulations are precisely written so that the discretion of the Minister is what would seem to be reasonable.  I agree with Senato O'Toole.  The solution will be to look at each section where there are regulations and if it appears that there are sweeping powers or matters that have not been thought of then, on Report Stage, section 7 can be amended to introduce provisions for other sections other than the ones already mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a reasonable approach.  I have before me, and I will not bore the House by reading them, some regulations made under the Planning Acts.  I can tell Senators the level of detail is quite extraordinary.  I do not think too many Senators would ever be interested in coming in here to seek to approve them.  Basically, most regulations deal with very technical, mundane, non-controversial matters.  There are very few occasions when we ever want to seek to annul them but the problem is the method by which they can be annulled. That is a different matter.  I have been on the other side of the House and I have tried to do it and I know how virtually impossible it is.  We are using a sledgehammer to crack a nut here.  If we deal with it as we go through the sections that might be the more appropriate approach.</P>

      <P>This amendment is based on the same general principles which I enunicated when moving the previous amendment, namely, the need for ministerial powers to be seen to be restrained in favour of Oireachtas supervision, so the same principle underlines it.

      <P>I would be grateful, if it is possible, to get a reasonably elaborate <Col N="940" /> answer on this.  Subsection (2) says, &ldquo;the Minister may by order revoke or amend the First Schedule or the Second Schedule.&rdquo; I am perfectly with the procedure for amending both Schedules.  We can all see why.  Processes may become out of date and may no longer need to be included and new processes may be introduced that need to be included in the Schedules.  Why would the Minister ever want to revoke the entirely of the Schedule? That is what I do not understand.  I can understand why they would want to amend it, perhaps in great detail, or rewrite it, but revoking the Schedule means there will be no Schedule.  I do not understand why.  I would like an explanation.</P>

      <P>A good question.  I am advised that there might be so many changes required that it would be more effective to revoke it and bring in a new Schedule.  There is nothing sinister involved here.  This is one of the orders that would have to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not attributing any malice and I never thought there was anything sinister in it.  I believe somebody in the parliamentary draftsman's office was being enormously careful.  The word &ldquo;revoke&rdquo;&mdash; I appreciate that it has to be <Col N="941" /> approved by the Oireachtas &mdash; means all the Oireachtas can do is refuse to revoke it or agree to revoke it.  It cannot debate anything else.  It seems to me that somebody somewhere was being cautious.  If we were to introduce amendments to allow the Minister the authority to revoke two Schedules of a major piece of legislation we would have to get ourselves involved in very complex English.  It seems to me that &ldquo;amend&rdquo; is more than adequate and that &ldquo;revoke&rdquo; is a very large power to give a Minister under whatever form of regulations.  The word &ldquo;revoke&rdquo; speaks for itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that this is the standard procedure in legislation of this kind.  The word &ldquo;revoke&rdquo; is always included.  To make it perfectly clear, the Minister cannot simply revoke it.  It has to be approved.  It is like bringing a new Bill into the Oireachtas.  The regulations would have to be approved.  It is not giving the Minister wide-ranging powers, since the approval would rest with the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Senator can take it that there is nothing sinister in this.  It is not intended to establish this agency and then to seek to remove it of all of its powers or licensing functions.</P>

      <P>The point which I do not want to labour is that I have no time for the view that this is standard practice.  I have sat here and heard quite extraordinary pieces of legislation justified on the grounds of &ldquo;We always did it&rdquo;.  If we were actually to follow that through, we would not change very much.  My view is that it is an improper use of regulation to give the Minister the right to revoke large sections of the legislation.  In principle, it could be inserted in section 2 and it would then state that the Minister may, by order, revoke the entire Bill.  I am prepared to be reasonable about regulations but I do not believe the word &ldquo;revoke&rdquo; should be inserted.  I will not make a big issue of this, I simply want to put on the record, as one who is interested in the legislative process, that words like &ldquo;revoke&rdquo; should not come under any ministerial power, however constrained. They are matters for the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>In page 13, subsection (1) (b), line 12, to delete &ldquo;ten&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;five&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have never been enthusiastic about locking people up and I have spent a considerable part of my parliamentary time here objecting to people being locked up.  A sentence of ten years is, in fact, in excess of the average length of a life sentence here which is around seven years.  I have a distinct recollection of the Minister raising some objections to that in the other House in another incarnation with the present Minister for Foreign Affairs when he was Minister for Justice. She felt it was too short.  I believe that ten years as a maximum penalty for something like this, however serious, is excessive. I do not believe in locking up people for ten years unless they are a major threat to human life and safety.  I do not believe in it, in principle, and I am not prepared to allow legislation which contains a penalty of the severity of ten years in prison to be passed.</P>
      <P>Five years would be a reasonable period.  One year is too short because that penalty is the preserve of the District Court.  Five years, as a maximum sentence, is the sort of sentence that should be imposed.  There are many other areas of legislation where excessive penalties are set out.  The idea of a five year sentence for car theft, for instance, is ludicrous in the extreme.  I believe ten years is too long I am opposed to it because we should not have those sort of penalties in our legislation, except in the most exceptional circumstances.  Therefore, I suggest a period of five years as a maximum sentence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 46, I <Col N="944" /> certainly support the sentiments expressed by Senator Ryan, that ten years is far too great.  That type of sentence is more in line with the crime of murder than with a particular offence.  We are talking here basically about a life sentence, ten years. I agree with Senator Ryan that a ten year sentence is far too great.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 47, I included the figure &ldquo;one&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;ten&rdquo;.  I believe that £10 million is far too great a fine.  There are very few companies who could tolerate that sort of fine.  Perhaps a fine of £1 million is not sufficient but £10 million is far too great. When one considers that amendment with amendment No. 49 I envisage a situation in which a company causing severe pollution &mdash; where prison sentences or fines which are envisaged here would come into play &mdash; would have to be responsible for correcting the damage done.  I believe that the figure of £10 million is far too severe.  Equally, I believe the figure of ten years is far too great.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of accepting amendments to section 9 along the lines of those two amendments.</P>

I disagree, with respect, with my colleague, Senator Naughten, in his view of reducing the £10 million to £1 million, as his amendment intended.  I do not think £10 million is too much for some of the multinationals.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the moneys involved.  A fine of £10 million is about right bearing in mind some of the bigger multinationals with which we might be dealing.  One has to assume that there will be a maximum fine of £10 million and that not every citizen who may contravene the law is likely to be presented with that type of a fine.  I support amendment No. 46 but not amendment No. 47 in this case.</P>

      <P>I disagree with my colleague Senator Ryan, and indeed also with Senator Naughten.  By putting in what may appear on the surface to be ferociously heavy fines and the possibility of jail sentences, we are making a statement about how seriously we regard damage to the environment.  Let us face it, it is not taken very seriously in many quarters.  People still consider the environment as something expendable. I believe there will be a great deal of difficulty when the time comes for the implementation of this Bill and when it starts to percolate to the offenders and polluters that this Bill will make them clean up their act.</P>
      <P>I take Senator Ryan's point that very often locking people up for many offences does not achieve anything. However, in this case, unless the polluters, the managing director, chairman of the company, or whoever, is faced with the remote possibility or remote expectancy that he or she might go to jail for a substantial period, they will not take the matter seriously.  The experience in the United States has shown that where industry is concerned fines are really not sufficient because they can insure against fines, no matter how heavy they are.  The only way to get people to take pollution seriously is by putting, or threatening to put, them into prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the well documented case of the Central Bank where 30 extra feet were added to the top of the building by <Col N="946" /> mistake.  In that case they eventually got away with it, yet, we have all witnessed people putting a small, modest extension to the back of their house and the local authority coming down on them like a ton of bricks.  That is the reality of the situation.  If that architect &mdash; or any other architect &mdash; had faced the possibility of going to jail, I am quite sure there would have been a very different outcome to Wood Quay, and that 30 feet would never have gone on.  That is exactly what we are talking about here.  After all it states &ldquo;not exceeding ten years&rdquo;, it is not obligatory that they go to prison for ten years.  It simply says it will not be greater than ten years.  It might be one, two, three or four years or anything up to ten years but not more than ten.  The amount of the fine and the possibility of a prison sentence is welcome because it shows the Minister means business.  I compliment her on having the courage to put in these fairly hefty fines and jail sentences.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment that we reduce the jail period from ten years to five years at the maximum.  I am not enthusiastic about locking people up. I wonder how my distinguished colleague, Senator Costello, would deal with these large industrialists when they find themselves in jail?  In his capacity as chairman of the Prisoners' Rights Organisation how would he handle that aspect of his work?</P>
      <P>I have no problem in relation to the £10 million fine.  The reality is that for some industries a £1 million fine may not be excessive given the sort of money which is at stake.  For that reason, I would be quite happy with the fine of £10 million and, indeed, I would be quite happy to see that figure adapted for inflation as time progresses.</P>

      <P>I accept the section as it stands and I support Senator Hederman. I think the threat of severity is called for in these matters.  One of the reasons the whole litter legislation is a joke is because nobody implements it or takes it seriously.  I am not sure a term of imprisonment is provided for in the Litter <Col N="947" /> Act but the famous £800 penalty is certainly not enforced.  These things have to be put before the public if the environment is to be taken seriously.  One of the reasons maybe that revenue under our income tax operation is shamefully falling behind its potential is that the violators of the income tax code, those who refuse to pay their proper tax, know they will not go to jail because they are middle class, whereas in the United States of America &mdash; whatever else we might say about that society &mdash; the prospect of prison looms very large before all classes and there is no respect for collars and ties or anything of that kind.</P>
      <P>I would imagine that if people were put in jail for ten years for violating the provisions of this legislation Senator Costello would ensure they would be treated humanely and given the creature comforts to which their class and station entitle them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the last remarks surprising because, while Senator Ryan has no problem with the large monetary fine of £10 million, he does have a problem with putting people into prison. This legislation will be judged in a number of ways.  First, people will look at the powers and independence of the agency, the transparency of decision-making and so on and the penalties that are imposed if people do not abide by the agency's diktat, as it were.  The Government are very keen to ensure that we are serious about environmental matters and that seriousness is reflected in a number of ways, particularly where penalties are concerned.  The kind of people who would be involved here are those for whom jail would be a major deterrent. They may not be too turned off by a monetary fine because they would not have to pay it personally.  However, if the management of a large concern whose company had destroyed the water supply in a whole region causing damage to public health and involving the State in having to pick up the tab, knew that as a result of their gross negligence on conspiring to wilfully cause negligence that <Col N="948" /> they might end up spending up to ten years in jail, then they might think again about their activities.</P>
      <P>It is in order that this legislation will be tough, will be seen to be tough and where gross negligence is involved that an appropriate fine and an appropriate prison sentence can be imposed.  In relation to Senator Naughten's amendment, if we were to reduce it to one year, for example, we would be imposing a lesser prison sentence on somebody who was involved in an offence under this Bill than someone involved in an offence under the Water Pollution Act.  Quite honestly, I do not think that would be reasonable.</P>
      <P>There are pollution incidents that can cause major damage which might never be undone or which might take a long time to undo.  We must have tough legislation which is seen to be tough and, in particular, the Oireachtas must show the courts, who have to be tougher in the way they approach environmental legislation, that they mean business.  The courts will look very seriously at the penalties imposed here, they will see it is the collective mind of the Oireachtas that they want the courts to be serious about breaches of environmental law and that they want heavy penalties and heavy fines imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fine of £100 million was imposed as a result of the Alaska oil spill; Shell in the UK were fined £2 million for the Mersey oil spill.  Those kind of fines are not out of proportion in other countries and the reason that fines to that extent are imposed is because the kind of damage involved is so enormous.  Even a fine of £10 million might not have a high enough monetary value for certain damage that could be done to our coastline and our water resources.  If a company destroyed the water resources in a region, what would it cost to repair and undo that, what would the implications be for public health and so on?  I feel very strongly about this.  I am very keen that these penalties will be as tough as possible and be seen to be tough.  If we were to in any way weaken the penalties in this Bill it would indicate to the wider public, particularly to those who will be licensed by <Col N="949" /> this agency, that may be we are not so serious after all.</P>
    <P>The whole debate about whether people should go to prison and how we deal with people who break the law is a matter for another day and for another agenda.  It is a separate issue.  Certainly prison is seen as a place of detention for people who have committed serious wrongdoings and if that is how our society looks on criminal behaviour then we should not exclude those who cause serious environmental damage from that kind of sentence.  One of the problems in this country and in other countries is often associating crime with what is called the white collar sector.  It is often assumed to only be associated with those of a different class.  This Bill shows quite clearly that regardless of who you are, if you cause serious environmental damage, it will be up to the courts to decide and adjudicate on it; it will not be a matter for the agency, it will not be a matter for us.  We should give the courts the maximum discretion to impose serious fines and up to ten years in prison. It is not a mandatory ten years in prison, it provides for up to ten years in prison if something very serious has occurred and if people have wilfully conspired with each other to cause damage.  At the end of the day if the agency are unable to enforce these penalties it may prove very difficult for people to follow their directions to concur with their monitoring regime and so on.  They need this kind of weapon as the final deterrent to enforce the provision of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the Minister I realise this could well be one of the most important sections in the Bill although up to now, I must admit, I did not see it as such.  The Minister referred to tough law.  My only worry is &mdash; because Senator Murphy referred to previous legislation and the fact that we do not make it work &mdash; whether the public in general realise how important and tough these penalties are?  The agency will try to save the environment by asking for tough penalties to be put in place.  Both the jail sentence and the fine are very <Col N="950" /> substantial but is the Minister satisfied that this section will be enforced?  We have seen legislation signed by the President and passed into law but the penalties enshrined in it were not effective.  This is one of the most important sections in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite taken by the severity of the penalties in this section.  I have no objection whatsoever to somebody who, deliberately, through carelessness or for whatever reason is responsible for an offence under this section being liable to imprisonment.  I have no great qualms as to whether it should be five or ten years, but Senator Ryan's preference for five years rather than ten years certainly impressed me.  What concerns me, for a completely different reason &mdash; I have to be careful how I phrase this because I could be misunderstood &mdash; is the penalty of £10 million.  That is an excessive figure.  I accept what the Minister said about the £100 million penalty for an oil spill in Alaska and the £2 million penalty for an oil spill in the UK.  If this £10 million penalty is in line with the penalties imposed in neighbouring countries and countries similar to ours, I will be happy with it, but if it is far in excess of penalties in other countries I wonder if use might be made of that position by countries who are competing with us for new industry.  I have not read, heard or seen a comment from, for example, the IDA, in relation to the effect this might have.  However, my fears may be totally unfounded.  There is a point I must raise on the issue of the penalty of imprisonment. That can apply from the top rung of the ladder down to the bottom rung of responsibility within any industry.  I agree with that.  That is the great deterrent.  I wonder what the Minister's reaction will be to my observation that the IDA are competing for industry here against other locations.  Are we providing a weapon to those locations to, say, forget about Ireland where there is a £10 million penalty. If that penalty is in line with penalties for similar offences in the countries I have referred to that is fine, but if we are beyond them I see a danger.</P>

We must bear in mind that two areas are involved here.  For an offence under the Bill we are talking about imprisonment for six months and a fine of £1,000.  It is on indictment that the large fine and, indeed, the prison sentence, apply.  It is very important that the court should have discretion and we rely on the courts in that regard.  It is very important that we give a clear indication of our intentions in this Bill.  If we are serious about the protection of our environment then we must send out a message.  The courts have discretion later.  If we are serious in our attempt to protect the environment then we should put down markers.  I would be opposed to any diluting of the provisions of this section.  I oppose the amendments.</P>

      <P>I will be happy if the Minister multiplies the fine by ten.  I have no problems at all about penalties.  My problem is not about penalties, but about prison.  I disapprove of prison.  It is a useless institution which does more harm than good, rarely deters anybody and ends up in most cases being a university of crime.  What the Minister said is true, the people whom she envisages going to prison for environmentally related offences are precisely those who are deterred by prison.  Most of the people who end up in jail are precisely the people who are not deterred by prison.  One of the reasons prison is a disaster is because it does not deter those whom it is meant to deter.  Judges do not send their own class to jail with the same enthusiasm that they send those of a different class to jail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sentences imposed on people who are convicted, for instance, of serious white collar crimes are minuscule by comparison with the sentences that kids sometimes get for stealing a car.  We do not even prosecute drunk drivers for the more serious offence of culpable manslaughter and as far as I am concerned that is a class-related decision as well because they are usually respectable <Col N="952" /> people.  Even if they kill somebody they get away with quite trivial sentences relative to the crime they have committed.</P>
    <P>The ten years jail sentence &mdash; it is because of its symbolic value that I object to it &mdash; is a symbol and nobody of any significance in our society will be sent to jail because our courts do not sent people of significance to jail.  Senator Murphy is right.  With all my reservations about the United States and the United Kingdom, they have a better record of sending people of significance &mdash; I use the word with a certain inverse quality to it &mdash; to prison.  They have done so in the United Kingdom.  People go to jail in Britain for fiddling their taxes, as Lester Piggot found out to his great embarrassment. People go to jail &mdash; including an ex-Vice President of the United States &mdash; for fiddling their taxes.  We do not have that regime or that climate here.  The fact, and I will be very careful here, that the chief executive of a certain major dairy co-operative in the south-west did not end up in jail for the carry-on in a certain town in Kerry seems to me to suggest that we have a fairly ambivalent attitude to these matters.  This also applies to the documentary evidence that came before the courts, in the full view of the public, of conspiracy to evade the environmental legislation.</P>

      <P>The two most unseen publications in the State are the books which contain the rulings of the Chairs of both Houses of the Oireachtas which are available to nobody except the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil.  In them are the bases for all these rulings.  I am very sensitive and very careful not to refer to individuals. If I was in any way abusing the privilege of this House let me say I am simply putting on the record of the House a case that was reported in the national newspapers &mdash; I will leave out the name of the individual &mdash; in which there was a scandalous conspiracy to evade the enforcement of the environmental protection legislation that existed at that time.  It was reported in full in the courts that people conspired to keep people waiting at the gate while certain decisions or certain processes were altered at the far end where the discharge was entering the river.  I am simply pointing out that you can get to that level of deliberate conspiracy and nobody goes to jail because of that.  I am not, therefore, arguing about the penalty, my objection is to prison. This is where I suspect I disagree with my colleagues in Fine Gael.  I do not approve of prison.  I do not think it deters, I do not think it works, and it usually does more harm than good.  In this case I feel the obligation to be consistent.  Nevertheless, I will not make this into an enormous argument.  I have made my point.

      <P>First, let me clarify what I said because I think the Minister misunderstood what I said.  I support the amendment by Senator Ryan to reduce the ten year prison sentence to five years. With regard to the other amendment, I was concerned about the amount of money involved in the fines.  I said I did not mind if a figure of £5 million was put into the Bill.  Senator Howard made the point that we could put legislation in place which might in time to come deter an industrialist from coming in here.  We have to be careful &mdash; and I have said this <Col N="954" /> throughout the Bill &mdash; to get the right balance so that we do not damage the future job opportunities for many young people.  I wish to point out to the Minister that, in view of amendment No. 49, where the court may order a person to remedy or pay for the remedying of any damage caused to the environment by the offence, when you take those two factors into account the figure of £10 million is very severe.  It may be the cause of companies ending up being bankrupt and they may not be able to pay for the clearing up of whatever damage has been done.  It is important to get the right balance.</P>
      <P>Recently we had a freshwater report on the upper regions of the Shannon. Two rivers were polluted by sewerage works operated by Roscommon Country Council, all because of lack of funding from the Department of the Environment. They were the polluting sources of the River Shannon.  I ask the Minister to examine those matters for Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>We have discussed this at length and people have already made up their minds.  I feel that Senator Ryan is against sending people to prison. What he is saying is that we are sending the wrong people to prison.  I go along to a large extent with Senator Ryan in that I think we are sending the wrong people to prison.  As he says, prisons become universities of crime and do not cure anything. I believe in this instance, as the Minister said and as I said earlier, that the threat for a serious pollutor of going to jail will be a deterrent while the largest fine you could mention simply will not. That is what is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the judges might have an opportunity to send one of their own class to jail, as Senator Ryan pointed out.  It has been my bitter experience that the judges and the courts are very poor at supporting local authorities in the rare instances when local authorities try to bring to court culprits who have been in breach of the Planning Act.  The judges have an abyssmal lack of understanding of what the Planning Act is about and <Col N="955" /> of their willingness to mete out fines or something that would be mildly commensurate with the offences committed.</P>
    <P>I remember one instance not so long ago when Dublin Corporation took to court somebody who had converted an entire house in Dartmouth Square into offices without permission.  They got off because the developer produced the son of the previous owner who had been an architectural student and they were able to say that he did drawings of the diningroom table and of his bedroom and the judge let him off.  The corporation had pursued the case for months and the case was let go.  The judges are always on the side of letting these people off.  They do not take it seriously.  I absolutely believe that, unless very hefty penalties are written in here and the threat of jail, the judges simply will not give the back-up that will be required by the agency to implement this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Ryan has an objection to imprisonment <i>per se</i> on moral, philosophical or aesthetic grounds, logically his amendment should propose deleting all references to imprisonment, not simply reducing it from ten to five which is just a form of inconsistency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I would like to take up.  I feel the threat of imprisonment for white collar workers, whether we are talking about one year, five years or ten years, is effectively the same.  It has a far greater impact than the threat of a large fine.  I have no difficulty with the level at which the monetary fine is pitched.  I find ten years quite excessive, but I will not press it because I understand fully the point the Minister made in terms of the impact a long term of imprisonment may have in sending a message to those who might pollute the environment that we take this very seriously and there will be no messing about as far as this State is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that ten years is too long for the type of crime.  I presume we are not talking about premeditated crime in this <Col N="956" /> area.  If so, we need to take a long look again at what it is about.  I am not sure of the implications of it in specific cases. Relative to other prison terms in this State, ten years for this type of offence would seem rather long, and that is conviction of indictment.</P>
    <P>Reading the section, summary convicton and a fine not exceding £1,000 is very little in many cases.  Perhaps it is on that area we should concentrate rather than the other.  When you are talking about a fine not exceeding £1,000, that will not even make a dint past the secretary in the general manager's or the chief executive's office of some of these multinationals. I wonder if that figure is pitched too low to be a preliminary warning to those not to cross the State's law in this area.  It seems very little.  I know we are getting into the area of District Court <i>versus</i> the rest and you will start with the District Court.  Do I recall correctly that that figure which is applicable to the District Court is being increased? Did I not see or read something recently about the levels of fines applicable at the different court levels being increased, doubled or trebled?  I think it is gone up to £4,000 at District Court level.  I am throwing that out for clarification.  I certainly read something in relation to this recently.  Certainly, £1,000 would appear to be derisory.  It is a lot for the average Joe Citizen who may have broken the law, but the judges would take that into account, but certainly for the multinationals it will not have much of an impact.</P>
    <P>In relation to what my colleague, Senator Howard, stated, I would not have the same concerns that we might be out of step with some of the other countries. Because at present, after Puerto Rico, we are considered internationally as the dumping ground for dirty industries.  We want to attract as much industry to this country as we can and I do not see an insistence on strict environmental standards as any deterrent to the type of industies we want.  Concern for the environment does not threaten development or industry in this country in any way; in fact, it enhances it.  I would not <Col N="957" /> share his concern that by putting in a figure of £10 million we might frighten off industry, because any industry that would need to be frightened by talking about indictment under the Environmental Protection Agency Act is one we need to take a long and careful look at anyway. We need a realistic approach.  We need jobs, but even more important than jobs we need environmental standards which in the long term will create more jobs. We should not be slipshod in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly agree with the points just made by Senator Doyle in relation to foreign industry.  Senator Howard was concerned that if we pitched the fine so high and were higher than other countries it might act as a deterrent to foreign industrialists locating here.  I think the only industrialists who would be put off by the high level of penalties would be those who intended to come here to pollute or destroy our environment. Any decent industry that wanted to operate here would not be in any way deterred by the level of penalty involved in this or any other legislation.  On the contrary, I think they would be encouraged. Many people in the private sector in industry have said to me that they welcome the level of the fines and that they would like to see them enforced because those who obey the law and adopt proper standards want to ensure that others do not get away because they do not have the same high standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was one of the difficulties for many people in industry &mdash; the perception that perhaps they might have got away with spending a lot less money, having fewer controls and fewer people employed in environmental monitoring and so on.  When I met many organisations before this Bill was drafted the one thing that was said to me time and time again, both by the IDA, the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries and many other people involved in Irish industry was: &ldquo;Give us the legislation, but please make sure it is enforced.  We will accept strong, tough legislation, but we want to know that that legislation is going to be enforced&rdquo;. <Col N="958" /> I believe they are entitled to know that the legislation will be fully enforced.</P>
    <P>It seems that some of the Senators want tough laws, they want to strengthen the Bill as we go through the sections, but when it comes to the really tough stuff, it is a little bit too tough.  One of the main reasons for the establishment of this agency was the perception among the public that the existing ways of enforcing environmental standards were not appropriate and that there was a tendency, perhaps, to have a soft approach, to say they had not got enough money, or it might close them down, or let us do it this way and let us not bring the full rigour of the law against somebody involved in pollution.  I do not think that kind of approach is acceptable.  If you have an independent agency you will not have that kind of approach.  However, very often there is a tendency to lobby in favour of group X, group Y or individual X or Y and not have the full rigours of the law applied to them.  That certainly would be totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that the fines and so on will obviously be imposed by the courts and not by the agency.  They are not mandatory fines, they are discretionary fines of up to £10 million, up to ten years imprisonment and so on.</P>
    <P>In relation to Senator Ryan's philosophical approach to prison, it is more appropriate to a different debate.  The fact is that in our society for those who are considered to have done serious wrongdoing, convicted by the courts of serious wrongdoing, considered a danger to society for various reason, that is the penalty and the manner in which we have sought to deal with them.  Once that level of penalty exists it should certainly apply to environmental legislation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the fines on summary conviction, I too would have liked to have those fines higher; but the Attorney General's office have very strongly advised that minor courts, the District Court being a minor court, cannot impose a fine at a higher level than £1,000.  The legislation that Senator Doyle referred to is going to extend the jurisdiction of the <Col N="959" /> court as far as awards and so on are concerned.  I do not know if it actually applies to fines.  If it did, we could obviously have a look at this again at a later stage; but we were very strongly advised in the drafting of this legislation, as we were with the water pollution legislation, that we could not go higher than a fine of £1,000.  I accept that there is a large discrepancy between the highest fine of £1,000 on summary conviction and then what would appear to be an extraordinarily high fine of £10 million on conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>Conviction on indictment would be for very, very serious pollution incidents and I do believe we need that kind of weapon. To lower the fine to something like £1 million would be too soft.  It may well be worth somebody's while not to put in the appropriate technology, not to take the appropriate measures, because the fine might be actually cheaper, if it were at a maximum of £1 million, than buying the equipment and putting in all the controls and so on.  It would also indicate to the courts that if £1 million was the highest fine, then that must be for something really serious, and degrees of seriousness were obviously to go way below that. You would probably find that the average fine on indictment would be very low indeed and I do not think that would be the desire.  The courts will see that they have discretion to impose £1 million, £2 million, £0.5 million, £5 million &mdash; that there is a wide discretion left to the courts.  Obviously, they would only consider imposing the high fine for a very serious matter indeed.  I believe it is appropriate for the circumstances in which we find ourselves and certainly it compares favourably with the kind of fines that are imposed now in other jurisdictions.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 48:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Where a person has been convicted of an offence under this Act the court may order that person to remedy (or pay for the remedying of) any damage caused to the environment by the offence.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is being proposed primarily to ensure that the pollutor pays for the damage.  It provides for the courts to make orders that somebody who causes damage from pollution can be forced to repair and to remedy that damage.  I understand that some of the provisions which are covered in this amendment are also covered in other areas of the Bill, but I would hope that the Minister might accede to including them here at this point in the Bill for a variety of reasons.  One is that it does not distinguish between licensed and unlicensed industries.  It also provides that people who are convicted in the District Court, where the fine is relatively modest, would also have the added burden of having to clean up and repair the mess which they had caused.  It is also partly introduced out of an anxiety to ensure that the people who cause pollution should be subject to, as it were, the general effects of civil actions in the courts, whereas most of this Bill seems to deter people through the criminal law.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding any other provisions in the Bill, I feel that section <Col N="961" /> 9, which deals with penalties generally, should have reference in another subsection &mdash; subsection(4) as we are suggesting here &mdash; to persons convicted remedying the damage or paying for the remedying of the damage they have caused to the environment.  It is basically the &ldquo;pollutor pays&rdquo; principle, which I think all of us generally support.  It is right through all types of environmental legislation and we cannot get away from it.

It is very important to have that stitched into the Bill.</P>

      <P>If the agency is to be the beneficiary of finest imposed by the courts for an offence under this Bill, then it does not seem consistent to stop at cases which are prosecuted by the agency itself.  Why not provide that all court fines be paid to the agency, irrespective of who initiates the prosecution?  That is the purpose of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>While I can understand the motivation behind this amendment and the benefit as far as the agency is concerned in that it could receive some additional revenue, it would, first of all, be totally at variance with our existing legal system in that fines imposed on indictment go to the State rather than to <Col N="963" /> the individual who does the prosecution. But, in relation to the overall provisions of this amendment, it would mean, for example, that regardless of who took the prosecution, whether it was a local authority, the Minister or the DPP, the fines would go to the agency.  I think that would be unfair.  The fines would help to defray the State's expense of having to undo the damage in some cases.  It would be important that the fines would remain with the State rather than be earmarked for either the agency or any other body. Therefore, I am afraid I cannot accept the Senator's amendment.</P>
      <P>In taking these prosecutions there would obviously be enormous expenses for the DPP.  There are enormous legal costs involved in taking a case of this kind.  It would not be reasonable in all cases that that fine would go to the agency.  It may well be the case that the State, through the local authorities or through the Department of the Environment or whoever, would have to begin to undo the damage if the public water supply was damaged, or whatever.  It would be appropriate that any serious fines imposed under this section on indictment &mdash; obviously the agency will get the fines for the cases it brings itself under summary conviction &mdash; would go to the State and, hopefully, at the end of the day would go towards undoing the damage caused.  I am sorry that I cannot be helpful on this occasion as I have been on other occasions.  I hope that that is acceptable to the Senator.</P>

The principle behind the section is that it is not a matter of fund-raising for the agency, it is not a question of putting fines into the agency' coffers?  I am asking a question here.  Is the purpose of the section to enable whatever body initiates a prosecution to recover the expenses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">

      <P>The idea is that the agency will be prosecuting and taking it in cases on summary conviction, but the <Col N="964" /> DPP will be taking the more serious fines. The purpose of this section is to allow for the payment of the fines in the cases taken by the agency to go to the agency, but other fines would go into the State's resources, which is the case at the moment.  The agency would not have the expense of taking a case on indictment. That would be done for them by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>

    <P>I would like to get an assurance from the Minister, if the agency manages to be particularly efficient and effective &mdash; and I hope that it does not have cause to earn a lot of money through fines because in that situation there would obviously have been an awful lot of environmental problems around the place &mdash; and collect a lot of money that the Government &mdash; Minister for Finance &mdash; Minister for the Environment or whoever is responsible, will not reduce the annual subvention of the agency by the amount they managed to collect.  In other words, I do not want the agency to be penalised by the State for being particularly vigilant and effective in implementing the law.  I would like <Col N="965" /> to know the Minister's views on this and I would like an assurance that there would be no clawback of Government funding commensurate with or equivalent to the fines the agency may collect.</P>

      <P>Have we any idea of what kind of money we are talking about?  I find it very hard to envisage the magnitude of the money coming in by way of recouping costs and so on.  Is there any proportion between the financing of the agency by the State, which must receive it if it is to function, on the one hand, and the kind of income or revenue that comes into it by the way of fines?  It seems to me that such fines might be quite trivial in comparison to the cost of running the agency. I do not see a proportion, as it were, between the two points being made in the amendment. This is just a matter of information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to ask the Minister what subsection (2) of section 9 means.  I think it has to do with the DPP's role in prosecuting on indictment.  It appears to me that the revenue accruing to the agency from section 10 will be quite small.  It will only be for summary convictions.  It is a pity that we are not going to have some way of transferring this.  I accept the costs of prosecution; but if there is a fine of £10 million imposed on somebody, it appears that under section 10 none of that will go to the agency.  That hardly meets our objectives.</P>

      <P>Sorry, I lost my train of thought for a moment.  My apologies. It is a difficult section to understand.  It <Col N="966" /> was difficult to understand why the amendment was out of order.  Can we assume that, if amendment No. 51 is not put in, the agency's funding will be reduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, in relation to the funding of the agency, obviously that will be a matter for the Government of the day at any one time, but we estimate at the moment that in a full year the agency will cost about £8 million.  The amount of money we are talking about here in relation to fines on summary conviction is very small.  If the agency gets 100 convictions at the maximum fine, which is probably unlikely &mdash; 100 is a lot, particularly at a maximum fine &mdash; one is talking about £100,000.  It is not an enormous sum of money but it is appropriate that that money should go to the agency.  I think Government funding and the funding of State bodies has to be a matter for budgetary policy on a year-to-year basis.  There is no way that I or anybody else can give an assurance that five years from now when others may be in Government that they are going to give X, Y or Z to a particular agency. There is no way of having a level of certainty about this except to say that because of the concern about the environment and the ongoing public interest and demand for strong environmental controls and action one can take it for the foreseeable future Governments of whatever shade are going to ensure that there is adequate funding for this agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A substantial proportion of the agency's funding &mdash; a much greater proportion than will come from fines &mdash; will come from the licensing role which the agency has been given.  That is important. Of course, the agency will also be able to charge on a full cost recovery basis for monitoring so that the State does not have to subvent the monitoring charge on the agency of monitoring pharmaceutical, chemical or food processing companies or whatever.  It is appropriate that they would pay the full cost of the monitoring. We estimate that about £1 million will come from both licence fees and direct monitoring levies.  The bulk of the <Col N="967" /> money will come from the Exchequer through Government subvention on an annual grant basis.  It would be very inappropriate for the Government to decide on an annual grant of, say, £4 million or £8 million or £10 million and then to say at the end of the year that they want £100,000 back which the agency received in fines.  I do not envisage that.  Even though the amendment is out of order and we should not probably be speaking to it, and it was the Cathaoirleach not I who ruled it out of order, I do not foresee this as a problem.  I do not think we should dwell too long on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point adequately made that summary convictions and money that might accrue to the agency from same will not amount to a lot but there is a principle here as the Minister has pointed out.  If, in terms of income to the agency from licences, charges and summary convictions, we are now to accept a future clawback from the agency commensurate with any such income, that could be dangerous.  On the summary convictions alone there will not be much but they could have an income of £2 million to £3 million if you add all the licences, charges, fines, etc.  Does that mean if they were getting £8 million in one year at the time from the Government that the next year they would only get £5 million if they earned £3 million the previous year?  Are we talking about the principle of clawback now and is it likely to be applied?  I would like an assurance on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly most unlikely to happen.  I do not think anybody has ever suggested a clawback in relation to fines the local authorities might collect under the Water Pollution Act, for instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was probably unwise to get myself into this debate.  The intention <Col N="968" /> is that the Government will give an annual grant to the agency.  There will be consultation when the agency is established between the director general and the board of directors, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Finance in relation to the initial budget. Thereafter, it will be a matter of consultation and a budgetary matter for Government. I cannot say with certainty that in the year dot there might not be restrictions on the funding but for as long as I am in a position to give commitments I would be of the opinion that this agency will be properly funded.  It is the Government's intention that this will be a strong, fully resourced, properly funded independent agency to look after environmental protection and to ensure that high environmental standards are enforced throughout the country.  The matter of the agency's budget would be more appropriately discussed in the context of the debate on the Appropriation Bill and not in the context of this Bill.  We estimate the agency will cost £8 million in a full year but that may change depending on the staffing requirements and matters of that kind.  That figure is an estimate at this stage.</P>

      <P>The wording of section 10 is much more positive than some of my colleagues seem to think.  In the early debate on this matter a commitment was given because it was questioned whether £7 million or £10 million or what figure would be granted to the agency.  I do not see why it should be written in that the fines shall be held because it is understood surely that the fines will be held by the agency.  As the Minister has said, on top of that you have a £1 million payment for licences and monitoring.  I am happy with this section concerning payments of certain fines to the agency.  We cannot put everything absolutely into place and nobody knows that better than Members in this House.

      <P>I understand this amendment had to be disallowed.  Nevertheless the principal of the amendment is to ensure that the amount of fines collected by the agency would not reduce the funding of the agency by that amount and the Minister has told us she could not envisage such a situation.  However, seven years ago the Ombudsman Bill went through the Dáil and certain guarantees were given then for funding.  We all know the uproar that arose here some three years ago when the office was without staff for lack of funding creating a situation where there was a delay of up to two years on cases being examined. Can the Minister give an assurance to the House that there is no danger of that situation arising with this agency?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept fully the Minister's intention but I want to tell her what used to happen in the case of institutions which I know well, the regional technical colleges.  They got a budget from the Department of Education in which an estimate was made of the revenue they would raise from their own resources and one of the great problems was that if the regional college was enterprising and raised funds from other sources such as consultancy work or by staff using and renting out its facilities and if it exceeded its estimated income in a financial year the Department of Education would reduce their grant in the following year by the amount by which they had exceeded their own expected revenue.  They had a continuing incentive not to raise funds <Col N="970" /> over and above what the Department of Education assumed they would get from a certain source.  I would always be wary of the capacity of Government Departments to do things that look very clever but are often considerable disincentives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the thrust of this section, as I always welcome intiatives which have the private sector supporting State enterprise and the public service.  I welcomed it in the Insurance Bill and in the Companies Bill where requirements were placed on auditors to give certain information to the Government and to Government Departments and Ministers as appropriate.  I agree with the points made by Senator Ryan and by Senator Doyle.  I would not wish to see this provision being used to diminish the funding available to the agency.  At a theoretical level if we were all agreed that the agency required £x per year to do their business and if half of that came from fines, I would not have any difficulty with that.  I would see that a saving of taxpayers' money and, consequently, something about which we should all be in agreement.  I have often said that the public service can be as competitive as any other group if they are let do their business.  There is a danger about earmarking funds to that extent.  It is like saying that our road tax should go to filling potholes, etc.  It is a simplistic kind of argument.  This is the way money can be directed into a particular resource or service.  I do not have any difficulty, nor does anybody else, as regards the idea of the fines being put towards the agency. It is up to us at this end to ensure that this is not used as a means of reducing the effectiveness of the agency.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister comes in, may I make a final comment, accepting that my amendment was out of order. Precedent would not allow any of us to take any comfort from the Minister's assurances on the point we are making. Examples have been given.  We could all list numerous other examples through local government, the health boards and <Col N="971" /> various other bodies.  We really need categorical assurance in so far as the Minister is in a position to give them to us that it is not the Minister's intention to clawback from the agency moneys equivalent to that they may raise either in fines or charges and licence fees, which come later in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as I am in a position to give that assurance I can.  I am not going to be around forever and I am not the Minister for Finance and I am not a member of the Cabinet.  It is not intended to give the agency power to raise money through fees and charges for monitoring and allow it keep the fines for summary conviction and then to come back and say that we are going to deduct £X now because you have been able to raise £Y.</P>
      <P>When the agency is established, and its very establishment is going to require the allocation of resources, it is envisaged that the director general and the board of directors will discuss with the Minister of the Environment of the day the needs of the agency as far as resources are concerned. My officials have estimated, given the functions we are giving to the agency and the number of staff we estimate they will require and the kind of job they have to do, that we are talking about a budget in present monetary terms of about £8 million per year.  It may be slightly more or slightly less but that is the broad figure.  The agency has a wide range of functions and if it has to carry out additional monitoring it will need more resources and will have to charge the person or company being monitored the appropriate charge.  But that would be an additional factor rather than the usual situation, I would envisage.</P>

      <P>Government Amendment No. 52:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (1), line 34, to delete &ldquo;other than section 103 or 105,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;other than section 103, 105, 107 or 108 or any regulations made thereunder,&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of amendment Nos. 52 and 54 is to provide that the agency will not have an automatic power to carry out a prosecution in these cases as it may not be the responsible authority.  Under subsection (2) the Minister may give prosecution powers to <Col N="973" /> whatever body is given responsibility for these functions.  Section 103 and 105 of the Bill do not contain any specific provision in relation to prosecution by the agency of offences under these sections or regulations made thereunder.  It is considered that any regulations for the control of noise under section 103 would in general be enforceable by local authorities. The enforcement of the nuisance provisions of section 105 are specifically assigned to local authorities or to any other person affected by such noise.  The provisions of section 107 in relation to access to information on the environment have much wider application than to the agency alone and in any event it is not certain that offences will arise under the regulations to be made.</P>
      <P>No decisions have been made as to which organisations would be responsible for the enforcement of any controls to be introduced under section 108 in relation to genetically modified organisims. This would be a matter for consideration at the time and regulations are being drafted.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">

      <P>I move amendment No. 53:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (1), line 35, after &ldquo;summarily&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or on indictment&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment would allow the agency to prosecute offences in the Circuit Court where the £1 million fine would apply rather than in the District Court as the Bill now stands.  That would solve a lot of people's concern about guarantees that large fines which can arise under this Bill will get back to the agency directly rather than making their way into central funds. I expect the Minister will be reluctant to agree to this amendment for reasons which relate to the functions of the Director of Public Prosecutions and so on and because of the knock-on effects arising from acceptance of the amendment.  We have tabled it in part to draw attention to some aspects of the role of the Director of Public Prosecutions in this area, particularly in relation to difficulties the <Col N="974" /> Director of Public Prosecutions may have in obtaining expert advice which would allow him to act rapidly in relation to some pollution cases.  We are also concerned that the powers of injunction have been removed from the Bill which marks a contrast between this Bill and a similar Bill produced by Deputy Shatter last year.  Those are the main reasons for proposing this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  As the Senator knows, all prosecutions on indictment in this country are taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The only other body with the power to do so are the Revenue Commissioners. Taking a prosecution on indictment is a very serious matter because of the consequences for the person accused.  That is why the procedure has to go to a preliminary examination by the District Court and it would not be desirable to pass that on to the agency.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, the agency would require a plethora of legal resources which quite honestly I do not think they require, given that those resources are already available in the Director of Public Prosecutions office.  It is not necessary for the agency to have this power.  The important thing is to have cases of prosecutions taken on indictment and to have convictions secured where serious wrongdoing has occurred.  It is not significant for the implementation of this legislation or in the interest of environment protection which body takes it.  Since we have to fulfil basic rules and ensure that the administration of justice is streamlined and that these prosecutions are only taken after the basic preliminary examination has occurred, it is appropriate that that function should still remain with the Director of Public Prosecutions as far as environmental matters are concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to make a big thing out of this, a Chathaoirligh, but the prosecution of an offence under <Col N="975" /> environmental legislation is an extremely technical area of prosecution which has a lot more to do with science, technology and litigal methods and other matters than it has to do with law.  There is, of course, a considerable element of law in it.  Can the Minister give us the reasons she believes that the legal expertise which undoubtedly exists in the Director of Public Prosecution's Office can understand the complex technical, scientific, technological and other questions necessary to adjudicate on the evidence?  The first thing the Director of Public Prosecution's Office has to do is to adjudicate on a file of evidence presented to it to decide whether there is a case to be pursued. The adjudication of evidence in an area like environmental protection is different from the routine adjudication on areas in which there is a long legal tradition.  For instance, forensic evidence to deal with crime is a well established area where legal precedence has been established, where the terminology is familiar and where developments take place slowly. We are now talking about an entirely new area with a mass of quite complex legislation.  Some areas of this Bill are extremely complicated such as integrated pollution licences.  I am not being critical. I would not be happy that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions &mdash; this is not a reflection on the Director of Public Prosecutions, I think he is one of the fine public servants this State has&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is still a case to be proven on a major area.  I am talking about the objective the Minister has identified which is that this agency must be seen to be technically and politically credible, and credible in every other way. I am not sure that if you accept that the Revenue Commissioners can be given the right to carry out their own prosecutions in one very important area that the environmental protection agency, given its unique nature and the unique importance of the environment should not have similar powers.  In terms of this country's future development if we are going to be different and preserve what is good about this country, the protection of our environment is not just a peripheral issue on the side; it is fundamental to our industrial, agricultural and tourism development and to our future as a centre for internationally traded services.  This agency is a major plank of future economic development.  It is not an inhibition but an asset to development and because of that it must be seen to work.  I would worry about the expertise available in the DPP's Office to assess the quality of the evidence because that quality is going to be a matter of considerable controversy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear on the Minister's response.  Before the Minister responded I was under the mistaken impression that it was only the DPP who could initiate criminal proceedings in the Circuit Court; I had forgotten about the Revenue Commissioners.  I had some idea that the Revenue Commissioners did it through the DPP.  This is going to require very specialised legal support.  It will have to be put together at some stage and the question here is where should that legal support be based? Should it be in the DPP's Office or should it be part of the work of the agency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Upton has raised a point of <Col N="977" /> extreme significance here.  I want to know whether the acceptance of Senator Upton's amendment would require consequental changes in other legislation or if there is other legislation in place which would not allow this to take place.  I am trying to establish if this is possible.  From the earlier part of the Minister's response I got the impression that it was not possible because of existing regulations or laws; now I am not so sure.  First we need to know whether the specialised legal support is already in place in the DPP's Office.  I do not think any of us would expect that it is.  Secondly, would the acceptance of Senator Upton's amendment require consequential changes in other pieces of legislation?  Is there legislation there which states that only the DPP and the Revenue Commissioners may initiate criminal proceeding?  This is the critical point.  If we are going to have to set up a section of the DPP's Office it is as easy to place it in one place as the other and it might be better to have it in the agency where environmental support and information would be available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the final point made by Senator O'Toole.  If legal expertise is going to have to be provided, it does not matter where it is provided because the money will be coming from the State.  The other aspect of the Minister's reply I would like to respond to is if legal expertise has to be provided does it make all that much difference whether it is in the DPP's Office or in the Environmental Protection Agency's offices?  It would be more effective from an environmental point of view if it was located in the Environmental Protection Agency offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment because it can only strengthen the agency to have this additional power.  It is not required to use it.  There is provision for conviction on indictment already in the Bill and I do not see why there should not be some provision of this kind which would strengthen the agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to whether <Col N="978" /> we could give this power to the agency, I am advised we probably could, subject to the provisions of the Act establishing the Director of Public Prosecutions' Office because he was given the powers the Attorney General has under Article 30 of the Constitution in relation to the taking of prosecutions on indictment. There is some misunderstanding.  All the technical expertise necessary and the decision to take a case on indictment would be the responsibility of the agency. They would decide that something was a serious pollution matter to be pursued through the courts or that a prosecution indictment was appropriate and they would provide all of the environmental expertise and so on.</P>
      <P>Because of the basic rules we apply to serious matters of that kind through our judicial system, those cases have to go through a preliminary examination at District Court level and we have to be sure that all of the matters that pertain to justice and the rights of citizens and so on are followed and lawyers are, therefore, required.  It is neither necessary nor desirable for the legal expertise required to handle these matters to be necessarily located in the agency.  I think it is much more in keeping with the way we run our national affairs that all legal expertise be located in one place because one day the legal expertise would be applied to murder or rape cases or whatever and it is the same legal expertise that one would be using on environmental matters. Granted, they will all have different technical and other expertise at their disposal. It is not desirable that the agency be given a whole host of legal staff because it would add unnecessary additional cost to the operation of the agency and the DPP's Office, in conjunction with the agency, can do this job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the exception of the powers given to the Revenue Commissioners which have been given for good political reasons &mdash; many will say they already have quite extraordinary powers but I support those powers and perhaps even more might be necessary &mdash; it is Government policy that all other prosecutions on indictment should be taken through the DPP.  I am <Col N="979" /> not in a position to turn Government policy on its head as far as that matter is concerned.</P>

    <P>I would like to refer to the Hirschfeld Centre.  We have heard about the Temple Bar area, a Left Bank area, the atmosphere of Paris and so on.  I invested there with the Hirschfeld Centre in 1978.  We brought people in.  People had not heard of it at that stage.  We had a cinema, a restaurant, a discotheque for the gay community, women's groups, and we dealt with environmental issues.  We fed and watered the people who were protesting about Wood Quay.  We were the first people there &mdash; not just from the gay community &mdash; who came into that area and first saw the opportunities in that remarkable and delightful part of the city.  I could point to virtually every business in that area and say; &ldquo;Yes, they <Col N="980" /> responded on environmental issues, they were on the Wood Quay march, that is where the idea came from&rdquo;.  We provided the energy to revive the entire area but we were the one operation that has received no encouragement, no funding. There is an item on the Order Paper recommending a lottery grant to the Hirschfeld Centre which has been passed by Dublin Corporation, which has been pressed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Womens' Rights, an all-party committee.  All the £50,000 funding which was passed by Dublin Corporation was flung into the bin.  I welcome what is being done by the Department of the Taoiseach and so on in the Temple Bar area but I have to ask the question, why is it that one group and that, the very first group to go into that area to risk capital investment, to renovate a building and to bring the intellectual and cultural life&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> It is indeed true to say that Dublin is a city of culture and it is appropriate that this year we should celebrate Dublin as European City of Culture.  The city has been adorned by famous names and by a succession of famous artists, musicians, sculptors, historians, writers, actors and a host of other very talented people.  All of this has greatly influenced our own attitudes and the way we see ourselves. Our culture is an expression of what we are and we celebrate this year as one in which all of us can be proud.  The fact that I, or indeed, any other person inside or outside this House, may not be a native of the city of Dublin does not preclude us from taking pride in what is happening this year.  We are basking in the reflected glory of the celebrations that are taking place at this time.  Many famous people in every sphere came from rural Ireland and while they looked upon Dublin as their adopted city they reflected in large part many of the traits of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would love to hear a definition of a true Dubliner.  Is there any person who can claim categorically that he has absolutely 100 per cent true Dublin blood in him?  I do not know of any such people and I would love to know if they exist. Perhaps Senator Cosgrave can enlighten me on that.  If I am wrong I will rephrase it by saying that the vast majority of people who live in this city and whose ancestors came from the city originated from rural Ireland.  However, we all have a very special association with the city and we can take pride in the fact that this year Dublin is European City of Culture.</P>
    <P>The range of activities is extremely impressive.  There are exhibitions, drama, films, music, special events, tours, seminars and a host of other activities including, tá mé lán sásta le rá, imeachtaí trí Ghaeilge.  Mar a dúirt mé ar dtús, tá sé sin an-tábhachtach ar fad.</P>
    <P>It is true to say the city is currently undergoing a total renaissance.  Many decisions and activities particularly relating to the inner city have greatly enhanced those areas.  The recent decision to develop &mdash; Senator Norris welcomed it &mdash; the Temple Bar area and the surrounding areas is indeed to be welcomed. <Col N="982" /> That will have major benefits, with the emphasis on artists, music and song.  As the Taoiseach said, it will bring those areas to life and make them vibrant.  I take the opportunity, in referring to the Taoiseach, to congratulate him and pay him a very special tribute for the immense contribution he has made over the years to the preservation and development of our culture, not alone in the city of Dublin but right throughout the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, more than anybody else, recognised the importance of our artists, of every hue, long before anyone else did and he did something positive about encouraging and fostering the arts when one would have to say it was not really fashionable to do so.  He recognised the enormous benefits to our culture and to the country as a whole that our artists and musicians and all the different people who are talented in every way make to this country and to the city of Dublin.  He recognised that fact long before anyone else did, when it was not really fashionable to do so.  In fact, one could say that he led the way in this particular area. This city and indeed the whole country is all the better for it.</P>
    <P>We have outstanding examples of the huge developments that have taken place in recent times in relation to the revitalisation and the total refurbishment and improvement of the whole city, for example, the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, and the beautiful job that has been done on Dublin Castle.  Those are just two examples of the enormous contribution that is being made to develop, foster and preserve our heritage in terms of the actual structures of the city, apart from the development and encouragement that has been given over the years to all our artists in recognition of the very important contribution those people have made to this country.  The fact that we have so many famous people reflects very well on our whole culture.  Today we have actors, film makers, directors and producers who are in great demand all around the world.  They are world renowned.</P>
    <P>The film, &ldquo;My Left Foot&rdquo;, an Irish production, was acclaimed throughout <Col N="983" /> the world and won Oscars.  Credit is due not only to the people who won the Oscars.  They were absolutely magnificent and I compliment them on their marvellous achievement.  The film is based on an outstanding book by Christy Brown.  That, in itself, shows the outstanding contribution that can be made by, one could say, I suppose, as near to a Dublin person as possible.  However, there are numerous others, and those are people who have come to light at the very top.</P>
    <P>There is a range of other artists who are making a name for themselves and contributing in the best possible way to what is best in everything Irish.  They have the opportunity to display to the world outside everything that is good and wholesome and everything, indeed, that is Irish.  I do not think we have to apologise to anybody for what we are.  We can hold our own with any other nation in the world in terms of the tremendously rich culture that we are proud to have.</P>
    <P>If there are some people who feel that our culture is inferior to other cultures, I would say to them to stand back and have a look at themselves, because there is absolutely nothing in the world that we need to be ashamed of.  In fact, the reverse would be the case.  Not for one second need we be ashamed of what we are.  For whatever reason, some of us tend to feel we are a little bit inferior.  It is only when we hear outsiders recognise the enormous potential, contribution and ability of our artists of all kinds that we stop and think: &ldquo;Is it not absolutely marvellous that there are outsiders who think so much about this country and the people in this country?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have an outstandingly rich heritage. It is up to us as public representatives to foster, promote and develop that heritage and make it known throughout the world.  The Taoiseach has led the way.  It behoves all of us to take a leaf out of his book.  He takes pride in our culture and heritage.  We can follow his lead and ensure that the rich culture we have continues into the future.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom arís comhghairdeas a <Col N="984" /> dhéanamh le gach duine a bhí páirteach san obair seo, comóradh na cathrach mar chathair chultúrtha na hEorpa, agus guím gach rath orthu.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to support this motion.  It makes a change that in this House we are all, if you like, rowing in the one direction, but it is a very good direction that we are rowing in.  We are the seventh city to be designated European City of Culture. We follow Greece, Florence, Amsterdam, Berlin, Paris and Glasgow.  Each of those cities has benefited from having been the European City of Culture.  In relation to culture, Dublin can certainly stand equal, if not far and away above, any of these other cities.  It is important that we work towards making 1991 a successful year for culture in Dublin.  I hope, as has happened in other cities, that when we come to the end of the year we can say progress has been made in certain areas, that events that took place were very significant and that we can go on from there.</P>
      <P>Culture and its development, developing and promoting our past and building on it is an ongoing process.  If we are to be serious about it, 1991 should be, if you like, the ending of one chapter and the beginning of another.  We are all aware of Dublin's tremendous tradition.  We had, in 1988, the Millennium Year and many Members of the House were involved in that and it was a success.  We must build on that, not dwell on it, and go on to develop our culture and improve Dublin as a city.  There is talk that with the right approach an extra 20 per cent of tourists will come to the city and visit the many famous places.  As a Dubliner, in the traditional sense, coming from people who were publicans in James's Street, helped on by, as the Leader of the House would have it, national hunt roots, it gives me pleasure to support this motion.  It is important that we cherish our past, that we benefit from our past and that we benefit from the many and different people who have promoted Dublin, lived in Dublin and been part of Dublin down through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> Recently I listened to a person from Scotland who described how they developed the cultural year in Glasgow and made progress in many areas.  This should be the way with Dublin because we have to improve on many of our efforts and promotions and not forget what has gone before.  We should be inspired by and proud of our past.  By our actions, whether it be at councillor level, at political level, at cultural level, in the arts, in architecture or whatever, we have to make certain of our future.</P>
    <P>We can trace a whole tradition in Dublin from the Vikings, the Normans, the freeing of the State.  We should never forget this and never be ashamed of it. Dublin has progressed in many areas, such as the restoration of the Royal Hospital and the building of the financial centre.  There have been various developments on both sides of the quays.  We have to make sure that we provide money in some of the areas that have become run down.  Hopefully through all our efforts we can restore the city.</P>
    <P>I would go along with the previous speaker in praising the commitment of the Taoiseach to culture and the arts and their development and of putting them more up front.  As politicians and members of local authorities it is important that we promote culture, development, the maintenance of areas and the whole environmental question.</P>
    <P>I will quote from an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 16 March, 1991 which is from &ldquo;Jack Hinton, The Guardsmen&rdquo;, By Charles Lever.  It reads:</P>
    <P>Play and politics, wine and women, debts and duels, were discussed not only with an absence of all restraint, but with a deep knowledge of the world and a profound insight into the heart, which often imparted the careless and random speech, the sharpness of the most cutting sarcasm.</P>
    <P>Personalities too were rife: no one spared his neighbour, for he did not expect mercy for himself.</P>
    <P>I suppose we could say, thank God, little has changed since that time, but it is <Col N="986" /> important that we use this year to promote Dublin.  If we promote Dublin, we are promoting Ireland.  I suppose Members who come from further afield and at times support other counties would not begrudge Dublin bringing off the league and perhaps a championship double in Gaelic football.  It probably would be right and proper&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Whatever chance Dublin has, I do not know about Westmeath. It is important that we use the year to promote Dublin in various areas. There is quite an impressive list of events which are to take place.  There are to be visiting stars from various countries.  All of this has to be used to promote the country and to promote tourism.  In the light of the Gulf War we have probably lost part of the American market for the moment.  We have to look more and more towards other European countries, more and more towards other European tourists who, perhaps, have not been here before and who, in light of the fact that Dublin in 1991 has been designated European Community City of Culture, are going to see it and are going to be made more aware of it.  If it is portrayed in the right light, they will come here and they will spend money which will promote the country, promote jobs.  That should be part of the target of all of us.</P>
      <P>I welcome the motion.  It is timely and fitting and it is important that from time to time we come together in the Seanad from all parts of the country.  Members from slightly further afield are more than welcome to the Seanad and I hope that many of my friends opposite will have a long stay in this House.  It is important that we benefit from this year and that Dublin benefits from it because if Dublin benefits the country will benefit from it.</P>

      <P>Dublin is a small city by most standards, especially by comparison with other European world capitals.  It is in a magnificent natural setting, resting on a broad sweep of the bay between the sea and the mountains.  Dublin straddles <Col N="987" /> both banks of the River Liffey and spreads out to the suburban areas, north, south and west.  However, Dublin's size is no way reflective of the amount of talent, arts and culture to be found in the everyday life of the city.  This year of 1991 has been set aside for a special purpose, to get the best out of ourselves and our city.</P>
      <P>There are many definitions of culture and as many expressions &mdash; the arts, theatre, literature &mdash; but the greatest wealth in any culture lies in the richness of its people.  Dublin abounds in a cocktail of wonderful people right across the social spectrum in every community in the city.  Dublin city is over 1,000 years old and the present day &ldquo;Dub&rdquo; is a product of various influences over the years. Each has contributed to the life and culture we have inherited, from the Vikings, the British and the Normans and, indeed, our own country cousins who have all worked and settled in Dublin over the years, each bringing a special ingredient of culture and background, adding colour to the city.  Each individual can be part of the life and vitality that is Dublin today.</P>
      <P>Much has already been said about the various projects which are either completed or are underway. Indeed, much has been accomplished by the urban renewal programme, for example, the Temple Bar project, the pedestrianisation of Grafton Street and Henry Street, the provision of the bronze sculptures for our city and the county areas.  These are all very laudable.  However, people are the lifeblood of any city.  It is on this community aspect of our city of culture that I would like to concentrate this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin communities cover the whole city and county area.  With this in mind the Dublin Promotions Organisation Limited, DPOL, who are organising the events and promotions for 1991, have set up a special community project subcommittee. From the outset, DPOL have placed a special emphasis on the importance of allowing ordinary Dubliners around the city and county to participate <Col N="988" /> in the programme for Dublin 1991.  This project committee were set up to deal exclusively with community projects and events.</P>
    <P>The committee were given a budget of £150,000 to aid in funding community works, and a scheme to enable community groups from around the city and county to apply for grant aid was devised.  The basis of the scheme is straightforward in its criteria.  Projects can be funded up to 50 per cent of their total cost to a maximum of £5,000.  Groups are asked to raise the other 50 per cent of the cost of the project themselves so that the project is substantially their own work and to make the community project's budget go further.</P>
    <P>This has a two-fold benefit.  The range of the scheme is maximised and the community is enriched a little more through co-operation and self-help.  A similar scheme was operated in Glasgow in 1990 and was called &ldquo;The Do It Yourself Scheme&rdquo;.  There have been 127 applications for aid under this scheme to date and they cover a wide range of events around the city and county. Among these already on the agenda are the CLEAR festival of working class culture in Kilbarrack, which will take place in June, Tallaght Arts Festival, which will run in July.  Glor na Gael have organised a summer programme and sculpture gardens in Ballymun, beginning on 5 May. Women's groups are sponsoring multimedia visual arts projects and, not to be outdone, the Dublin travellers education and development group programme have been involved in contributing to Dublin 1991 by reconstructing a barrel top caravan using skills that are almost extinct. Libraries, schools, drama groups and local communities are all playing their part in revitalising the spirit of the city.</P>
    <P>Sponsorship from the corporate sector has brought together the city's communities in organising various larger events. The AIB Group are sponsoring two concerts by the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra. This will take place in the National Concert Hall in September.  The orchestra is acknowledged as one of the finest in eastern Europe.  Irish Distillers are <Col N="989" /> sponsoring a competition for European Community architects under their Powers Gold Label brand name.  This competition will focus on the famous Smithfield market area and examine the use of the open space there.</P>
    <P>The ESB are sponsors of the Upstairs Downstairs exhibition which depicts the elegant lifestyle of Georgian Dublin. There are many more.  Guinness Ireland Limited, Irish Life, Bank of Ireland, Telecom Eireann and the National Lottery have all greatly contributed to Dublin 1991 and helped strengthen the links between the corporate and financial world and the ordinary citizen of the city.</P>
    <P>Dublin has no need to portray an image in the modern sense of the world.  Dublin and its people have a strong sense of identity.  The wit of the inner city &ldquo;Dub&rdquo; is renowned for its sharp, cynical yet humourous outlook on life.  Dublin pubs' culture is legendary, enhanced by the popular portrayal of drinking Dubs discussing and solving the problems of the universe over a setting pint of Guinness. The popularity of such pubs as O'Donoghues, Doheny and Nesbitts and Mulligans of Townsend Street far exceed the more recent arrivals on the social scene. They have been legendary for their clients and their crack.</P>
    <P>All of this is Dublin, not just the greatness of James Joyce, Oscar Wilde, Behan and Christy Browne, but of contemporary writers like Roddy Doyle, who is famous for his comedy plays.  The renowned Brown Bread capsulates the very spirit, humour and wit of everyday Dublin.  Comedians like Noel Purcell, Cecil Sheridan and Brendan Grace have made it their trademark and brought it into every home.  This humour and witty outlook on life is found in concentrated quantities in the inner city.</P>
    <P>On the subject of urban renewal, residents and visitors alike only have to look around them to see the vast improvements the city has undergone in the last few years, the wonderful restoration of Dublin Castle along with the Custom House and other magnificent buildings. Derelict sites are being cleared to make way for new developments.  The new <Col N="990" /> financial incentives to aid in the development of the Temple Bar area should further assist in the rejuvenation of the whole area.</P>
    <P>Inner city housing has taken on a new lease of life.  Many of the corporation housing estates in the flats complex in the inner city and some of the housing estates in Darndale and Ballymun and my own local authority area in Ballyfermot are being refurbished and improved in standard. The Oriel Street development for senior citizens has ensured that small individual units will be provided, specially tailored for the specific needs of the elderly.</P>
    <P>New apartment accommodation is being built in the city centre close to the new financial services centre and other developments are underway to provide for further housing in the various parts of the city.  A living city is one of an even balance of commercial enterprise providing employment and with a section of its people living in it.  Through the urban renewal scheme we hope to achieve such a marriage.</P>
    <P>Dublin's tradition with music goes back a long way.  Handel saw fit to have his first public performance of &ldquo;The Messiah&rdquo; performed in Dublin.  No less, the musicians of today, both traditional and popular, have found inspiration and expression in our city.  Like Handel, musicians such as U2, the Dubliners, Wolfe Tones, Sinead O'Connor and Emotional Fish and Aslan have had their roots in Dublin and found acclaim.</P>
    <P>In this year of culture encouragement and help should be given to our young people.  Our youth are full of life and talent and should be urged by their peers to express their qualities in healthy, constructive ways, such as music and sport. Music knows no social boundaries.  Its appeal is broadly based and crosses all sectors of the social spectrum.</P>
    <P>Talent also demands no criteria.  From the rich to the poor, the educated to the deprived a city has a deep well of talent and ability.  We in Dublin should use this opportunity as the European City of Culture as a platform for our young musicians and a medium for bringing their talent <Col N="991" /> to a greater audience.  One has only to walk down Grafton Street any day to see the range of talented young people busking there.  Apart from contributing to the Bohemian atmosphere of the shopping area and the tourist appeal of the city, some have found their path to fame.</P>
    <P>The now well known Dublin based band, the Hothouse Flowers, found their first loyal followers while busking in Grafton Street and went on to become chart toppers in Ireland, the UK and Europe. Dublin has now become synonymous with exciting young musical talent and record companies' talent spotters are frequent visitors to our city to look for new faces.  This is not solely confined to a contemporary or popular music.  The GPA international piano competition has contributed greatly to the culture of the city, attracting the best aspiring young pianists in the world.  The Heineken sponsorship of the violin students and the Lombard and Ulster music foundation are both examples of the role corporate sponsorship has played and the faith that the business sector has in the youth.</P>
    <P>The influence of the Irish language may not be as great in Dublin as it is in other areas of the country but where it is it is found in abundance.  Comhaltas Ceoltoirí Éireann in Monkstown have a thriving cultural centre both for tourists and for members of the community.  The high standard of performance and the immense popularity will ensure the continuation of their contribution to the culture of our city.  Music as a common denominator transcends language and other social barriers and it can be enjoyed by everybody from performer to audience. As a medium of communication music can be highlighted during Dublin 1991, as a bridge towards greater community awareness both within individual areas and between co-operating participants.</P>
    <P>Dublin in 1991 is a wonderful place to visit, it is a wonderful place to live in. This year it belongs to the people, the people of Dublin, a year to enjoy, to participate in and to contribute, a year for all our communities to respond with <Col N="992" /> their own flair and vitality as they did so well during our Millennium year.  Dublin 1991 as European City of Culture, has been an honour and a challenge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this motion and I am glad to have the opportunity to debate it.  The motion as it reads is a rather anodyne motion that &ldquo;Seanad Eireann welcomes the designation of Dublin by the EC as European City of Culture for 1991&rdquo;.  The designation certainly is very much the starting point.  The question is, of course, what results after that designation has taken place and how the 12 months period is used to ensure that there is an interest in culture in the strict technical sense and, indeed, an emphasis in the broader sense as well. We did not start very well.  We started with a whimper rather than a bang because the formal launch of our year as the cultural capital of Europe did not take place until ten weeks after the year had actually started.  It took place formally on 16 March.  That was the formal launch of Dublin as the European City of Culture.</P>
      <P>It indicates a degree of confusion and a lack of direction that it took us until that time to actually come to terms with the formal launch.  At the beginning of January we had the informal launch where we had the palm passed to us from Glasgow, by having the Glasgow ballet dancers come to Dublin as their contribution. Whatever else we know about Glasgow, it is not exactly famous for its talent in that particular area.  It would be difficult for anybody going around Dublin since January to recognise that anything different has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be almost impossible, looking around Dublin or talking to anybody, to become aware that there has been a difference in the activities of the ordinary Dubliner or the appearance of the city. That, perhaps, has been the problem.  We have not really engaged in planning for this 12 month period.  We had a tremendous year in 1988 with the Millennium. It was planned for in advance.  It involved a tremendous focus on the city and there were tremendous benefits.  It was a year <Col N="993" /> when everybody in this country, not just in Dublin, was well aware that something special was happening.  It is a shame that we have not been able to come to Dublin's designation as European City of Culture with the same approach, the same enthusiasm and the same planning.</P>
    <P>We could have learned a lot from the cities that have been so designated prior to us.  Athens, Florence and Amsterdam emphasised the arts because that was specifically their area of glory in the past. Berlin was the first city which really expanded the concept of culture to the broad area of the community, community arts plus community groups and the community itself and spent at the time 60 million Deutsche Marks in building up the city.</P>
    <P>That was followed by Paris.  Paris had sought to be designated as the European capital in 1989, the bicentennial of the French Revolution.  They built into it a celebration and commemoration of that event.  Indeed, if anything we have done the opposite.  We have almost eliminated any celebration of the 75th anniversary of 1916 in this city even though this was the centre in which it took place.  It was something that could have been tied in to the commemorations.  I do not think any of us want to be triumphalistic in that respect but at the same time it is part and parcel of our heritage.  It was something that could have become quite a substantial feature of the celebrations that took place.  Rather the opposite has occurred.</P>
    <P>Glasgow, the city that had the designation last year, is the city from which we could have learned most.  It is the city that first of all decided to spend a very substantial £40 million on revitalising itself and which decided to interpret the year of culture in the broadest possible sense.  It did it from the point of view of emphasising the arts in Glasgow, music and, obviously, ballet dancing.  They now have a company that can tour.  They then expanded it into what was needed in Glasgow, an emphasis on building up the structure of the city and building up the quality of service that was provided to the communities and building up the communities themselves.  Those are areas <Col N="994" /> we certainly should have involved to a much greater extent.  We should look at the designation in the broadest possible fashion and make the maximum use of it, not just for a narrow interpretation in relation to the arts but for the maximum interpretation in relation to the people of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The designation of funds as between Government expenditure, local authority expenditure, Bord Fáilte and the corporation amounts to only approximately £3 million and is totally inadequate to make any impact on the city.  It really is paradoxical for Bord Fáilte to expect that a 20 per cent increase will take place in tourism during the course of the year when their contribution towards that target is £150,000, in real terms.  We have wishful thinking in many ways and an absence of real funding to ensure that any of the set targets can be reached.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, the major contribution they have made is to write to all of us to see if we can get the Shannon fly-over dealt with so that Dublin can be the recipient of this new tourist exodus, the number of tourists that are coming into the country as a result of the designation.  It would be much better if the chamber of commerce had seen fit to look their own coffers and see what contribution they could make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to bring the House up to date on the dispute and to make a statement on some aspects of the dispute.  The House will know that the Government yesterday issued a statement on the ESB dispute which I feel I should bring to the attention of the House and put it on the record.  At the meeting yesterday morning the Government considered the very serious situation which has arisen as a result of the strike action by electricians employed by the ESB, which is being supported by other key workers in the company.</P>
      <P>The Government are extremely concerned that a dispute in this essential industry should have occurred so soon after agreement on a new three-year national programme had been reached between all the social partners and the Government and after this programme, and the pay agreement associated with it, had been overwhelmingly endorsed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  They deeply regret the serious disruption to production and employment, to the social services and the inconvenience and hardship caused to families, especially to the aged and the ill, which will be inevitable if the dispute continues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dispute comes at a time when the country has begun to get on top of many of the fundamental problems both social and economic which we have faced in <Col N="996" /> recent years.  Any setback to this progress would be completely unjustifiable when the country faces uncertainty in the international scene.  Disputes of this kind make all the more difficult the task of creating the jobs we need.  The interests of the country and its people cannot be allowed to take second place to the interests of any one group of workers when there are procedures to enable their grievances to be considered.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined that the provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> shall be adhered to.  The electricians' claim can be assessed by procedures in that context. The Government, therefore, in the public interest call for a return to normal work immediately while the appropriate procedures to look at any possible grievances are put in train.</P>
    <P>To summarise the background to the dispute, about 18 months ago the Electrical Trade Union initiated a claim for a salary increase for electricians mainly on the grounds of impact of reorganisation in 1986.  Negotiations took place with the union but as no agreement could be reached the claim was referred to the ESB's Joint Industrial Council in September 1990.  The council issued its recommendation on 14 November 1990 which effectively requested both parties to meet again to find a solution.  The sides met subsequently on at least two occasions. The matter was than referred back to the Joint Industrial Council who ruled on two issues: (1) that an in-scale increment would apply to all electricians; (2) that electricians on their natural maximum that is, those who may not advance further without promotion or progression through qualifications as agreed, be paid a once-off lump sum of £650.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Joint Industrial Council was accepted by the ESB but rejected by the ETU.  Following expiry of the 30-day cooling-off period which applied after the issue of a council recommendation, in accordance with agreed procedures, the union informed the ESB by letter of 5 April 1991 that its executive, having carefully considered the matter at issue, decided to sanction entering into <Col N="997" /> an official dispute with the ESB.  This letter formally put the ESB on 14 days notice to that effect.</P>
    <P>Further meetings between the sides took place all day Friday last but negotiations broke down.  The strike took effect from Monday morning and the Labour Relations Commission immediately invited the parties for exploratory discussions. Those discussions have continued throughout the night and are still in progress this afternoon.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise again the Government's belief that the damage being caused to the economy and the hardship being experienced by individuals is totally out of proportion to the issues involved in the dispute.  Again, in the public interest I call for a return to work to enable the issues in dispute to be fully considered in a calm atmosphere. I am keeping in close touch with the situation.  I hope that a formula can be arrived at which would allow a return to work pending further consideration of the issues involved.</P>
    <P>Those talks have taken place in the Labour Relations Commission, in a hotel nearby, and with the staff of the Department of Labour.  All three groups have been literally on call since early Monday morning and are still there.  The talks have gone on now for 31 hours without a break.  I would particularly like to thank the people involved in the Labour Relations Commission who have recently given up three of their four weekends to prevent disputes.  In this case they are now almost three days without a break, and particularly over the last 31 hours.  I would like to put on record my thanks to them and also my thanks to the negotiators on both sides who have done as I have asked them yesterday to try to keep working towards a solution of the dispute.</P>
    <P>Any examination of this dispute will show that it is not necessary to have such a national disruption for an issue like this. There have been some statements today that this was the only issue.  There are ongoing issues that surface week in, week out.  In this case it came to a strike action. Both sides have made their point and <Col N="998" /> now they should resume full supply to the public and continue on with the machinery they have, their own Joint Industrial Council.</P>
    <P>It is worth again saying to the Members of the Seanad that the ESB are one of the few sectors of the entire community that have their own Joint Industrial Council and it is on that basis that other forms of industrial relations machinery do not interfere with them until they request intervention by other bodies.  In this case they requested intervention on Monday morning and the Labour Relations Commission have been involved since.  The talks look likely to go on throughout the night and, hopefully, can be concluded.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity of updating the Seanad on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I will concentrate my mind on it.  I was saying that the only substantial contribution by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce to Dublin as the city of culture was to ask all politicians to designate Dublin as the centre for transatlantic flights and to by-pass Shannon. It would be much better if they and Bord Fáilte had dipped into their own pockets to a greater degree.  It is difficult to see how the 20 per cent increase in tourism will take place simply with wishful thinking without hard cash being put in place.</P>
      <P>Dublin is a city of culture.  There is no doubt about that.  It has a long tradition and a long heritage of culture.  It is universally recognised as having had the finest writers of any country in the world, with most of them located in the Dublin area. We have had Joyce, O'Casey, Behan, Swift, Goldsmith, Wilde and Beckett, all of international repute.  There is great need to emphasise that at every possible opportunity and to ensure that those writers are honoured and commemorated in their birth place, many of them from the inner city areas which are now neglected.  We should make sure that the local community are aware of their heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see that St. Mary's Church is being refurbished by the Living City Co-Op group.  They are in the process of doing it by literally scrounging funds, having found it impossible to get funds from <Col N="1000" /> the central funding for the city.  When initiatives are taken by groups of artists or by community groups we should go out of our way in this year to ensure that substantial funding is made available to help them.</P>
    <P>The other major area I would like to refer to is the question of Dublin as a living city.  That is the area where we should take a leaf from the book of Glasgow and concentrate on revitalising the city, putting the emphasis on community arts and making money available for community groups.  I am aware of about 20 local community groups in the north inner city who banded together to develop a wide range of projects for the year on their own initiative and who then applied for funding.  They were told that all they could get was a maximum of £5,000, even though they had put together a very broad scheme and schedule of work which they intended to carry out in the course of this year and the following year.  It is disgraceful that that is all that could be made available for the quantity of work envisaged.  They had budgeted, on a shoestring basis, for a very minimum of £50,000, but there was no way that anything was going to be tolerated above a possible £5,000.  It was a discouragement and has been a discouragement to many community groups involved in the arts and other areas.</P>
    <P>The Temple Bar area has been given a 100 per cent tax free incentive for development. I certainly welcome the opportunity that will give to the development of the central area in the city.  I would also point out the anomaly in terms of the drawing of lines for tax incentives in the city in that they by-pass certain areas all the time.  They by-pass areas that are most deprived.  The areas that are given the incentives are those where there is scope for speculation and where local entrepreneurs or local community groups have found it impossible to get involved.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation and the Government should look seriously at the manner in which areas are designated for the granting of tax incentives for development purposes.  I would refer to the <Col N="1001" /> colourfulness of Dublin.  The street traders in Dublin, mainly middle-aged women, are being imprisoned almost on a daily basis because they are carrying on a tradition which is part of the culture and the heritage of this city.  That should be addressed in a year when Dublin is the European City of Culture.  We have plans by the city fathers to build a £200 million road, called the eastern by-pass, through the city.  That will hardly enhance the city in terms of its environment and its community development.  That is being planned before any environmental impact study or feasibility studies have been done in relation to a crossing of the Liffey.  That is not exactly the type of project one would like to see starting this year.  Planning for it has already started.</P>
    <P>In relation to the quality of life, people must live in decent accommodation, decent housing and have decent maintenance. That has been signally missing this year and last year and there is no sign of any improvement.  Housing facilities have deteriorated and people are living in unhygienic conditions.  There is no emphasis in the plan for the city on the need to deal with any of those problems. What we should have had is a broad plan for the year specifying the arts and the cultural heritage of this city and emphasising present cultural developments. Secondly, we should have put the emphasis on the revitalisation of Dublin to make it a living city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>Many years ago I saw a film entitled &ldquo;Never on a Sunday&rdquo; and I was left with an impression of a wonderfully vivacious, ebullient, exuberant, effervesent, energetic, enthusiastic, intelligent and sensual woman.  Never in my wildest dreams at that time did I think that one day as a Member of the Upper House of the Irish Parliament I would be responding to an idea that was first mooted by that self-same lady, Melina Mercouri when she was Minister of Culture in Greece.  What a unique idea from a unique woman in such a unique ministry and from a unique country, Greece, which has rightly been called the cradle of democracy and from which we have <Col N="1002" /> viewed so much of what is now referred to as culture.  T.S. Elliot in Notes towards a Definition of Culture, states, &ldquo;The term culture has different associations according to whether we have in mind the development of an individual, of a group or class or of a whole society&rdquo;.  His thesis was that the culture of the individual is dependent on the culture of a group or class and that the culture of a group or class is dependent on the culture of the group or class to which that group or class belongs.  One can see, therefore, that the culture of the society is fundamental and every year since 1985 the European Community has honoured a city in one of the member states with the designation European City of Culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By moving that title around from city to city it was felt that it could be used as a platform by the honoured city to showcase its own particular cultural values and achievements before the eyes of Europe and, indeed, the world.  It was also, of course, envisaged that the city in question would during its year act as a host to some of the finest cultural offerings from the other member states.  Since the honour was inaugurated six cities have held the title.  The first was Athens, home of the agora and the great architectural masterpiece of the ancient world which sits on top of the Acropolis, namely, the Parthenon.  A Greek writer of the fourth century BC, when he was decribing the statue of Pallas Athenae, said, &ldquo;A man heavy laden who had drained the cup of misfortune and sorrow if he were to stand and gaze at this statue would forget the heavy and weary weight of this unintelligible world&rdquo;.  This city which gets its name from Athenae was, indeed a most fitting recipient of the first bestowal of this honour.  The next city was Florence, that ancient Etruscan city, the city which was the home of Lorenzo the Magnificent and the other Medicis which give rise to such names as Dante, Giotto, Luca della Robio and Fran Angelical.  The great 14th century artists announced the coming of the 15th century glorious period of the Renaissance during which Florence relived the illustrious era that Athens knew in ancient Greece.  There then followed <Col N="1003" /> in succession the cities of Amsterdam, Berlin, Paris and Glasgow and all in their own very different ways had their various cultures.  Now it is our turn and I proudly say deservedly so.  Culture means essentially the way of life of a particular people living together in one place.  It is visible in their arts, their mores, their social structures and their religion.  And so in Dublin we have a lot to offer.</P>
    <P>Many people use the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; to refer to the arts and, of course, the arts do go to make up part of what is culture.  But culture is a wider concept encompassing all that lives and thrives in a city, all that breathes and vibrates in a city.  I hope the visitors who come to our city during this year will not merely attend the artistic cultural events but will take time to visit the hostelries which abound in our city and while imbibing the local brew will also imbibe some of our local culture.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to list all the events planned for this year but I would like to mention a couple of them.  There is at the moment a very wonderful exhibition which presents a panoramic view of German 20th century art.  It focuses on Dadaism, German expressionism and Magic Realism.  It is in the restored or recently refurbished Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery in Parnell Square and is well worth a visit.  In November we are expecting from the Soviet Union an exhibition featuring some of the most magnificent works of art from the collections of the Tsars and the ceremonial crown of Peter the Great and the famous Fabergé egg are included among the 80 glittering treasures.  There is the first European Community play involving Ireland, Wales and Brittany.  The Age of the Saints is a Celtic project and it will involve these interrelated performances for over three weeks at weekends each linked by the figure of Saint Padarn and the giant floating rock on which he travelled.  There is a seven week programme of Irish and international theatre in the Project and Andrew's Lane theatres which will complement the Irish Life Dublin Theatre Festival in the autumn.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1004" /> In 1991 we will have an opportunity to host the European Youth Theatre Encounter which will involve 250 young people from 17 countries.  They will be here from 15 to 28 July in St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra.  Most of all, it will be a time for music, something which is dear to my heart.  What a feast of music we have ahead of us whether it is choral, classical, rock, or jazz.  The jazz department of Newpark Music Centre has used this occasion to mount an international meeting of schools of jazz with participants from Sweden, the Netherlands, the United States of America, Spain, Israel, France and Germany.  They will be here from 23 to 30 June 1991.</P>
    <P>The Early Music Association of Ireland's fourth festival takes place from 5 to 13 April and will focus on bringing to the city musicians from six countries who will perform music from medieval times to Mozart.  On the 200th anniversary of the death of Mozart the Pro-Cathedral will be a venue on the first Sundays in May, June, July and September, for the celebration of special Mozart Masses.  A Mozart coronation Mass was celebrated on 31 March when the Palestrina Choir and a small orchestra joined forces. There will be the Guinness Peat Aviation Dublin International Piano Competition which is now a competition of international proportions.  A prestigious jury chaired by John O'Conor will judge the competition to be held from 20 to 25 April.  A large number of very reputable orchestras will also visit the city: the Bucharest Philharmonic, the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, the London Mozart Players, the London Philharmonic and one of the foremost orchestras from Germany, the Nord Deutscher Rundfunk.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention one particular event which is run by the Young European Strings.  The third international Young European Strings and Keyboard Festival takes place here from 1 to 13 July and will feature a number of highly regarded specialist tutors.  In addition, the International Music Media Symposium, also organised by the Young European Strings, will take place from 15 to <Col N="1005" /> 17 July in St. Stephen's Church or the &ldquo;pepper cannister church&rdquo;, as it is commonly referred to.  It will consider the role of the music critic, past and present, and will present four concerts featuring young European artists.  The Young European Strings owe their founding and origin to the dynamism of a petite Hungarian lady of extraordinary energy and vitality named Maria Kellemann who came here some years ago with her daughter Gwendoline, an accomplished violinist, and her husband Ronald, who is also an accomplished violinist.  She was responsible for the founding of the Young European Strings which is an orchestra of very young people from the age of three or four up to about 12.  She is responsible for putting on the other events I mentioned.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to mention what for me will be one of the highlights of the year if not the highlight of the year.  This will be the performance of the &ldquo;Dublin Concerto&rdquo; which has been written by the distinguished Hungarian composer Sandor Szokolay.  He is a very distinguished composer.  This was commissioned by Dublin Corporation and it will be performed for the first time at a gala concert in the National Concert Hall on the evening of 4 November.  The first half of the evening will feature three Irish artists who have been acclaimed internationally, namely, Virginia Kerr, Nigel Williams and Hugh Tinney.  In the second half of the evening Mr. Szokolay will conduct the first Dublin performance of this Dublin Concerto.  It will be played by the well known violin soloist, Ronald Massin, who will be accompanied by the Alan Smale quartet augmented by double bass and vibraphone.  The particular point of interest for me at this gala concert, the proceeds of which will go to charity, will be the fact that Mr. Szokolay has decided, without urging from anybody else, to dedicate his Dublin concerto to our Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey.  As far as I know, he is the only Prime Minister in the world at the moment who has a concerto dedicated to him.  I expect to see you all there.  All in all, we will have an exciting, educative <Col N="1006" /> and enjoyable time and we will be able to show the world in 1991 that the honour bestowed on our city was indeed truly earned.</P>

      <P>Is an-chúis áthais domsa seans a bheith agam labhairt, agus freagra a thabhairt ar an rún speisialta seo, &ldquo;Go bhfáiltíonn Seanad Éireann roimh an socrú a rinne Comhphobal na hEorpa nuair a bhronn siad an teideal &lsquo;Cathair Chultúrtha na hEorpa 1991&rsquo; ar chathair Átha Cliath&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to reply, on behalf of the Government, to the motion &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann welcomes the designation of Dublin; by the EC as &lsquo;European City of Culture&rsquo; for 1991&rdquo;.  The designation of various Community cities as &ldquo;European City of Culture&rdquo; arose in consequence of the passing, in June 1985, of a resolution by an EC Council of Ministers for Cultural Affairs.  The resolution provides that the event should open up to the European public, particular cultural aspects of the city, region or country concerned.  Therefore, it provides a framework for cultural interaction and exchange over a broad diversity of cultural themes.  Athens was the first city to be so designated in 1985 and was succeeded by Florence in 1986, Amsterdam in 1987, Berlin in 1988, Paris in 1989 and Glasgow last year.  The choice of Dublin was agreed by the EC Ministers for Cultural Affairs when they met in Athens in December 1988.  The choice of Dublin as European City of Culture is a great honour not just to Dublin but to all of Ireland.  We should not be parochial in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to take full advantage of the <Col N="1007" /> opportunity presented, Dublin Promotions Organisation Limited, known as DPOL, have been mandated to plan and organise an appropriate cultural programme for Dublin during 1991.  The objective of this programme is to reflect every facet of the artistic and cultural life of the city.  Every major cultural agency in the city and its hinterland has been invited to participate and their response has been most heartening.  The many activities which are being planned include: the official opening of the new Irish Museum of Modern Art at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham; the official opening of the Dublin Writers' Museum. dedicated to Dublin's rich literary heritage; the Guinness Peat Aviation Dublin International Piano Competition, currently in progress; the unveiling of the restored Custom House; the Dublin Literary Festival incorporating Bloomsday; the Dublin International Writers' Conference; Mozart 200 &mdash; an extensive concert and recital programme commemorating the 200th anniversary of the death of Mozart and the inauguration of a world-class concert organ, at the National Concert Hall.</P>
    <P>There are very many other significant events planned and organised, including a series of major new exhibitions in the National Museum, the National Gallery and at the refurbished Municipal Art Gallery.  A special spring season of international theatre will complement the Dublin Theatre Festival, which is one of the high points of our cultural life each autumn.</P>
    <P>When you add to these specific events, occasions such as the St. Patrick's Day celebrations, the Dublin Street Carnival, the Dublin Film Festival and a greatly enhanced music programme at the National Concert Hall, you will get a flavour of the variety of projects and events which are being planned during the course of the year.</P>
    <P>Many anniversaries with a cultural dimension will be celebrated during 1991. These include the 50th anniversary of the death of James Joyce, the 800th anniversary of St. Patrick's Cathedral, the 100th <Col N="1008" /> anniversary of the death of Parnell and the 75th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising.</P>
    <P>It is highly appropriate that this House should address this motion and in doing so, acknowledge the importance of this year not just to Dublin, but to the country at large.  It is right for all of us in Ireland to take pride in our European cultural heritage.  It is out duty to promote a greater awareness and appreciation of contemporary European culture, not just as a valid end in itself, but as a means of improving communications and better understanding among the peoples of the European Community.</P>
    <P>I would like at this point to address briefly some of the points which have been raised by a number of speakers.  In general, Senators have been very positive and generous in their comments regarding what has been achieved to date and the many other events which are planned for the remainder of this year.  The translation of concepts and ideas into tangible performances is being made possible by the generous level of financial assistance which has been provided from public and private sources to assist Dublin's tenure as European City of Culture.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1.25 million has been allocated from the national lottery.  To date, £750,000 of that sum has been paid over to DPOL, while the remaining £500,000 will be paid during the course of 1991. Other public bodies are also making a significant input into the cultural capital activities.  Those bodies include Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council, the Office of Public Works, Bord Fáilte and the Department of the Environment. An allocation from the European Community has also been arranged and over £1 million sponsorship has been pledged to date from private sources.</P>
    <P>I would like to add my special appreciation of the level of private sponsorship which has been obtained to date and to thank particularly all the contributors from the private sector who have made such generous donations to enable this year to achieve its objectives.</P>
    <P>One of the major objectives for the year, as clearly defined by the Taoiseach, <Col N="1009" /> was the development of the Temple Bar area of the city as a cultural tourism centre and as a Government flagship project for Dublin's year as European City of Culture.</P>
    <P>To enable this project to be properly and sensitively developed and managed, the Government have set up a company, Temple Bar Properties Limited and the first meeting of this company took place last Thursday.  This project has attracted funding of up to £3.6 million from the European Regional Development Fund, known as the ERDF.  It has also obtained a loan of £5 million from the European Investment Bank, essentially for the acquisition of properties owned by CIE and Dublin Corporation and other key properties for the development of an east-west walkway in Temple Bar, for the putting in place of pedestrianisation, street furniture and lighting, for the redevelopment of the Irish Film Centre and for the development of three new public squares in the area.  This property acquisition process is well underway and will clearly be a major benefit in the development of the area.</P>
    <P>Temple Bar will stand, in years to come, as an enduring monument to Dublin's year as European City of Culture and will be a lasting testimony to the commitment of all those involved in rejuvenating an old and well loved area of the city and breathing new life back into its soul.  Temple Bar has its own unique character and will be an area where our tourists, both domestic and from abroad, can come and sample its vibrant and exciting atmosphere.  This year will be the year of Temple Bar.</P>
    <P>I know that the debate so far has been both positive and constructive and, indeed, that criticisms expressed are meant to be of assistance.  I have no doubt that the organisers and the people who are involved in the various programmes will listen to what has been said during the year and use the suggestions to make improvements in some areas and, hopefully, to correct any obvious omissions in what, on the face of it, seems to be a very comprehensively prepared programme of events.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" /> Mar a dúirt an Piarsach, laoch agus scoláire, &ldquo;Ní amháin saor, ach Gaelach chomh maith; ní amháin Gaelach, ach saor chomh maith&rdquo;.  Tá ríméad orm go bhfuil coiste speisialta ag cur snasa ar, agus ag athdheisiú Theach Fheadha Cuilinn i Raghnallach, an teach ina raibh Scoil Éanna i dtosach.  Ba mhaith liom gach rath a ghuí ar an saothar stairiúil chultúrtha atá ar siúl ag an gcoiste.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Foighil spoke sincerely and eloquently about what he perceived to be the neglect of the Irish language in the programme of events and promotional brochures.  I can assure the Senator and the House that the Irish language is held in the highest regard, not only by the Government, but also by the organisers of Dublin's cultural year programme of events.</P>
    <P>Is eol don Seanad go bhfuil tábhacht faoi leith ag an nGaeilge do mhuintir na hÉireann agus, cé go raibh páirt mhór ag traidisiúin eile i gcruthú chultúr an lae inniu in Éirinn, is iad fréamhacha an traidisiúin Ghaelaigh is doimhne a théann síos i stair na tíre.  Ba í an Ghaeilge teanga formhor ár sinsir anuas go dtí an céad seo caite.  Is minic a deirtear gur taisce í an Ghaeilge ina gcnuasaítear ní amháin samhlaíocht fhileata mhuintir na hÉireann ach freisin a mothú spioradálta, a ndúil sa tsaoirse, a leagan éirme agus meoin, agus a saíocht agus a nósanna dúchais.  Táim cinnte, mar sin, go leanfar le gach dícheall a dhéanamh chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn i rith na bliana cultúrtha seo agus go dtabharfaidh an lucht eagraithe, DPOL Teoranta, aird speisialta ar an méid atá ráite sa Teach seo maidir lenár dteanga dúchais.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the major promotional brochure produced by DPOL was prepared in four languages, Irish, English, French and German, each receiving the same degree of prominence.  The logo for the cultural year was produced in Irish and English and promoters have been encouraged to use the Irish version and have given an excellent response to this suggestion.</P>
    <P>DPOL personnel also met with An Comhchoiste don Ghaeilge specifically to tell them what Irish language input there <Col N="1011" /> would be in the programme of events and to discuss matters generally with them. There have been a number of specific events devoted to Irish music, culture and language including; Céiliúradh Slógadh &mdash; a celebration of Irish music and culture, organised by Gael-Linn, and sponsored by Iarnród Éireann, to be held in the Olympia Theatre on the 28 April next; Fundúireacht an Phiarsaigh &mdash; a concert which will be held in the Gaiety Theatre on 5 May in which the Irish language will be extensively used; An Doras Feasa &mdash; Flaming Door &mdash; a poetry reading by Irish poets of their work in Irish and English, reflecting 1916.  This event was held in the foyer of the GPO on Easter Sunday and was also another opportunity to honour the 75th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising, and Oireachtas na Gaeilge, to be held in Clondalkin, County Dublin, this year. This is a community event, funded in large measure by an annual grant from Roinn na Gaeltachta, and one which is normally held at different venues throughout the country.</P>
    <P>These are some of the events involving aspects of the Irish language which have been organised.  I am assurd by the organisers that there are a number of other events which they hope will come on stream during the course of the year in which Irish will play a prominent part.  I hope that Senator Ó Foighil will accept this assurance from me that the importance of the Irish language will continue to be recognised in the rest of the events being organised in celebration of this very important year.</P>
    <P>The question was also posed as to the purpose of the motion.  It is obviously, on the face of it, a non-contentious motion, but it gives an opportunity for this House to comment upon a singularly important year in the cultural history of our capital city, a city rich in culture and tradition; a tradition which takes us back over many centuries.  Indeed, it is a city which has only recently celebrated its Millennium, a city which has contributed so much to the world in terms of art, literature, culture and music.  It has produced poets, <Col N="1012" /> playwrights, scientists and world famous musicians.  Its museums, libraries and galleries house some of the most unique collections of metal work, books and paintings in the world.</P>
    <P>A significant part of Dublin is architecturally a Georgian city.  This year has seen the restortion of some of its finest examples of Georgian architecture.  It would be ungracious of me not to acknowledge the genuine concern, which many people feel regarding the destruction and, more particularly, the neglect of some of the city's finest properties but in doing so it is important to stress that a lot of money has been spent in restoring many of our major public buildings like the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, Dublin Castle and the Custom House buildings which are such an integral part of Dublin's man-made heritage.</P>
    <P>The dramatic improvement in the fortunes of the Irish economy over the past few years is directly attributable to the courageous management of the public finances through the pursuit of effective programmes by the Government.  One Government programme which has been particularly effective is the designated areas scheme for urban renewal.</P>
    <P>Under the urban renewal scheme, a package of tax incentives and rates remission is available to promote development in specially designated areas in 23 urban centres throughout the country. Since its introduction in 1986, the scheme has generated over £600 million worth of development between projects completed, in progress and in planning and this is in addition to the Custom House Docks development valued at some £400 million.  In Dublin alone, the scheme has enjoyed tremendous success having generated impressive private sector development valued at £58.7 million with a further £152.8 million worth of projects being planned.  New derelict sites legislation was enacted last year which provides greater powers for dealing with problems of dereliction.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello stated that we started with a whimper rather than a bang.  This was in reference to the fact that the <Col N="1013" /> formal launch of the cultural year was held some ten weeks after the start of the calendar year.  The formal announcement took place outside City Hall in Dublin on new Year's Eve.  It would not be realistic to have had the formal launch then for many reasons.  It was much more sensible to run it together with the St. Patrick's weekend, our traditional, much celebrated national holiday and annual cultural occasion.  If we had had the launch earlier it would in effect have meant that our invited international guests would not have been able to come here.  The St. Patrick's weekend put a particularly Irish stamp on the launch.  All of the other cities so designated by the European Community have organised their launch and programmes in a similar way since the whole concept was initiated by Madame Melina Mercouri in Athens in 1985.</P>
    <P>I have to take exception to what Senator Costello has said about St. Mary's Church.  The Office of Public Works have spent a large amount of money in the restoration of St. Mary's Church.  With Archbishop Connell, I was very pleased to have the opportunity to officially reopen this historic and architectural gem during the Millennium year of 1988.</P>

      <P>I will not take long. In one sense I do not see this debate as having anything very much to do with me because, of course, Cork is the perennial cultural capital and does not have to institute special years to so recognise itself.  I well imagine the story of the Corkman who was present during a guided tour of the Vatican.  When the guide was holding forth on the renaissance splendour, the Corkman simply said &ldquo;Did you ever see the Provincial Bank in Cork, boy?&rdquo;  It is in that spirit of self-assurance that I offer some impartial and detached comment on this motion.</P>
      <P>Dublin does belong to us all.  The Minister is perfectly right in asking us not to be too parochial about this motion. The shame of Dublin belongs to us all. The dereliction of Dublin belongs to us all.  The aversion of one's eyes from the waste of the quays happens to us all, provincial visitors as well as natives of Dublin city.  The attempt in this backslapping motion to hide all of these blemshes is something I cannot accept. Senator Costello was perfectly right in reminding us of how Glasgow overcame an image as squalid as Dublin, if there is such a similar image in western Europe, and projecting a new vigour and vitality during its year as custodian of this title.</P>
      <P>Dublin belongs to us all, which is why we are all concerned for such things as the state of the National Library and the National Museum &mdash; and we freely accept that great improvements have been made in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Costello is right also in saying that the cultural year is something that has not really made any impact on the country as a whole.  From my casual observations in Dublin itself I cannot see any enhanced consciousness of the citizens that they are now in a special kind <Col N="1015" /> of year.  I think in many ways this is a kind of a gimmicky year.  I would mention Deputy De Rossa's speech yesterday in which he spoke about the need to fund culture.  Senator Costello has referred to that also.</P>
    <P>Above all, one thing stands out.  It stands out in the recital of events to which Senator Lydon referred, when he spoke in glowing terms of the various musical recitals and the musical recital <i>par excellence</i> which is going to dedicate a composition to the Taoiseach, which will even further compound his delusions of immortality.  How many ordinary citizens of Dublin will attend these events?  The greatest indictment of so-called high culture in this country is its stratification on class lines.  All that kind of thing means nothing to the denizens of Fatima Mansions or to the citizens of Gurranabraher. That is a very deep malaise in our society, in regard to our so-called high culture and the full enjoyment of life all that betokens.  The Mozart bicentenary, which should be an enrichment to everyone, means nothing to the vast majority of our citizens.  Unless we turn our attention to the basic causes underlying that malaise, then motions such as this are sheer self-deception and hypocrisy.</P>

      <P>It is quite obvious that Senator Murphy is a Corkman, having listened to his contribution in relation to this motion.  I would have to fundamentally disagree with him when he says that this year, 1991, is a gimmick.  It is anything but a gimmick.  It is a concept which has come from the heart of the European Community and it is going back to our heritage and tradition and reasserting our European influence once again in this <Col N="1016" /> year.  If he had said that 1988 was a gimmick or that Cork 800 was a gimmick there might have been some truth in what he said, but certainly this year is a very genuine thing and is something which is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank all the Senators for their contributions.  We have had a very positive and constructive debate here.  Some Senators questioned the innocent nature of the motion, but again that comes back to the question of what we should be doing in this House in the first place.  There is no doubt that there is a perception that this House should give particular emphasis to the cultural affairs of our nation and that is what we have been doing here.  It is a noncontroversial House in some ways.  It is certainly less combative than the Dáil and, therefore, a motion such as this should be welcomed.  The Minister suggested this also during his contribution.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt but that Dublin city has its problems.  I would refer to some of the remarks made by Senator Hederman last year.  There is no question that Senator Ryan or myself tried to say that Dublin has no problems.  There would be no need for a city council or there would be no need for city fathers if Dublin did not have its problems and everything was going well.  But things are being done in relation to the problems of the city.  The Minister mentioned the Derelict Sites Act and so on.  I suppose it is debates such as this which focus on the problems of Dublin and that is to be welcomed. Any attempt to sweep the problems aside in the glare of publicity would be most unwelcome.</P>
      <P>I agree with many of the speakers when they say it is not just Dublin's year, it is an Irish year, it is a European year, it is when Ireland is brought centre stage in European cultural affairs.  From an economic point of view, if tourists come to the city this year they will also go to the rest of the country as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many speakers referred to the whole question of the Temple Bar area and the Minister also referred to this.  This is indeed one of the most exciting projects to happen this year.  We are now in the <Col N="1017" /> process of creating our own Left Bank, an area where arts and culture can be supported to the maximum.  Two companies are now in existence, one was launched last week.  The Finance Bill has just been published setting out special measures for the Temple Bar area and further legislation is promised.  That is something which will be positive and which will last when this year is long over.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that Irish culture should be celebrated this year.  I refer particularly to Senator Pól Ó Foighil's contribution.  We cannot forget what Irish culture is: it is our language, it is our dance, it is our traditions.  Everything to do with Irish culture must be celebrated this year.  There is no question of turning our backs on any particular aspect, particularly the language, as mentioned by the Senator.</P>
    <P>Many Senator referred to the anniversary of the 1916 Rising.  Such an event in our history must be marked.  There is no doubt that, apart from the tremendous political implications of 1916, there was a huge cultural influence brought forward, culminating in the revolution in 1916. The Irish revolution is exceptional and renowned for the fact that there was also a cultural and literary revival as well as political activity to bring about independence. To ignore 1916 this year is to ignore the very essence of our culture and our traditions.</P>
    <P>Other speakers mentioned the whole question of roads, public transport and so on.  That is going back to debates which are currently going on in normal political activity in the city.  There is no question that these are important issues.  These issues will be there to be dealt with in the political process over the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one of the greatest things also to come out of this year will be the drawing up of an arts programme for the future.  As of this moment all interest groups and communities are being consulted to try to bring about a policy for the arts for the years ahead.  That again demonstrates just how important the year is.  It allows us to take stock of where we are, to assess what we are doing and <Col N="1018" /> to plan for the future.  Again, many Senators brought forward ideas in that regard and therefore this debate has been useful in their doing so.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello was very critical of the fact that the year started late.  I would remind Senator Costello that Glasgow did the exact same thing.  I was honoured to be invited to the opening of the official year in Glasgow in March.  They, too, felt that it would be impossible to sustain an intense programme of cultural activity right throughout the year.  There is a general tradition and precedent, beginning now, to say that March is a good time to start the intense celebrations.  I would reject that criticism.</P>
    <P>Speakers have also mentioned the exciting things happening in relation to buildings in the city.  We have the restoration of the GPO &mdash; that is in progress at the moment &mdash; the restoration of the Custom House, Government Buildings, Dublin Castle, the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham and so on.  Nobody can deny that Dublin is on the way up, that we are at last putting money into public buildings and restoring them.  We are at last, albeit quite late, coming to realise the importance of our buildings, the importance of restoring them and keeping them for future generations.</P>
    <P>I would like to say once again that it has been a thoroughly enjoyable debate. It has been a useful and constructive debate.  There is one other thing which I feel I must mention, that is in relation to the criticisms levelled at the Dublin Chamber of Commerce.  I, for one, have had experience of what the Dublin Chamber of Commerce are doing for Dublin.  They are to be congratulated on everything they are doing.  They are doing tremendous work on behalf of the city and harnessing a tremendous amount of resources from the private sector at this moment for the benefit of Dublin.  That is something which is to be welcomed. Nineteen ninety-one has brought forward private sponsorship.  I said that in my own contribution at the beginning of the debate.  They regularly produce literature and brochures on behalf of the people of <Col N="1019" /> Dublin and Dublin business in particular. They also have two members on the board of DPOL and have played a very active role in the activities of DPOL. Indeed, many of their members have contributed substantially to 1991.  In particular, the Guinness representative was also president of the chamber of commerce at one stage and, of course, Guinness have pumped hundreds of thousands of pounds into 1991.  I thank you for your indulgence and I am delighted to support the motion.</P>

    <Title>Radiological Protection Bill, 1990: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Essentially, the purpose of the Bill is to provide the framework for a comprehensive system of radiological Protection for the general public.  Specifically, the Bill establishes the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, dissolves the Nuclear Energy Board and transfers its assets and liabilities to the new institute on the dissolution of the board.  The Bill also enables a range of radiation protection measures to be taken by various Ministers, both in normal circumstances and in a radiological emergency situation.  Finally, the enactment of this Bill will enable Ireland to ratify three important international conventions in the nuclear field and some of the provisions in the Bill derive from the requirements of these conventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will go into more detail on these conventions and on all the provisions of the Bill.  I will also outline to the House the important and positive changes which have been made to the Bill during its passage through the Dáil and since I introduced the Bill back in May last year. Before doing so, however, it might be useful to give the international background to this legislation as well as the <Col N="1020" /> Government's policy on radiological protection, nuclear safety and nuclear matters in general.</P>
    <P>Senator will be aware that in the international debate on environmental questions nuclear energy is being presented as the solution to the issue of environmental damage and global warming.  The international debate about these issues is progressing in many fora but our concerns about the nuclear option, which are shared by a great many other states, remain unchanged.  More recently the situation in the Middle East has affected and threatened the availability and price of oil and introduced more uncertainty into energy supply systems.  Difficult as it may be to find solutions to all these problems, both environmental and political, I am still firmly of the view that large scale and widespread recourse to nuclear energy is not an acceptable solution to our energy problems, given the very serious health and environmental risks which are intrinsic to the nuclear industry.</P>
    <P>Safety issues and the risk of serious accidents with trans-boundary implications are all still at the very heart of the nuclear question.  In that context, Ireland, in its capacity last year as President of the European Community, was pleased to propose on behalf of the EC member states the holding by the International Atomic Energy Agency of a conference on nuclear safety scheduled for September 1991.  I look forward to its deliberations and conclusions and hope that it will make a timely contribution to determining the nuclear safety agenda for the decade ahead.</P>
    <P>Ireland is now firmly identified within the IAEA and indeed all international fora as a country dedicated to finding an international solution to nuclear safety and radiation protection issues.</P>
    <P>The House will agree that nuclear countries must increasingly recognise the legitimate concerns of their non-nuclear neighbours and accordingly operators of nuclear power programmes must carry out their operations in accordance with the highest standards at all stages, from siting and construction to operation and <Col N="1021" /> to eventual decommissioning.  These concerns extend equally to the whole question of the disposal of nuclear waste.</P>
    <P>Any discussion on nuclear safety must, of course, consider the question of damage resulting from an accident, including liability and compensation.  An IAEA Standing Committee has met a number of times to look at possible revisions of the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage.  Ireland welcomes the progress that has been made so far, particularly in the acceptance by contracting parties that any definition of nuclear damage must include damage to the environment and that the liability regime must cover reinstatement. A comprehensive liability regime is well overdue and we look forward to substantial progress being made at the forthcoming meetings.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that Ireland, as a member of the IAEA, has been playing a very active role at these meetings, in pressing for the establishment of a system which would ensure that no victims of a nuclear accident would be left without full compensation and also that states would assume their full responsibilities in this area.  The corollary of that policy, and Ireland is supported by many countries on this issue, is that an element of State liability must now enter the present civil regime.</P>
    <P>Senators might appreciate if I dwell briefly on some basic facts about radiation. The atom has proved in many ways to be a Pandora's box for mankind, revealing many inherent dangers as well as benefits.  The processes by which nuclear materials are obtained, processed and used generate wastes which remain dangerous for thousands of years and prove a deadly legacy for generations to come.</P>
    <P>Radioactivity and the radiation which it produces has always been present in the universe and on earth.  We cannot see, smell or feel it and, in fact, its existence has been known for less than a century. It is now known that people constantly receive doses of radiation from natural sources.  Radioactive materials contained in the earth's rocks, soil, <Col N="1022" /> air and water give rise to external radiation doses, that is, from a source outside the body, and internal doses from radioactive substances in the food we eat and air we breathe.  Radiation is also constantly showered on the earth from outer space.</P>
    <P>In addition, following the discovery and invention of uses of radiation, people can receive doses from man made sources such as the various stages involved in the generation of electricity in nuclear power stations, the accidental release of radioactive materials from nuclear facilities and equipment, the nuclear weapons tests of the 1950s and 1960s and the use of radiation in the medical field for diagnosing and treating diseases.</P>
    <P>The adverse effects of radiation on human tissue were noticed shortly after its discovery.  There is still a lot that is unknown about the effects of radiation, particularly at low doses, but it is accepted that the damage which it causes to human cells depends on the level of radiation dose.  High doses can kill cells and cause death within a short period of time.  Low doses would not cause immediate death but may cause changes to human cells and lead in time to cancers or genetic damage.  However, it appears that radiation damage is not uniform.  Not everyone is similarly affected by the same dose, but what is clear is that a person receiving a dose has a greater risk of adverse effects than if he did not.  There is, of course, no difference between the effects of a given amount of natural radiation and the same amount of a man made source of radiation.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to completely eliminate doses of radiation.  What can be done is to attempt to minimise the doses from both natural and artificial sources.  General principles of radiation protection have been developed over the years and have been widely adopted.  These principles are reviewed in the light of developments in relation to the understanding of the effects of radiation.  They involve a system of control by a competent national authority whereby only those activities involving radiation doses which are justified by the benefits which they produce <Col N="1023" /> are permitted.  In addition, permitted exposures must be as low as reasonably achieveable and doses received by individuals from the activity must be below specified dose limits.</P>
    <P>These principles have been applied in international standards of radiation protection for many years in a more systematic way to some man made uses.  These international standards have been adopted in European Community laws and are implemented and supervised up to now by the Nuclear Energy Board in its licensing system for the use of radioactive substances.  Increasingly, however, attention is being given to a more systematic application of the principles of exposure to natural sources and to other man made uses such as medical doses and international standards may be extended in the future to these other sources of exposure.</P>
    <P>The post-Chernobyl era has witnessed a worldwide apprehension of nuclear energy which has been manifested in a retreat from nuclear plant construction plans and an increase in the number of reactors being shut down.  In fact, only now are we beginning to learn of the full facts surrounding the Chernobyl disaster. If anyone was in any doubt about the repercussions of such a nuclear accident, the further recent disclosures about Chernobyl widely reported in the press, have shown the incalculable effects of such a disaster on human health.  The full picture clearly will only emerge in years to come.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the actual proposal in the Bill to dissolve the Nuclear Energy Board and replace it with the Radiological Protection Institute.  It must be said that the board's expertise and performance over the years has been quite satisfactory, and the proposed dissolution of the board in no way arises from any concern about the manner in which it has discharged its functions.  The reasons for the board's dissolution are much more to do with the fact that the old legislation, The Nuclear Energy (An Bord Fuinnimh Núicléigh) Act, 1971, and the board established under that Act, are no longer <Col N="1024" /> appropriate to deal with the radiological protection issues which we as a Government wish to confront in the 1990s.</P>
    <P>Strange as it may seem today, the main purpose of the 1971 Act at the time was to establish a body to regulate a nuclear power programme.  As Senators are aware, during the 1960s a nuclear power station for Ireland was under consideration and Ireland's accession to the Euratom Treaty along with the other European Community Treaties was anticipated.  There was also a growing interest in the use of radioactive substances in industry and for research as well as in the medical field and with the rapid growth worldwide in the development of this new technology the Government needed expert advice on the subject.</P>
    <P>The functions of the board, as provided for in the 1971 Act, are to advise the Government and individual Ministers on all aspects of nuclear energy and to keep itself informed of developments in nuclear energy with particular reference to the implications for the State of such developments.  In particular, it was to advise on all aspects of the acquisition, location, operation etc. of research reactors, to advise the Minister on proposals for nuclear power stations, to prepare safety codes for radioactive substances and devices and to promote knowledge, proficiency and research in nuclear science and technology.</P>
    <P>There was a clear link between the establishment of the board and the consideration of a nuclear power station for Ireland.  This link is demonstrated in the fact that the announcement by the Government in 1973 of their approval in principle of the ESB's proposal for a nuclear power station accompanied the announcement of the coming into operation of the 1971 Act.</P>
    <P>I will turn briefly to the considerations which led to the abandonment of the nuclear power project.  In February 1979 the Government authorised the ESB to complete the planning process for the project but not to enter into any commitments until the Government decided whether or not the project should go <Col N="1025" /> ahead.  The Government also decided that a public inquiry would be held to deal with all of the relevant issues.  However, one month later a very serious accident occurred at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in the USA.  This accident highlighted the safety risks that accompanied nuclear power and caused much greater emphasis to be given everywhere to the safety issue in any decision on nuclear power.  As well as the safety issue, the economic recession which followed the oil crisis of 1979 caused a downturn in electricity demand and by 1980 it was clear that an early decision on a nuclear power plant was not necessary from the point of view of meeting electricity demand and nuclear generation in particular was not appropriate until the safety implications of the Three Mile Island accident could be fully evaluated.</P>
    <P>The risks arising from nuclear power have since become clearer and successive Governments here have decided that nuclear power will not be used for the generation of electricity in Ireland.  The ESB have expanded their natural gas and coal generation facilities and no longer have any plans for a nuclear station.  The land that the ESB acquired at Carnsore Point, County Wexford, for the nuclear power station is to be put to agricultural use and where applicable a portion of this land is to be used for afforestation. Accordingly, the decision not to build a nuclear power station in Ireland means that a major part of the Nuclear Energy Board's original functions and the corresponding provisions in the 1971 Act are redundant.  The board has, of course, continued to carry out its other functions. These are the provision of advice to the Government and the Ministers on nuclear matters, the regulation by licence of activities involving radioactive substances, the monitoring of ionising radiation in the environment and of the exposure of persons employed on work with radiation and the provision of library and information services.  It is now time to re-examine and refocus the functions of the board so as to express its main role as the centre for radiological protection <Col N="1026" /> of the public as clearly as possible.  Senators, I am sure, will agree with the thrust of that policy.</P>
    <P>Senators will also recollect that at the time of the Chernobyl accident, our preparation was not all that it should have been.  However, we were not alone in that respect.  In Ireland, the resources available to the board were inadequate at that time to enable it to satisfactorily provide the services required of it, which were to monitor and determine the extent and location of any contamination of the Irish environment, to assess the potential exposure to radiation of the Irish public and to identify the necessity for the introduction of measures to limit such exposures.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the roles of various other responsible bodies and the ability to mobilise them quickly in the event of an emergency had not been pre-planned in a systematic way.  Additional resources were allocated to the board soon after the accident and co-ordinated procedures were quickly devised.  Radiation monitoring showed that, fortunately, Ireland generally was not severely affected by the accident.  An extensive programme of monitoring levels in foodstuffs at processing plants and livestock in certain mountain areas was introduced and is still continuing four years later.  This programme shows that contamination levels monitored did not warrant the introduction of specific control measures, such as bans on the movement of livestock, or on meat, and that radioactivity levels in food in Ireland are low and well within the levels determined for international trade.  However, it is clear that if a serious accident happens at a plant much closer to Ireland than the Chernobyl plant the effects could be severe.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, an emergency plan for nuclear accidents based on the lessons learned from the Chernobyl accident has been drawn up by an interdepartmental committee and was recently approved by the Government. The plan, which will be published shortly, involves the deployment of a network of radiation monitoring devices around the country in order to detect any increases <Col N="1027" /> in radiation and pinpoint the areas of the country seriously affected.  A system is provided to enable notification of an accident abroad to be received and then, the rapid calling together of a co-ordinating body.  Following a notification of a detection of raised radiation levels, the machinery is now in place to direct the response and the identifiction of the roles and functions of the various Government Departments and other bodies in response to the emergency.  Much of the necessary equipment has been purchased and is operational.</P>
    <P>I will turn here briefly to a policy issue which is at the forefront of our strategy in the field of nuclear safety.  I believe that the best way to ensure that the highest standards of safety are being achieved and maintained is to have an independent, international inspectorate established to verify the application of such standards.  Within the European Community we have proposed that the Commission establish such an inspectorate for the Community.  We have pointed out that the Commission has sufficient power to do this under the Euratom Treaty and that it must remember that it has a duty to protect all of the people of the Community.  I continue to look to the Commission to bring forward a realistic proposal, and to nuclear member states to accept that they must be seen to be safe.  Last year, in response to repeated requests from Ireland, the Commission announced a modest proposal to reintroduce inspection and verification of member states' monitoring facilities for discharges of radiation. Officials from my Department have met Commission representatives to discuss this initiative and have made it clear that while Ireland welcomes this latest move, it is imperative that a much more radical approach is adopted.</P>
    <P>The nearest nuclear installations to Ireland are, of course, those on the west coast of the UK.  Successive Irish Ministers for Energy have conveyed to the UK authorities Ireland's concerns in relation to the UK nuclear industry.  These <Col N="1028" /> concerns have naturally focused on Sellafield, but we should not forget the risks associated with the operation of the old magnox reactors, with their outdated technology and inadequate standards that would not meet current day requirements. Even the UK authorities themselves admit that the magnox reactors cannot meet today's safety standards and I will continue to put our case to the UK authorities at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt in anyone's mind that the Government policy of direct contact with the UK authorities on the nuclear issue has had some success. The significant decrease in discharges from Sellafield, the closure of two older magnox reactors, the decision not to go ahead with the proposal to store radioactive waste in caverns under the Irish Sea and the cancellation of the Dounreay reprocessing plant project are all due largely to consistent opposition from Ireland, the Isle of Man, the Scandinavian countries as well as groups within the UK and public opinion generally becoming more aware of the risks to which they are exposed.  I am committed to the continuation of this policy to achieve our aims and I will look at every option open to us.</P>
    <P>The rightful attention we give to the existence of nuclear risks arising from installations abroad should not cloud the fact that radiation risks occur at home.  I referred earlier to the fact that people constantly receive doses of radiation from radioactive materials contained in the earth's rocks, soil, air and water.  One of the major natural radiation sources is radon gas which is released from radioactive materials in the earth.  The concentration of the radioactive material varies according to the geology of the region. Radon, as a gas, can accumulate in buildings and in certain regions of the world with a high incidence of radon, this can cause high radiation doses to the occupants. Studies carried out in Ireland by UCD indicate that approximately 2 per cent of Irish dwellings &mdash; concentrated in certain regions of the country &mdash; may have indoor radon accumulations giving rise to about eight times the average natural background radiation dose in Ireland. <Col N="1029" /> The Nuclear Energy Board are carrying out further studies on the question.  Last year, the EC approved a grant worth 100,000 ECU for a research programme co-ordinated by the Geological Survey of Ireland and involving the Nuclear Energy Board, Irish universities and German interests, on the geological factors contributing to the incidence of radon.  The results of this programme should help to make it easier to predict radon hazard areas.</P>
    <P>Radon in houses is a relatively recently identified problem, and there is as yet no international consensus on the levels at which action by the householder should be considered to reduce the radon concentration. However, on the advice of the Nuclear Energy Board, and based on the most recent research into the problem, the Government decided to adopt a specific reference level &mdash; 200 becquerels per cubic metre &mdash; which we regard as very low but also achieveable. Our commitment to radiation safety is reflected in the adoption of a low reference level, and also in the fact that, even in constrained budgetary circumstances, the Nuclear Energy Board will spend around £150,000 this year to enable it to carry out radon surveys and research. The institute will continue this research and develop it as necessary.  Recently the Nuclear Energy Board advertised their radon-testing service in local newspapers in the west of Ireland, explaining the problem and encouraging people to have the radon level in their homes measured. The Department of the Environment have also published a booklet giving information and advice on remedial measures where there is a risk of radon accumulation.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to turn to an issue raised extensively on both Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil, by way of a number of Opposition amendments to the Bill, which effectively meant that Ireland would be declared a nuclear free zone.  I do not want to go into all the details surrounding those amendments; suffice to say that proposals in relation to visits of naval vessels and overflights of military aircraft which might carry <Col N="1030" /> nuclear weapons are not feasible.  The question is of a military nature and more appropriate to the responsibilities of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It is not appropriate to this Bill.  Even more fundamental to this issue are the implications for this country's obligations under the rules of international law.  Senators will be aware that under international law, a foreign naval vessel has the right of innocent passage through the territorial waters of another state.  For me to have accepted these amendments on Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil would have opened the way for Ireland to be declared in breach of the rules of international law and I would emphasise to the House that this would have major international implications for us which could not be countenanced.</P>
    <P>I am quite confident that our position on the movement and control of nuclear weapons and materials is fully understood by the international community and, moreover, is protected by present legislation. The only nuclear weapon option Ireland supports is the zero option and our unqualified support for non-proliferation makes our position clear and unambiguous. The Radiological Protection Bill is not the appropriate medium for such proposals, given its primary aims of establishing the institute, putting in place radiological protection measures and enabling the ratification of international conventions.  This whole question is more a military matter and is more pertinent to the diplomatic arena, the area of international relations and comes within the responsibilities of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>I will now turn briefly to the details of the international conventions in the nuclear field which we wish to ratify under powers contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Conventions on early notification of a nuclear accident and on assistance in the case of a nuclear accident or radiological emergency were drawn up after the Chernobyl accident in 1986.</P>
    <P>One of the major issues hindering an effective response to the Chernobyl accident in all countries including Ireland was the lack of information on the occurrence <Col N="1031" /> of the accident and its nature.  This issue was quickly recognised by the international community and the International Atomic Energy Agency and the immediate result was that in September 1986, these two Conventions were adopted and opened for signature.  The Conventions have each been signed by over 70 countries, including Ireland, and have each been ratified so far by over 40 countries.</P>
    <P>The Notification Convention puts in place a formal regime for the notification of nuclear accidents.  It requires a state which is party to it in which a nuclear accident covered by the Convention occurs, to notify other states which are or may be physically affected of the accident, of its nature, the time of its occurrence and its location.</P>
    <P>I regard the existence of this Convention and its ratification by Ireland as very positive developments in relation to our emergency preparedness.  Obviously, the earlier we are notified of an accident the better we can prepare to deal with its consequences.</P>
    <P>The measures required to implement the Notification Convention include the notification of a competent authority and a point of contact.  The Bill provides that the institute will be the competent authority. Under our emergency plan, the Garda Síochána Communications Centre is the point of contact for receiving notifications of an accident.  Following notification of an accident to the Garda Síochána Communications Centre by any route, the centre will contact the institute, and the emergency plan will, if necessary, be brought into play.</P>
    <P>The Assistance Convention provides for states parties to co-operate between themselves and with the IAEA to facilitate prompt assistance in the event of an accident or radiological emergency.  I feel that this Convention has special importance for a small non-nuclear country like Ireland, as we would in the event of an emergency be able to call on assistance from other states party to the Convention. In the event of a radiological emergency a state party may request assistance <Col N="1032" /> in the form of personnel, equipment or materials from another state party or an international organisation.  The Convention provides that the assisting party may offer assistance without costs but that if it is provided on a reimbursement basis the requesting state must reimburse the assisting party.</P>
    <P>Certain provisions of the Bill enable Ireland to ratify this Convention.  The institute is to be the Irish competent authority for making and receiving requests for assistance although the making of requests for or offers of assistance is subject to the consent of the Minister because of the need for co-ordination with the Nuclear Accident Committee established under the emergency plan. This committee is chaired by an officer of the Minister.</P>
    <P>In order not to inhibit the availability of assistance under the Convention to Ireland, I propose to adopt the optional provisions of the Convention in relation to the privileges and immunities to be afforded to assisting personnel when providing assistance in Ireland.  The Government will make an order under the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Acts, 1967 and 1976 to provide for the granting of privileges and immunities. The Bill before the House covers other privileges, immunities and compensation provisions which are referred to in the Convention but which are not covered by the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Acts.  The Bill also makes provision for the necessary confidentiality requirements of the Convention.</P>
    <P>The Convention of the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material was drawn up in 1979 following concern on the part of the Governments about the possibility of terrorism involving uranium and plutonium, which are materials used in the nuclear industry but also capable of being used in nuclear weapons.  The Convention lays down standard protection measures for these nuclear materials while in international transport, involving notification of shipments, security escorts and surveillance.  The Convention also requires state parties to make certain acts <Col N="1033" /> such as robbery, embezzlement, extortion or sabotage serious criminal offences and to subject offenders to prosecution or extradition.</P>
    <P>In order to implement the convention it will be necessary to ensure that any shipments of the relevant nuclear materials to or from Ireland are protected in accordance with the requirements of the Convention.  The institute will be in a position to do this under the Nuclear Energy (General Control of Fissile Fuels, Radioactive Substances and Irradiating Apparatus) Order 1977 which will be kept in force under the Bill, when enacted.  Under this order the custody, use, manufacture, importation, distribution, transportation, exportation or other disposal of radioactive substances is prohibited except under licence from the board.  Conditions may be attached to such licences.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes acts of robbery, embezzlement, etc.  involving nuclear materials, as described by the Convention, offences and lays down severe penalties.  The Bill also establishes the necessary extra territorial jurisdiction to prosecute offenders in relation to offences committed abroad, where the offender is not extradited to the relevant State.  In order to ensure that extradition may take place to another state party to the Convention with which we do not already have an extradition agreement, it would be necessary for the Government to make an order under section 8 of the Extradition Act, 1965 enabling extradition to that State to take place subject to the provisions of the Extradition Act.  This will be done, if necessary, before we ratify the Convention.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the main features of the Bill but before doing so, I would like to dwell briefly on certain changes to the original Bill which were made during its passage through the Dáil.  When the Bill was first drafted, a number of organisations put their views to me on various aspects of the legislation.  I listened to them, as I did to many Members on the opposite side of the House particularly on Second Stage in the Dáil and, as a consequence, I have amended the Bill in <Col N="1034" /> a number of important respects.  Perhaps the most important change has been in the whole area of ministerial control, in particular the provisions as originally set out in section 20.  Senators will see that section 20 is now a very short section merely providing that the Minister may give general directives to the institute. Originally, this section was much more detailed.  In my view it placed too great an administrative burden on the institute but, more importantly, it created the possibility of undermining the independent role of the institute.</P>
    <P>Also in that general area, particularly in section 17, there was a genuine worry that it was unnecessary and too cumbersome for the institute to have to seek the approval of the Minister for Finance as well as the Minister for Energy when, for example, any changes to its work programme during the course of the year were considered.  Accordingly, on Committee Stage in the Dáil, I received the support of the House for the removal of this requirement in section 17 and in other appropriate clauses in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned before, I also agreed on Committee Stage that the institute should take on a much more active role in the area of providing information to the general public and I have made the necessary amendments to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have also amended the First Schedule to the Bill, in response to various arguments concerning the makeup of the board of the new institute.  I agree that appointments to the institute should be made quite clearly and unambiguously on the basis of qualifications and expertise in relevant fields. Accordingly, Senators will see that part 2 of the First Schedule provides exactly for that, by having up to five of the members as persons engaged in or having knowledge or experience in a range of relevant fields.  Up to six further members would be appointed on the basis of representative organisations in those fields. I consider that this approach which involves a mix of individual expert appointments and representative appointments will enable me to appoint a well balanced institute.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> Turning to the detailed provisions of the Bill, Part I contains preliminary and general sections setting out the Short Title, definitions, provisions relating to the laying of orders and regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas and provisions relating to expenses.  Part II deals with the establishment of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, the dissolution of the Nuclear Energy Board and the transfer of the assets and liabilities of the board to the institute.  I will appoint by order a day to be the establishment day for the establishment of the institute, the dissolution of the board and the transfer of assets and liabilities. The main functions of the institute, as set out in part II section 7 are to carry out monitoring of radiation in the environment, to advise the Government on radiological safety matters, to assist in emergency planning and response, to monitor developments on radiation matters in order to keep the Government informed and to carry out research.  As I mentioned before, I have agreed to an amendment to section 7 which now specifically requires the institute to provide information to the public on radiological safety &mdash; the new section 7 (k).</P>
    <P>Section 8 outlines the range of particular functions.  I again point out that in this section, I have made doubly sure of the independence of the institute by deleting any reference to the institute acting merely as an agency for the Minister. Section 9 enables me to confer by order additional functions on the institute.</P>
    <P>All these provisions provide the machinery for an effective radiological protection body capable of confronting and dealing with all of the radiological problems facing the State and its citizens.</P>
    <P>As I have outlined, the institute will consist of a chairman and between six and 11 members and will be able to form committees to advise it on various issues. The staff of the institute will be headed by a chief executive officer.  I had originally intended that in order to ensure the effective operation of the institute as and from the establishment day, I would appoint <Col N="1036" /> the first chief executive officer.  However, again in order to reinforce the independence of the institute, I have amended the Bill so that the board will do so, subject to my consent, even though there will be a time lapse before the first chief executive officer takes up office. The other staff of the institute will be transferred from the board on the establishment day and indeed, the institute is fortunate to have available to it the considerable expertise and experience of a highly qualified staff.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill outlines a range of powers and controls to ensure the effective protection of the public from radiation hazards.  Section 30 empowers me to make orders regulating activities involving radioactive substances by establishing a licensing system operated by the institute.  In practice the Nuclear Energy (General Control of Fissile Fuels, Radioactive Substances and Irradiating Apparatus) Order, 1977, which was made under corresponding provisions of the 1971 Act and which will be continued in force under this Act, will be the basis of the licensing system and will be operated by the institute.  This part also contain new provisions relating to the protection of the public from the effects of radiological emergencies.</P>
    <P>An important feature of the response to a radiological emergency is the ability to impose control measures to ensure that food with unacceptable levels of contamination does not reach the public or that contaminated food ingredients do not enter the food chain.  The legislative base to enable such measures to be implemented was not very satisfactory at the time of the Chernobyl accident.  While certain measures could have been implemented if it was necessary to do so, an accident with more severe consequences could have required the urgent enactment of additional legislation.  Part III contains sections which provide for comprehensive powers to enable the various Ministers who have responsibilities in relation to the food chain to ensure that radiation doses to the public from food in a radiological emergency are minimised. There is also provision for the obligatory <Col N="1037" /> immediate notification to the institute of any theft, threat of theft, accident or loss of radioactive substances or devices so that any response measures required can be put in place as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Part IV includes certain provisions which are required in order that Ireland can ratify the Notification, Assistance and Protection Conventions.  There is provision for the designation by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the countries which are parties to the Protection Convention so that importers and exporters will be aware of the physical protection requirements for imports from and exports to countries which are not parties to the Convention.  There is provision for the protection of the confidentiality of confidential information received pursuant to the operation of the Conventions. There is provision to ensure the immunity from customs charges or seizure of equipment sent to, from or through the State for the purposes of the Assistance Convention and also for the payment of compensation for death, injury or losses arising out of that Convention.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Protection Convention, the Bill creates offences in relation to the commission of certain acts involving nuclear material and establishes jurisdiction over these offences not only when they are committed in the State but also when they are committed in a Convention country and when they are committed elsewhere by an Irish citizen or by a national of a convention country. This is to ensure that offenders who are present in the State can be extradited to the relevant Convention country or be prosecuted in the State if extradition does not take place.  In view of their seriousness severe penalties are laid down for the offences involving these specific nuclear materials, which are capable of being used in nuclear weapons and are capable of causing widespread damage.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Bill will provide the comprehensive legislative framework which is required to establish the machinery to protect the people of Ireland from the dangers of ionising radiation and I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is important legislation which arose initially in the other House about a year ago.  It has taken a while and has been subject to certain amendments and proposals raised by our party and by other Members in that House, which he has taken on board.</P>
      <P>Our party were concerned with the whole question of the Minister for Energy possibly acting as judge and jury in relation to such matters.  Some of the changes introduced regarding the workings of the radiological institute of Ireland will enhance its independence.  I welcome what the Minister has said in relation to changes to section 20, that he will give more general guidelines and then let the board take over which is as it should be.  The less ministerial interference the better particularly in relation to the transfer of functions from the Nuclear Energy Board to the institute and also the appointment of the chief executive officer although the Minister will have to have some say.  It is important that organisations will be able to nominate members.  The Minister in his reply might expand further on whether he has selected organisations yet or if he is taking representations or what criteria will be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of protection from radiation leakages and from radioactive substances in the air has only become known to many of us in more recent years particularly in the light of the Chernobyl disaster five years ago and more particularly closer to home in relation to emissions and the few leakages from Sellafield.  There is general discussion about this but many people do not know much about it.  Some of it is quite technical. As has been stated here, there is a certain amount of radiation emanating at all times from various substances in the air and it is only by investigating it that we can address the subject more carefully. The reality is that while there are many downturn effects in relation to radiation there are also medical benefits for the treatment of certain diseases and illnesses.  It is quite a technical area but an area we need to learn about.  As an island <Col N="1039" /> we cannot cut ourselves off and say that it does not relly concern us because we do not have nuclear reactors.  It is important in relation to this legislation and in relation to the monitoring of damage to the environment and possible alternative power sources for the future.  It is ironic on a day when one energy supply monopoly is causing concern that we are looking at an alternative source here.</P>
    <P>I would hope that when this new institute is set up it will not be a hamstrung layer of bureaucracy.  The Nuclear Energy Board did a lot of good and I pay tribute to its members and the people who have worked diligently since the legislation was enacted in 1971.  It is important that we look to the future and to our role both as a member of the EC and of the UN and as a signatory of the various Conventions which have been mentioned here, that we combine our efforts and that we are able to get answers to our questions.</P>
    <P>In relation to the inspectorate which is to be established for the Community, who is to be involved in that, will the follow-on be that we will have individuals on the inspectorate, that we will have access to its results and its reports?  We are still learning from the Chernobyl disaster and there are many unanswered questions in relation to Sellafield.  While the Minister has indicated that he and some of his predecessors have made representations from time to time to their opposite number and so on, we recall recent events.  It takes the British authorities, and probably other authorities, quite a long time to get the message in relation to problems.  The Minister should make representations at EC level in particular.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one of the first things the chief executive and his new committee might do would be to demand that they are allowed to examine the situation in Sellafield, to hear reports and not just accept certain assurances that risks are being minimised, that leakages are not as frequent as they were in the past and that things are pretty well all right.  We have to constantly keep this issue before the <Col N="1040" /> various bodies that will be meeting, reporting and discussing the question of radioactive control and problems in this area.</P>
    <P>Radon gas and its problems have been mentioned.  It was said that 2 per cent of dwellings in certain regions have problems. What is the Minister going to do in relation to those areas or what plans has he in regard to sorting them out?  Perhaps when he is replying he would name some of the areas affected and then elaborate on exactly what has been done either to sort out the problems or to get further reports in relation to certain regions.</P>
    <P>The functions of the new institute are set out in sections 7 and 8.  What has the Minister in mind in relation to meetings with the Department and with the various other bodies and what is the position in particular as regards local authorities and their response at local level?  The Minister made great play of this great plan which is about to be announced and this communications network involving the Garda.  I recall recently in my constituency getting calls that there was not a squad car available and that was only to investigate a break-in.  In the case of a major problem whether it is a radiation leak nearer than Chernobyl, perhaps even as near as Sellafield, how is the plan to be put into effect?  How are we going to react?  We are all familiar with the fire brigade reaction when something happens and at times we close the stable door after the horse has bolted.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate when the plan which has been drawn up will be announced and whether there be sufficient resources to develop it and ensure that there is a proper line of communication.</P>
    <P>The question of food has been mentioned. Is the Minister satisfied with the inspections which are at present taking place?  Is he satisfied that foodstuffs are radiation-free and that they conform to high standards?  Is he satisfied that inspections are carried out on a regular basis? We are all aware of recent concern in relation to the beef industry.  The Minister should take a close look at the whole question of how food is processed and whether it is safe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1041" /> It is important that when this new body is set up it is given sufficient teeth and funds to ensure that it can carry out its functions adequately and properly.  We have to ensure that lessons are learned from Chernobyl.  We must not make any mistakes in relation to the development of tests regarding safety standards.  It is like robberies in houses: prevention is better than allowing things to happen.</P>
    <P>Another matter which we have got to look at is the whole question of transportation of materials.  Perhaps the Minister when he is replying, would indicate whether he is satisfied with the present method of transportation of various fuels and toxic substances which pass through our crowded cities and villages?  If an accident were to happen does he think we would be able to react in time to avert a calamity?  Unfortunately, as we have seen in the case of fires and rail crashes, we only set up judicial inquiries when the disaster has happened.  It is important that we take preventive action, that we anticipate the worst that can happen, what our reaction and response will be in relation to local authorities, the fire brigade service, civil defence, the Garda authorities and the Army and that we have a plan in readiness to enable the situation to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>In recent days we have seen how difficulties can arise.  One wonders if we only react after an event and do not think ahead to the problems that can arise and act accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he will be establishing the institute on a certain day.  Perhaps he might like to indicate what sort of timescale he would put on it at this stage with a reasonably speedy passage through this House.  What investigations, undertakings and work have taken place in order to transfer the functions which were previously held by the Nuclear Energy Board to this institute? It is important also that regulations that may be drawn up will be laid before both Houses so that we will be able to have a certain monitoring of the situation. It would also be important &mdash; the Minister might give an undertaking in this regard &mdash; that reports of the institute's <Col N="1042" /> deliberations, findings or discussions at EC or UN level are from time to time brought before this House and also that the institute's workings are brought before this House so that we can monitor its success.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister gives a clear commitment here today in relation to the whole question of Sellafield, that is an undertaking that he will be calling for the phased closing down and passing out of that reactor at Sellafield. It is important that we give a clear commitment in this country that that is our ultimate intention and that that is the object and goal we have to go after.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's response in relation to matters which I raised here tonight.  It is important that we get this legislation right, that the institute we set up is given sufficient teeth, given sufficient resources and, in particular, is given the necessary expertise in order to combat what might be one accident too many.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate. This Bill is to provide for the establishment of the Radiological Protection Institute in place of the previous Nuclear Energy Board and to transfer all the functions of the Nuclear Energy Board to the new institute.  As a radiologist, I am only too well aware of the necessity for such an establishment.  At the outset let me express my appreciation &mdash; the Minister has done so as well &mdash; to the Nuclear Energy Board who have provided an excellent service to this country down through the years.  The formation of the new institute is in no way a criticism of the old board; rather it is a recognition of the very serious problems which have arisen and is an attempt by the Government to keep up to date and to do everything they can to protect our people and our environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have specialised in the field of radiology, I am very familiar with the hazards of radiation and the dangers to both the living and the unborn.  Many of my predecessors and the pioneers in radiology suffered and died from the <Col N="1043" /> effects of excess radiation, such as cancer and leukemia.  The Irish Government have no alternative but to introduce legislation authorising the setting up of a radiological protection institute with the necessary finance and power to protect this country from the threat of nuclear energy.  With the enormous advances in nuclear development, a non-nuclear country such as Ireland must have a body with the necessary authority to act with the required authority and speed to counteract decisions made outside our jurisdiction which could have damaging effects on our country and our people. Let us consider the unenviable situation in which we find ourselves as a country.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to believe that apart from the ghost town of Prepeat next to the burnt out hulk of Chernobyl and sites around the world where nuclear bombs have been deliberately exploded, the Irish Sea is the place most contaminated with radioactivity in the world.  The huge nuclear complex run by British Nuclear Fuels, known as Windscale, or Sellafield, is only 80 miles from our coast and is responsible for this horrifying situation. Unfortunately, Sellafield is the heart of nuclear Britain and the nuclear waste processor to the world.  One is talking about this nuclear waste processor being as close to our coast as Kilkenny is to Dublin.  Sellafield's track record for the last two or three decades has not been good.  Its number of leaks and accidents are unequalled.  Its radioactive discharges have been the largest in the world.  There is in this waste storage facility the potential for an accident far more catastrophic than Chernobyl.  Imagine the action and precautions the Irish Government would have to take if this situation prevailed in Kilkenny.  Britain, unfortunately, is committed to going down the nuclear energy road and Heaven knows where any further reactors will be located.  There is no guarantee that Northern Ireland will not be a site for such a reactor.  The one thing we do know is that they will all further pollute the environment around them with radioactivity, discharging nuclear waste into the sea and the air.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1044" /> As a doctor and a radiologist I shudder to think what the long term health implications for the Irish people would be if there was an accident at Sellafield.  The implications for our economy would also be disastrous.  In relation to my own speciality there are horrific pictures in the annals of radiology showing the early workers with damaged limbs and other deformities which give some indication of how lethal and toxic unlimited radiation can be.  Those people in those days had no idea as to the dangers of radiation any more than the general public of today.  That is why we need a modern and independent organisation to protect us and our environment.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the dangers of Sellafield or Windscale as it was known. Many would say that the name was merely changed so as to alter the perception in people's minds of the horrors that existed in Windscale.  We are also well aware of the efforts made by this and previous administrations to have something done about this nuclear plant.</P>
    <P>The disaster at Chernobyl in 1986 is still very much in our minds.  The consequences of that disaster continue to live with us and will continue for the rest of our lives.  As the Minister said, there were very few nuclear energy boards in the countries affected by that disaster who have escaped criticism because of being totally unprepared for that situation. Because of the inadequacy of funding here at that time they were not in a position to monitor and determine the extent and type of contamination which was affecting the Irish environment.  Fortunately for Ireland in that instance, we were sufficiently removed from the source that we were not seriously affected by the radiation spill, but that does not apply where Sellafield is concerned.</P>
    <P>If we consider the enormous amount of work done over the last five years by the Government and the people to establish us as an economically viable country, the envy of our neighbours, we should further consider how closely the economy is tied to ecology.  When the Euro-tunnel is completed we will be the only island in the EC.  For us to market <Col N="1045" /> our produce &mdash; our food, cattle, fish, water etc &mdash; we will need to have no pollution and no radiation.  A continued strong economy for Ireland will depend, among other things, on our clean water and clean air.</P>
    <P>The facts are all there.  Sellafield is an enormous problem for every aspect of Irish life but how can any institute set up by any Irish Government influence the direction Sellafield is going to take?</P>
    <P>It is because of disasters such as Chernobyl, Three Mile Island in the US and the dangers of Sellafield that we need a properly structured and properly funded radiation protection institute.  It is regrettable that Ireland, a non-nuclear country, has to provide such a service, but the reality is that many countries use nuclear power for one reason or another. Accordingly, we must be in a position to monitor these and to ensure that these countries have the best technical, regulatory and safe practices, must be considerate of the concerns of other countries and must not attempt to hide the details of their various nuclear programmes and plans.</P>
    <P>I am delighted and fully supportive of the setting up of the new radiological protection institute but I plead with the Minister for Energy to use this opportunity to the full.  I think he has given us that indication here tonight.  The institute must comprise independent, scientifically aware and, equally important, politically aware people.  Nuclear energy is big business and I am pleased the Minister took this on board on Committee Stage in the Dáil and the institute will be all the better for it.</P>
    <P>The <i>raison d'être</i> for the new radiological protection institute must be the protection of the Irish people and the environment from any nuclear disasters particularly the nuclear threat of Sellafield. The institute needs to produce no reports.  We have the facts and it is time to take action.  Considering the enormous implications of an accident at Sellafield for the Irish economy the action I propose is that the institute, as its first task, should ask the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social</i><Col N="1046" /><i>Progress</i> to look closely at the consequences for Ireland of this threat to the economy in particular in relation to the Irish Sea and the effects on fishing, one of our major industries.  The unions and employers should be called in to consolidate and build their contacts to exercise pressure on Brussels through EURATOM to do something immediately to get rid of Sellafield.</P>
    <P>To deal with the main features of the Bill it is the establishment of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to replace the Nuclear Energy Board and the transfer of assets and liabilities of the board to the institute.  The main functions of the institute are to carry out monitoring of radiation of the environment and to advise the Government on radiological matters and safety matters, to assist in emergency planning and response, to monitor developments of radiation matters in order to keep the Government informed and to carry out research.  The budget for the institute will be provided by the Exchequer.  Again, I would agree with Senator Cosgrave here.  It is essential that sufficient funds are made available for it to function efficiently.  We all believe we need a modern, up-to-date body but we must ensure that we make the funds available.</P>
    <P>Having listened both to the Minister, Deputy Burke, who initially set up this legislation and the present Minister, Deputy Molloy, I firmly believe that this new organisation will be allowed to run as an independent body.  On Committee Stage the Minister has gone out of his way to ensure that this will be so.  I am pleased the Minister has said that the institute will have full professional freedom to exercise its functions as it sees fit.  It is only with that freedom that an organisation such as this can perform its very onerous duties.  I welcome this Bill and hope it receives a speedy passage through this House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister. Tá sé déanach ach tá fáilte roimhe.  Tá súil agam nach gcoimeádfaimid ródhéanach anocht é nó rófhada amárach.  Níl a fhios againn cad a tharlóidh mar is ceist chonspóideach <Col N="1047" /> í seo a bhfuil iarmhairtí anaithnide ag baint leis.  Tá cuid mhaith sa Bhille seo, cuid mhaith atá tábhachtach, ach is é an rud is bunúsaí ná a laghad eolais atá againn fós faoi radaíocht agus rudaí mar sin.  Is teicneolaíocht an-nua atá againn nach ndearnadh é a thriail i gceart fós, nach bhfuil a fhios againn fós teorainn na rudaí seo nó an damáiste a dhéantar.  Níl aon eolas againn maidir le trí nó ceathair de rudaí agus ní fheadar an mbeidh mé ábalta iad go léir a lua.</P>
      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, caithfimid a thuiscint i gcónaí gur cheisteanna airm agus cheisteanna míleata ba mhó ba chúis le bunú na gluaiseachta síochánta, agus san áireamh freisin tá an chumhacht núicléach agus páirt an Stáit sna ceisteanna seo.  As sin a d'eascair cuid mhaith de na trioblóidí atá tar éis tarlú sa tionscal fuinnimh núicléach.  Chomh maith leis sin tá sórt mystique ag baint le ceisteanna núicléacha.  Sna leabhair a foilsíodh sna caogaidí agus sna seascaidí bhí trácht ar atomic-powered cars, atomic-powered aeroplanes agus mar sin.  Bhí an chumhacht núicléach le bheith mar réiteach ar an chonspóid faoi fhuinneamh, ach is ceist chonspóideach í fós ar fud an domhain.  Níor tuigeadh ceisteanna comhshaoil ná ábhar truaillithe.  Mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Ormonde, ba dhaoine cróga iadsan a rinne an chéad taighde faoi chúrsaí an atom agus chúrsaí núicléacha. Fuair siad amach i slí an-chrua cé chomh dainséarach is a bhí an taighde sin, mar ba iadsan a bhí thíos leis an cheannródaíocht. Níorbh fheasach dóibh an baol nuair a thosaigh siad ar an taighde.  Ní hé sin an bealach is fearr chun na dainséir a aimsiú, trí dhaoine bheith i mbaol báis de dheasca a saothair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other reasons.  In the whole area of ionising radiation there have been enormous benefits.  I am not even going to begin to recite them in the presence of a professional of Senator Ormonde's knowledge in this area.  We are aware of them and we all recognise them.  I take issue with some of my friends in the environmental movement in a somewhat blanket denunciation of all forms of radiation and the effects thereof but I <Col N="1048" /> think we have great reason to be grateful to the same environmental movement in this country, in particular.  We would want to remember, in terms of the whole area of nuclear energy, the atmosphere in this country in the middle to late seventies on this and other issues.  We would want to remember the gung-ho attitude of the ESB, the Government of the time, and indeed the somewhat less than specific objections of the major Opposition parties at the time to the whole issue. We almost got bounced into a frightful situation, into a situation in which we would have not one but possibly two nuclear reactors in south Wexford.  There are certain questions to do with the minimum scale of what would be, even by a rather conventional and rather trite economic analysis, a viable nuclear power station that would suggest we would have to have two reactors to cover the possibility of one being out of action; we would have to have as much reserve power available as the largest single reactor taken out of the system in order to ensure that there was some sort of maintenance programme going ahead.  Since a nuclear station would have to be of the order of about 1,000 megawatts to be viable, you would need two in order to make sure there was not a gap of immense proportions in the service when one was out for maintenance.  That would have left us in a particularly dreadful situation.  I will come back to nuclear power in a while.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, many good things in this legislation.  There are the Conventions and I will not recite them all again. The Minister listed them.  Who could argue with their intent and who could but welcome particularly the Convention on the nofication of accidents etc.  It is a welcome though regrettable necessity and perhaps belated recognition of the possibility of accidents.  You must remember until Three Mile Island and Chernobyl we had a categoric assurance from the nuclear industry, a technologically quite dishonest and scientifically quite dishonest assurance that nuclear power was absolutely safe, and it was on the basis of that assurance of absolute <Col N="1049" /> safety that many people accepted the validity of the case for nuclear power.</P>
    <P>There is no such thing as absolutely safe technology.  At the centre of a great deal of the extraordinary race towards nuclear power the State, the whole of Western Europe, North America and the eastern bloc was the belief that nuclear power could be made absolutely safe. Nobody could argue about what could happen in the event of a nuclear accident and nobody knows what would happen in such an event.</P>
    <P>We had an accident of some significance in Chernobyl but we never had an accident on the scale of what might be possible and I hope we never have.  Until we have one, we will never know what the consequences are because science, however fine it is, cannot tell the future. Once science moves beyond the realm of experiment, into the realm of forecasting, it is into fortune telling.  It can refine its forecasts.  It can statistically analyse its forecasts.  It cannot give any more guarantees about the future than any of us can.  It is not in the business of fortune telling, of untested happenings.  Where experimental evidence does not exist, we are as good as the statistical analysis, as good as the probability analysis and no better.</P>
    <P>All the talk about the safety of nuclear power and about the minimal risks were based on computer similations and statistical analyses.  They were not based on real, hard evidence.  It is one of the huge flaws of nuclear power that it has accured in terms of its age and sophistication and also in terms of what we know about it. One of the enormous risks involved in it as a source of energy is that it is relatively unknown.</P>
    <P>With regard to new and innovative technology, there are not inconsiderable risks associated with it.  In all of those cases we as a society have actually to access those risks.  There is nothing as dramatically different in other areas of technology as nuclear power is from all the other sources of energy that are available.</P>
    <P>We do not know a lot about radiation. It is amply demonstrated in the area of <Col N="1050" /> radiation alone that what were regarded as acceptable standards of exposure to low level radiation have had to be revised at least once, if not twice, because of the experience from the two horrific occasions on which large numbers of people were exposed to nuclear radiation, Hiroshima and Nagasake.</P>
    <P>One of the few benefits that has come to the world from the horrific events in Hiroshima and Nagasaki is that we have sufficiently largescale numbers of people exposed to differing levels of radiation to be able to put together something like decent epidemological studies of what happens to people.  As we have moved in time further and further away from Hiroshima and Nagasaki we have begun to learn that the effects of radiation and of the almost frightening decreasing levels of radiation are more severe than was anticipated.  There is now an awareness that quite low levels of exposure to radiation are, apparently, in the long term more life threatening and more health threatening than would have been thought 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>When we consider the sort of lifetimes of some forms of radioactive material we are talking about half lives of thousands of years.  The limited knowledge we have gained over the past 20 to 40 years in terms of the life span of some radioactive material, what it does to us and, indeed, to the future generations, gives us reason to operate what we talked about at great length this afternoon with the Minister's colleague, both in Government and in party politics, the precautionary principle. If ever there was an area where there is a need for a precautionary principle it is in the whole area of nuclear power.</P>
    <P>One has to be extremely wary here for the professionals in this area.  By and large the professionals in this area here, in Britain, the United States and in eastern Europe, to the extent that they were allowed to have an opinion different from that of the State, all assured their people in a variety of fora that nuclear power and nuclear radiation as regulated under the various regulatory regimes was all right.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1051" /> I do not think the Nuclear Energy Board ever had a word to say about, or would even be remotely critical of, the decision to instal nuclear power-generating plants in this country.  I know that my own professional institution, the Institution of Engineers in Ireland, without much qualification, supported the decision to set up nuclear power-generating stations.  The combined expertise of a State body, for whom I have enormous respect, the ESB, had no severe qualms about setting up one.</P>
    <P>We have reason to be wary of professionals who, perhaps, have a certain familiarity with the material involved, and which may generate a certain complacency, which the rest of us with a less professional and more detached perspective would not share.  That is why I am enormously pleased at the increasingly emphatic way in which all political tendencies in the State have actually committed themselves, as unequivocally as you could ever get in party politics, to the idea that we will not use nuclear power as a source of energy in this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not persuaded on that one.  I was coming to the question of the economics of nuclear power anyway, because it is an exercise in the futility of <Col N="1052" /> a certain kind of very limited free market economics in a subject which has huge environmental and public ramifications and in which certain sums are left out of the equation in order to produce the acceptable result at the end.  I will come to that in a minute.</P>
      <P>I was simply talking about the health risks involved in nuclear power at this stage.  I believe it was Irish public opinion, unaided by most of our scientific establishments, that may have proven that it was financially unattractive at the time, beyond a doubt.  Moneypoint was also an enormously expensive undertaking which was taken on around the same time.  It was fortuitous that the demand for energy dropped towards the end of the seventies because of the international oil price escalation.  That could have operated in two directions.  It could have persuaded some people that we had to get into nuclear power for reasons of security of energy supply, or it could have persuaded us, as I think it did, to drop the whole idea.</P>
      <P>The problem with nuclear power and why the public have reason to be sceptical even of bodies like the Nuclear Energy Board or the radiological protection institute when established is that people have good reason to be sceptical of experts. I say this not as a scatter-gun in the direction of everybody else but as one who, in certain areas, would be the sort of person who would have been given the title of an expert if I spoke in certain fora wearing certain hats of an academic nature that I wear from time to time.  I do not regard myself as much of an expert on much anymore other than the foibles of parliamentary politics, I have learned considerably more about the foibles of parliamentary politics in the past three or four days than I had learned for quite a while before that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trouble with nuclear power is that as well as the inherent risk in radiation there is the problem of economics.  I do not want to delay the House unnecessarily but the whole issue of nuclear power &mdash;the Minister dwelt on it at some length &mdash;is also a magnificent statement of the hopeless inadequacy of a lot of what <Col N="1053" /> passes for economics.  Nuclear power was plucked out of the atmosphere somewhere around the late forties and fifties and became the peaceful use of atomic energy.  They wrote the slate clean at that stage and all of the enormous military-related development costs which brought the technology to the sophistication where it could begin to masquerade as a civil or peaceful use of atomic energy, was written off so that the actual development costs of nuclear power has never been a sum in the economics in nuclear energy.  Of course that is daft because any agency which develops something has to cost or pay for the development at some stage in the future; at least those of my colleagues in this House who have subscribed to variations of the myths of the market economy would believe that. The more I read on the market economy the more I am convinced that it is a figment of the imagination of academic economists who are safely protected from it.  I find that most people who actually have to work in the marketplace spend a lot of their energy making sure they are not affected by the marketplace rather than enthusiastically participating in it.</P>
    <P>The most overwhelming argument for this country not having nuclear power is that the economics of nuclear power are wrong.  The real economics, as they are discovering in the United Kingdom, is the cost of decommissioning a nuclear power plant station.  Do not forget, if we had opened a nuclear power station somewhere in the early eighties, we would be talking about decommissioning it in another 12 years' time.  The extraordinary gross underestimation of the cost of decommissioning a nuclear power station has raised for me suspicions about the credentials of those who made those projections.  It is in my view a hopelessly misunderstood area, which is proving vastly expensive and which the British Government under Mrs. Thatcher had to actually take out of the whole area of the electricity generating service because they could not privatise the British electricity generating service if the cost of decommissioning nuclear power stations and dealing with nuclear waste had been <Col N="1054" /> left to those who were supposed to be taking on the whole area of electricity generation.  They are so unquantifiable, so uncertain, so unknown, that nobody with the sense of, say, Senator Conroy, in terms of dealing in the marketplace, would possibly be prepared to risk large sums of money with the margins of error so enormous.  They had to actually take the whole area out and underwrite it themselves.</P>

      <P>I am not sure that I am dealing with nuclear power at any greater length than the Minister himself dealt with it.  I took my cue from the Minister. I would have been a good deal more modest if I had not heard the Minister elaborate at such great length on it. Taking the Minister's point I will move on from nuclear power and simply say I hope nothing of an external nature, including our commitments in the EC, <Col N="1055" /> will ever be allowed to change our view on nuclear power.  Perhaps in about 100 years time we will have developed ways of dealing with nuclear waste, of dealing with the risk and of understanding the risks of low level radiation.  This is relevant to the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is quite true that there is some naturally occurring background radiation.  It is quite true that in many of the discharges from many man-made users of nuclear power, the background radiation is less than that and that therefore one could argue that that proves that since we have to live with this low level of radiation it is no threat.  That is to misunderstand the sort of balances that exist in the human ecosystem, that even minuscule increases in the levels of radiation at which humanity has evolved, may well have enormous effects on the way the human metabolism works.  We do not know, but we know that radiation is a thing that can have profound effects on the human metabolism. You cannot just assume that because background radiation of a relatively low level has always existed that we can actually add a little bit more of the same order of magnitude and assume that the effect will be minuscule because we do not know.  We do not know yet how sensitive the human organism is to minute changes in nuclear radiation.  It is too new, it has not been sufficiently studied and nuclear radiation lasts so long that it will take large-scale studies over generations to understand it.  Perhaps when we understand that and when we understand the possible synergism that may exist between background radiation of a natural kind and small increases from man-made sources, we then may be able to talk about the safety of nuclear power. Since we do not need it, therefore, radiation deserves to be kept at a safe distance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One area in which we are liable to have considerable controversy is where large quantities of radioactive material are apparently to be transported in our coastal waters and in our skies with virtually no security for the people of this island.  That, of course, is the whole area <Col N="1056" /> of nuclear weapons.  There really is a little bit of a self-deception involved in putting together, enormously and justifiably so, elaborate mechanisms of protection for ourselves from areas of fissile material, which is being used for what are called peaceful means, while blissfully ignoring large-scale transportation of equally dangerous, and in some cases potentially more dangerous, fissile material just because it happens to be in a vessel which is designated as being of a military nature. It was a great opportunity lost during the debate on this Bill in the Dáil that the legislation did not extend to guarantee to the people of this island the same security from nuclear weapons being transported around our coasts or across our air space that is guaranteed to them in the case of material used for peaceful means.  I do not entirely subscribe to the view that you can seperate non-military and military nuclear material as simply as that, I am still convinced that without the huge nuclear military market an awful lot of other kinds of markets would be totally unviable.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into all the details surrounding the amendments in the Dáil on the question of a nuclear free zone. The Minister said &ldquo;suffice it to say that the proposals in relation to visits of naval vessels and overflights of military aircraft which might carry nuclear weapons are not feasible&rdquo;.  Who said they are not feasible?  Who is the authority that decided that it was not feasible to have a prohibition on the transport of nuclear weapons through our air space, into our harbours, through our territorial waters or indeed within any range we choose?</P>
    <P>New Zealand implemented a very strict nuclear free zone policy, which not only worked, but I have not heard that the sky fell in on top of them or that they were found to be in breach of international law or any of the other things. Indeed, the then opposition party, now the Government party, found that the policy of the Labour Government on that issue was so popular that they had to change their own view to accommodate the views of their own people on the question of a nuclear free zone.  There <Col N="1057" /> was much muttering and grumbling from at least one major nuclear power and from their nearest neighbour in Australia but that was all.  At the end of it all New Zealand discovered that it is possible for a small nation to say &ldquo;we are a nuclear free zone, we are going to stay a nuclear free zone and it is a good idea to have a nuclear free zone&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister later on said that we would be in breach of the rules of international law if we did this.  He said that a foreign naval vessel has the right of innocent passage through the territorial waters of another state.  I invite the Minister to get up where he can get a better platform than here perhaps and tell the Irish people that a naval vessel carrying nuclear weapons is on innocent passage through our waters.  I defy anybody in this House to say that the Irish people would accept that a vessel or an aircraft carrying nuclear weapons could be classified as being on innocent passage.  It is like saying that if they were carrying loads of highly toxic industrial waste they would be on innocent passage.  I know we have legislation to deal with vessels carrying toxic waste, particularly around our coast.  We claim all sorts of rights to regulate that, and quite rightly, because we have had a few near accidents and we had a few rather hair raising experiences with ship loads of extremely toxic waste travelling around the North Atlantic from port to port looking for somewhere to put in because nobody wanted them. There is a slight, to say the least, fudge on the weapons issue if, having accepted that we cannot regulate other forms of lethal cargo, we suddenly have to give foreign navies the right to ship whatever they wish wherever they wish, whenever they wish through our territorial waters.</P>
    <P>It is not on, I must say that in an otherwise forward looking and very progressive speech on this issue the Minister's arguments carry very little weight at all.  I suspect there are issues other than the logic of the argument behind his refusal to deal with these things.  I believe there is a reluctance to offend friends in Washington DC by saying &ldquo;Unless you give us a categorical guarantee that your <Col N="1058" /> vessels and your aircraft contain no nuclear weapons, you will have to go around us either by sea or by air&rdquo;.  It seems to me that the whole matter of protecting our people, the whole matter of precautions about transporting fissile material, the elaborate process of protection and safety is suddenly pitched aside if it is coming in a vessel that is part of a foreign navy or an aircraft that is part of a foreign air fleet.  Leaving out the political neutrality and all the other implications how can you tell people we are protecting them, regulating their safety and guaranteeing their safety from nuclear accidents when the biggest areas of concentrations of fissile material are free to come and go over our air space without as much as a question apparently and without us claiming the legal right to regulate what they do?  Quite honestly it is close to being daft.</P>
    <P>It may well be true that there is a certain logical argument that the Radiological Protection Bill is not the appropriate medium for proposals like this; but, as I have said before in this House, given the way legislation in this State and perhaps in every state operates, I am never too sure what is the appropriate vehicle for anything.  As I said, since we could define a crossbow as a firearm for the purposes of legislation in this House without as much as a blink of an eyelid, I do not think we should have much problem about saying that nuclear weapons are legitimately treatable as fissile materials to be covered by our decisions as a sovereign State on how we want to protect our people from the risks involved. I am enormously and deeply disappointed at the dismissive tone of the Minister's comments on that.  It is the least the people could expect.  May I say that I was somewhat astonished to read the amendments in the Dáil and discover that Fine Gael were in favour of the prohibition of the transfer of nuclear weapons through the State.  I thought, with their ethusiasm for European defence, that they would have some difficulty on the one hand prohibiting nuclear weapons and at the same time launching <Col N="1059" /> us into a European army, which presumably would not be non-nuclear.  Are they actually deciding they will not campaign for a non-nuclear Ireland but instead it will be a non-nuclear Europe?</P>

      <P>As a final note in this, may I say that I hope that in its practice in its dealing with the public and indeed in the whole way we deal with the nuclear business the same principles that apply to a Bill introduced by the Minister's party collegue, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment &mdash; that is, openness, disclosure, clear accountability, independence, penalties on a scale which are a deterrent to abuse, and all those things &mdash; will be as vigorously espoused by this body as by the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
      <P>I believe, as I said on the other Bill, that this is a vital area of environmental concern.  There has to be legislation for a clear link between this institute and the Environmental Protection Agency.  I am not too hung up on how it should be or whether it should be a realm of expertise here but it is extremely important that there ought to be a link set up and maintained between the two bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the sad chapters of the nuclear industry is its secretiveness, and it was not just Chernobyl.  We must remember there was an accident in Windscale in 1957 which was kept secret for God knows how many years and in which the health of a large number of people was put at risk.  Our friends in the Soviet <Col N="1060" /> Union may have a particular capacity for obsessive secrecy, but other countries are not so good either in the area of disclosure of accidents like that.  There have been suggestions of a number of accidents in military nuclear reactors in a number of western countries that were never adequately explained or reported upon. Therefore, we have good reason to ask and expect from our own institute the standards of disclosure that I hope we are coming to accept in the whole area of environmental protection.</P>
    <P>I will be introducing amendments on Committee Stage, specifically on the issue of weapons and the need to logically extend a protective piece of legislation like this to cover the major area of risk involving the transport of fissile materials. I look forward to the detail the Minister did not want to go into on Second Stage coming up on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the Minister to the House to respond to this motion.  Last year I put down a similar motion regarding the river Foyle.  The reason I raise this matter this evening is to highlight the need for the Minister for the Marine to report progress on the Foyle Fisheries Commission and the problems of alleged pollution of the river Foyle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am alarmed that the report of the <Col N="1061" /> Foyle Fisheries Commission dated 1987 is the latest available.  I do not know of any other industry or any other project in Ireland, or in Europe, that would publish a report for 1987 on an important industry and make it available on 28 June 1990.  I suppose on 28 June 1991 one can expect the 1988 report.  This is totally inadequate because there have been many changes since then.  In fact, since the material was made available for the report by the Foyle Fisheries Commission the Minister for the Marine has changed, the Government have changed and members on the commission have changed.  That is totally unacceptable to those interested in the future of the Foyle Fisheries.</P>
    <P>The commission held a number of meetings which are detailed in this report: on 5-6 March 1987 in Derry, on 30 March and 6 May in Belfast, on 28-29 May and 6-7 July in Derry and on 8 October in Belfast; one meeting was held on 23 November 1987 in Dublin but no meeting was held in County Donegal. There are many people from my county and along the river Foyle, from Lifford to Moville, whose livelihood depend on their fishing activities on the river Foyle.</P>
    <P>As far as our Government and Department of the Marine are concerned, there seems to be a lack of interest. I remember very clearly the Minister's response when I raised this matter previously.  He indicated that he was satisfied that the civil servants in his Department had written a report which indicated that everything was cosy with the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  I do not believe that report is worth anything.  I have an interest in the river Finn and under the heading &ldquo;Angling&rdquo; the report states in relation to that river that, while not up to the standard of recent years, the spring run of salmon did yield significant catches.  Although May was disappointing, catches reported in June were only marginally lower than those in 1986.</P>
    <P>It is hard to believe that departmental officials would not report this unacceptable position to the Minister.  It is appalling that there is no involvement from the <Col N="1062" /> South except by civil servants who met six times outside the State and once in Dublin.  I ask the Minister to give me a response I can take to those involved in the fishing industry on the river Foyle and which will make sense and be acceptable to them.</P>
    <P>I have a particular reason for raising this.  The British and Irish Governments agreed on 21 October 1987 at a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to initiate a study of the north-west region, County Donegal and the areas covered by the district councils of Derry city and Strabane.  That was a very important study after long negotiations by three local authorities.  The Taoiseach and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter Brooke, launched the North-west study in County Donegal on Saturday, 7 July 1990.  That study was carefully examined by many authorities in County Donegal.  It was examined by the vocational committee, Teagasc, the Department of the Gaeltacht, the IDA, FÁS and all the public bodies stating they had a contribution to make on the north-west study launched by the Taoiseach and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  The reason I mention this is, having carefully examined and made recommendations &mdash; seven joint recommendations, two specifically from Strabane Rural District Council, two from Derry City Council and two from Donegal County Council making a total of 13 recommendations arising from the north-west study &mdash; the first item on the list is a water quality management plan for Lough Foyle.  How inconsistent.  If the study was so important &mdash; and I believe it was and that it has been taken seriously because it was submitted for consideration to the Interreg Programme of the EC and for other funding programmes to support the development plan &mdash; I find it difficult to understand that on the same river the Foyle Fisheries Commission are allowed to manage by default and nothing else.</P>
    <P>The serious aspect of this matter is that there are reports of pollution on the river Foyle which I mentioned on a previous occasion but which have not been proven. <Col N="1063" /> In fact, recently there was a scare about a national incinerator for waste being located on the Foyle at Maydown, County Derry.  There has been widespread concern and many public meetings about the damage that would cause to the Foyle.</P>
    <P>Another part of the problem is that there are a number of licensed fishermen who buy the licence at an increased fee every year.  I have no quarrel with that but those families who pay for a licence, who go out to fish and expect to make a livelihood are confronted by a very large number of poachers.  Some of the people who poach on the river Foyle believe it is the proper thing to do, that it is nationalistic and that they are striking a blow for the country.  I could go on at length.  The Minister knows right well that I have a very good case to make and a difficult one to answer and I ask him not to defend the people who are involved in the management of the Foyle Fisheries Commission.</P>
    <P>I make one request and I intend to press it hard until I get results: will some of the people who are living in County Donegal on the banks of the Foyle who are involved in the fishing of the Foyle be involved in the management structure? I do not think that is an unreasonable request.  If one considers the Industrial Credit Board and many other industries, I do not know of one single industry that have not got some of their people actively involved, participating in the management structure or the board of management or commission, or whatever you call it.  It is time this matter was put on a proper footing and I am asking the Minister to bring this problem of the river Foyle to the attention of the Government. I live very close to the river Foyle, within one field of it and I can tell you that it is long past time we had proper management structures in place there.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the people from the Department of the Marine who are acting on the Foyle Fisheries Commission are very highly qualified, perhaps they have degrees in research and they have studied fishing, pollution and mariculture and so <Col N="1064" /> on, but that is not acceptable to representatives of the industry looking at the problems on the ground.  I will give the Minister the list of priorities which have been agreed.  I will also give him copies of the programme as launched.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Senator to choose some other place to give the Minister the documentation. I am sure he will be able to give it to him later.  It is not appropriate to hand over documentation at this stage.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will respond favourably in this matter. My motion this evening is timely in so far as we are now starting another year.  We had our difficulties last year and an indication by the Government and by the Minister's Department would help to bring about a more regular and orderly approach by the existing structures until we can improve on them.  That is my motion and I am asking for the Minister's favourable consideration of the matters I have raised in this regard.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick West</i>): First, I thank Senator McGowan for raising this matter and I welcome his contribution.  The reports for the years 1988 and 1989 are completed and are being printed and will be published very shortly.  I have every confidence in the personnel from my Department on the Foyle Fisheries Commission and in their ability to do the job.  I know from experience that they are doing a very good job indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator raised a question about the north-west study.  I want to let him know that the study was discussed at the meeting between the commission and the advisory council as late as November 1990.  He raised the question of water quality management plans.  Those plans are the responsibility of another Department, the Department of the Environment and, indeed, of local authorities.  I will be happy to have the management structure the Senator suggested considered.  As the Senator rightly <Col N="1065" /> said, this matter was raised in this House on 5 July 1990.</P>
    <P>The primary responsibility for the preservation of water quality generally in the portions of the Foyle catchment within our jurisdiction rests with the Donegal County Council exercising their powers and functions under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 and 1990.  As I said then, I have every confidence that the elected members and officials of the council are fully competent to discharge their statutory duties in this regard, having regard to the circumstances obtaining locally.</P>
    <P>That said, it has to be recognised that the Foyle Fisheries Commission must have a particular interest in ensuring that water quality in the Foyle is of sufficiently high quality to guarantee the future of fish stocks and that the interests of fishermen who earn a good part of their annual income from salmon fishing are not adversely affected in any way.  At this juncture I should point out that most of the commercial salmon fishermen on the Foyle are residents of County Donegal. To enable the commission to discharge their responsibilities in this area, it has available to it the wide powers exercisable by the regional fisheries boards under the Fisheries Acts and the various Water Pollution Acts to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>As a result of the concerns that were raised last year in relation to possible tainting of salmon caught in the Foyle, the commission instituted a comprehensive monitoring programme involving systematic sampling and testing of water, sediments and fish from the Foyle system in close co-operation with officials of the Fisheries Departments, North and South, Donegal County Council and the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment.  I am pleased to be able to inform the House that none of the samples tested to date under this programme has revealed the presence of any substance at a level which would give rise to suggestions that fish could be tainted.  The monitoring programme is continuing in 1991 and will be intensified if necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1066" /> I understand that the substance which gave rise to concern about possible tainting in Foyle salmon in earlier years was Geosmin which is an entirely naturally occuring substance which can accumulate in the tissue of fish in particular circumstances in dry years and can give rise to suggestions of an early or muddy taint. This phenomenon has been reported from locations in the USA also.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to be able to say that there is no suggestion that there has been any pollution of the Foyle waters by any toxic substances, or, indeed, from effluents released by manufacturing industry.  If such should ever prove to be the case, I have no doubt that the commission, Donegal County Council and the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, have sufficient powers available to them to take the necessary remedial action, including prosecutions where these are called for.</P>
    <P>I mentioned on the last occasion the existence of the Foyle Advisory Council who are a consultative body established under the Foyle Fisheries Act in order to provide a channel of communication between the commission and the various local interest groups in the Foyle area. As set out in the Act the functions of the council are:</P>
    <P>to watch over the interests of the holders of fishing licences and the occupiers of fisheries in the Foyle Area, to make such suggestions and representations as it thinks proper to the Commission in relation to any of the Commission's functions, and to advise the Commission upon any matter referred to it by the Commission.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this council who have regular meetings with the commission, are ideally placed to deal with the concerns of local people living and working in the Foyle area in relation to this issue. The council met all four commissioners at the end of last year and I understand that they will be meeting the chief executive of the commission very shortly when <Col N="1067" /> this matter of tainting will again be discussed.  I have no doubt that the members of the council will be pleased with what they will hear on that occasion <Col N="1068" /> in relation to the progress that has been made on this very important issue.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 25 April 1991.</P>
