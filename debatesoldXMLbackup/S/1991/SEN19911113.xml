      <P>I have notice from Senator Kennedy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to intervene in the industrial dispute affecting the courts which is having a crippling effect on court procedures, probate, Land Registry and other significant legal matters.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to take immediate action to resolve the serious courts dispute involving 274 clerical staff.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Jackman of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to notify local authorities immediately of their rate support grants to facilitate local authorities in compiling their estimates.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Hederman of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Government to sign the 1985 European Charter of Local <Col N="630" /> Self-Government of the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Kennedy, Neville, Jackman and Hederman as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Kennedy's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Neville, Jackman and Hederman may give notice another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Item No. 1 &mdash; the resumed debate on Statements on the Role of Seanad Éireann &mdash; until 6 p.m. There will be a sos between 6 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. From 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. we will take item No. 11, Motion No. 36, which reads:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes with concern the cost of motor and liability insurance; and requests the Minister for Industry and Commerce to take urgent steps to remedy the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Leader of the House confirm the rumours which have been sweeping the House that he intends a major reshuffle of his front bench and that he may be about to give a chance to some of his backbenchers whose talents have not quite been recognised up to now? Would he put our minds at ease on that score?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Order of Business, I am proposing that we amend the Order of Business today to take, after Private Members' time, item No. 48. This refers to the debate on the Maastricht Summit. As this House knows, at the end of this month one of the most important European summits in our history will take place. It is very clear that the other House is not going to find time to debate that matter in any great detail and I believe it is vitally important that one House of the Oireachtas turns its attention to the implications of the Maastricht Summit. I would ask from the Leader of the House that either he accepts my amendment and <Col N="631" /> that we start this debate this evening and continue it over the next week, or else that he gives me a definite, categoric assurance that item No. 48 will be taken next week. I am formally proposing to amend the Order of Business to take item No. 48 at the end of Private Members' time this evening.</P>
    <P>May I also ask on the Order of Business the intention or the mind of the Leader of the House on the reform debate which is taking place, has been taking place over some weeks and obviously will continue? Is it the intention of the Leader of the House when it concludes either to come forward with a series of proposals of his own from the Government side, or is it his proposal to set up an all-party committee with a definite time frame &mdash; if I can use that phrase &mdash; within which to report on the changes which we all want? It would be a shame if this simply was a debate and nothing followed from it.</P>
    <P>I note on the Order Paper today a commitment is now given to take the Register of Members of the Oireachtas Interests Bill on the first sitting day of the next session. I would like to ask the views of the Leader about the Suicide Bill. Will he give us a commitment to take the Suicide Bill, give us time this session to take it as a Private Members' Bill, to have it printed and have First Stage taken?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>For the third week in succession I am raising with the Leader the question of a debate on the Maastricht Summit. I am concerned, as a legislator and a Member of this House that next month decisions will be taken about our neutrality, our functioning as part of the European Monetary Union, about foreign policy, about many aspects of social policy and especially the education area in which I am particularly interested, which will have an extraordinary impact on Irish life for the foreseeable future for as long as we remain in Europe. There has been no debate, no education and no understanding in respect of this and it is irresponsible that we should continue without having a full <Col N="632" /> discussion on the topic. We are already running out of time; this time next month the summit will be over. I plead with the Leader of the House to make it clear that this item will be taken next week at the latest, if not today. He should heed the amendment proposed by Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>On that same point, a Chathaoirligh, I would ask that you in your capacity as Cathaoirleach of the House would initiate the agreement and the procedure which has been approved by this House to allow representatives from the different groups from this country in the European Parliament to address this House during the course of that debate. We have proved that as a procedure it lies in your hands to initiate it and I would ask that in the event of this debate taking place there would be representatives from the European Parliament to give their views. The powers of the European Parliament will also be discussed in detail and decisions will be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a speech; it is merely an index of the contents of what we might be addressing should we get to discuss this issue. It is interesting that people are so uneducated and so unaware of what is happening that they would see that as a speech. Somebody is going to be crying into their cups when this is over about not having had the opportunity to address these crucial issues. We are being irresponsible in not doing so.</P>
      <P>I want also to raise the question of legislation. I asked for information on this issue last week and the week before. I did not get a response last week. I concede that when the Leader was giving his response I was not in the House, but I checked on the response given I ask again the specific question: what are the next two pieces of legislation that are going to be initiated in this House? We are entitled to know that and we are also entitled to say that if we do not know it somebody is not doing their business properly. It is an insult to the House that we are not able to prepare for legislation properly and correctly.</P>

      <P>On the matter of allowing persons who are not Members of the House into the House to address the Seanad, as Senator O'Toole has stated that was agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Priviliges, subject to certain conditions. If it is intended to proceed with that arrangement it would be necessary for the Senator to put the request to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and have them adjudicate on it rather than through me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader if and when we are going to have a debate on the present political situation? In the recent past he indicated we might have such a debate. When can we anticipate the promised legislation on telephone tapping, which, I believe, was discussed at the weekend? Would the Leader agree there are many similarities between the problems of the Taoiseach and Mr. Jack Charlton in as much as they both seem to have fielded teams with many injured players?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>While not wishing to dictate to the Leader of the House as to how he should order the business &mdash; for that reason I do not support the amendment &mdash; nevertheless I share the views expressed from the opposite side for the need for a debate on the Maastricht Summit. I expressed that view last week and I repeat it this week. If anything, the matter is even more urgent this week, given that there has been quite a perceptible shift in British views in relation to the summit and also the fact that there appears to be less than full commitment to economic and social cohesion within the Community. From our point of view, that would have very serious implications indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter which might be included in that debate, or perhaps might more appropriately be taken separately, is the whole question of the GATT and the Common Agricultural Policy. The GATT negotiations appear to be coming towards some sort of conclusion and <Col N="634" /> again that has very profound implications not just for farming and agriculture but for the whole Irish economy. These are matters which we need to address. They could be addressed as part of the overall Maastricht agenda, or perhaps more approrpriately as a separate item.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Through the Leader of the House, may I first convey my congratulations to my constituency colleague, the new Minister for the Environment, Deputy O'Hanlon, and on a political level make the point to him that this must and should provide an opportunity to do something once and for all about the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;road structure in this country in terms of funding from Europe, the upgrading of certain roads and a proper commitment from central Government. This is something that is causing a real crisis for many people. It is a particular problem in the Minister's constituency and it is a national problem. I would urge the Minister to take this in hand as an immediate priority.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Ceannaire i dtús báire faoi choiste ghnó na hEorpa &mdash; European Affairs Committee &mdash; atá geallta i gclár an Rialtais. An chomhchoiste den dá Theach a bheidh i gceist nó chóiste den Dáil amháin? An inseodh sé é sin dúinn?</P>
      <P>It would be helpful to know whether the Europen Affairs Committee, which presumably is the nearest we are ever going to get to a Foreign Affairs Committee, will have membership from this House, and, if so, can the Leader ensure that the representation from this House will be sufficiently large to ensure that all the groups in the House are represented on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I vigorously support my colleagues in asking for an openended and extensive debate on the Maastricht Summit. I wish again to put on the record of the House that it seems to be the tradition of all Irish institutions that the more important <Col N="635" /> an issue the less it should be debated in public. We saw that recently, but at least that was an internal Fianna Fáil matter. The Leader of the House told us he did not plan to have a debate on Northern Ireland. Apparently there is now a similar reluctance to have a debate on the forthcoming, in my view, awesomely negative consequences for this country of what will happen at Maastricht. I appeal to the Leader to allow a debate. There is no fund of expertise residing either in the Department of the Taoiseach or of Foreign Affairs on which they can rely for all perspectives on this. What bothers me is that there seems to be an increasing belief that the worst place one could discuss something is in the Houses of the Oireachtas. Will the Leader tell us if he will allow an open ended debate on the Maastricht Summit and, if he will not, will he at least tell us in some detail why not? Is it that we are not able, not good enough, or is it that he will not be let do so?</P>
    <P>Finally, after another week of tragedy, I say again we should have a debate on Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wrong in the extreme, a Chathaoirligh, as I have said a moment ago, that the minute an issue becomes urgent, important and sensitive, apparently we close down the democratic hatches and assume that secrecy and privacy is preferable. It is not. It simply leaves a monopoly of comment on Northern Ireland to those outside the Houses of the Oireachtas and that is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole, particularly on the question of neutrality, the discussion on which is liable to start. The danger is this: it is a norm in life that the more you get out of an organisation the more you owe that organisation and the more that organisation will demand what is owed. Therefore, in terms of that criterion, we are at a very serious stage. We should get down to discussing the matter. Let us bear in <Col N="636" /> mind that the more we get out of the Regional Fund or any other benefits and the more we are sucked into the organisation, the more we owe it and the greater the obligation we have to it. Therein lies the danger and Senator O'Toole is correct in sounding the warning.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning wondered what way the Leader of the House will proceed when the Statements on the role of the Seanad are finished. I think it is little early to ask for an answer to that yet. There are many more contributions to be made on that matter yet. It might be necessary to have a discussion as to the best means of proceeding before the Government themselves come in with some proposal. We should have a say as to where we will go from here after the Statements have concluded.</P>

      <P>As Fine Gael Seanad Spokesperson on Women's Affairs and a member of the Women's Rights Committee, I would like to express my dissatisfaction &mdash; and I hope the Leader will express this to the Taoiseach &mdash; that the Taoiseach has effectively halved the female representation at Cabinet level by the removal of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like if the Leader of the House would ask the Taoiseach whether the Women's Affairs portfolio which Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn held is now gone or whether it will be given to one of the Ministers of State. I think it is important to say it now before the announcements are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I would like to welcome the employment equality ruling which found that the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners had breached the Employment Equality Act in 1977. I <Col N="637" /> welcome the fact that it now may open the door for women having left the Civil Service to be reinstated in their jobs. I applaud the woman from the mid-west, Miss Fionula Moran, who went to such trouble&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Manning in inquiring what is going to happen after the statements on the role of the Seanad. There was one Senator here who said that talk was all we should do. That was grand &mdash; talk, talk and more talk. I would like to know is it intended, as Senator Manning said, that the Government will come forward with proposals or an all-party committee. Six times in the past this matter has been discussed over the years since 1977 and there have been no fundamental changes. Can the Leader of the House guarantee that during the course of this year we will have no repeat of the incident we had here in the last week of the session before the summer recess when two Bills went through and it was perfectly obvious there was no question of an amendment because the Dáil had already gone into recess? There was the Local Government (Amendment) Bill where a guillotine was imposed. It is not acceptable and I ask the Leader of the House to assure us that will not happen during the course of this session or this year.</P>
      <P>While joining my colleague in complimenting Deputy O'Hanlon on his elevation &mdash; I am not sure how they look at it &mdash; to the Department of the Environment, may I ask, through you, Sir, that instead of the Minister for the Environment being asked to deal with every little piffling pothole in the country that he would allow devolution. Is he going to implement the Local Government Bill, 1991, devolve power and let the local authorities look after the potholes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been a number of debates in the Chamber on European affairs and I am sure there will be many more, including that on the Maastricht Summit, in due course. We pride ourselves on being good Europeans and we are rightly and naturally concerned at the very sad and appalling atrocities taking place in the North of Ireland. At this very moment as we speak there are atrocities, massacres, destruction of famous old buildings and a really horrible situation emerging in Croatia. There are one or two Irish officers trying to do what they can in the peace-keeping force. We had many calls here for a debate in relation to the Gulf War; eventually we had a very good debate and I hope the Leader of the House at some time will be able to see his way to making time available for such a debate despite the pressure of business. This is something that is happening now; people are being killed and we should do more than just wring our hands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate my colleague, Deputy Bertie Ahern, on his promotion to the Department of Finance. I am sure he will do a good job in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask three questions all of which could be dealt with if we had reform of the operation of the Seanad. The first is in relation to the Maastricht Summit. It is necessary that we have a <Col N="639" /> debate on that matter and I would like to know if we can have Members of the European Parliament present for that debate. My concern is twofold. Senator Harte referred to neutrality and my concern is equally in the context of the economic and social developments that have taken place and the statement by member states that they would see a two-tier system, Ireland being in the second tier.</P>
    <P>The second question also relates to Seanad reform and the legislation coming before us. Since we started here this session we have not had a proper piece of legislation before us despite what the Leader of the House has told us that he intends to ensure that this House gets a fair share of legislation. All we have got is the Sea Pollution Act, which is a measure to implement an international protocol, and the Liability for Defective Products Bill relates to something we have to do in the European context. There is no domestic legislation being introduced here, or nothing of a substantial nature. These are important Bills but passing them is really a formality for us.</P>
    <P>The third question is: when is the Leader of the House going to allow us to hold the debate on the political situation as he indicated? Five successive weeks in the Dáil have been taken up with matters relating to the leadership of the Government party. We now have new Ministers appointed and we cannot even rubberstamp it, we cannot discuss the matter at all. When are we going to have a debate on matters that concern the future of the Government and the future of the country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I would like to make it clear that when I said I supported Senator Manning's amendment I was indicating I was seconding it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accepted that and allowed you to speak on two occasions on the Order of Business because of the fact that there was very considerable support for Senator Manning's amendment. <Col N="640" /> I was going to remind the House to have it seconded if they so wished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great sympathy for the view expressed here that the more important the issue the less likely it is to be debated. It all contributes to what we see and have been analysing for some time as a growing democratic deficit both in these Houses and between here and the European institutions generally. I add my voice strongly to the call for a debate on the Maastricht Summit as set out in Item No. 48 on the Order Paper. We ask for this in a non-combative way and through you, a Chathaoirligh, we ask the Leader of the House to have the debate before Maastricht.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach spoke last Wednesday and addressed the Irish Council of the European Movement in UCD. It was an excellent address on this very topic, but it should have been delivered in one of the Houses of Parliament. It brought us further down the road on the issues we are all concerned about. It referred to the powers of the European Parliament and the matter of neutrality and the whole political union area was very well and very sensitively dealt with by the Taoiseach. However, I have to register my strong objection that he could not have chosen one of the Houses of Parliament to deliver that most important address. We would love him to come and put on the record of this House his views, which we will have very little difficulty in supporting, and open a most important debate in this House on it. I always thought that one of the strengths of the Seanad over the Dáil was our ability to respond more quickly to national and international issues without being over-strictly fettered by political constraints of one kind or another. I urge the Leader to allow that debate, the request for which has come from all sides of this House.</P>
      <P>We also support fully the urgent need for a debate on Northern Ireland and the Yugoslav crisis. We do little justice to our foreign affairs brief if we do not debate that as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, as I said before <Col N="641" /> in this House &mdash; I know it has been repeated on all sides again today in relation to what is happening in Maastricht &mdash; I have just one suggestion to make to the Leader in the context of the suggestions for a debate. I am not so sure whether it is practical or not. The Maastricht Summit is not going to confine itself to just one area of government, or indeed one area of activity, as it will impact on this country. There are, for example, serious defence implications, serious social implications under the Social Charter and, of course, economic implications. I am wondering if the Leader might consider having a debate which would encompass all of these matters under which the various Ministers would come into this House and expound the Government's views on specific areas. While I fully appreciate and indeed applaud the efforts to have the Taoiseach here as the Leader of the Government and as the person who will lead the Irish negotiations in Maastricht and beyond &mdash; I know all of us will be very anxious to have his views on this &mdash; I feel perhaps that in the interest of information generally, not only for the House but for the general public, there could be an accommodation. I am not sure how it could be formulated. However, I suggest to the Leader that perhaps he might include this in his discussions with the Whips when we are putting together the motion. I am sorry my good friend, Senator Ryan, could not hear me; usually I am accused of shouting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Manning's request to the Leader to give time for a Second Stage reading to item No. 6, the Suicide Bill, 1991. I think all sections agree that something should be done in this area to bring the law in line with society's view in the 1990s. The law could be described as silly if it was not so tragic in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to support Senator Ryan's request for a debate on Northern Ireland and in doing so to congratulate Dublin Corporation on their decision to not allow the mouthpiece of the men of violence a stage in the Mansion House, <Col N="642" /> something I requested on several occasions this time 12 months ago.</P>

      <P>With regard to this ongoing debate on the role of the Seanad, in which I propose to take part, I will be saying precisely the same things I said even before I was elected. We all know perfectly well how the Seanad should be reformed and could be reformed. We also all know perfectly well that it never will be reformed because it does not suit the political parties to engage in anything that would approach even minimal reform. That is the answer to the question.</P>

      <P>May I also say something with regard to an item that was mentioned in passing, a very serious and important item raised by Senator Upton? I would like to ask the Leader of the House, in the light of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the Programme for Government and of the fact that over the weekend it was disclosed that three members of the Fianna Fáil Party, including a Cabinet Minister, believed their telephones to have been tapped &mdash; I am not going into the merits of that case &mdash; in the light of that situation and the undertaking given may I know precisely when the Bill dealing with telephone tapping will be introduced in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I support the Senators who called for a debate on Northern Ireland. We are occasionally told that we must not have such a debate because we will exacerbate matters. How much further can they be exacerbated? In the past week or so a hospital was blown up and the bomb was brought in through the children's ward. Just in the past few days we had the other side apparently blowing up a mother and son. When will we have a debate on Northern Ireland? Are we just going to be fiddling while the rest of the country is in chaos and turmoil? <Col N="643" /> There will never be a time when we can debate this unless we take ourselves seriously in our role as democratic representatives.</P>

      <P>I support the call for a debate on the Maastricht Summit. The suggestion made by Senator Dardis was an excellent one. We should have a separate debate on the GATT and the Common Agricultural Policy. The GATT agreement is about to be concluded before the end of the year and the Common Agricultural Policy reform early next year. We should have a debate on these two subjects at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Doyle when she said that there was a democratic deficit in the Community. It is a growing one. As one who worked there for five years, I assure the House that I am very concerned that we are being ruled more and more not by politicians in Brussels but by civil servants who are not accountable and we are suffering the consequences one way or another. We should make our views known on that subject. I am very sorry our country could not be represented by a Minister on Monday at the discussions on economic and monetary union due to internal problems in one party. It was regrettable. I am also very sorry that the largest county in Ireland still does not have a senior Minister at the Cabinet table. I refer, of course, to County Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to two issues very briefly. One is the question of the foreign affairs committee which a number of us have been seeking vociferously for some months. My understanding is that recently the Taoiseach gave it as his view that what he described as a European affairs committee might be established. I put it to the Leader of the House that this is not what Members sought or are seeking. If it is a European <Col N="644" /> affairs committee presumably the intention would be to confine debate to issues that relate to the European Economic Community. If this were the case it would render ineligible for discussion issues relating to the present strife in Yugoslavia, issues in Russia, eastern Europe, the GATT negotiations particularly as they affect the United States and the implications of the Common Agricultural Policy here. Events in countries in Europe such as Switzerland, Austria, Finland, Sweden, the Norwegian fish issue, issues relating to the Third and Fourth World including the Middle East and the Palestine question could not be discussed. I ask the Leader of the House to bring my comments, which no doubt many other Senators agree with to the Taoiseach and explain that what we seek is a more-widely based foreign affairs committee. We are the only country in western Europe without such a committee.</P>
      <P>I add my voice to those of my colleagues who have sought an urgent debate in relation to the Maastricht talks. Obviously if a foreign affairs committee existed and there was a structure in this Parliament for discussion of these pertinent issues we would not be wasting so much time on the Order of Business. It is pathetic that the structure is such that we need to press an issue like this and waste 40 minutes of our time when it should be patently obvious that there is an urgency about such a debate given the issues that are involved.</P>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed that for the first time in the history of this State the dominant political party in this country have chosen not to appoint a Minister from the province of Connaught.</P>

We have very good ongoing negotiations. However, by avoiding discussion in this House of the problems we have given the wrong signal.

      <P>A number of Senators raised the question of Maastricht and EC matters at present being debated. Senators are aware that in the Programme for Government it is proposed to publish a White Paper on the new union treaty which it is expected will result from the current negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conferences on political union and on economic and monetary union. These negotiations are due to conclude in Maastricht in early December. The new union treaty will be ratified by member states in the course of 1992 so as to come into effect on 1 January 1993. It is most likely that a referendum will be held in this country to enable the union treaty to be ratified. It is the Government's intention that there should be a full and wide-ranging public discussion on the issue involved in the new treaty so that the referendum can take place after a fully informed debate on this further stage of European integration that will be of such crucial importance to the future prosperity and wellbeing of this country.</P>
      <P>Senators are aware that even this week there are ongoing Intergovernmental Conferences taking place. Today there is an informal meeting in preparation for the Maastricht Summit so obviously I could not &mdash; and it would be wrong for me to do so &mdash; agree to a debate here today with this matter being discussed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is my intention but I cannot give a specific date.</P>
      <P>The queries raised by Senator Manning and others referred to the ongoing debate on reform of the Seanad. The proposal was that we would note what Senators said, refer it to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and take it from there. That is the way I understood it.</P>
      <P>A question was raised by Senators Manning and Neville regarding the Suicide Bill. The position is that the Minister for Justice will very shortly seek the approval of the Government to circulate a Criminal Law Bill and that Bill will provide for the abolition of the offence of suicide and make the necessary ancillary provisions. The Bill will also abolish the present division of offences into felonies and misdemeanours and do away with obsolete forms of punishment of prisoners such as penal servitude, hard labour, whipping and prison divisions. At present suicide is a felony at common law. It was regarded at one time as self-murder and it carried with it certain consequences which are now obsolete, such as forfeiture of goods and chattels of the deceased and denial of a Christian burial. Attempted suicide is a misdemeanour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this enlightened age we would all agree that it is inappropriate for society to treat suicide as a crime under the law. Indeed, there were proposals to abolish the offence as far back as 1967 but they came to nothing. It is my very strong view that it is undesirable and wrong that criminalisation should add to the tragedy and the loss which accompanies such <Col N="649" /> events, as well as compounding the grief of the family and friends of the deceased.</P>
    <P>The Government agree with the principle of Senator Neville's Bill and I congratulate him on his interest in this matter. I suggest that in view of the Government's proposal to introduce a Bill in the wider context of crimes generally he should withdraw his Bill and await publication of the Government Bill which the Minister for Justice hopes to publish as soon as possible. The Criminal Law Bill will deal with other matters relating to the abolition of suicide which are not covered under Senator Neville's Bill.</P>
    <P>Senators O'Toole, Upton and others raised the question of Maastricht. I have replied to that.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton asked for a debate on the political situation. I have no proposals at this time for such a debate. He also asked about the Bill on telephone tapping. I understand the Minister for Justice indicated that this Bill would be taken in this session. Senator Dardis referred to the Maastricht Summit and to the Common Agricultural Policy. Most Senators would like a debate on the Common Agricultural Policy. They have had one recently in the Dáil and I hope to have one here as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly congratulated the Minister for the Environment. Senator Brendan Ryan asked about the European affairs committee. That is referred to and promised in the Programme for Government and I understand it will proceed. The foreign affairs committee will come onstream as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In regard to Northern Ireland, my position remains the same and I have no plans for a debate on it. Senator Harte referred <Col N="650" /> to the role of the Seanad. The other points raised were not appropriate to the Order of Business. Senator Conroy referred to the European affairs committee and to Croatia. I have no proposals in that regard. I have dealt with the queries raised by Senator Costello.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Doyle, I allowed debates on many national and international issues and I think her comments were a little unfair. I have no proposals for a debate on Yugoslavia. I noted Senator Norris's comments on Northern Ireland and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Senator Rafferty referred to the GATT and the Common Agricultural Policy and I have indicated my position there. I have indicated my position in regard to Senator Staunton's queries. Senator McGowan referred to Northern Ireland. I will take up with the new Minister for-the Environment Senator Cosgrave's comments in regard to the rates support grant. As regards Senator O'Keeffe's query, as soon as possible we will have a debate on the banking system.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald asked for a debate on the Third World before Christmas. Obviously that is an important issue and something I will consider. Senator Lydon asked about a debate on Northern Ireland to which I have replied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the sixth time we have discussed the role of the Seanad and it would be worth our while instead of saying what we should be doing to reflect a little on why this institution of the Oireachtas is the way it is. Quite truthfully, the problem is not Seanad Éireann but first, the Oireachtas and then the entirety of State institutions. The problem centres on lack of accountability and of participation. All through the institutions of this State, in Dáil, Seanad or local authority and in the various semi-devolved institutions like health boards we have developed a resistance to public accountability, to public participation and to the idea of openness. A cult of secrecy, of exclusion and of suppression has taken over this country so that it has become a bad thing to discuss anything in public or to demand public accountability. The result is that Governments do not regard themselves as accountable to Parliament other than in a formal, rubber stamp fashion.</P>
      <P>It is particularly ironic, for instance, that President Gorbachev in the Soviet Union has greater difficulty enacting legislation in the allegedly undemocratic Soviet Union than our Government ever had because President Gorbachev actually has to persuade people to do things; the Irish Government do not. I am not criticising any one political party or, indeed, any Government; I criticise the way our institutions have been made to work. But institutions are non-participative and no more than minimally democratic. We do not believe in democracy in the way our institutions work. We have created layer upon layer of bureaucratic restraint and of secrecy to suppress discussion and this House is the most blatant symbol of that pervasive secrecy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind the House that the greatest power in the land outside of Government lies not with the Dáil, most assuredly not with the Seanad and not with any local authority; the greatest national power lies with the Department of Finance who exercise massive influence and patronage, who supervise large scale expenditure and hold power of veto, effectively, over the operations of virtually every other Government Department. The Department of Finance do not see themselves in this light &mdash; a cursory look at the history written on their behalf and some recent historic analysis will show that the Department of Finance <Col N="653" /> claim powers and wisdom to themselves that is out of touch with reality.</P>
    <P>It is important to elaborate on this issue. It is not necessary to have a Parliament made up of experts or of people with formal qualifications. There is no particular reason why the occupants of these benches should be assumed to be better qualified, more expert or more knowledgeable than the occupants of other benches whether back or front. Parliament has nothing to do with formal qualifications. The dynamism of democracy can generate the kind of people capable of dealing with issues as they arise and we have suppressed the dynamic dimension of democracy in this country. It has been suppressed by the increasingly irrelevant practices of institutions supposedly running this country. No Government seriously believe they have to persuade either House of the Oireachtas of anything; they only have to ask people to support them.</P>
    <P>Individual Ministers will occasionally condescend to get involved in serious discussion on certain issues. I am aware of two instances in recent times &mdash; there may have been more. The Minister of State at the Department of the Environemnt when the Environmental Protection Agency Bill was in this House was actually prepared to discuss the arguments. More recently, the Minister of State &mdash; the almost former Minister of State &mdash; at the Department of Justice, Deputy Noel Treacy, discussed the Children Bill. With a sense of participation and of accountability Parliament works as intended, but when an attitude prevails that Parliament is a nuisance ritual that Ministers have to go through in order to get legislation passed, then there is no incentive to participate.</P>
    <P>I do not sing this tune simply because it would be nicer for Independents like myself if Parliament had greater power and by Parliament I do not mean the Seanad only but both Houses of the Oireachtas. I sing it because this country is afflicted by a sense of exclusion among its citizens. They believe they are on the outside, that they have no say, influence or power and that nobody in Parliament <Col N="654" /> takes them seriously other than in the ritual election every five years. The electorate are entitled to vote in elections, but there is a general feeling among elected representatives that beyond that they lack the capacity to understand issues that concern them and are not qualified to participate in decisions which affect their futures.</P>
    <P>This House is a microcosm of that. During the past hour we have explained to ourselves why we will not debate Northern Ireland. I do not know why we should not debate Northern Ireland and I would like to hear the reasons given. I suspect it is because the first instinct of all Governments and of all those in power at various Government levels is to decide that difficult and sensitive issues must be discussed in private and in secret with no external involvement. The consequence is that issues of difficulty and sensitivity are discussed everywhere except in the Houses of the Oireachtas; we will have learned seminars on Maastricht and on Northern Ireland on &ldquo;The Gay Byrne Show,&rdquo; on &ldquo;The Late Late Show,&rdquo; on Gerry Ryan's programme and so on where every topical issue may be discussed but debate will be restricted, or late or inhibited on difficult issues inside the Houses of Parliament.</P>
    <P>That lamentable situation does not apply in this House only; we just happen to be down the line regarding access to power but if you emasculate the primary House of the Oireachtas, the Dáil, the result is an even more severe emasculation of the secondary House of the Oireachtas. At this stage, I have had it with what I can only describe as the Seanad's insular navel-gazing introspective obsession with itself because the State rather than the Seanad is the issue. In our lack of authority and accountability we are no more than a symptom of that irrelevance which is why I disagree with many who have spoken in this debate, including most of my Independent colleagues.</P>
    <P>The political parties are not the cause of the problems of this House; political parties &mdash; whatever my views on them &mdash;<Col N="655" /> are no more than a reflection of institutional decay and have got used to non-accountability and to non-participation. All our political parties accept to an appalling extent the idea of centralised authority and the necessity for a boss to dictate what you do and say and how you do it. Disagreement with the boss is taken as a reflection on your loyalty and can also jeopardise &mdash; as we have recently discovered &mdash; one's hopes of promotion; this is a consequence of the centralised hierarchical model and structure of all institutions in this State.</P>
    <P>The Seanad, like our trade union movement, our largest Church, and every State institution, is characteristically centralised, hierarchical, authoritarian and secretive. There are rituals of participation in most of these institutions with the exception of the Church, but real power in all of them rests behind closed doors and in private with people whose accountability is limited.</P>
    <P>The source of our national problems is that no one believes anymore that people are capable of taking control of their own lives. Legislators do not encourage it and resist it themselves in the Houses of the Oireachtas which is why we get squeezed out and not because political parties dominate this House. Many second Chambers are elected in a similar fashion to this one; the form of local or regional government determines the composition of the Upper House. The composition of government in the German states determines the composition of its national Senate. There is nothing unusual about this. I would prefer if local authority electors did not elect as many members of Fianna Fáil as they do but because I do not like the election result does not entitle me to object to the election.</P>

      <P>Senator McKenna knows my views on that. I do not feel that Fine Gael are of sufficient significance at present in my political spectrum to merit <Col N="656" /> a mention. Fianna Fáil Senators at least have power of sorts.</P>
      <P>I agree with changing the process of election but, for instance, if we allow farmers to elect representatives directly that process will become politicised also. There is nothing wrong with that and no way of avoiding it. Wherever elections take place for positions of influence there will be politics.</P>
      <P>Politics is not a bad word, nor is politicisation a bad thing; these words are not pejorative terms although it is often suggested that politics and politicisation are undesirable. As a member of a minority in this House, which differs on most issues from the majority Members, I do not have any problem with the notion of politics. I have a problem with State institutions which impede political action; we do not have real politics either in this House or the other House. We have a ritual not based on accountability; major upheavals and debates occur outside Parliament and Parliament is no more than a ritual of rubber stamping with limited and controlled debates.</P>
      <P>It seems no one believes that either House of the Oireachtas can contribute anything to the formulation of policy on future economic and monetary union or on European political union. We will have a debate on what our betters have negotiated for us, in which they will defend what they have got. There is no Oireachtas belief in a need for participation in the formulation of a national view because this country no longer believes in democracy or in public participation in debates. The list of exclusions from participation is endless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Large numbers of people have no control over their lives and are unrepresented in this House. If the Oireachtas were to be properly representative, one-fifth of its Members should have experience of long term unemployment. How many Members of either House have ever experienced unemployment for any length of time? A few have for very short periods of time when, like myself, in student days they passed through a labour exchange once on the way to a Christmas job with An Post; such jobs <Col N="657" /> were plentiful then. The experience of a labour exchange is something that most Oireachtas Members read or hear about, but do not experience personally. Certain groups of people are not represented in the Oireachtas because we are an excluding society. Our institutions exclude, decision-making processes. Our system of Government is based on exclusion and on the presumption that experts outside the Oireachtas know what is good for us, can give Government better advice than ordinary people and that there is a better way of dealing with problems than the democratic way. I do not believe there is any better way.</P>
    <P>Democracy is not an easy system to operate. I said at a public meeting recently that democracy is a scourge for anybody who wants to get anything done but it is preferable to other ways of doing things. Politics is being undermined to a considerable extent by our own actions but also by the increasingly trivialising nature of much of what passes for political comment. That is not casting aspersions on politicians but on democracy, on the idea that we can govern ourselves. It is a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from the degree to which we exclude ourselves from participation.</P>
    <P>There is a series of issues that could be addressed in terms of institutional reform. The first would be to ensure that issues are debated as they arise. Both Houses of the Oireachtas spend much of their time on business that should not be central to the Oireachtas. From April until June the other House devotes itself largely to the Finance Bill and nothing else. This House devoted huge chunks of its time before the summer to the Environmental Protection Agency Bill and nothing else could be done. There is now a backlog of legislation in the other House while business in this House is liable to come to an end shortly for want of legislation to debate. The solution is not to encourage long debates here on Second Stage but to set up select committees in both Houses to deal with issues.</P>
    <P>I am not interested anymore in talking <Col N="658" /> about the Seanad in isolation; Seanad reform cannot be separated from Oireachtas and institutional reform. It is not separate from everything else. We are symptoms of the fundamental national structural problem of exclusion. If citizens felt they had some way of influencing decisions, 20 per cent of our adult working population would not tolerate the scourge of unemployment; but the experience of exclusion and the consequent helplessness encourages them to tolerate it.</P>
    <P>The second and more difficult issue in reforming the Oireachtas is to restore the proper order of accountability. Governments do not run the Oireachtas; that is not the way parliamentary democracy works. On the contrary, the Oireachtas runs the Government, and ultimately Government has to persuade the Oireachtas to allow it to act. It might be naive to suggest a return to that model but we have, in Ireland, developed a creaking institution of parliament, based on structures and perceptions of the role of Government which are close to 50 years out of date.</P>
    <P>Fifty years ago State involvement in many areas was minimal and the Oireachtas met two or three days a week to discuss that minimal involvement. The same structures are burdened now with a huge complex State apparatus and an equally complex apparatus of devolved central Government &mdash; I use that phrase advisedly because regional health boards and vocational education committees are simply local incarnations of centralisation; they are not local in any real sense because they have no local authority or decision-making power. The greater part of Government decision-making, patronage, expenditure and much of the legislative programme cannot be accommodated by our creaking, groaning, overloaded State institutions. The frustration Members of Seanad Éireann experience is directly related to that and not to some mysterious development taking place here and nowhere else.</P>
    <P>One discovers after a few years in the Oireachtas that any backbench Member <Col N="659" /> of the Dáil not in line for promotion &mdash; and the line for promotion should be revised by all in the light of recent events, because it obviously extends further than we thought &mdash; finds any House of the Oireachtas frustrating because there is no serious role available to them other than roaring at Members on the other side unless a Minister is prepared to take an issue reasonably. Beyond that there is no sense of the ideal order of things in the Oireachtas, and the ideal and proper order is the dominance not of Government but of Parliament to which Government is accountable. Real power and decision-making lie with Parliament and not with Government under parliamentary democracy. The Seanad constitutes one House of Parliament and one reason for the degree of exclusion of this House is that Parliament is essentially a minor player in the political process and Government is the dominant player. What we effectively have in this country is not parliamentary democracy but elective dictatorship. We have a Government who, in the eyes of the general public, need to get themselves one vote more than 83 votes in the Dáil to enable them to do what they like for five years. Only under very rare circumstances would they be inhibited from doing what they want by Parliament.</P>
    <P>This reflects a change in the perception of Parliament's role which would not have been of such consequence when Government was not such a major spender or developer of policy. At present, an enormous Department of Education operate without an Act in most areas and a similarly large Department of Social Welfare operate with minimal accountability; there is one annual Estimate and one Social Welfare Act and for the rest of the year £2.5 billion is spent with virtually no accountability. One debate in one House of the Oireachtas once a year on an Estimate is not accountability.</P>
    <P>It would be a good thing to have an Oireachtas committee to deal with each of the major spending Departments, not a Seanad or Dáil committee but an Oireachtas committee which would <Col N="660" /> monitor the way each Department did their business. But we will not have that because we do not accept the principle of accountability anymore. It would be good to have an Oireachtas committee on Foreign Affairs to monitor foreign policy attitudes of the Government and foreign policy issues which would have power to summon anybody to explain what is being done in our name.</P>
    <P>I can illustrate my points by reminding the Seanad that the committees that already exist and in which Members of this House participate have virtually no powers over members of Government. They cannot insist that a Minister appear before them and the degree to which they can force people to disclose papers is limited in many cases. The degree to which they can make the instruments of Government, the Government Departments, accountable to Parliament is limited to a considerable extent. The very committees that are supposed to represent a step forward are a clear illustration of the degree to which there is no such thing as parliamentary accountability. Present committees have no power and we do not set up the sort of committees that could function perfectly well outside of the political arena which would be select committees to deal with legislation.</P>
    <P>If Dáil Éireann will not give itself the right not to be bored to death while four people spend four weeks debating the Finance Bill, then perhaps we could start in this House by deciding that the Committee Stage of legislation as it passes through this House would be taken by a select committee. It is, in fact, usually taken by a self-selected committee of four or five people but that committee hold up all other business for weeks instead of carrying on their business in a less heated atmosphere and in a way which would not retard the business of the House.</P>
    <P>If people want to talk in this House about the role of the Seanad, they must talk &mdash; and that is why I have deliberately chosen to do so &mdash; about the role of the Oireachtas and regarding that role I reiterate the principles of accountability <Col N="661" /> and participation, two fundamental principles in which this country is lacking and which are symptomatic of, and indeed the cause of, most of our problems. Lack of participation creates grand scale alienation from the system, from Government and from politics. Lack of accountability results in inept incompetent management of health services, in some cases of education services and of other services too. People and management systems are not perfect and the only alternative accountability system I know of, apart from the market, which cannot be applied to education, health and social security, is openness and questioning by parliament. Since one cannot have marketplace accountability for education, health services, social security or many other areas, the inevitable consequence of secrecy and centralisation is not efficiency or control but inertia, bureaucracy and a lack of imagination.</P>
    <P>We encourage inertia and bureaucracy by opting for the worst of both worlds, bureaucracy without accountability, which generates so much frustration in both Houses of the Oireachtas and so much public contempt for the Oireachtas. It is true, and the public are right to believe that as the Oireachtas now operates, the last place one would expect to find an issue dealt with intelligently, immediately and to completion would be within the walls of the Oireachtas; there would not be time nor the expertise to do so. I remember an incident at the committee on which I serve, Comhchoiste na Gaeilge. I was anxious that we should ask the people of the Gaeltachtaí to communicate their problems with the committee. The first suggestion was that we should place an advertisement in the local papers. It emerged that the permission of the Department of Finance would be needed for a committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas to obtain the money required to place an advertisement in the newspapers. That is a fine illustration of the absence of any real power the committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas have: a joint committee set up by resolution of <Col N="662" /> both Houses could not place an advertisement in the papers. I then, innocently, suggested that we should write a letter to the papers since we could not place an advertisement. I was told that an Oireachtas Joint Committee could not write a letter to the papers without permission. This illustrates the dominant ethos. I inquired from whom we would need to get permission and the reply was a bit vague but, ultimately, we took that course. The philosophy is quite clear; contrary to the constitutional theory, the Houses of the Oireachtas are under the control of Government Departments and therefore under the control of Government, whereas, the opposite is the case: Government is under the control of the Houses of the Oireachtas. That is the larger picture.</P>
    <P>If we were to have a revolution in terms of perceptions of parliament, what would this House need? This House does not need extra powers. As a secondary House of our Oireachtas, the Seanad has sufficient powers as it stands. It can initiate or amend legislation and refuse to allow legislation through. It cannot stop legislation, and I would not favour a secondary House of the Oireachtas having power to prevent legislation being passed. I would regard that as undemocratic. Only the Chamber elected by the people should have such power.</P>
    <P>The Seanad can also, quite astonishingly, overrule any statutory instrument, although I suspect it has never done so. There are hundreds if not thousands of such instruments issued every year. If the Seanad overturns one, it cannot be overruled by the Dáil. Any statutory instrument which is overturned by either House of the Oireachtas lapses and there is no way, short of legislation, to reverse that. This is an extraordinary power if this House chose to exercise it.</P>
    <P>If this House chose to have an open debate, with a free vote, on secondary legislation we would have a very interesting secondary House. This would require no extra power. It might be much more useful for us to spend our time dealing with controversial items of secondary legislation, in serious debate, rather than <Col N="663" /> spending long hours going through amendments to a Finance Bill which have no chance of being taken seriously. There is no problem about the powers of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Some people are unhappy about the composition of this House. Many criticisms of the structure, composition and democratic credentials of this House come from my colleagues in Dublin University. I am one of three Senators representing a constituency of 75,000 voters. My colleagues in Dublin University have three representatives for a constituency of 17,000 voters. If we wish to exchange pleasantries about democratic credentials, there is a very good case for restoring some degree of parity in terms of the number of voters per Senator from the universities. The number of excluded graduates, not of the National University and Dublin University, is also increasing.</P>
    <P>I would be much happier if the composition of this House were different, if there were less likelihood of a Government majority. I do not, however, suggest that simply because I do not like the result of an election we should change the rules. I would like a number of the representatives of the various vocational interests to be elected by the vocational interests themselves. I do not believe, however, that that would produce a much different result. The political parties, quite understandably and reasonably, would then become involved in those elections, and ultimately, although not necessarily in all cases, the difference would not be nearly as significant as we imagine. I very often regret the choices political parties make on their own voting papers about who they select. They often have a better choice available to them than the people they select. However, I do not think that we should allow ourselves to be diverted by that.</P>
    <P>I have had enough of talking about the Seanad. The real problem for this country is not Seanad Éireann but the increasing irrelevance of the Oireachtas. The real problem is not what we do here, though one would always like to do more, but that we have completely lost the <Col N="664" /> proper order of things in a parliamentary democracy. Major announcements and major statements of Government policy are made outside the Oireachtas. This was evidenced by the recent speech made by the Taoiseach to the Irish Council of the European Movement, in which he apparently announced views different from those of the Government on a number of issues relevant to Europe. Announcements are now as likely to be made outside as inside the Oireachtas. That is the problem. Because this is the secondary House of the Oireachtas, we are in the backwash of that institutional failure. The fashionable phrase in Europe is the &ldquo;democratic deficit&rdquo;&mdash; those who are theoretically in control, the people, are in practical terms, increasingly outside the system of control. This democratic deficit exists not only in Brussels but in this country too.</P>
    <P>Elections which occur every two, three or four years, are only one part of democracy. The other part is the interaction between people, their representatives and the Government. In my view, that interaction has, effectively, ceased to work. Regardless of who is in Government, parties are so constrained in terms of their freedom to debate and Ministers are increasingly impatient with the problem of debate, that all Members can do is whisper in the Minister's ear, or have a quiet chat at a parliamentary party meeting and then come in to the House to rubber stamp legislation. We will not change that without major institutional changes.</P>
    <P>In my view what is needed is for Members of both Houses to insist on a system of committees to scrutinise the activities of an awesomely large Government apparatus. It would be helpful if we had real decentralisation so that we would only have to scrutinise genuinely national issues. Members of the Oireachtas spend much of their time in the Oireachtas worrying about their local health board, local education and the application of the social welfare system at local level. They must raise these issues nationally because they cannot get answers locally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="665" /> The underlying problem is the underutilization by the Oireachtas of its existing power. That power would be best used if we took seriously the right of the Oireachtas to the final decision on everything. That is ultimately the position we occupy. Until we recreate the atmosphere in which governments realise they are accountable to Parliament and parliamentarians assert their right to hold governments accountable, there is no point discussing an isolated way, the reform of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to restate the Progressive Democrats position in relation to the Seanad. From some of the contributions I have heard and read over the past two weeks, in spite of the fact that we have stated our position on several occasions, there is still a misunderstanding about it. It was misrepresented quite seriously by at least two speakers in the past fortnight. The Progressive Democrats position has been, and is, that there is no need for an Upper House of Parliament, that there are democracies in the EC that operate quite well, efficiently and in a totally democratic way without the need for an Upper House. The conduct of some of the Members of this House, since I have come into it, would confirm us in our view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, we must also recognise that there is no political will among the other parties in either House to abolish Seanad Éireann. We are a political party, we are democrats and we abide by that political will. While Seanad Éireann exists as an institution of the State, we will participate fully in its workings and committees and we will defer to it as we should defer to a House of the Oireachtas. I do not see any inconsistency between holding the view that the Seanad should be abolished and participating in it as a political party. We are a political party and we will participate in the institutions of the State. We will attempt, by every democratic means at our disposal, to change the things we wish to see changed but we will do so in the context of the democratic institutions <Col N="666" /> which the State provides us with, and we will participate fully.</P>
    <P>On the first day this Seanad met, my colleague, Senator Cullen, said we would participate fully in the workings of the House, in its committees and in its reform. That commitment still stands. Our record in this Chamber bears examination as to that commitment which we have fulfilled to the best of our ability. We have participated in the day-to-day workings of the Seanad, and in its votes. Some of those who pointed the finger at us a fortnight ago as not being present in the Chamber, might very well examine their own consciences as to how they participate here. It is an irony that those who defend this House most vigorously are sometimes the people who do most to discredit and disregard it.</P>
    <P>We see no inconsistency between wishing to see the Seanad abolished and being here. We will continue to contribute to this and to all the democratic institutions of the State for as long as we are here and are a political party. We will use the democratic structures as provided as long as they are relevant to the wishes of the people.</P>
    <P>Given my party's position, it is somewhat ironic that I find myself disagreeing fundamentally with the negative tone of some of Senator Ryan's remarks. It is quite difficult to argue about matters like the democratic deficit about the unrepresentative nature of Parliament and its accountability, given the elite constituency from which the Senator comes.</P>

      <P>He said the Government can do what they like. That is simply not the case, and the Senator knows it. The Government can only do what they like as long as they have a majority of Dáil Éireann to support and vote for them. Even if a single party were to hold a majority in the Lower House, if a Government were to treat the country and their party with contempt, I am quite confident that the democratic process would work effectively to remove that Government from office.</P>

      <P>On the question of accountability, the Senator is right in saying that the Government are and should be accountable to Parliament. The individual Members who compose the Parliament are also accountable to the electorate who put them there in the first place. In our democratic system the electorate is perfectly free to remove those it considers inadequate. That is the ultimate in sovereignty and democracy.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Senator's concern about disadvantaged people and the unemployed, there are quite a few unemployed graduates. I am sure it would be possible to put forward an unemployed graduate for membership of this House, within the electoral framework of the universities.</P>
      <P>In this debate we need to ask ourselves if Seanad Éireann is an essential and necessary part of our democratic system. It is an essential part as long as the Constitution remains as it is. About 80 amendments to the Constitution would be required before Seanad Éireann could be abolished. I do not think we will have a referendum on 80 amendments to the Constitution even if people might like to have such referendum. In his contribution two weeks ago Senator Murphy referred to that when he said that perhaps the Progressive Democrats recognised something he had pointed out a long time ago: the constitutional difficulty of abolishing this House. We do recognise that difficulty but whether this House is a necessary part of the democratic system is a separate question. It may be essential, in the constitutional sense, but it is not necessary. Its relevance must be questioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil elects the Taoiseach, which means there is an influence on Government in the Dáil. This House has demonstrated that it, too, has an influence of how the Government behave in terms of policy and legislation. The degree to <Col N="668" /> which Senators on all sides of the House contribute towards the legislative process in our democracy is encouraging. In many instances, we have improved legislation. The example that comes most readily to mind is the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990, which was introduced in this House. It was modified quite significantly and improved by the contributions made during the course of that debate. Seanad Éireann has added and does add to the quality of the legislation which it is our responsibility to enact for the good of the country.</P>
    <P>There is widespread agreement from all sides of the House that the House needs to be reformed. Why then do we not proceed to reform the House? Some minor recommendations have been made by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in relation to the election of Cathaoirleach, the raising of topical issues and the attendance of distinguished visitors. I am gratified that, in the agreed Programme for Government, it states that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government consider that reform of the Oireachtas is an essential prerequisite to carrying through a legislative programme of reform and to make its work relevant and effective for the people of Ireland. The parties in Government will present proposals to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in 1991 for implementation during 1992.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas, as we know, includes the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The agreed Programme for Government also proposes that Committee Stages be dealt with by select committees and refers to a European affairs committee and the extension of sitting hours. There is deep public concern at the fact that the House rises in mid-July and does not come back until late October. There is, therefore, a commitment in the Programme for Government that the Dáil will rise on or around mid-July and recommence in late September. That is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>As part of the reform process, one of the more sensible decisions made by the <Col N="669" /> Committee on Procedure and Privileges and adopted by the House, was the installation of the television cameras. People in the country can now see how Parliament works, and judge for themselves whether we are making any contribution of value. That is to be welcomed. As I mentioned here previously, I found it extremely curious to go to Hungary almost two years ago and to find the proceedings of the Hungarian Parliament being broadcast every evening on the television news bulletins. We were not even being seen on television here at the time. I know there were fears about the misuse of television. It was said that people might, as they did today, speak indefinitely on the Order of Business about a pothole in Cavan, a harbour in west Cork or a national park for the Curragh. Thankfully, that temptation seems to have receded and people are less attracted by the magic eye of the camera.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, both Houses of the Oireachtas must change fundamentally over the coming years, because of the developments taking place within the EC. Many Senators earlier today spoke of the need for a debate on the Maastricht Summit. We need that debate. As we move towards greater economic, and particularly greater political union, the procedures of the Houses of the Oireachtas must change very fundamentally. It is an unfortunate accident of history that we derive so much of our parliamentary procedure and our parliamentary institutions from the model which is closest to us across the water. It is an irony that those who most profess to be nationalists and republican should have adopted a direct copy of a parliamentary system which is now shown to be archaic. It is my hope that our greater involvement in European affairs will require us to look beyond our nearest neighbour to the alternative parliamentary systems available in Europe on which we might model our system.</P>
    <P>The nation state is becoming less and less relevant. A colonial background has led us to imagine that the only legitimate form of government is a very highly centralised one based on the nation state. <Col N="670" /> That is something of comparatively recent origin in history. In a more all-embracing Europe the nation state is less and less intrusive and the temptation to keep a close centralised grip on power will be diluted. In this House and in the other House we must ask ourselves if we are to remain immune from the developments taking place in the world around us. Will we remain immutable while the world around us changes and while society here changes so dramatically? The answer must be &ldquo;no&rdquo;. We must be responsive and be seen to be relevant to the needs of a modern, high-tech society, one geared towards communications. Our sovereignty need not be diminished; in fact, it can be enhanced. A Senator referred earlier today to the democratic deficit where, for instance, the European Parliament did not have a very significant input into the workings of the EC. It is quite clear we are moving in a direction where the Parliament of the European Community will have a more direct input into the policy and the workings of the Community. We can complement that.</P>
    <P>The onus on us here is to retain the confidence of the electorate. I can imagine, given the events of the past few months, that there are sections of the electorate who need their confidence restored in politicians and in the political process. There is a widespread cynicism in parts of the country regarding politicians and how we behave and also regarding our institutions. We hope we may not have to go on the canvass trail too soon, but it is regrettable that when we do we will meet so many people who will say, &ldquo;I will not vote for any of you, you are all the same&rdquo;. It is a very short step from saying &ldquo;I will not vote for any of you&rdquo;, to saying that democracy is not the system of government we desire. We must be very conscious of the need to preserve the democracy which we gained at such cost and ensure that it survives and thrives.</P>
    <P>I found some of the nature of the debate in the other House during the motion of confidence in the Government quite unhelpful in that respect containing, as it did, a degree of personal <Col N="671" /> vindictiveness and invective. We can be grateful that that type of vindictiveness has not spilled over into this House. The onus is on us as parliamentarians, as politicians, to gain the confidence of the people, that the democratic systems to which we adhere will work and to the advantage of the people in the country as a whole. I do not for one moment doubt the motives of anybody in this House, of whatever political persuasion, in wishing to preserve those democratic systems and to ensure that democracy is protected.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt anybody's motives for becoming involved in politics in the first place. I am sure that all Members of this House became involved in politics out of a genuine desire to serve their country, their community, and to improve the people's lot as far as possible. That applies right across the political spectrum. It is worth stating because there are many people who think that if you say you are a politician, you have your hand in someone else's pocket or that some businessman has his hand in your pocket. We need to reaffirm our need to be here and what we are attempting to do is to remove some of that cynicism which exists in some areas. We need to restate those things lest they be forgotten, and lest that cynicism becomes so pervasive as to challenge our fundamental democracy. If we are discredited it is not the fault of the electorate; it is our own fault because of the way we conduct ourselves. For that reason, and because of what is happening within the European Community, reform is needed. We must change our system to reflect more fully the needs of a modern society so that we are at least more accountable and more relevant.</P>
    <P>The question then arises as to what needs to be done to reform Seanad Éireann. First, we must look to the university benches which are now empty. I have no objection to third level participation in Seanad Éireann. Many of the Senators on the Independent benches add to the House and work very hard within it but I resent any inference that those with a third level qualification &mdash;<Col N="672" /> of which I am one &mdash; are in some way more deserving of being listened to or more deserving of representation than those who have not. Senator Ryan made some points relating to that but I believe it is just as valid for a person from another vocational background who does not have the advantage of a third level degree to be represented here. However, I will say in defence of this House that, given all the deficiencies of the electoral system, its composition accurately reflects Irish society. We have people with third level education, we have people who have not; we have people who are wealthy and people who are not so wealthy; we have people from diverse backgrounds and from different parts of the country. In that sense this House accurately represents Irish society.</P>
    <P>In relation to accountability, it must be very comfortable to be in a position, as some Independent Senators are, to participate fully within a House of the Oireachtas without any apparent responsibility; in fact, they are not really responsible for their actions at all because they will never be in the position &mdash; I will not say of legislating because I acknowledge that Senators have contributed to legislation &mdash; of being responsible for the outcome of their actions. That is a very comfortable position to be in.</P>
    <P>In relation to third level representation we must realise that knowledge does not equate with wisdom and it is unfair to presume that because somebody is highly educated they have any more wisdom or input to make than someone who is less well educated. There are many examples of that here, people who may not be very well educated but who contribute fully and effectively to the working of the House. At a minimum, the franchise in relation to university representation should be extended to all third level institutions. It is wrong that people from the National University and Trinity College can be part of the electorate while those from the more recently established third level institutions are denied that franchise. That is a relic from the past and should be amended.</P>
    <P>Last year I met some people from <Col N="673" /> Toronto who as members of the Toronto constituency of Trinity College, were very interested in the outcome of the election of Senators from Trinity College or Dublin University. People living abroad should not be disenfranchised and I am glad the Programme for Government refers to votes for emigrants to the other House. I have no objection to people from Toronto, Quebec, Brussels or elsewhere having an input into elections but in the university context it should apply globally.</P>
    <P>I do not find the system of electing people nominated by the various panels undemocratic. There is a suggestion that if county councillors are part of the electorate there is a non-democratic implication. I reject that. It is quite democratic, after all councillors are elected and represent the views of their electorate. This is a political House, a political institution, and there are plenty of precedents which show that electoral colleges elect people to other Houses. Therefore, it is not particularly unusual to have a system like ours and I do not have any particular objection to it. However, as in the case of the universities, we should also extend the franchise to the nominating bodies. Again, we are back to relic of &ldquo;auld decency&rdquo; if I may use the term. For example, women's groups are not particularly well represented on those panels. Obviously, 30 years ago that was not as big an issue as it is today. Women's groups should be part of the nominating system. There are other large national representative bodies which did not exist several years ago and which should now have nominating rights.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the desire originally was that the Seanad would be a vocational chamber. In many ways it is; we have people from very diverse backgrounds here. However, one should be required to demonstrate competence and expertise to the nominating bodies of having some relevance at least to the panel one represents but that is not to say it has to be in the area of third level or higher education. There are many famers with a great deal of expertise who would <Col N="674" /> have plenty to say here. In fact, farmers are represented here. I see Senator Byrne here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking about the system of election for those who are elected by members of county councils <Col N="675" /> and so on. I reject, therefore, the suggestion that there should be a universal franchise for Seanad elections. That would not be appropriate as it would not contribute to the Seanad. In those circumstances it would be quite conceivable that we would have a different result in the Seanad compared to the Dáil and it is appropriate that the Government of the day should have a majority in Seanad Éireann as they do in the Dáil, otherwise it could lead to very serious difficulties.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Taoiseach's nominees, I could not reasonably be expected to say that the Taoiseach should not nominate people to Seanad Éireann given that I am one of the Taoiseach's nominees. It is important that there should be an inbuilt majority for the Government of the day. In fact, looking at local election results it is conceivable that with the present system one or more parties in the Dáil might form a Government while that party or parties might not be able to have a majority in the Upper House. This is quite conceivable and it could lead to chaos. I accept, therefore, the need to have some degree of control over the composition of the Upper House so that, at least, it reflects in broad terms the outcome of a general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to reform, there should be a review of Standing Orders and this is already being done to a limited degree through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. The way in which the Order of Business I conducted and some of the procedures adopted are not entirely appropriate to the needs of the House. They often lead to repetition as witnessed today during the Order of Business. Obviously, improvements can be made in that area. It would be much more effective if a vehicle were found where topical issues could be raised other than on the Order of Business. The Order of Business would then be more efficient. The public cannot comprehend why a House of the Oireachtas cannot debate and discuss matters which are being talked about in every pub and household. It can take several weeks before matters of general public interest are discussed <Col N="676" /> here by which time they are probably irrelevant. Therefore, it is important that we address that problem.</P>
    <P>In their January 1990 report the sub-committee on the revision of Standing Orders made some very valid points regarding raising topical issues, the extension of time for statements and so on. Senator Naughten was chairman of that sub-committee. As a start, it would be helpful, if we were to implement some of their recommendations.</P>
    <P>Another matter is the allocation of time for Second Stage debates. I come from a background where I produced three minute radio scripts in an hour and a half. Now the opposite applies; one need only think for three minutes about giving a one and a half hour address to Seanad Éireann. This illustrates how one can expand one's words to fill the time available. Members should have an opportunity to air matters fully but if their time was restricted it would lead to a more efficient way of conducting business.</P>
    <P>There was a reference made earlier to the Adjournment debates. I believe more than one topic should be taken on the Adjournment. On three separate occasions during the past fortnight I tried to raise a very important matter in relation to the water supply in Naas. I finally succeeded last week but, again, public concern had diminished somewhat. Therefore, more than one matter should be taken on the Adjournment. I agree with Senator Ryan that it is fundamental to parliamentary democracy that Ministers attend both Houses, listen to the contributions of Senators and Deputies and reply to them. The fundamental principle of accountability of the Executive to Parliament is involved here and for that reason I make no apologies about suggesting that more than one matter should be taken on the Adjournment and that Ministers should attend. Select committees could be used more extensively to deal with some matters and that would expedite the workings of the House.</P>
    <P>The status of the Leader is another matter to which some attention should be <Col N="677" /> given. The Programme for Government states that the Government will examine the feasibility of giving a special allowance to chairmen of Oireachtas Joint Committees in recognition of their additional responsibilities and workload. That could also apply to the Leader of the House. He has additional responsibilities and that should also be taken into account.</P>
    <P>There would be a distinct improvement in our public relations, if nothing else, if we allowed distinguished persons to address this House. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges made some proposals in that area which were widely accepted and should be implemented. It is appropriate that a Commissioner from the European Community, for example Ray MacSharry, should address this House. It need not necessarily be in the form of a debate. However, if more access was given to distinguished persons and to our European Parliament colleagues, to come and address this House, we would be more informed. From that point of view the proposed establishment of a European affairs committee is to be welcomed and particularly the fact that in future MEPs will have a right of audience at the meetings of this committee. The structures in Europe are changing and our parliamentary system will have to respond to those changes. There will have to be much closer liaison between Members of the Oireachtas and members of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Our voting procedures are archaic and date back to another century. I have seen parliamentary systems where the voting procedures are much more efficient than ours. I know from the Programme for Government that the Government will support the examination by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of the efficiency of Dáil practices, including the feasibility of an electronic voting system, and I am sure that could apply here also.</P>
    <P>There are positive aspects to this House and I hope I have mentioned some of them. One is the way Members have contributed to Bills. For example the Environmental Protection Agency Bill was definitely improved by the debate in <Col N="678" /> this House. The Minister accepted some amendments and, as a result, a better Bill was presented to the Dáil. Our deficiencies are underlined by the fact that we rely heavily on our own resources for research and expertise. While we have a very comprehensive Library, the degree of backup information which would improve our contributions to matters of a technical legislative nature is not always available. One of the side-effects is that it gives disproportionate power to lobby groups. I have seen several instances of Senators contributing to a debate and actually reading from a lobby document provided by a certain interest group. While it is important to represent diverse interests, nevertheless, it is undesirable to accept a document from a lobby group as a backup for a matter of a technical nature.</P>
    <P>I agree with some of the points made by Members on the opposite side about using the guillotine in a debate and the fact that debates should proceed until they logically end. I appreciate that if an amendment is made after the Dáil rises, the Dáil would have to be recalled and that would lead to all sorts of problems. Nevertheless, with proper ordering it should be possible to avoid those confrontations. This would be to our advantage and would benefit legislation going through the House.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which concerns me is our relationship with the media. I have already mentioned the electronic eye on the wall and what it sees. An unfortunate aspect of this is that we are getting &ldquo;sound bite&rdquo; politics &mdash; if there is a succinct sexy phrase that is what gets attention. I have met people in prominent public positions &mdash; not Members of either House &mdash; who will quite cynically say that if you want to get on air you must have a sexy phrase, and that is very unfortunate.</P>
    <P>The reporting of proceedings of both Houses of the Oireachtas should reflect the tone and content of debate and should not abstract a single, unrepresentative sentence. To be fair, &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; has accurately reflected a representative cross section of what takes place in this House. In other respects some media are very much into <Col N="679" />&ldquo;sound bite&rdquo; politics. This is disturbing because in recent weeks there has been very little evidence of moderation in the media. Somebody can say something very sensible and moderate but if it is not extreme it does not get reported. That is not very healthy from a democratic point of view. We probably do not have a great deal of control over this but we should be concerned that, frequently, it is only by being extreme that one attracts attention. This has led to some unfortunate incidents on the Floor of this House in the past where people have indulged in opportunism just to get a few lines in a paper which is not read by many people anyway.</P>
    <P>We are moving towards a more European and liberal society and we will have to reform our procedures and the way we conduct our business. This House needs to be fundamentally reformed in order to respond to the needs of a modern society, a society which has technology and communications systems instantly available to it. We will have to come out of the 19th century and start to live in the 20th century, since, undoubtedly many of our procedures are more appropriate to 19th century politics.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset my party's views are well known. They have been repeated on several occasions in this House. It is quite clear that not everybody has been listening to what we say but we are determined and will give an absolute commitment that as long as this House is here, and as long as we are here, we will contribute fully to its workings, to maintaining its dignity and we will participate fully in its reform. At the end of our participation here our record will be the subject of favourable scrutiny.</P>
    <P>My party believe we could get along quite effectively without an Upper House of the Oireachtas. We recognise that many people share that view but we also recognise that the other political parties do not share it. While we are a political party we will participate in the democratic institutions of the State to the extent that is available to us and we will try by democratic argument to change <Col N="680" /> those institutions. We are content to operate fully within the democratic process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Making statements on the role of the Seanad enables us to take a cold, hard look at ourselves having regard to the Seanad's present day requirements as a legislative body. We must also take into account the public perception of the Seanad as expressed by some journalists through the media.</P>
      <P>First, we must admit that there are difficulties with the way the Seanad performs. Inevitably, these statements will be viewed as a speculative investigation of the potential of the second Chamber. That is the idea behind this and I trust our statements will give an insight into how we perform, having regard to the restrictions we experience through no fault of our own and the limits we impose on ourselves, possibly through lack of change. The purpose of our statements should be to understand better the nature of impediments, delays, obstructions and obstacles that have penetrated the functions of the Seanad and which have had a harmful effect on its main purposes of scrutiny and control of legislation. It is important that Members of this House conscientiously use these powers and do not rubber stamp legislation. The Seanad could make its contribution more meaningful by having its own approach to procedures which highlight its constitutional intention. There is no reason a committee could not examine the constitutional parameters within which this House operates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, we must clearly and openly state what the difficulties are, where they lie, how they arose and where the blame lies for the diminution of our purpose and role. It is incumbent on us to ensure that our collective statements show the public that we are conscious of the need for vast improvements and experimentation and that there is a sincere desire to pursue courses of action which will bring about an improved performance having regard to the present day requirements of any legislative body. We should also be seen to offer, in a <Col N="681" /> willing and united manner, our view on the value we place on such a review of the working of the Seanad for the 54 years of its existence so as to facilitate considering the type of reform that might be most effective and which would allow the Seanad to function in accordance with its present day requirements. Obviously, to obtain the best results such a review should not be undertaken by parliamentarians. One of its main questions would be, has Seanad Éireann matched up to its constitutional parameters? The latter, in my view, cries out for attention.</P>
    <P>Having stated the idea I would like to accentuate the concept of being true to ourselves. Of the statements so far delivered, some have expressed mixed feelings, some have been very direct and some have been on the defensive. Our purpose was not to go on the defensive but to own up to our deficiencies, because as far as I am concerned going on the defensive will not contribute to improving the role or function of the Seanad and certainly will not help to satisfy the public perception of the Seanad. Going on the defensive we will certainly not demonstrate that we are interested in showing political will, or showing that there is among Senators a serious thought about moving in the direction of pressing the Government to deal with the question of making the Seanad measure up to its present day requirements.</P>
    <P>Dealing in the first instance with this question and without attempting in any way to avoid taking some responsibility for some of the circumstances we find ourselves in, I admit that Seanad Éireann is not functioning as an effective legislative body in accordance with what the Constitution intended and has not been doing so for some considerable time. I referred earlier to the need to be honest with ourselves. In an effort to do so, I submit that the following points constitute obstructions, impediments, delays and obstacles that have had an ongoing effect in making Seanad Éireann subject to the scorn of some of the media and public &mdash; and I emphasise the word &ldquo;some&rdquo;. Obviously, the intention of the <Col N="682" /> Constitution was not that Seanad Éireann would be compelled, as is the case, to approach legislation in the same dull, mechanical way as in the Dáil but that there would be additional expertise in Seanad Éireann with emphasis on parliamentary scrutiny and control.</P>
    <P>I quote Article 18.7.1 of the Constitution in support of that point:</P>
    <P>Before each general election of the members of Seanad Éireann to be elected from panels of candidates, five panels of candidates shall be formed in the manner provided by law containing respectively the names of persons having knowledge and practical experience of the following interests and services, namely:</P>
    <P>(i) National Language and Culture, Literature, Art, Education and such professional interests as may be defined by law for the purpose of this panel;</P>
    <P>(ii) Agriculture and allied interests, and Fisheries;</P>
    <P>(iii) Labour, whether organised or unorganised;</P>
    <P>(iv) Industry and Commerce, including banking, finance, accountancy, engineering and architecture;</P>
    <P>(v) Public Administration and social services, including voluntary social activities.</P>
    <P>That Article of the Constitution is clear in its intent to get expertise working in the Seanad. Obviously, the support is there for the argument I made: that the Constitution intended that the purpose of bringing people into the Seanad with expert knowledge and practical experience was to ensure that legislation brought before the House would be subject to the application of that expert knowledge and practical experience for the purpose of improving the legislation through greater scrutiny and control &mdash; in other words, greater scrutiny and control would be the end result in the Seanad by virtue of that special knowledge and practical experience. Obviously, it was <Col N="683" /> also intended that the knowledge and experience would be applied to matters of an urgent, public nature. If not for those reasons, why does the Seanad exist?</P>
    <P>It is clear from the Constitution what was intended, why the expertise was brought here and what its purpose was. The question we have to ask ourselves is this: has the question of scrutiny and control been applied in a proper way or have the impediments, obstructions, delays and obstacles that we have encountered diminished in some way the actual function and role of the Seanad or its overall general effectiveness? It was never intended in the law or the Constitution that the Seanad would be repetitive when a Bill comes before it, or that it would proceed in the same mechanical way as in the Dáil. For instance, why is it that we cannot or do not refer some Stage of some Bills to a special committee on a particular area where it could be processed in greater detail with the right of this committee to call in departmental officials, etc., and report back? The Constitution does not say we cannot do this. Perhaps the fault lies with our own lack of use of Standing Orders or our failure to change Standing Orders. Here I would like to quote Standing Order No. 84 (1):</P>
    <P>When a Bill has been read a second time, it may be ordered to be considered in Committee of the whole Seanad on a day then named, or be referred to some other Committee.</P>
    <P>The most relevant part is paragraph (2), which says:</P>
    <P>The Seanad may on motion made without notice commit the Bill to a Committee of the whole Seanad in respect of some of its provisions and to a Special Committee in respect of other provisions. If such a motion be opposed the Cathaoirleach, after permitting an explanatory statement from the mover of the motion and from a Senator who opposes the motion, may, if he thinks fit, put the question thereon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> That does not exclude the idea at some stage when a Bill is brought into the Seanad, of some part of it being referred without debate to this select committee, or portion of some particular Stage of it. That is my reading of it; but I am open to argument on it. I believe that was the intention. If it was not, why then go to the bother of making sure there is this specialist knowledge and expertise available to the Seanad through the panel system? Yet we do not make use of this facility of referring legislation to a special committee to have a look at a certain aspect of a Bill that would require teasing out and would need to be looked at in detail.</P>
    <P>The second point I would consider to be in the category of obstacles, delays, obstructions, etc, concerns the Seanad's right to reject Bills. The history of Bills rejected in the Seanad, and delayed even for a limited time of 90 days, is deplorable. In its 54 year history only about four Bills have been rejected. They were rejected only for a time; obviously they went to the Dáil and were passed. I could only find Bills being rejected twice, but I believe about four were rejected. The two I found were the Third Amendment to the Constitution Bill, 1958, and the Pawnbrokers Bill, 1963. This denies the intention of the Constitution on the matter of scrutiny and control.</P>
    <P>The history of Private Members' Bills getting to the Statute Book is limited to about one in the lifetime of a Seanad. I do not know if there are any more. If there are, I would like somebody to tell me about them. That one Bill I discovered had to do with animals. I am not suggesting for a moment that animal legislation is not good legislation or that anything to do with the protection of animals is not good legislation. What I am suggesting is that the idea of a Private Members' Bill not getting on the Statute Book is not in keeping with the spirit of the Constitution as it was intended for the Seanad. The tabling of a Private Members' Bill is a very constructive process. The reason I would describe it as a constructive process is that it draws more attention to an issue than a general <Col N="685" /> motion. A Private Members' Bill does not lend itself to inconsequential debate. On the other hand, general motions can become just a lot of talking for the sake of the record with no real decision resulting.</P>
    <P>The third issue that falls into the category of impeding, obstructing or delaying is, for example, Seanad Standing Order 29 which deals with emergency motions. These are not encouraged because of the limitation in that order on what constitutes a matter of urgent national importance. The very limited way in which the Seanad can act with immediacy on matters of public interest requiring urgent consideration can therefore be included in this category of the Seanad being impeded, obstructed or delayed because of the inflexibility of Standing Orders. I am not referring in particular to the Government; we may all be guilty in some way, and I will deal with that later.</P>
    <P>In regard to Standing Order 29, dealing with a matter of urgent national importance, the inflexibility extends to the Cathaoirleach, because he is bound by the Standing Order. No matter how sympathetic the Cathaoirleach would wish to be, he cannot do anything about it because the Standing Order has to be interpreted in a certain way. We must ask if we have looked at the Standing Order sufficiently. Is it not a fact that the Seanad is a more appropriate place, and has more time on its hands than the Dáil, to deal with a matter of urgent national importance? In regard to some of the rulings that have been made during the years on what was or was not a matter of urgent national importance, is it not true that matters subsequently came to this House, even though they did not originally get on to the floor for debate? Standing Order needs to be looked at. Its purpose is not being served if this House cannot utilise the expertise and special knowledge brought to it from vocational bodies.</P>
    <P>I come now to the fourth point. In my view Seanad amendments to Government legislation have not stood up to the test of political substance down the years in either the volume of amendments <Col N="686" /> accepted or the type of amendment. I was referring in particular to the quality of amendments accepted. More often than not, if an amendment is accepted it is of very minor importance in the overall legislation. I recall that we did see amendments accepted to the Stock Exchange (Completion of Bargains) Bill. I recall that the late Senator Alexis FitzGerald got ten amendments accepted to that Bill and then went on to be successful in having the Title of the Companies Bill, 1977, changed but these are the exceptions. The overall acceptance in respect of quality and volume of amendments does not stand up to the test of political substance.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty I see, which in itself is an impediment and obstruction and draws fire on the Seanad as being a weak body, is weak Ministers. A weak Minister does not help because he does not comprehend what he is introducing and he does not have the strength to say no to the civil servants advising him. We all have seen this here from time to time and on such occasions one does not know whether one is addressing the Minister or the civil servant. On the other hand, we must give credit to the good Ministers. When somebody like the late Senator Alexis FitzGerald is able to get ten amendments through, it means the Minister concerned is a strong person. He knew what it was all about and what the final consequences for the Bill would be if he did not agree to the amendments.</P>
    <P>I come now to the fifth point. There is some justification for the view held by the public and some Senators that the Seanad is a playground for political parties. Let us be honest with ourselves. The fact is it is used to enhance the chances of former budding TDs. We should not be afraid to admit this to ourselves and to the public at large. What we should not do is to play down these facts or go on the defensive. When all the debate is over and we are having an impartial examination, this may be one of the things we will have to look at and decide whether it has been a contributory factor to the impediments, obstructions, delays, or obstacles I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> Nothing can be left out. It is all there for examination. It would be naïve to think that the architect of the system did not want it any other way. Who would? The architect of the system was not going to risk Bills being held up for 365 days when he could get away with 90 days and ensure that his Bills would get through anyway. This point merits some future scrutiny together with the other points made, and those about to be made. The reality is that the panels have been taken over by political parties. That does not make the whole case; there are many other points for examination. I have set out about five of them now and I go on to point six.</P>
    <P>Party politics have entered the University panel by virtue of some University Senators taking the party whip. This, of course, has some bearing on the argument whether the Seanad should be strictly vocational. A point of interest here is that no Senator is elected on the basis of being an executive director, a general secretary or a branch secretary of a trade union; nor is he elected on the basis of being a University lecturer or the head of a faculty. I am suggesting that election takes place on a political basis. It will be argued that perhaps they are not political in the sense of not been completely synonymous with party politics, but the argument still holds that people are not elected because they are professors, lecturers, etc; they are elected because their constituents are convinced about them as people.</P>
    <P>The constituents want people who can articulate their, the constituents', views. They want people capable of processing the issues that are peculiar to the University people. Also they look to the national appeal the candidate can generate. We must acknowledge and appreciate that the Univesities down the years have brought a high calibre of person into the Seanad. There is no doubt about that. We have had wonderful contributions from many of them, but the fact is that some of them come into the Seanad with a political bias. If they do not actually transfer into the political system, <Col N="688" /> there is nevertheless some political bias in some of their expressions. There is political bias in the way they get elected in the sense that people want them to be able to express their constituency interest.</P>
    <P>I make my observations on this point in the hope that this question will not be excluded from any review we undertake in the future. The fact that the party whip has been taken by Senators over the years cannot escape some scrutiny as to whether it is a contributory factor to the impediments, obstructions or delays that have helped to keep the Seanad role less than adequate for its present day requirements. In my view it is in the same category as the points we have gone through. Therefore, I think it should be open to examination, depending, of course, on the type of examination we finally agree.</P>
    <P>Another area of our behavioural patterns that can be considered to come within the category of obstructions, etc. is the amount of tiresome technicality and trivia we experience in the House. We probably do not feel it is our fault that this happens, but it is noticed by the media and therefore must be considered as aggravating the weaknesses of the Seanad and its functions, particularly when we have regard to the other points raised. I would describe that as point number seven.</P>
    <P>Making the eighth point, another difficulty experienced is that Standing Orders are so designed that we must follow the same dull mechanical procedure as the Dáil. I make this point because Standing Orders have had the effect of silencing very brilliant people. That is a problem. Obviously, Standing Orders need to be looked at, if not by us then by some detached or non-parliamentary body.</P>
    <P>The ninth point is the difficulty we experience by reason of the insecurity of tenure. For example, when the Seanad adjourns <i>sine die</i> nobody is sure when it will be called back. This is largely because Governments have made it dependent on how they proceed, or what they decide is happening in the Dáil. If this was not the <Col N="689" /> situation, it would facilitate the processing of more Bills through this House, or more Bills could be initiated here. In this way the Seanad would play a bigger part in the legislative process. What adds to the insecurity is that, by and large, we are confined to assembling just for Government business. That also is an impediment to our giving the best possible performance. The low proportion of non-Government business dealt with obviously follows on from that.</P>
    <P>The tenth point that fits into the category for examination is this and in saying this I do not want the Senators on the Government benches to get the wrong slant on this. I am not going out for an attack or anything like that, but I am seriously concerned that there is a need for change, that we need to have a look at ourselves and openly admit to ourselves where we see the deficiencies. That does not necessarily say that everything is wrong, and I will be covering that point before I conclude.</P>
    <P>Over the years I have seen many Senators on the Government Benches &mdash; and it did not matter which Government were in &mdash; who showed very substantial opposition to some of the legislation brought before the House. I have listened for hours on end to exchanges between people on the Government benches and Ministers going through the pros and cons of a Bill sometimes in a lighthearted manner and sometimes with heated exchanges. It is not a question of saying that some were sacked; at the end of the day they walked into the voting lobby. It is very important that Government Senators are not silenced because many of them have very good contributions to make in relation to legislation. There is possibly an underlying fear there that this is not the right thing to do but any strong Minister would understand that he or she was getting the best deal possible out of that type of exchange, provided they did not have the crippling experience of some walking through the wrong lobby. That is a legitimate way of contributing.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the late Alexis FitzGerald earlier, and former Senator Eoin Ryan, Senior, was another example of people <Col N="690" /> of high calibre. When he was Leader of the House he had no problem about telling a Minister where difficulties lay and having an exchange with him. The situation was the same when John Horgan was Leader of the Labour Party here and also Ken Whitaker, the late Senator Fintan Kennedy and, not least, President Mary Robinson when she was a Senator.</P>
    <P>There were incidents where people lost the Whip but it was for different reasons. We had examples such as Michael Mullins and Christy Kirwan who were seriously opposed to many things. They lost the Whip but it was because they voted against legislation, not because they spoke against it. That is the difference. There are very able Senators in the Government party. They can make a substantial contribution and they should think seriously about this. We are open to criticism. We are having a good, hard look at ourselves in an honest and open way and we should not be afraid to face certain facts. The saddest thing of all is to see brilliant people silenced not by Ministers but by Standing Orders.</P>
    <P>I have made ten points about why I feel the Seanad has lost some of its effectiveness. In doing so I do not think I have shirked the blame or let my colleagues do so. However, we cannot just accept the criticism and blame; we must move on and do more to show how effective Senators and the Seanad can be. We must examine the impediments, delays, obstructions and obstacles that hinder the Seanad.</P>
    <P>We should recognise that we are no different to those in Government. It appears to a large proportion of the public that a few dominate the many. We have all heard the accusation: &ldquo;You are all in it for yourselves&rdquo;. We are talking about the public perception of the function and role of the Seanad. We must not allow this to continue. It is well within our capacity to reform and it is incumbent on us to be honest and to recognise our difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is one thing to say we should go ahead and take action to try to bring about substantial improvements in how <Col N="691" /> we operate and in how we might change our attitude but it is another thing to implement what you think will work. For example, we do not know at this stage whether we can change Standing Orders in such a way as to make the Seanad more lively and relevant. Since all five Stages of a Bill have a definite purpose it is not possible to say whether the mechanisms we use to deal with Bills in this House and in the other House can be changed.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to talk about reform. One must weigh up the concept of this House being very strongly vocational as against the political necessity to proceed in a certain way. It is not for us to suggest at this time that we are sure the best thing to do would be to reinforce the vocational element. As I said earlier, this debate is a kind of speculative investigation which needs deeper consideration. I do not believe that politicians collectively will be willing to change too much. Would it be possible at this stage of the debate to say that there is a collective agreement that after 54 years of operation of the Seanad there should be a review of our workings? We cannot say that with any authority at this stage. Can we say that a wide-ranging examination will be undertaken based on what has been stated? Can we say to any great effect that we will examine one House having regard to the fact that a relationship exists between the two Houses? We can say that with our approach to procedures we can make some improvements. Can we assess whether we have matched up to constitutional procedures? That may be a little more difficult to do. Can we allow the Seanad to contribute to contemporary Ireland by changing Standing Orders? Will that work? We want a greater opportunity to contribute to contemporary Ireland. It can and should be done.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Seanad can be reformed without endangering the Government's mandate to legislate but there must be the political will to do so. Senator Norris believes it is not there. I am not sure it is that simple. Substantial statements have been made and there is <Col N="692" /> a lot of material to be digested. I reserve judgment on the question of political will. We can argue both ways; we can talk about the political will to do it the way we think or we can talk about the political will to make sufficient change to enable us to progress to the point where we measure up to the present day requirements of a legislative body.</P>
    <P>Are Standing Orders the real culprit? Do we share the blame or are the Government at fault? No matter what way we look at it, we have obstacles to overcome. We must begin even if it is only on an experimental basis. The question of whether Seanad Éireann has lived up to the role envisaged for it in the Constitution cries out for consideration. I am not suggesting that, arising from this debate, that will happen but it is a serious point for consideration.</P>
    <P>We all know that, in the minds of some people, Seanad Éireann is irrelevant to Irish life but that view also existed 54 years ago when the Seanad was established. The Seanad can and does make a very substantial contribution to legislation. I have criticised the workings of the Seanad as have other Senators, but as a result of this debate we have a very substantial pool of information and a lot of advice available to us.</P>
    <P>I hope the Seanad will proceed with this debate and when it has concluded that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will examine the points made. A lot of thought will have to go into how to bring about change having regard to the complexities of the two Houses and the difficulties of the political parties, the universities and the different panels blending together. There is no reason it should not be done because we have the ability to do it. Senators can make a substantial contribution to the nation, particularly by scrutinising legislation that comes before us, as was intended by the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very proud and honoured to be a Member of this House. It is a matter of public record that I contested Dáil elections as did many other Senators. Be that as it may, I fully <Col N="693" /> respect and have a great regard for this House. I believe in this country and in the insitutions of democracy. Ireland is a great nation and I am proud to support its political institutions.</P>
      <P>Seanad Éireann went into recess on 17 July, 1991. We returned to business in late October. Many things happened during the summer recess both at home and abroad. Problems arose in relation to the public finances, the employment situation became particularly difficult and sectarian killings in Northern Ireland continued. Abroad, there was the revolution in the USSR; civil war was threatened in Yugoslavia and, of course, we had the alleged business scandals here at home. Since our return in October we have spent three weeks debating the role and usefulness or otherwise of Seanad Éireann. It seems that we will discuss this issue next week also. In fact, we have spent three weeks justifying our existence. This is hugely ironic. That is the background to this debate.</P>
      <P>The Seanad is now faced with major challenges. We need to establish if we are to operate on a similar basis to the Dáil or if we are to be a carbon copy of the Lower House. This debate is about creating for ourselves a definite, separate and distinctive role. The justification for our existence depends on the successful outcome of the debate and on appropriate Government action following this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made earlier about the renewed Programme for Government lasting from 1989 to 1993. The section dealing with Oireachtas reform states that the Government consider that reform of the Oireachtas is an essential prerequisite to carrying through a legislative programme of reform and to make it work relevant and effective for the people of Ireland. Some Senators have regretted that no specific mention was made to Seanad Éireann in his programme. I do not take this view and I believe many other Senators do not take this view either. Were the Seanad <Col N="694" /> specifically mentioned it would be in the context of its abolition given the presence of the Progressive Democrats in Government, and that is something of which we should be very conscious.</P>
    <P>Many people are calling for Seanad reform. Any proposed reform should not involve a referendum because I am not sure the people fully realise what we are about in Seanad Éireann and we should think long and hard before initiating a public debate in the context of a referendum in relation to Seanad Éireann. We have to change the public perception. I spoke on this issue in the Seanad on 4 June 1987. In that debate I pointed out that people were calling for the abolition of the Presidency. That has now changed. The media and the people in general have found a new interest in the Presidency and we need to ask why. Of course, there is a new incumbent in that office.</P>
    <P>We must find out why the media do not take the Seanad seriously and rectify the matter. Like the Presidency, this need not involve constitutional change. What is the traditional role of a secondary Chamber. Most legislations have secondary Houses. They act as a further check on Government. They set out to improve Bills and amend them. They act as a revising body. In this Seanad Éireann is no exception. The Seanad plays a smaller part than the Dáil and has a subordinate position. That is beyond question. However, the relatively inferior position of Seanad Éireann is common enough throughout the world.</P>
    <P>There are many good things one could say about this House. Important issues have been raised exclusively in this House, during my experience here at any rate. Time and time again Ministers have come into this House to deal wih urgent matters raised particularly in Private Members' time. These issues were not raised in the Dáil. In addition, individual Senators have brought particular issues here. Again, these issues have not been brought to the attention of the Dáil. <Col N="695" /> Senator Norris has done a lot in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the standard of debate in Seanad Éireann is better than in the Dáil; party political considerations are less dominant here than in the other House, the style is less combative. That is an important feature of this House.</P>
    <P>It is also important to examine the history of the Seanad and the history of a secondary chamber in this country. Under the Irish Free State Constitution a provision was made for an Upper House. This was largely to accommodate the Unionist minority. That was a noble objective at the time. Then came the 1937 Constitution. There is no doubt that Eamon de Valera was particularly interested in the issue of vocationalism. It is suggested that the ideas of Pope Pius XI influenced him in that regard.</P>
    <P>Basil Chubb in his book <i>The Government and Politics of Ireland</i>, on page 212, states: &ldquo;de Valera recognised that the country was not, in fact, sufficiently organised on vocational lines to allow direct choice by vocational bodies&rdquo;. In addition, de Valera did not want a body that would be likely to oppose the Government of the day. That was the dilemma he was faced with and so, for better or worse, we got the current Seanad and the current electoral college.</P>
    <P>The Seanad electoral college has been criticised in the past. As everybody here knows, 43 Senators are chosen from panels of candidates having knowledge and practical experience in certain interests and services. Nominations are allowed from appropriate voluntary associations but because the electoral college is itself composed of elected representatives chosen on a party basis, party political rather than vocational considerations predominate.</P>
    <P>Basil Chubb goes on to suggest that the prestige of the Seanad suffers from the fact that, by and large, it is merely another selection of party politicians <Col N="696" /> chosen in an unnecessary complicated and not particularly democratic manner. I would take issue with him on that. What are the alternatives to the electoral college we have at present? At the moment, I would be very slow to change the electoral system. Direct power, for example, could be given to vocational groups. I suggest that could be open to abuse. Under the current system, democratically elected people elect the Senators by secret ballot using proportional representation with the single transferable vote. Any alternative system would need to be looked at very carefully.</P>
    <P>Many Senators have criticised the fact that the Seanad is dominated by party politicians. Party politics is essential to democracy. Political parties mobilise the electorate at election time. They put up posters and supply personation agents. That should not be lost sight of. Senator Hederman went to great lengths to criticise party politics and party politicians but what is the alternative? Independents could not mobilise the electorate in the same way as political parties. I do not think there is anything wrong with the Seanad being dominated by party politics. It is essential to democracy and to the operation of politics in this country. I say that to redress the balance in relation to Senator Hederman's contribution.</P>
    <P>There are many ways we could improve the workings of this Seanad. We need more Government commitment to this House. I refer to the present Government and, indeed, previous Governments. We need the Government to recognise the importance of this House. We need to have more Bills initiated here. That would generate greater public interest in our proceedings and, in particular, would generate more media interest. That is a simple matter. It would not take much to implement and yet it would increase the prestige of this House substantially.</P>
    <P>Time and time again we have raised the affairs of the EC in this House and we need to carve for ourselves a special <Col N="697" /> role in relation to EC affairs. Perhaps, thought could be given to structuring the proceedings of this House so that everyone would know that Seanad Éireann has a particular expertise in EC affairs. That is something we could set about doing.</P>
    <P>Another issue is the Order of Business. At the moment, Senators feel compelled to raise all sorts of issues on the Order of Business because there does not seem to be any other mechanism with sufficient flexibility to allow them raise important issues. Perhaps the possibility of a Question Time could be looked at or allowing more flexibility in relation to matters being discussed on the Adjournment. We need to allow Senators to raise important issues and issues of local concern quickly and efficiently. I do not think that would be difficult to bring about.</P>
    <P>The Seanad should pay particular attention to cultural affairs and, as I mentioned in relation to EC affairs, we need to carve out a role for ourselves in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes with concern the cost of motor and liability insurance; and requests the Minister for Industry and Commerce to take urgent steps to remedy the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I declare my interest in this debate. I have an interest both as an insurance broker who worked within the insurance industry from 1956 to 1968 before starting up my own insurance brokerage and also as a public representative. The problem of high levels of insurance premiums has been mentioned to me both as an insurance broker and as a public representative. Within the last 48 hours I attended a meeting where the question of the high cost of motor insurance in particular for young <Col N="698" /> people was discussed at length. At a meeting of the General Council of County Councils some months ago in Ennis a long and very similar discussion took place.</P>
    <P>Insurance premiums for motorists employers' liability and public liability are very high in this country for many reasons. We have become a litigious minded race and there is a high level of claims consciousness in this country. Secondly, the number of accidents on our roads and in the worksplace has increased over the last number of years. Thirdly, the cost of settling claims has increased dramatically and fourthly, the very high number of uninsured vehicles on our roads contributes's to premium costs.</P>
    <P>I share the concern of insurance companies operating in this country, a concern shared by the general public and indeed by the Government on this question. In my 23 years as an insurance broker the possibility of young drivers getting a quotation, not to mention a reasonable premium, has never been as bleak. It is a well known fact that motor insurance premiums are higher in this country than in most other European countries, and not merely for young drivers. Internationaly, young drivers constitute a high risk group for the purpose of motor insurance and their premiums tend to be well above average as a result. In general male drivers constitute a higher risk than female drivers. Consequently young male drivers pay the highest premium of all.</P>
    <P>In relation to any risk group the premiums are largely determined by the claims experience of the group. Unfortunately Ireland has a particularly high accident rate which results in the large number of claims in proportion to the number of insured vehicles on the road. We also have relatively high levels of compensation for personal injuries, high vehicle damage and repair costs and high legal fees. These combine factors result in a high average cost of claims compared to other countries. The combination of <Col N="699" /> high average claim costs and high accidents and claim frequency results in very high total claim costs. These costs have to be funded from premiums and dictate the rates charged to policyholders whether old or young.</P>
    <P>It should be stressed that even with these high motor insurance premiums, I have been informed that the insurance industry has made substantial underwriting losses in recent years. In 1987 the loss was £33 million, in 1988 it was £49 million, in 1989 it was £116 million and an estimated £130 to £140 million in 1990. It is clear, therefore, that the premiums currently charged are inadequate to meet claims and expenses, even though they are extremely high for young drivers in particular.</P>
    <P>To some extent insurance companies are partly to blame for some of their current problems. During the period form 1987 to 1989 excessive competition prevailed in the motor insurance market resulting in rates being depressed to uneconomic levels at a time when both the number and the cost of claims were rising. Insurance companies made substantial losses, as I have outlined, in order to place their business on a sounder financial footing and have had to increase motor insurance premiums very significantly during the past year. Unfortunately it looks as if further increases will be necessary in the year ahead.</P>
    <P>When we look for the reasons insurance costs are so high in this country compared to most other European countries, three basic issues stand out. Firstly, we have more accidents per head of population than other European countries. For example, in motor insurance, the number of people killed on our roads each year expressed as a percentage of the number of registered vehicles is double the UK and significantly higher than most other European countries. Secondly, we pay accident victims substantially more in compensation than do most other European countries. I read <Col N="700" /> recently of a victim who lost the sight of one eye having compensation for pain and suffering in this country estimated in the region of £83,000 to £85,000 whereas in the UK for a similar injury the victim would receive approximately £30,000; countries like Portugal and Greece the figure would be in the region of £3,000 to £5,000. A whiplash injury in Ireland would cost the insurance company in the region of £15,000 to £18,000; in America a whiplash injury entitles one to $4,000 to $5,000 only.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the cost of motor insurance is exacerbated by the national level of uninsured driving which is significantly higher than most other European countries and is currently estimated at between 6 to 8 per cent of the total number of registered vehicles, whereas the average in Europe is less than 1 per cent. I mention these points as practical reasons for the continuing high cost of motor insurance premiums, especially for young people.</P>
    <P>The cost of motor insurance in Ireland cannot be reduced unless and until we decrease our accident rate and reduce also the level of compensation paid to accident victims. We cannot have a substantially greater accident rate than most other European countries, pay subtantially more compensation to our accident victims and yet expect insurance companies to sell insurance at prices comparable to other European countries.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that with the right commitment from the relevant authorities significant progress can be made in reducing our road accident rate. During the major Garda clampdown on drinking and driving during December 1990 the number of road deaths was reduced by almost a third. I am glad that this campaign will be repeated again this December and I congratulate the Minister for Justice for doing so.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to change the attitude of road users towards road safety generally. There is evidence that the public favours stiffer action against those <Col N="701" /> who drink and drive. The insurance industry, through the Insurance Federation, has recently launched in conjunction with the National Safety Council a major publicity campaign costing about £200,000, which will, I hope, change the attitude of the public towards road safety and towards law enforcement generally.</P>
    <P>The task of reforming our legal system and reducing the high level of settlement claims in Ireland is much more difficult. Previous attempts to change the legal system through the abolition of trial by jury has not led to expected savings in legal costs. In addition, the level of damages awarded by judges sitting alone are higher in many cases than those that were given by juries. In the past number of years insurance companies have proposed many reforms with a view to reducing premiums. The Courts Bill &mdash; which abolished juries &mdash; was one. Another was the rule to remove the necessity for two Senior Counsel and another introduced restricted fees for Junior Counsel. There is no indication that these innovations have served their purpose. Instead, the level of insurance premiums has gone up, particularly in the case of young drivers. It has been very strongly suggested to me that under the present system awards issued by judges are higher than in the pre-Court Bill days.</P>
    <P>The high cost of public and employers' liability is adding enormously to the costs of industry, including retail and wholesale outlets, payment of tradesmen, builders and many other enterprises. There is no doubt that jobs are lost due to the excessive cost to public liability and employers' liability premiums. Local authorities in particular are very badly hit. Boards such as health boards, vocational education committees and other local authority bodies are finding the burden of public liability premiums in particular extrememly onerous. All of them are experiencing great financial difficulty, and the high cost of public liability, in particular for county councils and corporations, has led in many cases <Col N="702" /> to dramatic increases in the rates. County Councils are at present examining this situation and I am informed that Limerick Corporation have been charged a premium this year in excess of £2 million for public liability alone. That has been reduced subsequently to £1.8 million. Cork County Council will be charged a premium of £1.5 million. My own county of Westmeath is being charged a premium of almost £0.25 million for public liability.</P>
    <P>In 1987 the company which transacts the business of most public authorities, the Irish Public Bodies Insurance Company, was obliged to introduce a £5,000 excess on every public liability claim. The bill for that first year of the £5,000 excess has now been handed to Westmeath and it is £41,170; and obviously that will grow larger each year. Having made the point about the Irish Public Bodies Insurance Company, I want to make it clear that I have great respect for them. They are a small company who are doing great work for the local authorities of Ireland and if local authorities were to seek insurance elsewhere tomorrow I do not think they would secure it as efficiently and as expertly as with the Irish Public Bodies. I have been a long-time friend of the Irish Public Bodies Insurance Company; indeed Senator Honan is a director of that company and knows its business affairs very well.</P>
    <P>Recently a high level of fraudulent claims was disclosed. The number is growing constantly and is causing serious concern. I have been informed many times of the famous incident where five men in this city fell into the same hole on the same night after leaving a pub and they were all far from their road home. People in the Irish Public Bodies Insurance Company could reveal hair-raising stories of fraudulent claims. Local authorities are vulnerable to such claims on public liability insurance and this, of course, has a bearing on the cost of insurance.</P>
    <P>A new system will operate after 1992 <Col N="703" /> when European companies will be allowed to compete fully in this country but there is a naive view abroad that this development will produce a miraculous drop in the cost of insurance in Ireland. The advocates of that point of view seem to be unaware of the fact that by European standards the Irish market already has the highest foreign penetration level of any insurance market in Europe. Over 75 per cent of the total premium income generted in the Irish market is now controlled either by branches or subsidiaries of overseas companies. Most major European countries already have a presence in the Irish market.</P>
    <P>Much could be done to improve the insurance situation. Strict enforcement of the laws regarding seat belts would help as would compulsory checking of cars. Further information and further checks on safety in the workplace would help. Additional reform of the legal system would help, as would the introduction of minimum fines for uninsured drivers. The Garda should have power to impound uninsured vehicles. All of us have a role to play in reducing insurance premiums whether as legislators, policy holders, members of the insurance industry or Government.</P>
    <P>The decision to set up an inter-ministerial committee on motor insurance is a clear sign the Government recognise the problem of high insurance costs and that it must be addressed as a matter of priority. We must all support any proposals which will reduce the number of claims and thus enable insurance companies to bring down the cost of insurance for Irish policy holders, and in particular for young drivers. It is clear, however, that if insurance costs are to be reduced the inter-ministerial committee will have to take a number of very difficult decisions if we are to achieve a substantial improvement in our accident rate and reduce the level of compensation paid to accident victims.</P>
    <P>Insurance is an issue in which I have a <Col N="704" /> particular interest. I accept fully that we have problems regarding motor insurance and public liability and liability generally. I recognise the unfortunate position that insurance companies find themselves in: if they do not get in the premiums they cannot pay out the claims; hence they are forced to charge high premiums. I recognise that we have a role to play and I am looking forward to hearing what the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, has to say to us this evening regarding this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I have been interested in this question for a long time because I feel very hurt and annoyed at the way young drivers are being dealt with by insurance companies. Unfortunately it is the most industrious minded who get themselves a job and are prepared to work who find they cannot insure a car to take them to work. Very often they endanger their lives and jobs by hitching, and the wage or salary is not sufficient to pay for accommodation in the town where they are working. The present high cost of motor insurance militates against an industrious young person who wants to work but needs a car to do so.</P>
      <P>In February 1989 the underwriting criteria for accepting young drivers was age 17 with or without a full licence. The car had to fall into a particular group of up to 1300cc which includes Ford Fiestas and similar type cars. After applying the relevant loadings for age, licence, etc., the maximum premium the person would have to pay was £700 plus the Government levy of 3 per cent. In June 1989 the general insurance rates were increased by 4½ per cent; in August 1989 they went up by another 4½ per cent and in February 1990 they went up by 14 per cent bringing the maximum premium for young drivers to £1,000, plus 3 per cent Government levy for a Ford Fiesta type car. In August 1990, the young driver premiums went up to £1,100 and in December 1990 that figure went to £1,240.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="705" /> The underwriting criteria changed to the following: in order for Guardian Royal Exchange to quote the insured must have had some record of having driven under a Guardian Royal policy &mdash; I think there is no harm mentioning them. One would have to be a driver with their company before they would quote you at all, which made it impossible for many to get a quote. In May 1991, maximum premiums increased to £1,470, two months' wages for any young worker. That is the rate at which insurance costs have risen &mdash; from £700 in 1989 to £1,470 at present. How can anybody justify that? However, that is not all.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in obtaining a quotation for female drivers is not as great as for male drivers. The maximum premium for third party insurance for females is only £940, so, as we try to eliminate sex discrimination, we find insurance companies discriminating against young men by charging them £400 more than women drivers. That is unjust as they are all youthful drivers.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Guardian Royal Exchange insurance company the only other company prepared to offer a quotation to young drivers at the moment is the PMPA &mdash; and Guardian Royal Exchange own the PMPA. To approach Irish National one must be over 30 years of age and have two years' no claim bonus; the situation is similar with the Hibernian Insurance Group. Other insurance companies such as ICI and the Norwich Union apply the same criteria. In order to be insured with Church and General, one must be over 30 with one year's no claims bonus. How can one have a no claims bonus if insurance is not obtainable in the first instance? To be insured with Shield Insurance Company one must be 25 years of age with two years' no claims bonus, and for Sun Alliance one must be over 28 years of age, with one year's no claims bonus. Those are the facts about insurance for young people; it is becoming impossible for them to get insurance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> Guardian Royal Exchange issued a document referring to the age of drivers, driving records, medical records, etc., and I agree with some of it. Insurance is loaded against people engaged in the following occupations: betting shop proprietor, market trader, general dealer, cattle dealer, casual traders, hawker, horse dealer, taxi driver, gaming club proprietor, bookmaker, professional sports persons, including jockeys, boxers, etc., scrap merchant, turf accountant, etc. Where is this going to end? How many people will be put out of work if present rates continue to rise and if this type of system continues? Proposals from musical groups or their members, are discouraged; bands give a great deal of employment but the music industry is being discriminated against for insurance purposes. This official list identifies proposals from members of the armed forces of other countries, proposers or any driver engaged in the entertainment business, radio, television or film personalities as insurance risks to avoid. Who gets reasonably priced insurance when you exclude those I have mentioned?</P>
    <P>In this list Ireland is divided into five different areas. I suppose we are not as unfortunate as we might be in rural areas because a young driver can get insurance there at £1,470 but in Dublin the premium is £1,750 for owners of group two cars, small 1300 cc cars with the bare minimum right to the road, and for third party fire and theft policies.</P>
    <P>Significant loadings are imposed on young drivers: for a driver aged 17-20 there is a 150 per cent loading with a provisional licence, a 100 per cent loading with a full licence and a full licence taken out today must be held for 12 months before it is recognised as such by an insurance company. A full licence held for 11 months and 29 days, is a provisional licence and will incur loading at 150 per cent; the full licence must be held for over a year. A driver aged 21 with a provisional licence incurs a loading of 115 <Col N="707" /> per cent with a full licence and 75 per cent with a full licence; 22 year old's incur 90 per cent loading with a provisional licence and 50 per cent with a full licence; at 23-24 years it is 80 per cent with a provisional licence and 50 per cent with a full licence; at aged 25-29 a provisional licence has 50 per cent loading and a full licence has 20 per cent loading; from aged 30-70 there is a loading of 30 per cent for a provisional licence and no loading with a full licence. Many of us on this scale will start being loaded again when we reach 70 years of age in a few years time.</P>

      <P>I have another six years, but it does not take long to come around. They are getting us at both ends of the scale. Given the present situation it is time we took a serious look at the insurance business.</P>
      <P>Why is insurance so high? It is amazing that in Beleek a car can be insured for about one third of what it costs in Ballyshannon. No one can tell me the driver in Fermanagh is better than the driver in Donegal. I have cited those figures before in relation to cars. It is another part of the imbalance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our system is terribly wrong. We have passed Bills to cut down on the number of legal representatives in court and to stop the use of juries in these cases, but still, the cost of insurance is not coming down. In fact it is rising. Insurance companies are to blame for much of this. For example, a car stopped quickly in front of a colleague of mine who was going to a meeting and he stopped and skidded. There was little damage to the cars but the other driver got out and said: &ldquo;You had better be well insured&rdquo;. He said he was and the other driver then said: &ldquo;You had better be. There are a number of whiplash cases in this car&rdquo;. Somebody in the back of the car then said his hand was injured. That person went to the doctor, <Col N="708" /> who could find nothing wrong, even looking at X-rays. The insurance company refused to contest the case and paid £5,000 to settle it against the wishes of my colleague. This was a case where absolutely no claim whatsoever was due.</P>
    <P>Somebody referred recently to ambulance chasing. Some time ago, at a meeting of our own organisation, I said that something would have to be done about this &ldquo;no foal no fee&rdquo; system. Now legal people are advertising to represent any claim at all. I would like to issue a word of warning. I met somebody recently who went to a solicitor and was told he had a claim. The case was contested and he lost. His solicitor did not charge anything but the defendant's solicitor charged him and he finally had to pay £17,000. Claims should not be paid in lump sums, but so much annually. Claimants should be checked every year to see how they are getting on because people claiming do not recover as quickly as people who are not claiming. The long wait destroys them and by the time they get the money and repay the banks they do not have very much left.</P>
    <P>We also passed a Bill although it was not brought into operation, and if there was an accident and victims were brought into a hospital a blood test could be taken and the result made available to the Garda who could prosecute if the driver had been drinking. The present position where, once the person has been taken into an ambulance the Garda cannot take any action should be reconsidered. There are many claims involved.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to look at this serious problem. Our own young people in the Fianna Fáil organisation made a study of this subject because the youth of this country are crippled by insurance, employment is suffering, and it is time we did something about it.</P>

      <P>At the outset I wish to inform this House <Col N="709" /> on developments regarding the Inter-Ministerial Group on Motor Insurance. The group's report, which was endorsed by the Government in July of this year, identified a comprehensive list of measures which have the objective of improving the environment for insurance. While the group's work was primarily concerned with motor insurance costs, those of its recommendations which are designed to impact on the cost of personal injury compensation, particularly the legal costs associated with such compensation, will, it is hoped, have a positive impact on the cost of settling all personal injury claims, including those claims covered by the employers and public liability insurance. The agreed measures identified by the inter-ministerial group have already been communicated to the Dáil and, indeed, have been announced by the Ministers who have responsibility for their implementation.</P>
      <P>I consider that it would be helpful to this discussion to give a summary of the more immediate measures. The motor insurance claims rate in Ireland is one of the contributory factors to the present level of motor insurance premiums. This claims rate has shown a close correlation with the motor accident rate in terms of the rate of road accidents as a proportion of the number of licensed vehicles on our roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an effort to reduce the road accident rate, the gardaí are maintaining strict and sustained enforcement of the road traffic laws, particularly breaches of the drinking/driving laws. Road traffic deaths showed a decline of 11 per cent in the period January to August 1991 on the comparable figure for 1990. Similarly, accidents which involved injuries declined by 10 per cent. In addition to the need for stricter enforcement of existing road traffic laws, the Minister for the Environment is preparing a major amendment to the Road Traffic Acts, which will include provisions for an increase in the minimum disqualifications <Col N="710" /> from one year to two years for dangerous or drunken driving convictions. Disqualification would be subject to review by the court after 12 months instead of the present six months; convicted drivers would be required to repeat the driving test; the introduction of a mandatory disqualification period for those convicted of drunken driving; the impounding of uninsured vehicles where proof of insurance has not been produced to the Garda within ten days of a request for same; a reduction in the permitted blood alcohol level; breath testing and closing of loopholes in drunk driving legislation, etc. The Minister for the Environment has already launched a road safety awareness plan as part of the road safety campaign by the National Safety Council which receives substantial funding from the Irish Insurance Federation.</P>
    <P>In an effort to encourage safer driving by young drivers in particular, the Department of the Environment have invited the national association representing driving instructors to formulate proposals for the establishment, by the association, of a register of driving instructors. A crucial aspect to this initiative will be the adoption of criteria for driving instructors, including improvement of the content of driving lessons, in consultation with the Irish Insurance Federation.</P>
    <P>The cost of personal injury compensation is a major factor in the current level of insurance costs, both for motor insurance and employers and public liability insurance. Initiatives by the Minister for Justice which should have a positive impact on the level of such compensation, in particular, the legal costs associated with personal injury claims, include the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1991, which was enacted on 16 July this year, increasing the monetary jurisdiction of the lower courts in civil liability cases. It is expected that the increase in the monetary jurisdiction of the Circuit Court from £15,000 to £30,000 should result in the Circuit Court dealing with <Col N="711" /> about 35 per cent of the personal injury actions which otherwise would be disposed of by the High Court, thus providing a saving in legal expenses. Also included are legislative proposals which will contain a number of provisions of importance to the objective of improving the environment for insurance, including the establishment of a court of civil appeal, with very limited rights of further appeal to the High Court, in personal injuries actions, an extension to the powers of the taxing master in an effort to re-introduce a degree of control on legal costs in personal injury actions, and giving power to the master of the High Court for the introduction of pre-trial procedures.</P>
    <P>The above initiatives, including an increase in the number of judges in the courts, should assist in enabling speedier court settlements of personal injury actions in addition to having a direct and positive impact on the level of legal and other costs associated with such actions. The impact of these measures and other proposed initiatives which are under consideration on motor and liability insurance costs will ultimately depend on the timing and extent of their implementation and, most importantly, the attitude of the insurance industry, the legal profession, other professions, including doctors, and the general public including businesses, employees and road users.</P>
    <P>I have to say at this stage that while the road accident figures have shown a decline in the period 1 January to 31 August this year, the current rate of improvement is not quite as impressive as in the first six months of the year. Continued improvements in road safety, and even a stabilisation in the motor insurance claims rate, require co-operation of all road users and particularly motorists. In addition to the important life and health aspect of road safety, road users must appreciate that greater attention to safety on the roads is essential if <Col N="712" /> the objective of improving the environment for motor insurance is to be achieved.</P>
    <P>In relation to the achievement of greater safety in the workplace, employers and employees should cooperate with the National Association for Occupational Safety and Health. Again, improvement in the law and the enforcement of the law needs to be accompanied by a greater awareness on the part of the general public of the need to sustain the improvement of safety standards and safety records. While the road accident statistics and data on the motor insurance claims rates are already well documented in the public domain, I would like to draw the attention of Senators to the fact that the claim numbers in the liability insurance area have increased in recent years, for example, from 21,100 claims in 1988 to 23,100 claims in 1990. Clearly, if the claims rate keeps rising we must expect the insurance costs to rise also. Thus, the need to stress the need for greater attention to safety on the roads, in the workplace and in public places.</P>
    <P>While the claims rate is a significant factor in motor and liability insurance costs, I would like to turn now to the question of the level of compensation in personal injury cases. The Government are endeavouring in the courts system to ensure that a speedier, more efficient and less costly method of settling personal claims is made available. It is now clear that initiatives which go beyond the objective of the Courts Act, 1988, which abolished the rights of trial before a jury in personal injury actions are required if compensation costs and associated legal costs are to be stabilised, much less reduced. I hope the Government and the Oireachtas will proceed with legislative proposals. I must stress at this point that there appear to be constitutional limits to what can be achieved by amendments or improvements to the existing statutory provisions which impact on the cost of the resolution of personal injury claims.</P>
    <P>There are also other limits in the sense <Col N="713" /> that in a democracy Government policies and attitudes must reflect the values and aspirations of society in general. We cannot and should not expect that insurance costs will be stabilised or reduced when, at the same time, we as a society expect, and even demand, the level of personal injury compensation that now obtains. Indeed, I note that a recent report by the Consumer Association stresses the responsibility that motorists themselves have, not just in relation to road safety but also in relation to the cost of insured injury compensation.</P>
    <P>Research carried out by my Department suggests that the average cost of motor insurance claims in Ireland is considerably higher than in most of the other EC member states. Thus, it is not surprising that an EC-wide survey carried out by a French research company in 1990, based on a selection of family cars, found that Ireland had the highest third party motor insurance rates in the EC, while Irish comprehensive rates were the third highest. Individual insurers who operate in both jurisdictions have also cited examples where personal injury compensation in Ireland is considerably higher than awards made in the UK for similar injuries. In addition, it is expected that a consultancy report funded by the Irish Insurance Federation will shortly give further evidence that the compensation levels in this country substantially exceed those in the UK and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, the Irish economy and Irish social attitudes that must sustain and accept the level of compensation for personal injuries caused by accident in this country. The total cost to motor and liability insurers of claims is almost 3 per cent of GNP. While this claims cost includes the cost of property damages as well as the most substantial cost of personal injury compensation, it does not include uninsured costs arising from personal injuries such as some social welfare and health costs, nor indeed the cost to <Col N="714" /> the economy of production loss as a result of the inability to work because of injury. Can we really expect that our economy can sustain the current or possibly the even higher level of compensation, or will we continue to believe it is equitable to expect motorists and employers to continue to pay the level of insurance premiums that are economically necessary to sustain such levels of the compensation?</P>
    <P>The chairman of the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland, the MIBI, in his address to the annual general meeting of the Bureau on 13 May 1991 concluded that their ratio of the cost of some of the Bureau's personal injury cases to similar claims in the UK was 4:1. In other words, the experience of the MIBI suggests that personal injury compensation in Ireland can be up to four times the UK level. The chairman of the MIBI also drew attention to the incidence, mentioned by Senator Farrell, of whiplash claims in Ireland and the mystery that tends to surround the accepted extent of the injuries that result from suffering whiplash.</P>
    <P>The mention of whiplash brings me to the problem of spurious, dubious and sometimes fraudulent claims. Recent court decisions highlight the manner and perhaps the extent to which unscrupulous claimants seek to exploit the availabiity of personal injury compensation. This ongoing problem of spurious claims must be resolved. I have exhorted the insurance companies to do their utmost to resist these claims to the extent, if necessary, of providing available evidence which could assist the prosecution of wrongdoers in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is well known by now that insurers suffered substantial losses in the underwriting of motor and liability insurances in 1989 and 1990. Rather than dwell on the statistics there is, I believe, a limit to the extent to which insurers can realistically expect to recoup further increased losses should these occur. Indeed in some instances there is resistance on the part of policy holders, or in some cases inability to pay the increasingly high rates <Col N="715" /> that insurers consider necessary to sustain prudent underwriting. In addition, a motor insurer, albeit a company with a relatively small market share, recently announced it had decided to terminate the underwriting of motor insurance for the Irish market. This development serves as a reminder that the continuation of the present level of claims settlement, allied to the claims rate, may result in other insurers reviewing the desirability, from their own perspective, of continuing to provide motor or perhaps liability cover in the Irish market.</P>
    <P>As demonstrated by the resumé which I gave earlier on the measures identified by the inter-ministerial group, the Government have and will continue to bring forward initiatives designed to improve the environment for insurance. Although I have no statutory role in this regard, I would expect insurance companies to control those factors within their ambit so that inefficiencies in the insurance sector do not give rise to any unnecessary costs which have to be borne by the community as a whole. However, neither Government, individual Ministers, the Oireachtas nor the insurance companies can do it all. Clearly we need, as a society, to review our attitudes to safety and to the level of personal injury compensation.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by commending, for discussion during this debate, the fundamental issues I raised in this regard and I want to express my appreciation to Senators for raising this issue. It is a vital matter which affects the economy. We must ensure that we all take more care on the roads to prevent accidents in the first place.</P>
    <P>The points made by Senators Farrell and Fallon and others clearly show the claim rate in our jurisdiction is very serious. I am delighted the Seanad decided to debate this issue and highlight the situation clearly. My Department and <Col N="716" /> I are paying special attention to the contributions made in this House which will be of assistance to us in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear of the Minister's and the Government's concern about this ongoing problem.</P>
      <P>In 1988, I bought a car in Germany, insured it in Belgium and, in 1990, brought it back to Ireland. I insured it in Ireland with a subsidiary of the company I was insured with in Belgium. Although the car was two years older it cost two and a half times as much to insure it here as it had cost when I insured it, brand new in Belgium. A quotation I obtained in Newry for the same car was slightly less than one third of what I had to pay in Cork. But the problem was that the insurance certificate I would get in Newry would not be acceptable to tax the car in Cork.</P>
      <P>We have a serious problem here. While the Minister recognises it now, perhaps this is like the recognition of the Minister for Industry and Commerce some years ago when he said the cost of insurance would come down when we got rid of the jury system. In fact, the cost of insurance went up.</P>
      <P>Excellent contributions have been made here tonight by Senators Fallon and Farrell and I agree with everything they said. We must accept, however, that the responsibility for changing the situation is in the Government's hands. It is difficult but it must be done. I was lucky enough to be able to pay the increased insurance for my car in Ireland, but there are hundreds of thousands of young people trying to obtain insurance and they cannot afford it. Some of them have been unable to take up jobs because employers would not accept them unless they were fully insured, with a full driver's licence. I heard an employer in Galway, on the radio recently, complaining about this. He had found an excellent young man but could not take him on because of the insurance problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a compensation conscious <Col N="717" /> environment in this country now. This is disgraceful but we are not tackling it. Reference was made by a previous speaker to five people falling into the same hole, on the same night, in Dublin. I listened to the Gay Byrne Show where a young man admitted that he had planted himself in a hole in the road in Dublin and when he heard people coming he began to shout for help. He was lifted carefully out of the hole and taken to hospital. He later received and award of £2,500 from Dublin Corporation. Our best known broadcaster used the national airwaves, at the taxpayer's expense, to have a young man tell others how to defraud Dublin Corporation or any other corporation. Last week Bus Átha Cliath pointed out that insurance claims cost them £11 million last year, a rise of £3 million on the previous year. Only the Government can deal with such a situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon made the point that the derogation we obtained for insurance companies would not have made much difference. Perhaps this is so in the car sector, but why then did the Government had to ask for the derogation for their total non-life sector? It was a mistake. We should have allowed our drivers to go to Northern Ireland or elsewhere for their insurance certificates. That would solve the problem fairly quickly. Such certificates should legally be acceptable for taxation purposes. That would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Having received this frightening quotation for the car I brought back, I went to the insurance company, told them I was insured with their parent company and asked them what was going on. I was very quickly told that, because of the legal situation in Ireland, car insurance in Ireland costs at least £70 more than the cost per driver in Belgium, that uninsured drivers cost a further £20 per car and a further £10 was added for the problems created by the collapse of PMPA. Straight away there was a £100 difference between the cost of insurance in Belgium <Col N="718" /> and Ireland. This is intolerable and we are not doing anything about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to awards being four times as generous in Ireland as in Great Britain. I accept that awards are extremely generous. The Minister for Industry and Commerce admitted that some years ago, and promised that as soon as the jury system was abolished the matter would be rectified. The juries went, the judges took over these cases and the awards increased. Awards in this country are inconsistent as is sentencing for crimes. Judges require in-service training but they also need guidelines. In other countries, there is a figure set for particular types of injury, for example, the loss of an eye, the loss of a limb, or whiplash. Judges simply make the award that is due. Awards are now so generous that some people deliberately damage cars and make very substantial profits. They buy a secondhand car for little or nothing, insure it and get a friend to run into it with a tractor or some such thing. Such action pushes up the cost of insurance but, unfortunately, we seem to be incapable or unwilling to do anything serious about it.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon said, rightly, that insurance companies are very often unwilling to fight claims. This is because the legal costs would be greater than paying the award. Our problem is not unique. New Zealand, for instance and the State of Ontario in Canada had the same problem and tackled it. The Ontario plan was interesting. This is the information I was given:</P>
    <P>The Ontario protection plan is a new insurance system that balances the goal of affordable insurance with the need to provide swift, humane and adequate compensation in the event of an accident... The new plan is designed to keep automobile insurance rates as low as possible and to ensure that more of the premium dollar goes to those who need it most, those injured in accidents. If you are injured in an accident <Col N="719" /> you will be protected by the guaranteed benefits available under the new plan and in cases of serious injury you will continue to be able to sue for additional compensation. Serious injuries are those which meet what is known as &ldquo;the threshold&rdquo;. The threshold is defined as &ldquo;death, permanent, serious disfigurement or permanent serious impairment of an important bodily function caused by continuing injury which is physical in nature.</P>
    <P>The Ontario motorists protection plan also introduces a new approach to vehicle damage. It states:</P>
    <P>Under the new plan you will recover to the extent that you are not at fault for damage to your automobile and its contents from your own insurance company. For example, if you are 75 per cent at fault for the accident you would receive 25 per cent of your loss. If you have purchased optional collision coverage it will make up the other 75 per cent for which you were at fault.</P>
    <P>I will read the concluding paragraph of this long document:</P>
    <P>The new system is the Government's response to public concern that car insurance in Ontario was becoming too expensive. The new plan should help to stabilise costs and premia.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of positive action we need to take in Ireland. We simply talk, moan and groan about it. I wish we could implement something like that in Ireland because it is totally unacceptable that so many young people are unable to get insurance and that those who get insurance have almost to pay more for their first year's premium than they paid for the car. It is totally unacceptable that we have to pay three times as much for car insurance as those in another jurisdiction which we are so critical of at times, that in addition to the fact that we are already paying substantially more for <Col N="720" /> our cars than the British and the British, in turn, are paying substantially more for their cars than anybody else in the Community. We are caught in a situation here where the cost of motoring is prohibitive.</P>
    <P>Cars are no longer a luxury, they are an essential for most people, even for young people. We urgently need action to be taken on this. I sincerely hope we get it because if we do not we will become less and less competitive. The cost of insurance, both motor and public liability, will make it unattractive to locate industry in Ireland and impossible to continue doing business here. I plead with the Minister to make a stronger case to the Government to get on with it and do something about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate and the wording of the motion &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann notes with concern the cost of motor and public liability insurance and requests the Minister for Industry and Commerce to take urgent steps to remedy the position.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was a particularly bad year for general insurance with record underwriting losses in motor and liability accounts. The deterioration in the underwriting results meant that the general insurers in the Republic lost an estimated £167 million on general insurance during 1990 compared with a loss of £90 million in the previous year. New claims rose by 14 per cent. A complaint made against insurance companies is that insurance costs in Ireland are substantially higher than in most other European countries. We have had more accidents per head of population than most European countries. We pay substantially more out in compensation to accident victims. These amounts, of course, are determined by the courts, or the standards are set out by the courts. Ireland has the highest level of uninsured drivers in Europe. During the past decade the number of claims has increased dramatically and the population has become very conscious <Col N="721" /> of the legal aspect. The question must, therefore, be asked: are the courts too generous with damage's awards or too lenient, and do they make it easy for the plaintiff to succeed?</P>
    <P>Aside from the increase in the numbers of claims and in fraudulent claims, the main reason, I understand, why insurance costs are so high is that the level of awards to accident victims is much higher than elsewhere. It is quite clear that while policy holders are happy enough to see accident victims paid large amounts of compensation they are not prepared to pay ever-increasing insurance premiums. From the insurers' point of view it is clear that as long as we continue to pay our accident victims substantially more in compensation than most of our European partners, our insurance costs will remain significantly higher than in other countries, even if the number of accidents is reduced.</P>
    <P>Looking at the issues that confront the insurance industry in Ireland at present, one predominates all others and that is the high cost of insurance. The insurance industry has received adverse publicity over the past year following a number of significant increases in the cost of motor insurance. There is understandable concern at the high cost of insurance here and the insurance industry shares this concern on how to bring about a reduction in high insurance costs. The difficulty for the industry is that there is no direct control over the main factors which contribute significantly to the high cost of insurance. We do not police road traffic law. We do not determine the level of damages to be awarded to victims nor can we ensure that all motorists are insured.</P>
    <P>There is a naive view in certain quarters that the opening up of Irish markets to foreign competition will somehow produce a miraculous drop in the cost of insurance in Ireland. Those who advocate this point of view seem to be unaware of the fact that by European standards the Irish market has the highest <Col N="722" /> form of penetration of any insurance market in Europe. Over 75 per cent of the total premium income generated in the Irish market is now controlled either by branches of or subsidiaries of overseas companies. Most major European companies already have a presence in the Irish market. We are not talking about waiting for all these European companies to come here. They are here already.</P>
    <P>We must realise that no company would be foolish enough to accept business from Ireland at rates which are likely to incur substantial losses. The high cost of insurance here at the moment is dictated by the high costs of claims and, consequently, no insurance company whether based in France, Germany, the UK, or wherever they may be can afford to undertake business in Ireland at rates which do not reflect the underlying cost of claims in this country.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the courts probably encourages people to claim. It is difficult for large bodies and this was referred to by Senator Fallon; local authorities, semi-State bodies and insurance companies can hardly succeed in the courts at the moment. I will not further comment on that. It is generally known. I understand that solicitors are now to be allowed to advertise and I wonder how this will contribute to further costs.</P>
    <P>Senators from all parties who took a stand and opposed doing away with juries were criticised by colleagues and some of us were lashed by our leaders. What have we today? It was a mistake to do away with juries. We were told at the time it would reduce the cost of insurance but it has gone the other way. I would like to pay a tribute to the Irish Public Bodies Insurance Company who have all our lives insured. Since the foundation of that company they have covered local authorities, all health boards and vocational education committees and have played an extraordinary role protecting all those groups.</P>
    <P>This is a very important debate and I ask the Minister of State to convey our <Col N="723" /> concerns to the Minister, Deputy O'Malley. I know the Minister and the style in which he does things and I ask him to look closely at the high cost of insurance. Young people cannot get insurance. That is tragic. Young people lucky enough to have a job have been quoted £2,000 and over for insurance if they do not have a full driving licence. That is extraordinary in today's world. We talk about Europe and what should be done at Maastricht, yet we have one of the highest insurance costs in Europe. I request the Minister for Industry and Commerce to take immediate action on this and I am sure the Minister of State will convey my message to him. I support the motion.</P>

      <P>Who could disagree with this motion? We would love the price of everything to come down. It would be wonderful to pass a motion every week calling for the Government to take action to reduce the cost of insurance, excise duty, stamp duty on property and so on. The principle one agrees with but what is worth examining, I hope without any unnecessary filters of my judgment is the situation that pertains and what might contribute to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is indisputable that insurance costs here are dramatically higher than in other countries. One of the problems appears to be that we allow the loading of insurance costs which makes it very difficult for those least likely to be able to pay the high cost to get insurance. It is an indisputable fact that insurance costs are out of line. Incidentally, the high cost of car hire is largely a consequence of the high cost of insurance. I would love to know how insurance companies work out the charge for insurance for car hire fleets. Is it on the basis of historical records? One cannot but be sceptical if it is based on the number of foreign tourists involved in accidents that result in court cases which, in turn, result in the award of damages or in the agreement of damages between two insurance companies or <Col N="724" /> between a plaintiff and the insurance company.</P>
    <P>I would like to know if they have been asked to explain and justify the way they target certain groups selectively. One case I regard as a scam is where a married couple have one car between them. One of that couple ceases to be the insured person but continues to drive as a adult over 25 years and under 70 fully covered by the other person's insurance. If after a few years the couple buy a second car they will discover that virtually every car insurance company will treat the second person, who gave up insurance maybe ten years ago, as a newly insured person and will not allow any of the previously earned no claim bonus. That is an unchallengeable fact, I have it confirmed in writing. The principle is that if you were not insured for more than three years you lose your entire no claims bonus whether or not there were claims. I do not believe there is one scrap of evidence from the courts or of judicial awards to justify that. That is a classic example of the lack of refinement in many of the financial services in this country: if you do not know, you charge high.</P>
    <P>I can understand there are problems with certain groups, for instance, motor cyclists, because there are higher risks involved. However, there is no evidence to suggest that, in the example I gave, the person should be treated as a new case. I believe if you argue with them they will give you a different deal but their starting position is that you lose your no claims bonus because you stopped being an insured person.</P>
    <P>In my experience taxi-drivers must be experienced drivers. They obviously have a personal interest in preserving their car and safety because their livelihood is at stake. I am profoundly sceptical about the basis on which insurance companies argue their case. They argue their case for rates on the basis of lack of profitability. You are in an unprofitable enterprise either because your income is too low or your costs are too high. I <Col N="725" /> do not know why the costs of the car insurance industry are too high. It could also be because awards are too high. Maybe they are, I do not know. It could also be because they are inefficient and sloppily run with enormously large overheads. The suggestions made from time to time that there will be some sort of derogation from 1992 for the Irish insurance industry confirm one's suspicion that there must be something of a scam going on.</P>
    <P>I know that various Ministers have investigated this industry. I am not suggesting that it was not done with the best of intentions, but I am sceptical about the real degree of competition in the business. I am amazed every so often when suddenly somebody discovers a category which can be given special offers. It took them years to realise that it might be reasonable to suggest that a person who does not drink is a lower risk than a person who does drink. That is perfectly reasonable. The Minister of State is a lesser risk driving a car than I am and I say that quite happily. He will never succumb to the temptation to be in charge of a car while intoxicated. It is, therefore, perfectly reasonable and logical to argue that he should be charged a different rate of car insurance to me &mdash; not that I will do much out of the way on that score anymore. I am too sensible at this stage in my life to do things like that and what happened to my colleagues on my left and on my right taught me a lesson.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies then discovered that women were safer drivers than men. Not so long ago I heard an insurance company tell a woman, the joint owner of a car, that she would have to get her husband's signature. This was before we changed the law. It suggests to me that our insurance companies, particularly in motor insurance, have not had much of an incentive to go and look at the spread of risk. For instance, why do they not talk about different degrees of driving skill among young drivers? Why <Col N="726" /> do they not offer young drivers an incentive to develop their driving skills? Why do they pretend there is no difference between a young person who has been a named driver on his or her parent's insurance and a young driver who has no driving experience? It is nonsense to suggest that there is no difference between them. The insurance companies pretend there is no difference.</P>
    <P>It is like the classic case of the airline pilot where the number of hours solo flying one does determines one's degree of expertise, although one is also expected to have been a co-pilot. This means there has been a build up of experience. To suggest that a young driver who has considerable years of experience as a named driver on somebody else's insurance is the same in terms of risk as somebody who has not had such experience is nonsense. We ought to build into the pricing structure of car insurance incentives for young people who have documentable driving experience to underline the fact that they are not just raw recruits.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies are not market driven. I am not a great believer in market economics but one of the things I know about is that it never works. Adam Smith said 200 years ago when he developed his famous theory that you did not have a real free market unless no participant in the market was so big that his absence would affect the market. In other words, there had to be so many people in the marketplace for the departure of one of the alternative providers of a service not to affect the market. Does anybody believe that the departure of one of the major motor insurers would not affect the market? Of course it would. Therefore, we are not in a real free market. In effect, the insurance industry have a gun which they can put to the Government's head: we cannot make money, therefore we must increase charges. It is not politically feasible for a Government to carry out a detailed assessment of their claim.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> I agree with Senator Honan, not for the first time. I never believed that the abolition of juries would make the least bit of difference. I must be careful not to get into big trouble&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In determining an average judge's view of what is reasonable minimal compensation is liable to be substantially bigger than that of an average jurer because what a judge regards as a small sum is quite different from what an ordinary citizen with an ordinary income would regard it. Recently a relative of mine &mdash; I am delighted for her &mdash; was awarded more by an eminent judge than either the insurance company's solicitor or her solicitor sought. The figure her solicitor sought and the insurance company offered was actually less than the eminent judge awarded her because this man's view of what was reasonable compensation, like the rest of us, was influenced by what he was used to. It was always a bad idea and there is no reason we should not have cases heard by juries. There is nothing as good as public opinion to keep things under control. We would find that juries would take a more rational approach to what was an allowable level of compensation. If the damages awarded are excessively large&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The other side of the argument is to find out why we have a high incidence of road accidents with consequential court cases and why we have high insurance costs. Every person paying any kind of insurance in this country is paying for the PMPA debâcle.</P>
      <P>With the fortunate exception of the drink driving regulations, our rules of the road are unenforced. How many people take the speed limit remotely seriously any more? How many Members of this House or of the Dáil, including myself, would say conscientiously, with their hand on their hearts, that they watch the speedometer on an open road to make sure it does not exceed the official speed limit? For a long time I was not sure of the official speed limit. How many people travelling through small towns and villages actually slow down to 30 mph? Most people slow down from 70 mph to about 40 mph and find that so tediously slow that they cannot bring themselves to slow down any further. If you slow down to 30 mph you will have a queue of cars shooting past. If an impatient garda is waving you through a junction and you go through at 30 mph in an urban area you are liable to get very dirty looks from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="729" /> I do not think we take the rules of the road seriously. We do not take car safety seriously. We have a mixum-gatherum of rules which are rarely enforced. How often is somebody penalised for having bald tyres on a car, except when there has been an accident? The purpose of enforcing rules like the quality of tyres is to prevent accidents not to penalise people after there has been an accident.</P>
    <P>If you are driving from Dublin to Cork and meet one speed trap along the way, you can take it for granted you can travel at whatever speed you like for the rest of the journey because the chances of meeting a second trap are close to zero. We do not seriously enforce any of the rules of the road.</P>
    <P>In city driving people regard traffic lights as a delay rather than something that actually stops you and people, particularly cyclists and to a lesser extent motorists, ignore traffic lights. They judge for themselves on the basis of what traffic is coming whether they will break the lights. Look at the thousands of journeys people make every day and look at the small number of people who are prosecuted for not wearing a seat belt, for instance. This disrespect for the law results in an excessive number of accidents causing injuries and involving excessive costs for the average driver. There is sufficient evidence and considerable suspicion abroad that these companies are not efficient. We are urgently in need of what I regard as a necessary part of any coherent road safety policy which is an independent traffic police force established exclusively to enforce the rules of the road. This would save not only money but lives also.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - Courts Industrial Dispute.</Title>
    <Col N="730" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to have this opportunity to raise in the Seanad as a matter of extreme urgency the industrial dispute affecting the courts which is having a crippling effect on court procedures, probate, Land Registry and other significant matters. I thank the Minister for Justice for coming in here to respond to this Motion on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>This industrial dispute is most damaging because it deprives people of their constitutional and legal right of access to justice, a cornerstone of our democratic system and fundamental to the social and economic fabric of our society. I, therefore, call upon the Minister for Justice to avail of the services of an accredited and independent source, such as the Labour Relations Commission, to act as mediator or arbitrator in this dispute so that an immediate solution can be found. It seems intolerable that the Minister for Justice and his officials should refuse to sit down with a mediator to find a solution to this industrial dispute, a dispute which has been described by Donal Benchy, President of the Incorporated Law Society, as one of the most serious in the history of this State. This strike by 270 Circuit and District Court clerks, which is now in its 13th week, is already having a serious impact on several aspects of our daily life and there will be serious long term repercussions and irreversible damage caused unless the dispute is settled immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The magnitude of the detrimental effect of this dispute can be seen from the fact that all criminal jury trials outside Dublin have been suspended. Potentially guilty people charged with serious crimes are out on bail. Innocent people are being denied their rights. In most parts of the country, jurors have not been summoned for criminal trials and no list of cases has been printed. Without this calendar <Col N="731" /> claimants and their legal advisers do not know when a case will be heard.</P>
    <P>Applications for grants of probate and administration are not being processed outside of Dublin. Solicitors cannot gain access to the register of judgment mortgages and the bankruptcy register without the necessary documents being stamped. As a result it is impossible to check if the vendor of property is in a position to sell and this, of course, is holding up sales. Applications for bar extensions for special functions and annual applications for the renewal of publican and hotelier licences are all affected. Maintenance payments to spouses are under threat and some litigants may find that in the absence of documents being stamped the time limit has run out and their claims may become statute barred. In addition no new civil claims are being processed.</P>
    <P>This dispute will also have significant long term implications. Should this dispute be settled immediately it will take several months to clear the backlog of cases which has built up and the longer this dispute continues the greater the backlog will be.</P>
    <P>Very little separates the two contending sides. What is at issue certainly does not justify serious disruption of court work and procedures. The regrading of the administrative and clerical structure of the Circuit and District Courts is essential particularly in the light of their increased workload and higher responsibility as a consequence of the increased monetary jurisdiction from £15,000 to £30,000 in the case of the Circuit Court, and from £2,500 to £5,000 in the case of the District Court. Originally the disputing workers' trade union, the CPSU, sought regrading of 210 posts and the Department of Justice conceded 42. Now the union have reduced their demand to 79 and the Department have increased their offer to 62 posts. This means that a mere 17 posts at around 10 per week per post &mdash; a total of £170 per <Col N="732" /> week gross, or £80 per week net, or a mere £4,000 or £5,000 per year &mdash; stands in the way of settlement.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, I believe, has the responsibility to ensure that an efficient and adequate court service is provided to the public. He should now have recourse to the services of an independent mediator such as the Labour Relations Commission to act as a mediator or arbitrator in this dispute. The case against the Minister has been put clearly and impartially by the President of the Incorporated Law Society, Mr. Donal Benchy. Without taking sides in this dispute, he said that the Government should be setting an example and not claiming that normal labour relations procedures do not apply to them. In the words of <i>The Cork Examiner</i> editorial of 5 November 1991:</P>
    <P>It is a fundamental principle of labour relations that if an employer and a union fail to agree they should have recourse to the assistance of an accredited and independent source. This action is all the more important if the failure to call in a body like the Labour Relations Commission results in a strike which seriously damages the general interest.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I believe the Minister for Justice and his officials should now sit down with a mediator to find an immediate solution to this problem which is wreaking disastrous effects on many aspects of Irish life. The Civil and Public Services Union have already applied to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for an all-out strike and unions involved are currently putting their various members to a ballot. A majority vote of the aggregate membership would have an immediate effect, the disastrous consequence of which would be the closure of our courts. I, therefore, thank the Minister for coming in here this evening and I hope it will be possible for him and his officials to have recourse to the assistance of an <Col N="733" /> independent arbitrator. Senator Cosgrave is sharing my time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Kennedy for allowing me some of his time this Adjournment Matter which is of the utmost importance and urgency. I welcome the Minister to the House and thank an Cathaoirleach for allowing us to raise this matter which we have tried to raise on several occasions, both an the Adjournment and on the Order of Business since the Seanad resumed some weeks ago. The courts' industrial dispute began in the middle of August, and is gradually leading to the closure of the courts system, the system of justice in this country. With a little goodwill on the Minister's part, the matter could be resolved.</P>
      <P>I support the request of Senator Kennedy to have the matter referred to some independent arbitrator such as the Labour Relations Commission or the Incorporated Law Society. If the Minister would prefer to use some other body, I do not think that would be a sticking point with the union. The important point is that talks commence immediately to prevent further escalation, otherwise within weeks if not days we could have an all-out strike and a breakdown of the courts system which I do not think the Minister would welcome.</P>
      <P>No summonses have been issued since mid-August and I understand that 10,000 summonses have gone missing, creating an intolerable situation. We had anticipated great improvements in the courts system; the people involved are hard working and industrious and have always given tremendous service, sometimes under terrible conditions. Some individuals on criminally low pay deserve a review of their pay and conditions. The Minister and his Department are obliged to ensure that our system of justice is fair, and is seen to be fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kennedy outlined problems in relation to probate matters and judgment mortgages; he mentioned that trials <Col N="734" /> which were set had to be cancelled because jury lists, etc. were not sent out. This situation cannot be allowed to continue; we must face up to the long and short term implications.</P>
    <P>The Minister must consent to use whatever measures are necessary to rectify the situation. If talking could begin, the situation might be resolved. It would be most undesirable to precipitate an all-out strike, with a closedown of the courts. As practitioners Senator Kennedy and I have encountered difficulties in relation to issuing of proceedings and difficulties obtaining information are holding up all sorts of matters.</P>
    <P>With goodwill on the Minister's side and a little generosity, talks could proceed. We do not want a further escalation of this dispute which affects 270 people directly. Before the situation becomes critical, someone must cry halt. The Minister has the power to do so and I have no doubt that with his commitment to changes and improvements &mdash; we have seen changes in jurisdiction in relation to the District, Circuit and High Courts &mdash; he does not want to see the new jurisdiction begin on such a disputatious note. It is important that the Minister and his officials discuss the matter and request the union to engage in talks before an arbitration body; I am sure an arbitrator acceptable to both sides could be found to adjudicate on the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy outlined various other matters which I do not wish to repeat. Without a breakthrough very shortly this strike will escalate. Some courts have already erected notices saying that no court proceedings are taking place and things are fast approaching a chaotic level. The strike, with goodwill, can be stopped and worse consequences averted. I appeal to the Minister to take whatever action is necessary to see that he and his officials have this matter resolved.</P>
    <P>I thank the Cathoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully and readily acknowledge the concerns expressed by Senators Kennedy and Cosgrave in relation to the disruption in the courts. I would like, once again, to express my deep concern at the disruption resulting from the industrial action currently being engaged in by clerical staff in the offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to assure the House that every effort was made by officials in my Department in the course of discussions with the union concerned to avoid this action. The stance adopted by the officials of my Department in the discussion was a most flexible and conciliatory one designed to avoid industrial confrontation in the hope that differences between management and staff sides could be negotiated away. This, unfortunately, has not proved possible but I have not given up hope that the dispute may be resolved in the not too distant future. Both sides in the dispute are in contact with one another and certain proposals are being studied. My own view is <Col N="736" /> that the best hope of resolving the dispute lies in continued contact between the parties.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the House that every effort continues to be made to bring the dispute to an end. However, it would not be helpful or conducive to good industrial relations to conduct negotiations across the floor of this House or the Lower House and I hope Senators on all sides will share this view.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of my personal intervention, the position is that I am personally involved through my officials in resolving this dispute. My officials act at all times under my guidance and on my direction. They report to me on a daily and, in some cases, an hourly basis and keep me fully informed at all times of the position and of any developments in the present dispute.</P>
