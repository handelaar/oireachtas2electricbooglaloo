      <P>I have notice from Senator Hederman that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to review the charges for planning appeals and for oral hearings which are now a great burden for voluntary, community and residents' associations and are therefore preventing them from participating in the democratic planning process.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to include the coast road between Limerick and Tarbert, the N69, for investment under the operational programme for peripherality.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Dardis of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Disadvantaged Areas Appeals Panel to rectify the disproportioned exclusion of areas of County Kildare, compared to all other counties, under the extension of the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="598" /> I also received notice from Senator Raftery of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to give meaningful help to HIV positive haemophiliacs, who got the HIV virus from factor VIII which was supplied through the health boards.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Hederman, Neville and Dardis as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Hederman's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Neville and Dardis may give notice another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret that I have had to rule the matter raised by Senator Raftery as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of <i>sub judice.</i></P>

      <P>I would just like to raise the matter I raised on last week's Order of Business, that is, to have some indication of the programme of legislation from now until the end of the session so that people can make arrangements.

      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he would be prepared to make a small gesture to <Col N="599" /> acknowledge that today is World Environment Day by sending a message of congratulations to the newly-formed group who will do much to improve the environment of the capital of our country. I refer to the group People First Dublin Initiative, made up of a very diverse range of people &mdash; the National Trust, An Taisce, various institutes of architects, Iarnród Éireann, Dublin Bus, Trinity College, etc. &mdash; who intend to tackle the whole area of transportation in the city and I think they are worthy of congratulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I simply &mdash; I have already asked the leader on another occasion about Tibet &mdash; draw the attention of the House to the fact that it is almost two years to the day since the massacre in Tiananmen Square?  May I ask all those both in front of me and on the other side who celebrated with such enthusiasm the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe if they would direct their attentions towards what I think are their friends in China &mdash; they are not mine &mdash; and remind them that there are human rights abuses?  There is an Amnesty report available.  May I ask the leader if we could have a debate on the appalling continuing abuse of human <Col N="600" /> rights that is taking place on a daily both within the People's Republic of China and also within occupied Tibet?</P>
      <P>I welcome Senators Upton and Harte back and support them in their insistence that we should have a debate on the single greatest crisis this country is now facing, which is the spiralling rate of unemployment with all the damage that it will do.</P>
      <P>May I finally record &mdash; fairly dispassionately, I hope &mdash; my objection to the Order of Business as ordered?  I have been ten years in this House and I have never before been in a position in which I was given a specific time for when a debate on a Committee Stage was taking place and where that was changed without some attempt to consult with me.  I was told the Child Care Bill would be on from 2 p.m. tomorrow and the first I heard of it was when I received a letter yesterday afternoon through Senator O'Toole's secretary.  I am not used to being treated like that.  I am not used to having this House treated like that and I object in the strongest possible terms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I am objecting, as I understand is my right, to the Order of Business and I am simply explaining why.  I really think this has been ordered with all the grace, subtlety and finesse of a bull in a china shop, or indeed a bull that brought along its own china shop to have the operation in here. I really object very strongly.  I am tempted to object to the Order of Business, but, to quote the Leader of the House on another occasion, quite frankly I could not be bothered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to support what my colleague, Senator Ryan, has said and also, since I am in a supportive mood, I support what Senator Hederman, has said.  I have no personal interest in any local elections that are taking place.  Therefore, I think I can do it without any of these opprobrious suggestions attaching to me.  In view of the fact that it has been confirmed that Ireland is actually doing nothing whatever to mark World Environment Day, I think Senator Hederman's proposal is worthy of support.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he can give us an update on the question of the Foreign Affairs Committee, which is an item on the supplementary Order Paper.  Like many people, I am increasingly disquieted and I have raised this on several occasions. We are being fed information through the media.  The latest speculation is that the committee is being long-fingered because of a dispute between Deputy Haughey and Deputy Lenihan.  I would like to know if that is true or if there are plans to introduce such a committee and, if there are, I want to make certain the Seanad is centrally involved in it.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask if the leader will give time for a debate on the Middle East.  I will not be satisfied by replies from the leader saying we have already had one.  This is a radically different situation now.  We are in a situation in regard to the Kurdish people where, for example, some interpreters who have cooperated with the American and the United Nations forces are being hung out to dry, they are going to be left stranded behind and are going to be simply butchered by Saddam Hussein when he gets back in.  It is not good enough for us to think we have had a debate on the Middle East.  We have not had a debate on this aspect of it and I now call for such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like too, since World Environment Day was mentioned, to draw the attention of the House to the fact that this weekend saw World AIDS Day and that this is a continuing international crisis of very severe proportions.  Would <Col N="602" /> the leader entertain the possibility of once more having a debate on the subject of AIDS as it has an impact on Ireland, particularly as it is now clearly internationally established that the principal method of transmission is heterosexual intercourse and that this has been established in this country also?</P>
    <P>Finally, since last week we stood, very properly, in silence to commemorate the murder of a member of a political party, would the Leader of the House agree with me that it is now time that we stood in silence and in shame particularly at the prospect of a civil servant having her legs blown off in our name in the North last week?  I would like a moment's shame for the victims of violence frequently perpetrated in our name.  Statements which claim that violence are often issued from this capital city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is European Environment Day, I would like to say that in Sligo Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have agreed that they would not put any posters on telegraph poles or ESB poles.  We are putting them on billboards strategically placed.  Could I ask that all politicians follow our example right around Ireland in the interests of the environment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I enjoyed the interruption from Senator O'Toole on the demeaning of this House.  I do not wish to comment further on that.  We were discussing the environment and postering.  In Cork we had a call from Fine Gael that we would not have any postering and I find the countryside littered with Fine Gael posters.  I ask the Leader of the House, given the appropriateness of the day, World Environment Day, to advert to an innovation brought in by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1977 relating to the beach amenity grants and that out of 83 entries right around this coast 67 of them were granted the blue flag today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Independents have raised the question of World Environment Day, a very appropriate gesture for World Environment Day from this House would be if the Leader of the House would agree to impress upon the Minister for the Environment the fact that our natural environment is being marred and is ruined by the prevalence of potholes throughout the country.  Would the Leader agree that, as a gesture in honour of World Environment Day, our Minister for the Environment should commit himself to putting the county roads of Ireland in proper shape?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish someone would tell me.  On another and very serious matter, the matter of votes of sympathy has already been raised.  I am glad, because there has been something on my mind for a long time and I now have the opportunity to say it, since today we are not dealing with any vote of sympathy. When there is a vote of sympathy proposed in this House it is very difficult for anyone to oppose it.  You accept the vote of sympathy and you go with it.  I think it would be better for this House if votes of sympathy were passed only when there was the unfortunate death of a Member, because I feel it may well be getting out of hand.  There was one occasion here where there was a vote of sympathy and it aroused a lot of controversy afterwards. The vote of sympathy was justified, most of the words that were used that day were justified, but still there was a lot of controversy afterwards.  It would be better if we adhered to what I always understood to be the old tradition and just move a vote of sympathy when there is the unfortunate death of a Member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recalled &mdash; and Senators might find this of interest &mdash; that when Mr. de Valera died a vote of sympathy was proposed by the Leader of the House at that time, who was a Fine Gael Member, Michael O'Higgins.  I mention his party because there was another Michael Higgins here.  He was the one who proposed the vote of sympathy, but in doing so he said: &ldquo;I know I am breaking tradition,&rdquo; which he was, because he was proposing a vote of sympathy to someone outside the House.  However, it was an noble gesture on his part.  Everybody understood why the vote of sympathy was being passed, but he was breaking tradition and he excused himself.  I think we should go back to the old tradition.  With all the <Col N="605" /> unfortunate happenings in the North of Ireland on one side or another, every day we meet you will have a vote of sympathy to someone.  I think, with all respect, a Chathaoirligh that you might decide that we just go back to what was the old tradition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hanafin, in the light of what you have said I am prepared to take your views along to Committee on Procedure and Privileges and have them consider what is appropriate for the House to do in this particular regard.  Is that to your satisfaction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the interest in World Environment Day, I am tempted to ask the Leader of the House when he replies to the other questions on this if he would indicate what progress Senator McDonald's sunfiower seed oil engine is making, because we are all holding our breath in relation to that.</P>
      <P>One more parochial issue, when the Leader is replying to the various questions put to him in relation to World Environment Day I would like him to add in his votes of congratulations to the different bodies in Dublin and elsewhere that have been alluded to, a note of congratulations to Wexford County Council for the publication of an environmental magazine to commorate World Environment Day.  Could I add a note of cynicism in that I would hope that the agreements entered into between different political parties in relation to posters and our environment are motivated environmentally and not by the pocket. I leave that just said.  Providing it is environmental considerations I am fully with it, but I have a funny feeling that it is financial matters which are dictating the tune more than the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also agree with Senator Brendan Ryan in that I was told last week, by a very reliable source on the benches across from me, that the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill was being taken on the Wednesday.  There was a change around. I am not saying the Whips subsequently did or did not agree, but I was interested <Col N="606" /> in the schedule this week and I was specifically told that the Fisheries Bill would be taken today, which would corroborate when Senator Ryan said, that the Child Care Bill would then be taken tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole asked for some idea as to what the business might be in the short term.  Obviously, there is the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, as well as the Competition Bill and the University of Limerick Bill, three Bills which will be taken in the month of June.  In July Report Stage of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill will be taken. Senator Upton also queried the position of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.  He and others asked for a debate on unemployment which I agree is an important matter, but I have no plans for a debate on that particular issue.</P>
      <P>I have noted carefully what has been said by many of the speakers in regard to World Environment Day.  But this is not really appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan asked about a debate on Tibet and again I have to say I have no plans for that.  In regard to his comment and that of Senator Avril Doyle about the Order of Business, the Order of Business can change.  It does not change very much from what you get in your Whips' notice, but the proposal last week could well have changed in 24 hours.  That obviously is what has happened here and it has happened for good reasons.  It is not the first time, and I am sure it will not be the last time, that whatever proposals are suggested for the week following will and can change.  That is going on as long as I can remember.  I accept that it is disappointing; but it happens and I share the Senator's view on it.</P>
      <P>I have nothing further to add to the comment made by Senator Norris about the foreign affairs committee.  I have no proposals at this stage for a further debate on the Middle East, nor have I a proposal for a debate on the important matter of AIDS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matters were totally inappropriate to the Order of Business.  You, <Col N="607" /> a Chathaoirligh, have already referred to Senator Hanafin's suggestion, which I think is the way forward, to have discussions at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges regarding votes of sympathy.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
      <P>In page 17. subsection (2), Lines 14 and 15, to delete &ldquo;and give directions as to the performance of his duties&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to delete the words &ldquo;and give directions as to the performance of his duties&rdquo; in that we feel that to leave it as it is is too directive.  We feel it would be appropriate that the solicitor would use his discretion in dealing with the case and that he might bring in other child care-workers and experts.  It might be appropriate to call on the services of social workers, teachers, child psychologists, etc.  We think that to give actual direction to the solicitor in this case is too specific and is narrowing it too much.  I would urge the Minister to <Col N="608" /> and not narrow the options of the lawyer in this case.  I think it would be a helpful amendment and would improve the Bill. I await with interest the response to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This entire section has been very carefully drafted by the Attorney General.  I would be reluctant to change it in the way proposed in this amendment.  What this subsection provides is that where a child is made a party to court proceedings the court may if it thinks fit appoint a solicitor to represent the child.  Where it does so, the court may again if it thinks fit give directions to the solicitor as to the performance of his functions including directions in relation to the instruction of counsel.</P>
      <P>The need for this provision stems for the fact that the child himself may be too young or immature to understand fully the nature of legal proceedings, let alone to give instructions to counsel.  This provision enables the court to see to it that the interests of the child are properly represented and protected in the course of the proceedings.  The focus of this provision is on protecting the child's interests and in view of this I would ask Senator O'Reilly to consider withdrawing this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I would be reluctant to support Senator O'Reilly on this amendment.  I do not have the sufficiently elevated view of the competence and the committment of all members of the legal profession to be happy to leave them dealing with work like this without being under very careful scrutiny from the court to make sure that they carry out those duties with this sort of sensitivity and with the thoroughness, diligence and efficiency that would be required.  I would be quite happy to leave it within the power of the court to give directions to the solicitor appointed as to the performance of his duties.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is need for a person other than a solicitor to look after the interests of the child &mdash; there is no reference to this in this section &mdash; to represent the child's interese <i>vis-á-vis</i> the health boards and in all sorts of other areas in terms of the emotional well-being of the child, in terms of the needs of the child and also in other areas?  The phrase that has been used is &ldquo;a guardian <i>ad litem</i>&rdquo; and amendments in regard to it, as you know, were ruled out of order, probably quite correctly.  It appears to me perfectly reasonable to rule them out of order, but that does not prevent us from raising the issues now.  I would like the Minister to explain to us his own thinking on the issue of a guardian <i>ad litem</i> or whatever term he wishes to use.  A considerable body of professional opinion has been passed on to a number of us about this issue.  I do not think the reason for refusing if, or the reason for it not being here, is financial.  I accept that it is not simply a question of resources.  I accept that there may well be other arguments and I would like to hear them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that Senator Ryan brought this up.  A number of amendments that were ruled out of order were in my name.  I think it is appropriate to say a little bit here.  The Minister did indicate that he would take a look at this, and perhaps a Government amendment <Col N="610" /> might be forthcoming in this area.  There has been universal support of it.  I made some considered arguments on Second Stage and it would not be appropriate to repeat them here, but Senator Ryan is quite right when he says that there is room and a necessity for another person and such provision has not been made in this section.  After all, the courts system tends to be adversarial and in this adversarial situation the rights and well-being of the child can very often be lost which would be a great pity.</P>
      <P>May I also point out that there has been a developing court practice of justices appointing guardians?  This creates an anomaly because a person is appointed to a position that does not legally exist. The people appointed normally are psychiatric social workers, or child guidance people and so on, but it is interesting that case law is developing along this area so there is a kind of organic development within the court system although the position of guardian <i>ad litem</i> does not actually exist.  I join with Senator Ryan and I would be very interested to hear what the Minister has to say.  I hope that having consulted with his advisers and with people involved in this area he will introduce this clause himself as it is clear that an amendment of this kind is not contemplated for introduction in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I support this suggestion. Court cases may involve children of a very tender age who often display suprising maturity under difficult circumstances and it is essential that child care professionals be available to explain the situation to the child rather than a legal professional who would not have the same child care qualifications or professional understanding of the difficulties experienced by a child in these circumstances.</P>

      <P>I support this also.

This is important and could only be a helpful addition.</P>

      <P>My colleagues' worries are unfounded since the protection of the child is guaranteed in section 24 which we have just cleared:</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions on this section.  We cannot look at any section of the Bill in isolation; we must look at it in its totality. The thrust of the Bill is directed towards establishing a complete child care structure once the Bill is passed.  Section 3 (b) (i)  says that &ldquo;in the performance of its function the health board shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.&rdquo;  Again, when we come to the courts in Part V, as Senator Honan pointed out, &ldquo;the courts are obliged to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.&rdquo; We have discussed and given consideration to the guardian <i>ad litem</i> situation.</P>
      <P>Section 26 empowers the courts to bring forward any person it regards as having a contribution to make, involvement with, information relating to or any involvement of any type pertaining to any particular case or any individual child. We are fulfilling the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission that the child shall have a right to Be heard by the court.  That right is included in the Bill. The Commission also requested provision to be made for the appointment, by the justice, of an independent legal representative for the child where the justice is of the opinion that this is necessary and in the interests of the child and we are also fulfilling that request in a totally new departure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where other professionals are involved the court will have the right to call them <Col N="612" /> or any other person.  In order to be absolutely certain that the child's welfare is safeguarded and in view of what has been said here, I am prepared to have a further look at this situation and if appropriate I will bring in an amendment for Report Stage but I do not give any commitment that I will be able to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I welcome what the Minister has said displaying his usual open-mindedness?  In order to help him, might I indicate the kind of situation not covered by section 26 which allows for the procuring of reports and so on, and for the summoning of witnesses, but it does not provide for the presence of somebody in the court all the time to represent the interests of the child, which is a developing and invaluable practice, particularly with our nearest neighbour. While the Minister was speaking, one of the possible contradictions came to my mind where there could be a conflict of interest between the interests of the child as perceived by the child or the guardian on the one hand, and by the health board on the other.  Then the person appointed to adjudicate is a health board employee; a guardian ad litem would not be a health board employee.  I am not casting any aspersions on the professional capacities of health board employees but there are circumstances where a totally independent person to determine, to understand and the not articulate the point of view of the child has been found, in other jurisdictions, to be essential.  There has been a growing court practice of establishing such persons although without any legal role and I am very glad the Minister is looking at this again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been total support for this Bill from this side of the House &mdash; I will not call it the Opposition side because I do not feel that I am necessarily in opposition to the Government; last week on a number of occasions I had the pleasure of voting with the Government on a matter of conscience and I do not wish to be taken as automatic knee-jerk opposition.  The last time we spoke on this matter there was also noticeable support from the Government benches.  Virtually <Col N="613" /> all the professional bodies engaged in this area - I am not going to read out the list of about a dozen, the Minister is aware of them &mdash; have urged that a determined effort be made to have this guardianship <i>ad litem</i> provision implemented in our law.  I am grateful that the Minister is going to look at it and I hope there will be a positive outcome; it will only serve to strengthen the Bill which we all believe is a good Bill if the Minister finds himself able to introduce this amendment from the Government.</P>

      <P>I know how helpful the Minister is determined to be on this Bill and I do not want to waste any time on it but I would appeal to him when he looks again at this to remember that children need somebody to identify with. They cannot identify with systems or with institutions; children identify with people.  There is a considerable case for having somebody in court with the skills and commitment to build up a trust with a child; no solicitor could seriously be asked to do that given the nature of the task and the professional pressures they would be under.  There is a considerable case for the employment of another person who would not have the solicitor's burden of other work and who could win the trust of the child and become the person with whom the child would identify. I hope the Minister will think about this when he carries out his review.  I am very glad he is continuing to be as constructive and helpful as he was last week.</P>

      <P>With regard to amendment No. 44, there is a slight misunderstanding about sections 25 and 26.  No court proceedings will arise directly under either sections 25 or 26.  What these sections do is give the courts certain powers to assist them in dealing with proceedings arising under other sections of the Bill, for example, section 18 which deals with care orders and section 36 which deals with access to children in care.  As a result of amendments No. 32 and No. 43 the provisions of these sections will apply to proceedings arising under any section in Part IV or Part VI of the Bill.  I trust that this will clarify the position beyond any doubt and perhaps in view of that Senator Norris may wish to withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 18, subsection 3 (c), line 44, to delete &ldquo;transmits&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;is responsible for the transmission of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Nobody would dispute or disagree with the provisions of section 30.  Penalties are necessary because there are, unfortunately, considerable sections of the media, both nationally and internationally, who would take great delight in publicising what they would see as the juicy details of some of these issues.  My amendment concerns a difference in emphasis between penalties for the written word and penalties for broadcasters. Subsection (3) provides that in the case of publication in a newspaper or periodical, the person liable for penalty will be the proprietor, editor or publisher.  In the case of the broadcasting, the penalty applies to any person who transmits the programme, which is the broadcasting equivalent of penalising a printer, a person not in any way responsible for the publication, or for any of the words used. This goes back to a problem with the libel laws but we need not go into that now.  I do not want to argue about the wording of my amendment but a technician working up on top of Kippure or Mount Leinster or Mullaghanish and responsible for transmitting something that is in breach of section 30 should not be culpable under the law any more than a printer could be culpable and I would ask the Minister to accept either my amendment or one that is perhaps better drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ryan in this.  His case is very well made and could even be stronger because the wording is &ldquo;anyone who tramits or provides the <Col N="618" /> programme in which the broadcast is made and any person having functions in relation to the programme corresponding to those of an editor of a newspaper&rdquo;. The final section already takes in an area analogous to the proprietor, editor and any publisher of the newspaper.  When it says &ldquo;any person who transmits or provides&rdquo;, it covers not only the people Senator Ryan mentioned, such as technicians an so on, but also presumably people who relay programmes such as cable link companies and the various RTE services who relay these programmes by cable to the subscriber.  I do not imagine that is what the Bill intends. The Minister may wish to come up with his own wording but Senator Ryan's case is well made because you may be making people liable for the content of a programme when they merely service its, transmission without any moral or editorial responsibility which divorces this situation from other cases such as newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. The case is well made.  We have our learned Senators on the Independent benches informing and educating us on nuances of the English language but this is a straight forward case in that a person who transmits or provides a programme is usually the technician rather than the person responsible for the station or for the programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this provision is to protect the good name and reputation of children who through no fault of their own are involved in child care proceedings.  It seeks to achieve this by prohibiting the publication or broadcasting of any matter that would serve to identify such a child.  It would be an offence to act in contravention of this prohbition.  I am advised that an offence would be committed only by the person or body having charge of the radio or television station that wishes to do such a broadcast.  There is no question of a technician who physically causes the transmission to occur being held criminally liable.  I am impressed by the case <Col N="619" /> that is being made and Senator Ryan, with the support of the other Senators, may have touched on a grey area and in view of that situation it might be appropriate for me to consider this further.  If I feel we should make any further improvement on it I will come back on Report Stage with an amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>An issue which may arise when children are involved in court proceedings is the use of closed circuit television which has been employed in cases of sexual abuse and so on to protect the child.  I am worried that the term &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; as defined here could in future, without a little more subtlety on our part, be used to prevent the use of closed circuit television because broadcasting means the transmission or relaying of any sound system intended for direct reception by the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We went through the question of cable before with this Minister, and is he sure that transmission by cable is covered by that definition of broadcasting?  We had a long argument with some Minister here before about the term &ldquo;broadcasting&rdquo;, which is defined as &ldquo;relaying or distribution by wireless telegraphy.&rdquo;  I am not trying to be troublesome but in other countries cable television has been used in ways in which main stream non-cable television could not be used, particularly for the broadcasting of pornography as has happened in the United States.  As a caveat rather than as an argument I ask if we are satisfied that the transmission of material by cable is covered by the definition of &ldquo;broadcasting&rdquo;.  I wish we could be a little less confused with the English language: for instance, &ldquo;written publication&rdquo; is defined as including a film, sound track or any other record.  I am <Col N="620" /> never happy when the English language begins to be redefined for legal purposes in terms of anything other than its own reasonable meaning and would have been perfectly reasonable to use a different term there.  Is the Minister sure that computer-based records or computer-transmitted data are covered by his definitions?  These are not argumentative questions but bona fide questions that deserve addressing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I support Senator Ryan.  The commonsense meaning of &ldquo;wireless&rdquo; is clear and derives from the fact that it involved broadcasting without the use of cable.  Now we have a different system where limited mass communication by cable is possible.  That area has been properly developed by Senator Ryan and I am not going to go into it.  I would like to raise something quite different. The maximum fine of £1,000 seems quite small when one considers that obnoxious rags like the <i>Sun</i> would be delighted to pay £1,000 for a juicy story; it would not cost them a thought.  They frequently engage in slandering public figures knowing the price tag, which is sometimes a couple of hundred thousand pounds, so a £1,000 fine will not frighten them off particularly if the victim is a vulnerable child.  For that reason, I would like also to ask the precise import of section 30 (4) where it states:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this section shall affect the law as to contempt of court.</P>
      <P>Am I to understand that a parallel conviction could be incurred under the laws of contempt?  A more appropriate measure should be dealt out to people who violate the rights of children in this matter; I usually argue for the reduction of penalties in law but on this occasion I think a £1,000 maximum fine is not enough.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Ryan's view on this section.

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I had neither a discussion nor an argument with Senator Ryan on similar legislation pertaining to telecommunications or anything like that.  Perhaps it was my senior Minister; I am not sure.  On section 30 (5) the definition of &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; is the most up-to-date definition available as amended, updated and clarified in a recent Bill in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>It covers cable and all other methods of broadcasting but closed circuit television is not involved.  Line 12, page 19, states: &ldquo;reception by the general public&rdquo;, so closed circuit television is not involved.</P>
      <P>Proceedings will generally be heard in the District Court and this refers to the point made by Senator Norris about a fine not exceeding £1,000.  I agree with the Senator that there are organs who might like to pay a lot of money for certain stories but our laws cover only our own jurisdiction.  More importantly, these are the maximum fines that the District Court can impose.  However, if cases did go to a higher court, they would be able by summary jurisdiction, by the rights and powers vested in them to impose higher fines and penalties.  There is no doubt about that.  As most of these cases would be heard in the District Court the Bill must cover that, and if a case goes to a higher court on any particular issue, the higher court has the right to impose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister very gently mentioned to us the need to be consistent last week.  The penalties for failure or refusal to give up a child shall be a fine not exceeding £500 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months or both. Amendments Nos. 63 and 64, which we will be dealing with later, change provisions later on to make the penalty £500 and the term of imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.  I remind the Minister that we had a discussion on section 19 the last day which still provides for a penalty which does not exceed £250 for people who fail to comply with the supervision order.  Perhaps I can return the compliment about consistency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept Senator Ryan's very shrewed observance and the need for consistency.  However, in this situation we are dealing with a child and the people involved with that child.  We want it to be seen in the Bill that it is the human element we are attaching importance to. The other situation involves commercial companies who would break the law and the penalty is a fine of £1,000 or imprisonment for 12 months.  I hope we would not have a situation too often where people would not accept the will of the court and return the child.  We hope to get co-operation through negotiation and the production of various documents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not talking about the previous section.  I was talking about section 19 which deals with supervision orders and the fact that for a person who fails to comply with the terms of a supervision order the maximum penalty is a fine of £250.  The point I am making &mdash; and I think most people would agree with this &mdash; is that the first attempt always <Col N="624" /> should be to try to keep the child within his or her own home.  The penalty in that instance is less than the penalty for somebody who would refuse to deliver up a child.  Supervision orders are a major instrument in trying to ensure that a child remains within their own home, for instance the possible victim of sexual abuse.  There is a case for supervision of an intensive kind which protects the child from sexual abuse but keeps him within his own home.  Therefore, there is a case to be made for having at least the same penalty for somebody who fails to comply with a supervision order as somebody who fails to deliver up a child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I applaud the Minister's humanitarian bias and it is appropriate in many ways.  However, I share his concern that there should be humane values implemented in this Bill and a distinction drawn between a newspaper or commercial enterprise on one hand and the human individual on the other.  However, the damage that can be inflicted by a newspaper is limited to psychological damage, the kind of public image of the child and the distress that is caused.  In certain extreme cases like the Maria Cauldwell case, for example, if a child is not surrendered the result can be death. That is an extreme case but what we are talking about here is not the mandatory imposition of a fine but about the maximum, and a variation of gradation is possible within that maximum.  It is horrible to contemplate that parents would actually be responsible for the death of their own children but we know that this has happened.  If there is a situation in which on the one hand the result to the child can be deprivation of life and, on the other hand, simply the impact on the reputation and feeling of self-worth of the child, then the maximum fine of £1,000 is justified, taking into account the fact that the justice has discretion.  I am obviously making a substantially different point from the one made by Senator Ryan although I thought I was making the same point.</P>

      <P>We must consider the <Col N="625" /> case of a person being guilty of very violent conduct against a child and the same person also being guilty of not accepting the decision of a court.  They could be guilty on two different counts and liable to two different penalties.  Likewise, two people could be guilty of two different offences, one against a child and one against the decision of the court.  Senator Ryan has been consistent in pointing out that I am in favour of being consistent rather than inconsistent.  I want to be consistent again and will consider any inconsistencies that there are between the various penalties proposed in different sections.  In view of that I will consider the matter for Report Stage.</P>

      <P>In page 20, subsection (2), lines 29 and 30, to delete &ldquo;other than a relative of a child&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The definition of a foster parent as it stands excludes a person who is a relative from the definition of a foster parent. However, the Minister has introduced an amendment to deal with placement with relatives.  Unless I am wrong, it is almost identical in its wording to the section to deal with the regulations about foster parents.  I assume that the question of payment to relatives where they agree to take a child arises because it is not excluded.  Therefore, as a result my amendment is no longer necessary and I shall withdraw it.  We can perhaps leave it until the Minister deals with his own amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a certain amount of misunderstanding about this definition since it was inserted in the Bill on Report Stage in the Dáil.  I emphasise that it is not intended that the <Col N="626" /> option of placing a child who is in care with a relative should be removed from health boards.  On the contrary, paragraph (d) of subsection (1) makes specific provision for the placement of a child with a relative where the health board consider that it is in the child's best interests.  I might add that this is the first time that specific statutory provision for placement with relatives has appeared in our legislation.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that different considerations apply to the placement of a child with a relative than with a non-related foster parent.  That is why we have drawn a distinction between the two forms of care in drafting this section.  I reject, however, any suggestion that this distinction will extend to denying payments to relatives looking after children on behalf of health boards.  On the contrary, the next amendment, No. 59, proposes the insertion of a new section enabling the Minister for Health to regulate placement of children with relatives. One of the reasons for this new section is to ensure that relatives who are caring for children on behalf of health boards will receive appropriate payments from the board.  I think the Senator understands the position which is covered in the next amendment.</P>

      <P>I am not trying to play tricks but I have tried to understand the connection between section 36 (4) and section 4 (2).  Section 4 (2) states that without prejudice to the provisions of Parts III, IV and VI nothing in this section shall authorise a health board to take a child into care against the wishes of a parent having custody of him or any person acting in <i>loco parentis</i>.  Section 36 (4) states this section is without prejudice <Col N="627" /> to section 4 (2).  Can the Minister explain this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about section 36 (4) which states: &ldquo;This section is without prejudice to section 4 (2)&rdquo;. Section 36 states that where a child is in the care of a health board, whether by virtue of an order or otherwise, the board shall do certain things and facilitate reasonable access to the child by the parents or any person acting <i>in loco parentis</i> or any other person who in the opinion of the board has a bona fide or genuine interest in the child, and such access may include allowing the child to reside temporarily with any such person. It allows a person who is dissatisfied to apply to the court and the court may make various orders and may discharge those orders.  The court on the application of the health board, if it considers that it is necessary to do so in order to safeguard the child's welfare, may make further decisions authorising the board to refuse to allow persons named access and may do various other things.</P>
      <P>Section 4 (2) states, without prejudice to the provisions of Parts III, VI and VI, nothing in this section shall authorise a health board to take a child into its care against the wishes of a parent having custody of him or of any person acting <i>in loco parentis</i> or to maintain him in its care under this section if that parent or any such person wishes to resume care of him.  Basically, what we are saying there is that if the parents of the child or the people who are acting in place of the parents want to maintain that child in their care, the board are obliged to leave the child with them unless they make an application to the court to have a clear decision taken.</P>

      <P>40.&mdash;(1)  The Minister shall make regulations in relation to the making of arrangements by health boards under section 35 (1) (d) for the care of children and for securing generally the welfare of such children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that Senators did not get notice that these amendments were ruled out of order.  I regret that we had to come in here today rather than tomorrow.  My difficulty and the Government's difficulty is that I am charged with being in both Houses of the Oireachtas on two days, one after the other, to do Government business.  It seems that on account of that they decided I would be in the Seanad today and the Dáil tomorrow. I presume that is the reason for the change and I regret very much if this has created difficulty for any Member of either House.  I appreciate the commitment of the Senators present.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to close off a loophole that arose when section 35 was amended in the Dáil. Section 35 sets out the ways in which a health board may provide accommodation for children in their care.  It may place them in foster care, or place them in residential care, or place the child for adoption where he is eligible to be adopted, or make other suitable arrangements which may include placing the child with relatives.</P>
      <P>Sections 38 and 39 require the Minister for Health to make regulations in relation to the placing of children in foster care and residential care respectively.  The placement of children for adoption is, of course, subject to the various safeguards contained in the Adoption Acts. However, as this Bill now stands there is no provision for the making of regulations in relation to the placement of children with relatives.  This amendment proposes to insert a new section to plug that gap and it covers the amendment which Senator Ryan graciously withdrew earlier.  It is broadly similar to sections 38 and 39 and I hope we will have the support of the House for it.</P>

      <P>This is not an amendment on which I would like to delay the House too long. It is simply to reiterate a point that everybody agrees on, which is to take into consideration the long term needs of the child in terms of reviewing the cases of children in care.  The section as it stands says that the Minister shall make regulations requiring the case of each child in the care of a health board to be reviewed in accordance with the provisions of the regulations.  It seems to me and to a number of other people I have spoken to that it would be useful to reiterate that the review should take into consideration the long term needs of the child, the child's developmental interests and whether he will stay in residential care or foster care.  I am sure that is the intention of the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some sympathy with what is contained in this amendment and for what Senator Ryan has said.  One of the main purposes of this section and of the regulations to be made by the Minister for Health under the section is to ensure that the long term interests of children in care are safeguarded and promoted.  I would envisage the regulations providing for the drawing up of a plan for the future care of each individual <Col N="631" /> child and for the monitoring of his development.</P>
      <P>However, it must be borne in mind that children in care have short term needs as well as long term needs.  For that reason, I would be reluctant to amend the section in the way proposed.  However, I assure the House that the long term interests of the child will be a key consideration in these reviews and on that basis perhaps the amendment might be withdrawn.</P>

Why is it impossible to insert some reference to that into the section, not necessarily the amendment I put down, but some reference to the long term interests of the child?  Is there a drafting or legal problem? I accept that it will be in the regulations. If this Minister or his immediate superior Minister &mdash; he will not be the one who will be drafting the regulations because he has now moved on to different things, I think I would prefer child care to prisons myself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have an open mind on this.  I envisage that reviews would be carried out by health board staff, Department of Health officials and the child care division.  Reviews would be carried out at the request of the Minister for Health and he would have the right &mdash; and I am sure that will be encompassed in regulations although it is vested in him in some part of the Bill if not in some of the powers that are conferred on him &mdash; to have an independent assessment carried out by a group of people or organisation independent of the health services. Section 66 covers the powers of the Minister for Health.  In section 66 (2) the Minister may cause to be inspected any service provided or premises maintained by a health board under this Act.  The Minister will have discretion to decide the type of inspection to be carried out and who should carry it out.  I am sure if the Minister felt that it was necessary to have an independent person or group or a particular group controlled by an independent person, a member of the Judiciary or some professional organisation or whatever, he would have that right.

      <P>The original draft of this section provoked a lot of controversy, particlarly among foster parents, who saw it as a threat to the security of their foster placements.  As a result of representations which I received from the Irish Foster Care Association, I brought forward a number of amendments in the Dáil in order to allay these fears and to provide a fairer deal for foster parents. These two amendments taken together seek to remove the existing subsection (2)  which many foster parents found offensive and to substitute what I believe is a more acceptable approach.  The existing subsection (2)  makes it an offence for foster parents to refuse to deliver up a foster child on demand to the health board.  As I said, many foster parents found this offensive and saw it as a big stick being held over them by the health boards.  While I am satisfied that health boards would not abuse this provision, I am very sensitive to the feelings and fears of foster parents.  I know many of them personally.  I know their organisation and the people who make up that organisation. They are very decent, genuine, sincere people who do a tremendous human service in the interests of the State and the interests of little children, and we deeply appreciate that.  That is why I am proposing a new subsection under which a foster parent would only be guilty of an offence if he or she refused to obey a court order to return a child to the health board.  This is a much better approach and I ask the House to support these amendments.</P>

      <P>I read the debate in the other House on this section because I have a long-established interest in the transition into the wider community of people who have been in care.  Section 43 is a commendable effort to make that transition as smooth as possible.  I hope the Minister will ensure, through his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, that at local level the two agencies &mdash; particularly in regard to local authorities dealing with planning accommodation for children leaving care at the age of 18 &mdash; are as willing to co-operate as the section envisages.  There have been, as the Minister well knows, considerable problems about the interaction between health boards and local authorities in the area of accommodation and who is responsible for what, with, unfortunately, considerable evidence of determination to pass the buck from one to the other.  The section is fine in principle. <Col N="636" /> I would like to know what the Minister has in mind, to make sure that it works in practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the principle of the section and concur with what Senator Ryan has said.  Subsection (2) (d) states: that they may exist a person under this section by among other things arranging hostels or other forms of accommodation. Is the Minister satisfied that such hostel or other accommodation exists because in the Dublin area it does not seem to?  There are still homeless children on the streets.  It is difficult to believe that there is sufficient hostel accommodation in existence when I see homeless children.  There has been the appalling situation of Father Peter McVerry, although I gather that there has been some amelioration in that situation, but I wonder if there is sufficient hostel accommodation available for this to be a practicable section.</P>

      <P>We are very committed to the Bill and to this section.  Senator Ryan has commended this provision and it speaks for itself.  It is an all-embracing and wide-ranging section.  It brings into focus the importance of providing education, accommodation and other facilities for young people, particularly young people who will be moving out of the child care area and into adulthood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have already had discussions with officials in the health boards pertaining to this.  As Senators know, the health boards act as a servicing agency to local authorities in adjudicating and reporting on the conditions and environment in which people live, and their medical situation. The health boards and local authorities can co-operate in order to maximise our efforts to provide accommodation for those young people.  We have had discussions with the health board staff and we are confident that this is the line that will be operated.  We have already had tentative discussions and we will have more detailed discussions with the officials in the Department of the Environment pertaining to the operation <Col N="637" /> of the Bill, particularly this section.  I am confident that these arrangements will work well.</P>
    <P>As Senator Norris said, hostel accommodation is available.  There is probably not enough hostel accommodation but I am not absolutely certain of that situation. However, my colleague and successor in the Department of Health, the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, has responsibility for this area and has been given a co-ordinating role by Government. As a result, we are very confident that there will now be much greater coordination of the need and the services to be provided for people, particularly young people who find themselves in this situation.  I can assure you that the Government are very concerned and committed to resolving those difficulties. We have made some progress and I am confident that over the next year this progress will be very obvious and the services will be improved.  Arrangements have been made to provide certain services and facilities.  Some of them have already been provided but most of those services will be provided in the latter half of this year and early into next year. Following that we will be in a better position to deal with these very sad human situations.  I am confident that this section of the Bill will be positively operated by the Department of the Environment, the local authorities, the Department of Health and the health boards in the interests of those young people.</P>

It sets out in a much clearer and more detailed way how a person will be guilty of an offence under this section where he removes a child from the care of a health board, or prevents a child returning to care at the end of a holiday or other period when the child is at home. I trust this clarifies the position.  It strengthens the Bill and I am sure the House can agree to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some difficulty with many of the representations that have been made to me.  The definition of &ldquo;pre-school service&rdquo; seems to incorporate anything from the neighbour next door looking after the children for an hour a day to the granny carrying out what would, in other societies, be regarded as the normal functions of an extended family, through to commercial operations like a créche operating in a supermarket.  I am not sure that we can apply the same legislative requirements to all of those.  For example, we are very slow to interfere with the internal operation of a family, in terms of the parents and the children.  This Bill is very carefully balanced through the judicial process to make sure that the family set-up is not interfered with.  The child comes first but that does not exclude parents.  It seems to me that the normal, sensible relationship between a grandparent and a child, where the grandparent is living anywhere other than in the family home, or even there, is a little circumscribed by this.  I know this is with the benefit of hindsight and that a considerable effort went into this section in the other House, but I wonder whether the words &ldquo;for reward&rdquo; should be inserted somewhere in this, with the exception of those grant-aided by the health boards.  It seems to me that where people do this without reward &mdash; and even that is not entirely satisfactory because very often somebody has to subscribe to the cost of the feeding of a child by the granny &mdash; it should be looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am intrigued by the difference between section 47 and section 56. Section 56 deals with the definition of children's residential centres and specifically excludes residential centres which are managed on behalf of a Minister or <Col N="641" /> a health board.  Section 47 specifically includes pre-school services that are managed by a health board.  There seems to be &mdash; I am reluctant to use the word again but it is the one that comes to mind &mdash; an inconsistency here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps &mdash; to be of assistance to Senator Ryan &mdash; he might vary &ldquo;inconsistency&rdquo; occasionally with &ldquo;anomaly&rdquo;.  The phrase to which Senator Ryan has drawn our attention is a grant catch-all phrase calculated to encompass more or less everything.  I am not sure that I like it for a number of the reasons which Senator Ryan has outlined.  Also, it is very broad and I wonder if the very broadness of the sweep of this section may be one of the reasons we do not have &mdash; unless the Minister is kind enough to accept amendments that are shortly coming up &mdash; a system of registration. That is a serious lapse.  There are many grey areas &mdash; for example the granny looking after kinds &mdash; which should perhaps be included in this section.  As well as that there is no registration, there is just notification later on.  I think that the sweep of these sections is too broad and too lacking in the kind of definition I would like to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, we are talking here about non-family situations.  Granny will not be included, auntie will not be included, Uncle Johnny next door, cousin Mary across the road or in-laws will not be included.  They will be regarded as an extended family accommodating a family because they have a purely personal blood interest, if you like, and family connection with the children they are looking after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about people who are providing a service in this area.  It may be dangerous to use the word &ldquo;reward&rdquo; because we are covering all kinds of situations including the supermarket créche.  There may be no reward for that apart from the fact that supermarkets, by providing a very upmarket or a specific type of créche, may be able to attract more customers for monetary gain.  A person could run a particular service and <Col N="642" /> other enjoyments and benefits could be conferred on them as distinct from monetary benefits as a result.  We might not be able to enforce regulations and inspections or otherwise, as a result of those people being involved in providing that type of service for which there was no obvious, proven, tangible monetary reward for them.  We must have that latitude there.  What was the second point made by Senator Ryan?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was much discussion on this on Committee Stage by the all-party committee.  We felt it would be unwise to have a situation where a health board would register their own institutions and children.  We had to get away from that, where they would not be in a position to register themselves.  We decided to be very specific and in section 56 exclude the areas that pre-school and registration did not cover.  Apart from that everything is covered.  We felt that that was in the best interest of providing a proper system, maintaining proper, supervisory and regulatory control.  That was agreed ultimately on Committee Stage after much debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the definition by the parliamentary draftsman of pre-school service, given the obscurity of the language they have used on some occasions in the interest of what they are assured by their Minister was precision.  It may well be the intention not to involve the extended family, but the truth is that a pre-school service means any pre-school, playgroup, day nursery, créche, day care or other similar service which caters for pre-school children. First, there is a problem here, we are saying to a mother who works at home looking after her children that if she chooses to look after one of the neighbour's children she is running a pre-school service.  We have this ridiculous position where the State accepts her <Col N="643" /> capacity to look after her own children but insists on a considerable right to supervise how she looks after perhaps a child of another family.</P>
      <P>That definition is quite leaky and vague and may well result in considerable problems in the future for many couples where both go out to work.  A large part of the informal network of child support or child care operates to the satisfaction often of the parents in an informal fashion which might involve a family member &mdash; that may not be the Minister's intention but I think it is contained in it &mdash; but also non-family members.  The intention is to regulate a growing industry and to ensure that it operates under proper standards, but a large part of that industry is so diffuse and informal that it either defies inspection or results in a clamp-down which will close a large section of it.  Many people are quite happy to have, perhaps, one or two children staying with them during the day but if they suddenly discover that they are liable to have a health board inspector descend upon them to assess the quality of the service they provide, then that informal section will close down.</P>
      <P>That definition should be tightened up. If I was as good a draftsperson as I should be I would have offered a definition myself but on this occasion I am inviting the Minister to use the expertise at his disposal.  He has referred on a few occasions to the considerable expertise at his disposal and he was very enthusiastic about it.  Perhaps he would invite that considerable expertise to attempt simply to say what he said which is that the immediate family are not included.  Secondly, he did not talk too precisely about the position of the person who takes in one child.  That person is covered by the definition.  I find it quite difficult to conceive what may happen if every mother around the country at home with her children, who takes in one of the neighbour's children for a modest reward, suddenly discover that they have to notify the health board and are liable to inspection. This may mean that many of those informal arrangements will stop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand my colleague, Senator Ryan, correctly I respectfully disagree with him.  I accept beyond a shadow of a doubt that there are many excellent, informal arrangements and I take the Minister's point about the immediate family and the extended family.  However, I am of the view that from the smallest unit up, we have to regulate our child care services at all levels and be seen to regulate them.  I believe that many of our child care services, informal or otherwise, are of the highest standards and have nothing to worry about.</P>
      <P>I would put a different emphasis then Senator Ryan on this.  Because of the sensitivity and the importance of child care at all levels, because it is critical that the child gets the right care in its infancy, as that care will affect the child in adulthood and will affect society in many ways and is so important for the individual child, I would go the whole way.  I would favour a comprehensive and clear regulation of all forms of child care service.  I would do that while acknowledging and paying tribute to the tremendous number of excellent carers around this country.  I am well aware of this, know a number of those people and they have nothing to worry about.  I favour regulation because I argue, and I am convinced of this, that the care of the infant child is central to the welfare of that human being, it is central to society and it is central to the future of society.  It is relevant in many ways.  There is nothing wrong with having clear regulations right throughout this service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I was to adjudicate on the recommendations of Senator Ryan and those of Senator O'Reilly I am afraid I would come down on the side of Senator Ryan.  Senator Ryan is trying to ensure that the regulations applied are watertight. However, I think I am interpreting him correctly when I say that he does not want every situation regulated.  If Mrs. Browne next door takes in my child for a period of a day, a week or a year it is an arrangement between her and me and that kind of neighbourly family back-up <Col N="645" /> support should continue.  We should not regulate and encroach on that kind of personal relationship between neighbours and friends.  Our purpose is to regulate where there is a regular, consistent service being made available for some type of gain, be it monetary gain or some reward, and that we should be in a position to regulate that.  When bringing in regulations we must take into account that children must be given a certain type of environment in which to grow up, develop and evolve and on which they can base mutual trust and judgment.  They should be able to see the human dimension in those with whom they are dealing and respond in their own development. If we regulate in a very stringent manner and impede that kind of relationship and development we will do a disservice to the development of young people. However, we need regulations and in view of what Senators Ryan and O'Reilly have said we will have another look at this.  If we can tighten it up and eliminate any grey areas we will certainly do so on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Regulations under this section shall also apply to after-school care services.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This would simply bring after-school services within the ambit of the regulations. <Col N="646" /> I believe the Minister will be sympathetic to this.  I hope so because, after all, we have just being talking about pre-school operations but there are, as the Minister knows, also what are known as after-school services which means, for example, looking after children when the formal school day is over.  It is a growing area of business.  There are people engaged in this throughout the country and it is not regulated at present.  It is important that it should be brought within the scope of the Bill.  It is appropriate, relevant and germane and apparently the Minister has already been considering it with regard to pre-school services.  I will be very happy, having been advised, to supply the Minister with this sort of definition.  For example, the National Children's Nurseries Association, one of the groups that approached me on this are prepared to supply me with it.  I will be happy to supply the Minister with this definition so that it is not confused with clubs or other extra-curricular activities.  The kind of definition we would have in mind would be the care of school children in a group setting for more than three hours in the school week.

      <P>The term &ldquo;after school care services&rdquo; is very ambiguous and requiries defining.  Senator Norris is right in that the regulatory procedure being introduced for pre-school centres should also apply here.  It is inevitable that for the same reasons that child care centres or pre-school services are expanding, after school centres will also expand. Parents who put their children into pre-school centres because they both work will need places where their children can go after school given that the first two years in primary school usually finish at 1 p.m. and in later years it is rarely later than 2.30 p.m. or 2.45 p.m.  There is, therefore, a considerable need to ensure that the commercial services available are properly regulated.  I do not propose to be as stubborn as Senator O'Reilly &mdash; to regulate the granny &mdash; we must allow people at family level to trust each other, but there is a case for Senator Norris's amendment, whatever about its wording.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little confused because I wonder how we all grew up without all these regulations and I am worried that we are beginning to over-regulate the development of children. Senator Ryan was accurate when he said that I have some difficulty with this amendment because it is very vague.  It could result in State interference in a whole range of activities in which children are involved after school.  For example, is it the intention that various extra-curriculuar activities organised by school teachers outside school hours would be the subject of regulations by the Minister <Col N="648" /> for Health?  Is it intended that the activities of summer projects or youth clubs would be affected?</P>
      <P>We all know that in modern times schools run many activities during holiday times, particularly at the Easter holiday period and in the wider summer holiday period.  They create many opportunities for young people in various school projects and activities.  Schools also run such activities for non-students, young children who may be attending national school, within one or two years of second level or who will attend second level in a few months' time.  It would be very unwise for us to interfere in that area.  It would take away the flexibility, the civic and the personal commitment among teachers, school principals and school management to making their facilities available to the wider community. It would take away from the fun and enjoyment because they have to have some kind of a structure and a system within which they must operate.  If we interfere and over-regulate for them it would undermine the tremendous opportunities created for children by very responsible people in our society.  We must commend this.</P>
      <P>The amendment gives no clue as to the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;after-school care&rdquo;, or the age up to which children would be subject to the proposed regulations. Are we to say that this proposal would be up to the age of 18 years?  If that is the case, we are talking about young people at third level.  That is another dimension.  How will we regulate those in a third level institution, who have already come through first level and second level, where there were rules and regulations to be obeyed?  They are now coming into adulthood; they are in a new environment and there are certain regulations in operation at third level.  Those students have a personal commitment to whatever opportunities are available, sporting, extra-curricular, or otherwise. It would be unwise to involve the Department of Health and the Child Care Bill in that situation.  Perhaps Senator Norris, in the light of that, may wish to consider withdrawing the amendment.</P>

      <P>I will not push it, but might I suggest that the Minister's advisers get in touch with the National Children's Nurseries Association so that there could be some further degree of clarification, because they were in contact with me? The Minister has expanded the case to the point of absurdity and that is a very useful logical method of demonstrating the flaw in an argument.  I accept that; it would be absurd to have people in university being catered for by this kind of regulation.</P>

      <P>That may be true and if any of them need nappies changed, Senator Honan, we will know where to direct them.  There is a serious issue here and this is related to the question of the employment of parents.  Frequently children are left in a créche or a pre-school partly facilitating parents who are in employment and when this formal pre-school or Montessori group ends at a particular time there is then a gap of a number of hours during which care is provided, although it may not be formalised as pre-school or créche facilities. It is after-school not in the sense of the recipient of this care having finished with secondary education.  It is simply a question of time.  I quite accept that the amendment is vague, but I think the principle could do with some further examination and perhaps it could be returned to on Report Stage.  I am happy to withdraw it, but I will be back in contact with the people who briefed me and see if they can give me a definition.  It is clearly something about which they have a genuine concern.</P>

      <P>I think the concern of Minister Treacy is that we as legislators are not entitled to regulate every hour of a child's life and we seem to be doing this.  If we did not have regulating legislation we would be asked to do it, and the opposite would be true also.  Senator Norris wants the care in the class situation or in the minding situation and now he is <Col N="650" /> talking about after-school care service. The Minister is appealing to us that as legislators we should not set down regulations for every hour of the child's life but should give the child some freedom. He has also told us that there are already in place some of the protections for the hours that Senator Norris is concerned about.  I must say I was delighted that for once he was checked on the wording because he is forever checking us lesser beings here on how we should word our amendments or motions.  I think Senator Norris should show common sense and withdraw this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us put this in context. Many pre-schools operate from 9 until 12.30.  Not all of them are eight hour day services.  Many of them are actually a transition from the home to school, where the mother or a parent may well be still working in the home.  That would cover a period of two to three hours. Some of these other centres take children who come out of school at 1 o'clock and look after them, say, from 1 p.m. until 5 p.m. or 5.30 p.m., which is four and a half hours.  That is as long a period of care for the child as many of the places that we see fit, quite rightly, to regulate.</P>
      <P>The second thing is that we have the lowest school entry age in Europe, or one of the lowest.  Senator O'Reilly is among those who is an expert on this.  But it is among the lowest: children can enter our school system at four years of age.  Four years is a remarkably young age and, if it is valid to regulate pre-school services for kids of three or four or up to six, as we have done here, then it seems to me to be valid to extend this to at least cover children between four and eight years, because a pre-school child is defined as a child who has not attained the age of six and who is not attending a national school or a school providing an educational programme similar to that in a national school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We accept that the children who need protection under this section are aged up to six, but if they go to school at the age of four for three hours a day and then go to another service for four hours a day, <Col N="651" /> they do not need the protection that children would need if they went to a pre-school for three hours a day and were not going to the national school.  It is not logical.  There is a logical argument for extending the limited powers of notification and inspection to all persons who provide a service for children outside school hours and where they are, as I said, running a commercial operation.</P>
    <P>We could argue all day about definitions and I am sure Senator Honan would be particularly delighted if myself and Senator Norris launched into an interesting discussion on the meaning of words.  It seems to provide her with endless entertainment.  The issue is that there is a logical argument in principle for what Senator Norris is saying and I do not think the Minister, to be fair, has addressed it straight on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to say that we must have respect for the role of the parents and we cannot, as Senator Honan said, over-regulate for children.  Indeed, Senator Ryan has made a wonderful case for the withdrawal of this amendment.  If we have the youngest school entry age in the world &mdash; and we have at four years of age, a very young age &mdash; I think a wonderful facility is being provided by the State that parents can have their children go to school at four years of age.  It provides a great facility also for maintaining the level of school services that we have, local services in particular.  You have national schools throughout the country in small towns, in large cities and in rural Ireland.  The fact that you can bring children of four years of age into those schools protects that school and its teaching complement and ensures that opportunity is there for children not to have to travel too far to school.  They get great time and attention.  The parents are happy in the knowledge that they are down the road in the local national school.  They are cared for by excellent teachers.  The parents can take them home early, if they are very young, or they can take them home in the evening along with other children, or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" /> I think this is a situation that we should not interfere with.  We must recognise and realise that we are putting children at four years of age into a regulated régime. If we are going to have a situation that when they come home in the evening they have not the flexibility to roam and run around as they like under the care of their parents and have to go into another regulated situation, we would be going down the wrong road.  All I am saying is that I would not be able to accept this amendment, but if Senator Norris has some documentation which he has received from this organisation I most certainly will exmaine it.</P>

      <P>I think I would be delighted to accept the social licence which has been transferred to Senator Norris in this case and respond.  I will accept the spirit of what the Senators are trying to achieve in this amendment.  The whole purpose of this Part of the Bill is to ensure that the pre-school services will be of a fit standard and that they will serve to promote the social and emotional development of the child.  I would refer the House to subsection (1)  of this section, or page 25 of the Bill, under which the Minister for Health is required to make regulations for securing the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children; for promoting their development towards this end the Minister for Health may impose requirements in regard to the premises in which pre-school services are to be carried out and in regard to the equipment and facilities to be provided.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, section 50 imposes a statutory duty on persons carrying on pre-school services to take all reasonable measures to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of children attending those services.  I suggest, therefore, that what the Senators are trying to achieve here is already contained in the Bill and that there is no need for the amendment.  Perhaps, Senator Norris may be able to use the licence which has been transferred to him to withdraw this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 71:</P>
      <P>In page 26, subsection (1), line 12, to delete &ldquo;give notice to&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;register with&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the subsection stands it states that: &ldquo;A person carrying on a pre-school service in the commencement of this Part shall give notice to the relevant health board in the prescribed manner.&rdquo;  My amendment would alter that by proposing that a person in this case would register.  What we are effectively trying to do here is to improve the legislation in this respect.  It is important that I make a background point to this, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.  The background point would be that as a party we are very much aware from practical experience &mdash; I know many cases of this myself &mdash; that there are many excellent high standard pre-school services throughout this country.  They are in existence already and are providing a tremendous service.  They provide a tremendous developmental function for the child and a tremendous back-up to a family unit where two parents are working, although it does not necessarily follow that both parents need be working for this facility to be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are very much aware of this and are very proud that that is the case.  We totally support that, but what we want to achieve is that all existing pre-school services including those superb and excellent services, would be registered as and from the implementation of this Bill.  The reason we want them to be registered is that we want it to be clear that they are part of a register, that they live up to set standards and that there is a standard of care and a standard of physical environment there, which is so important to the development of a child.  We want to ensure also that there is a standard of learning experience there, which is also so important to the development of a child, that there is a standard of care, emotional as well as intellectual, and that all of these standards are ensuring that <Col N="655" /> the pre-school services are for the good of the child.</P>
    <P>The fact that I, the Minister and other Members of this House, know that there are many existing pre-school services that are of this standard is not sufficient reason to be relaxed about the situation. Because of the sensitivity of this area and because I know as a teacher &mdash; I taught for a number of years at both primary and vocational levels but more particularly at primary level &mdash; and I can tell this House, if the House needs informing, that there is no area so critical to the development of a human being as the very early infant stages.  That is where it really matters for the ultimate type of person that will emerge, intellectually, socially and emotionally.</P>
    <P>For that reason I think it is a very critical area that needs regulation and the highest standards.  I would appeal to the Minister to go for a system of registration here, that a register should exist and that there is a clear set of standards for the physical space, the building, the size of the building, the colour of the building, how creative the environment is, the kind of care, the kind of teachers, etc.  All of this should get consideration.</P>
    <P>I think this is a very significant amendment. It is put down in the very best interests of the legislation.  I wholeheartedly accept that we have had a very positive approach here today and that we have had a very constructive debate.  I appeal to the Minister for a number of reasons, firstly, as an affirmation of those who are doing a good pre-school job already &mdash; they merit such an affirmation and they would receive it this way &mdash; and, secondly, that for the sake of the children we put in a system of registration for the pre-school services already in existence and for those that will come into existence.</P>
    <P>There should be nothing wrong with that and nobody should be alarmed about that.  I cannot see who would be alarmed by that.  I would be very cynical about the motivation of those who would be alarmed about a system of registration. It would raise a question mark as to why <Col N="656" /> a person might want to prevent a system of registration.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment as improving the legislation and as implementing a system of registration for pre-school services that I can only see being to the good of very young children, and that is critical to society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to Senator O'Reilly for having led off on this issue.  It is a very important amendment and a number of us spoke on it. Senator O'Reilly spotted an occasion where I had not put an amendment in.  I thought I had covered all eventualities but the Senator spotted one where this change had not been made.  A number of us, including Senator O'Reilly, spoke on Second Stage on the question of registration <i>versus</i> notification.  It is a crucially important point and I very much hope the Minister will see his way to meeting us on this one.</P>
      <P>As it stands, notification is really not sufficient.  At the moment all that need happen is that a child care facility simply notifies the local health board that they are in operation.  That legalises them and gives them a degree of recognition.  I do not think, in view of the very considerable caring concern that the Minister has evidenced throughout the passage and discussion of this Bill, that it is appropriate that somebody can simply set up shop, notify the health board and immediately be accepted as having had some kind of an accreditation.  I simply do not think that this is at all appropriate.  It is correct that we should remove the phrase &ldquo;give notice to&rdquo;, which is a kind of a passive acceptance by the system, and substitute for that phrase the much stronger and much more responsible phrase &ldquo;register with&rdquo;.  That is in my amendment No. 72, which is virtually identical to Senator O'Reilly's earlier amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With that there is also amendment No. 73, which, if the Minister accepts either of our two amendments or both of them, would be necessary.  I see no point in requiring registration unless the Minister stipulates what that registration shall consist of.  Amendment No. 73 inserts a new <Col N="657" /> subsection which gives that degree of definition and says: &ldquo;A register of pre-school services will be maintained and made available to the public in each health board area, preferably in library premises.&rdquo;  Again, this is an important addition to the Bill and one with the principle of which the Minister will certainly have no great difficulty.  It simply means that parents who wish to place their child in an appropriate environment can have access to a register which will indicate that this is a properly supervised facility and that they can have confidence in placing their children in such a facility.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 74 is not my amendment, it is Senator Ryan's and he should obviously deal with that.  Amendments Nos. 77 and 78 are mine and they are simply extensions of the question of registration as opposed to notification.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is almost redundant for me to say that this alteration in the Bill, which is clearly an amelioration, has been urged upon me by a considerable and well qualified group of people in this area. Certainly, as Senator O'Reilly raised the spectre of people objecting to it, all I can say is that those bodies which are already recognised, and deserve the thanks of the Irish people for their marvellous work in this area, do not seem to have any worry about it; in fact, they are actively canvassing that this system of registration should apply.  I would have to say that without a system of registration a nonsense is made up of whole sections of the Bill.  We are presuming to regulate and yet we are allowing people to set themselves up and there is no real method of establishing their proper accreditation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat taken aback by my colleagues.  Is one going to argue about a difference between notification and registration?  Part VIII goes through a process of registration and through the process of stages.  For instance, Senator O'Reilly and Senator Norris want registration, but they do not say whether they can refuse to register anybody. If they cannot refuse to register anybody, notification and registration mean the same thing.  If Senator O'Reilly <Col N="658" /> and Senator Norris want pre-inspection before approval of every single child care facility or pre-school in the country, then we are going to have something close to chaos on our hands.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept that the concept of registration as envisaged by Senator O'Reilly and Senator Norris is anything but another word for notification if you do not put in a procedure for refusal, a procedure for inspection and a procedure for appeal against refusal, all of which take up the best part of three or four pages of the next Part of the Bill.  That is why I prefer my own amendment.  All my own amendment says is that the public should have access to the names, addresses, etc. of those persons or premises which notify their existence to the health board.</P>
      <P>I suspect the Minister is going to tell me that section 54 (3) makes provision for that.  I do not think it is as specific or as clear as it ought to be.  Large bodies have a habit of not taking the most benign interpretation of things and they may well interpret it in a less open and a less detailed fashion.  I know of one local authority who in a related area, to give an example, will allow people to inspect environmental impact studies, for instance, but will not give them copies of it because they say they are not obliged to give you a copy.  An environmental impact study is very thick sometimes.  It is effectively not available to the public if the public cannot take it away and study it.  Similarly I would be worried if it is not made precisely clear that the public are entitled to know who exactly has given notice.  That is all that can be done unless there is a procedure for pre-inspection, for refusals and for appeals and much more detail in terms of standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened to the arguments from some people in the profession, but most of what I have heard from people in the profession, as I recall it, involved, if not a stated requirement, an implied requirement for pre-inspection.  It seems to me physically impossible to impose a burden of pre-inspection on every single pre-school as defined here.  In the little part of Cork city that I am familiar with I <Col N="659" /> could probably have my two hands to count the number in that small area of places that would be classified as providing pre-school facilities.  If that is extended over the whole of the city of Cork and then out into every town and every townland &mdash; and there is virtually a person providing a pre-school service in every townland in Ireland at this stage &mdash; then the implication of pre-inspection is enormous.  The alternative then is to assume that registration means the same as notification, in which case we should not be wasting our time talking about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most important aspects of the Bill as far as I am concerned.  I was involved for many years in the Civics Institute and we ran nurseries in Mountjoy Square and in Dublin 8.  We endeavoured, as one of our objectives, to raise the standards of pre-school play groups all over the city; I am not sure that we were able to cope with the whole of Ireland.  We drew up standards and did everything we could to run courses and to help them.  There was always this problem of the unsatisfactory pre-school play group run either in a slovenly manner, or by unscrupulous people, or by people who were simply in it to make money.  If that was true &mdash; and I am talking of 20 or 25 years ago &mdash; that situation has certainly become very much more widespread.  There is now a situation where people are simply opening up these pre-school play groups and they are quite clearly &mdash; I am sure this has been said before; unfortunately I was not here for the earlier part of the debate &mdash; running them as businesses.  Somebody who rang me recently wanted to run one of these pre-schools in our area and wanted to know if planning permission would be a problem for them in a residential area.  They referred to it quite straightforwardly as a business.  The husband was ringing on behalf of the wife, she would be running the business, etc. Therefore, I have great concern about this section of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the points that Senator Ryan made.  I certainly am not looking for what <Col N="660" /> he interpreted Senator O'Reilly and Senator Norris to be looking for, a semantic change to &ldquo;registration&rdquo; from &ldquo;notification&rdquo;, which is in the Bill.  That is not what I am looking for.  My concern is that &mdash; if the health board maintain a register of persons who are running a pre-school play group and if that register is available for inspection, say, in the local library or wherever it may be, there is an obvious assumption there that these are satisfactory, well run institutions.  I think it will be making the situation even worse the more you publicise and make that information available, because if you simply have notification, the very worst pre-school play group in this country &mdash; we need not go into what that is; I am sure that has been spoken about &mdash; the one that this Bill is there to stamp out, can continue.  They can simply notify the local authority &mdash; call it &ldquo;register&rdquo; or &ldquo;notify&rdquo;; that is what Senator Ryan is talking about &mdash; or whoever they have to notify, the health board or whoever.  That register will be available perhaps in the local library and an unsuspecting mother goes in there and says: &ldquo;Oh, this is the register&rdquo;, and does not bother to check it.  They get a false sense of confidence about it.  They do not realise that it has not been vetted or do not realise that it could be the worst one in the country. They send their child off there, happy in the belief that this is a satisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>This matter is germane to the whole Bill.  I take Senator Ryan's point.  It is obviously a problem.  We are back to what is a pre-school.  If a mother has two children of her own and she decides to take in two more from a neighbour who goes out to work, is that a pre-school? Where is the cut-off point?  What is a pre-school and what is not a pre-school?  I think that any pre-school being run for a certain number &mdash; that number would obviously have to be decided on; I do not think one could say it should be four, six or eight &mdash; would have to be inspected. Then there would be a guarantee that there was some sort of standard.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Ryan that this is an impossible situation, that is, <Col N="661" /> provided we define a pre-school play group as something more than the mother who takes in two children other than perhaps her own.  Bord Fáilte, for instance, have registration for bed and breakfast outfits.  I consider it is far more important that there should be registration for a pre-school play group than that there should be registration for where our tourists and our visitors come to stay.  I would prefer to see the money taken out of that and put into pre-schools, if that had to be.  That, of course, is not what I want; I want them both to be done.  I think the registration of bed and breakfast accommodation is very important, but I cannot accept that it is more important, because there are people going to bed and breakfasts who are perfectly capable of looking after themselves and, if they do not like it, they can take themselves off somewhere else; whereas, unfortunately, that is not the case for a child who goes to one of these pre-schools.</P>
    <P>Another situation which we have is that a landlord is obliged to register if he has two flats in a house.  In that situation there is no automatic inspection: the local authority can inspect it if there is a problem.  That is a situation which I do not think would be sufficient in the case of a pre-school play group.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to think about this one very seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan may have misunderstood my amendment and the very helpful contribution made on it by Senator Norris.  What I think Senator Ryan fears might arise is that we would have a network of inspectors criss-crossing Ireland visiting pre-schools, that the whole regime would become punitive, obstructionist and difficult.  That, of course, is not what we are talking about. There is no question about that.  What the amendment is trying to ensure is that a system of registration exists that will ensure the highest standards in the pre-schools of this country.  The amendments are proposed in the knowledge that that exists, by and large already; but we want to isolate the cases where it does not exist <Col N="662" /> and get rid of those.  I would be saying that the people registered could at any time lose their registration if they were not up to standard or if their standards fell to a level that was unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The object of registration is to ensure the highest standards.  I can appreciate that Senator Ryan would legitimately be concerned if we were going to set up some absurd bureaucratic inspectorate that would cause all sorts of inhibiting problems for the pre-schools, that people would operate their pre-schools on a day-to-day basis totally nervous about when will this horrendous inspector appear. That is not what we are talking about at all.  We are ensuring by a system of registration that the very best standards exist, that it is possible that somebody can cease to be registered and that somebody does not automatically be registered without it being the case that certain standards exist.  In other words, we want the highest and best form of regulation.  I have taught for many years &mdash; and I remain a teacher on leave of absence &mdash; and I know that if you do not get the pre-school path, the very junior years, right, then you do not get the latter stages right. I am very anxious about that and I am appealing for the Minister to accept the amendment.  I want to make that qualifying remark in the light of Senator Ryan's contribution, which I know was well motivated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have given tremendous time and attention to these sections at the all-party Committee Stage and again in the Dáil, and I want to assure Senator Hederman and the House of that.  The first point I wish to make in response to these amendments is that the Government are committed to introducing statutory procedures for the regulation, inspection and supervision of pre-school services.  However, we are also anxious to avoid creating an elaborate, supervisory system which would cost a huge amount of money to operate, a cost which would ultimately have to be borne by parents of children attending these services; and this, we feel, would be totally unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> It seems to me that the notification system which we have proposed in the Bill meets two objectives: it provides a system of statutory control and it does not impose a huge cost on the users of the pre-school services for these young children.  What we propose is that there would be a legal obligation on persons carrying on pre-school services to notify the health board of their existence and operation and failure to do so would itself be an offence.</P>
    <P>There are a large number of sections dealing with this and they do so in great detail.  I think Senator Ryan has made a very practical contribution on this whole matter.  If we are to have a situation of registration and pre-inspection we are going to be in a position that many of the existing services would be put out of operation immediately.  That is not what we intend or what anybody wants to imply or to achieve.  We want notification, which is ultimate registration. There would be specific forms to be completed. We have ensured that the staff of the health board, qualified professionals, inspectors from the Department of Education, will be in a position of visit these schools.  We want to ensure that there will be a levelling of standards and a gradual improvement of those standards. All that would be operated in consultation with the Department of Education and the Minister for Education. We are talking here on a Bill which is the ultimate responsibility of the Minister for Health.  Consequently, we cannot be operating on the basis that we are wearing two hats, one on the health side and the other on the education side.  We must ensure that where there is a dovetailing there is a balanced, consistent effort to ensure that we are as fair to everybody as possible and that we bring in reasonable control, not absolute control.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day we must always remember that those ultimately responsible and the ultimate arbiters in any situation will be the parents of these children.  If they are dissatisfied with the type of service that is being given, with the facilities available, with the charges <Col N="664" /> being imposed, they will respond by reporting to the health board or withdrawing their children, or both.  We can be certain in that situation that the system will operate effectively.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health will make regulations to control the operation of pre-schools following consultations with the Minister for Education and the Minister for the Environment.  Health Boards would be required to have the services inspected from time to time and would be able to call on the assistance of inspectors from the Department of Education in the case of services which have an educational dimension.  The other areas of service they will be able to call on the Minister for the Environment and the other statutory authorities if an examination or an inspection pertaining to the safety of a building or fire safety regulations or anything like that needs to be carried out.  In the event of serious of persistent failure to adhere to the regulations the courts will be able to impose fines and, more specifically, order that the service be closed, either temporarily while improvements are being effected or for a longer period.  This is a major change.  We have covered a very wide area.  We have brought these pre-schools under statutory and State control.  We have involved regulations and an inspectorate and this is a major departure.  We should all welcome it.  It is more than adequate to deal with any abuses which may arise in the area of pre-school services.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Ryan's amendment No. 74, I would draw attention, as he did himself, to section 54, part III, which requires each health board to make available to any interested person information on pre-school services in their area.  As far as I am concerned, what that means is that if I am living in a health board area and need information from the health board pertaining to the pre-school services in my area, I am entitled to get it.  If the health board refuse to do so, all I have to do is make a phone call to the Department of Health who will direct the health board to make that information available to me.  That is how <Col N="665" /> simple it is to operate the regulations which we propose to bring into operation as soon as the Bill has been passed.  This achieves in a slightly different way what Senator Ryan is trying to achieve in amendment No. 74.</P>
    <P>I hope that what I have said is a clear commitment on behalf of the Government to regulate and to take under statutory control the pre-school services in the country.  It is also an acknowledgement by us of the situation that exists today and the tremendous level of service being given by many pre-schools right across the country.  It is also an acknowledgement by us of the necessity to have an opportunity to inspect and to ensure that a proper service is being given right across the board in this very important area.  I hope this is to the satisfaction of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret to say it is not entirely to my satisfaction.  The Minister is a little disingenuous in one of his arguments at least when he said the situation is that if parents are dissatisfied they can withdraw their child or report to the health board.  Of course, they can.  They can do that without this Bill.  If this is the principle along which the Minister is operating there is absolutely no point in regulating things at all because the free market operates.  You can have Dotheboys Hall, you can have borstals all over the place, you can have murder machines.  Of course, the parents can withdraw the children.  It is the old &ldquo;If you don't like it, switch it off&rdquo; argument. It is rather curious that the Minister's colleague does not operate this in regard to pornography and video nasties and so on: &ldquo;You have the off switch; why do you not use it?&rdquo; I do not accept that argument at all.  There would be no need to go round and laboriously pre-inspect every school, but each school would be liable to inspection and as a result of this liability could be de-registered.  Perhaps some legal machinery needs to be applied to this.  The Minister has the resources of parliamentary draftspersons; lonely, isolated individuals like myself trying to read through this kind of legislation do not, so <Col N="666" /> we put down our own, akwardly phrased amendments.  If a principle is accepted I have no wish to stand over every single word.</P>
      <P>Certain doubts have been raised about the authenticity of the point of view expressed here.  I am not an expert but I do not think Senator Ryan is either although I frequently find myself in agreement with him.  I am acting on the basis of advice from Barnardos which echoes the general welcome we have all given to this Bill and goes on to say that &ldquo;registration is essential for pre-school services because it imposes standards which have to apply before the facility can be registered.  Clearer child development and curriculum standards need to be laid down.  A list of registered facilities would then be available to the public and parents on the understanding that they were fit to operate.  Notification as defined in the Bill does not incorporate these safeguards&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is defective in word if not in spirit and has to be taken with the other amendments that deal with the question of authorised personnel because our definition of those stated that they must be properly and professionally qualified and trained.  At the moment authorised personnel are designated by the Minister and that is not good enough either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case other doubts are raised as to the professional competence that lies behind these amendments or if there is any feeling that they have been casually or mischieviously put down, may I say I have received another submission from a group that includes the Royal College of Psychiatrists &mdash; child psychiatry division &mdash; the Irish Association of Social Workers, the Irish Association of Care Workers, the Federation of Services for Unmarried Parents and their Children, Focus Point, Street Wise, Catholic Youth Council, Family Lawyers Association, CARE and the Resident Managers Association and this is what they have to say on the point of notification versus registration: &ldquo;registration rather than notification is needed.  A pre-school service must be of a certain standard before <Col N="667" /> it can be registered.  This must be vetted by the particular health board but we are in need of a Bill to set out clear guidelines as to standards of practice in accordance with child development facilities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is possible under this amendment for a facility to register and for an assumption to be made by the central authority that the facility is bona fide.  It is assumed by the process of registration that the child care facility has entered into a contract which states on their part: &ldquo;We have understood and met the requirements for the establishment of this kind of thing&rdquo;, and then there can be inspection.  They are liable to inspection and should be liable to de-registration.  I am not sure whether the Minister has satisfied us on whether or not can they be de-notified. Senator Ryan has now assumed ministerial responsibility and it comes as a great pleasure to me because I think &mdash; not denigrating the present Minister &mdash; in the light of the Senator's contribution that he would be an excellent Minister.</P>

      <P>I am not sure if I am wearing my putative hat as the Minister's <i>alter ego</i> or whatever, at this stage.  My colleagues have put down amendments about registration which are meaningless. If they want to put down amendments about registration which involves a process of inspections, appeals, refusals etc., then let us have a debate but let us not spend a long time arguing about a register which is the same thing as notification. Saying it is a register rather than notification does not make it any different. If Senator O'Reilly and Senator Norris want to put in a procedure for registration similar to the one under Part VIII then they have a perfectly valid point.  I would not agree with them largely because the definition of pre-school service, which I am not happy with, is extraordinarily wide-ranging in this Part.</P>
      <P>There is an obligation on every person carrying on a pre-school to take all reasonable measures.  The Minister will make further regulations about health board pre-schools.  People will be appointed by the health board, and it is not &ldquo;may&rdquo; but &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, who shall inspect premises where there is a notified play school; they can get a warrant from the District Court to enter any premises where they believe an un-notified pre-school service exists.  There is a provision for a person who contravenes the requirements of this Part to be convicted, fined £1,000 or in addition to or as a replacement for to be prohibited from carrying on a pre-school service for a period. These are fairly substantial powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not normally take the Government's part but there are an enormous number of people in our society who go out to work in order to have a roof over their heads because it takes two peoples' salaries to pay the sort of mortgage you have to pay on a new house today.  We <Col N="669" /> should not impose any extra costs on pre-schools other than the minimum necessary to provide reasonable guarantees of a decent service because the more we regulate and the more we involve pre-inspections the more cumbersome and complicated the apparatus becomes.</P>
    <P>I know that certain professional bodies have suggested pre-inspection and no registration until they have been pre-inspected but I do not agree with them. In the submission I got from Barnados dated February 1989, their section on notification and inspection is not as specific as the letter Senator Norris quoted from.  The proposed procedures are reasonable and fair as long as people know about them.  It would be useful for the health board to ask everybody who notifies them to state in that notification that they meet the standards required or that they are satisfied that they are operating properly under the provisions of the Act.  That would be a reasonable request and an inspection would possibly follow.  Such a notification of compliance would put an onus on people to make some effort to meet the reasonable standards set down but I think the Part is quite reasonable as it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the Minister's reply on this; his approach is too lax as is Senator Ryan's.  Any existing or potential child care service should be registered and anything short of a national registration system is inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were to introduce a registration system for pre-schools it would be necessary to have a system of pre-inspection of pre-schools before they could be registered and a number of Members &mdash; Senator Ryan in particular &mdash; referred to this.  It would be necessary in this case to have provisions similar to those contained in Part VIII dealing with children's homes, for example, section 57, the prohibition of unregistered centres; section 58, registration of children's residential centres; section 59, appeals against refusal of registration.  I do not believe that pre-school services require <Col N="670" /> this type of detailed regulation and we must all accept this.  I sincerely thank Senator Ryan for his excellent practical exposé of the current situation.</P>
      <P>Once the Seanad and Dáil pass this Bill and the President signs it, it will be the law of the land; notification will be required.  Certain details will have to be given on that notification which will be subject to examination by the health boards.  If the health boards deem it immediately necessary they will send out an inspector or inspectors to examine that situation and if those inspectors find something they are not satisfied with they will report to the health boards who will direct that certain things be done or, alternatively, if things are serious they will direct that the centre be closed down. If a refusal to close down is not acceptable to those promoting that centre, or administering it, or in control of it, then this Bill will allow the health board to take that centre to court to get a clear decision. If that is not regulation and implementation of the law in a totally new way for these pre-school services, I do not know what is.</P>
      <P>We must accept that many well-intentioned people run a tremendous service on behalf of little children and as Senator Ryan said, on behalf of parents who need that service so that both parents can go to work.  If we bring in registration we immediately put many of those children at risk and their parents' jobs at risk. That would be unfair and would not be in the best interests of the children for whom we are here to ensure that we pass the best laws possible.</P>
      <P>In view of that I appeal to Senator O'Reilly and his colleagues not to press these amendments as I believe they are unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully suggest to the Minister that the way to correct the situation he adverts to in terms of the difficulty that might be posed for parents who wanted to put children into pre-school services or for people running pre-school services would be to look at our taxation system and at other areas of legislation outside this.  I do not believe <Col N="671" /> that introducing a less than comprehensive registration system is the right method.  Implicit in that last reply from the Minister is an acknowledgment that a registration system &mdash; and this is important &mdash; would involve a different set of <Col N="672" /> standards and I accept that difficulties could be caused for individuals.  I submit that the Minister should look at the taxation system and for that reason I cannot accept his reply.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 75:</P>
      <P>In page 26, subsection (1), line 27, after &ldquo;Part&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, such authorised persons to have specialised training as appropriate for their duties&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment deals with ensuring that authorised persons have a specialised training which would be appropriate for their duties.  This is a reasonable amendment. It is important that personnel involved in child care ought to have proper professional training and that those employed to supervise in such a child facility ought to be trained in the appropriate fields.</P>
      <P>The emphasis in the Bill, by and large, is on physical environment.  There is very little concept of the kind of care or the quality of that experience for the child.  I know from what the Minister has said that this is very much in his mind and although he did not take on board an amendment earlier in the afternoon from Senator Ryan, which spelt out this question of the care and supervision of the child, the development, etc., the Minister made it perfectly clear that this is implicit, as far as he is concerned, in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="675" /> Hygiene and safety regulations have to be met but under &ldquo;health&rdquo; it is essential to consider as well as physical health, the psychological and emotional health of the child which is influenced by the environment. A child in a creche, playgroup, nursery or any child-minding centre will spend the greatest part of his or her early life in that environment.  For that reason it is felt that the Bill should be amended to ensure that those undertaking supervision and inspection are trained in child care, child psychology and child development. This will enable the health board or the Department of Education to second staff to do this training or to contract those skills in from outside.  It seems perfectly logical and reasonable to expect people in this kind of authorised position to have certain qualifications and skills, otherwise there is very little point in them being there at all.</P>
    <P>The Bill as it stands is a little bit naked in its phraseology because it seems to allow the Minister to designate people. The coalition which represents eight or ten different groups say that in order to inspect and supervise facilities adequately, the authorised persons must be trained or have access to professional persons.  They give as an analogous case the Department of Health and Social Services inspectorate role in the United Kingdom.  Barnardos say there should be training of personnel in order to ensure that they have the proper skills.  The setting down of minimal standards will necessarily imply that those who work directly with children will be professionally trained to do so.  The Bill should ensure that specialised training is mandatory for all those working in this area.</P>
    <P>There is commonsense involved here which even so unsophisticated a mind as my own can comprehend.  I could again read into the record of the House the views of a number of caring and professional bodies who strongly feel that there should be some kind of qualification or training required.  I do not suggest that they have a Ph.D. in child minding but I am suggesting that in order to inspect, it <Col N="676" /> is really necessary to have some acquaintance with this role.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment is different and a slightly more appropriate way of achieving the same objective which is that the Minister shall make regulations prescribing the qualification and/or experience required by a person to be appointed under subsection (1).  It is important that the inspection be carried out by somebody who has a qualification or experience or both.  The individual should be properly qualified either formally or by experience.  I would prefer both.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senators that persons carrying out inspections under this Part should be appropriately trained and qualified.  Health boards employ a wide range of professional staff including doctors, nurses, social workers, health inspectors, administrative, engineering staff and others.  Any of these staff would be in a position to contribute to the inspection of pre-schools.  We are anxious to give health boards the maximum flexibility in assigning staff to undertake these inspections and that is why we have not idicated any specific category or grade of staff.  The various professionals I have mentioned have their own systems of training and prescribed qualifications. Health boards operate training, in-service and refresher courses.  We intend that some of these courses will be specifically for the Child Care Bill and the various obligations contained therein.  In view of this, there is no need for these amendments and I suggest that they be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>The appropriate qualification or experience should be spelled out because as the Bill is drafted an inspector of drains could be sent in to assess the psychological environment.  I <Col N="677" /> do not think that is appropriate.  I am not tying the Minister down to anything specific.  We are just saying &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;. We are not putting down a list of specific qualifications.  It seems reasonable to ensure appropriate qualifications. I do not want to be contentious and I hope that the Minister might be in a position to undertake to look at the situation again.  It is not an extravagant demand.  The question of appropriateness is an important principle with which I am sure the Minister and Senator Brendan Ryan would find themselves in partial agreement.</P>

      <P>In page 27, line 44, to delete &ldquo;excluding&rdquo; and in page 28, lines 1 to 11, to delete paragraphs (a) to (e).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not tempting fate but I half expected this to be ruled out of order because quite clearly if the inspection and registration procedures that are imposed on children's residential centres that are not institutions managed by the State were to be imposed it would involve a charge on the revenue.  I will not push this amendment to a vote because, re-reading this part of the Bill, I am aware that it would need some further thought to make it consistent.  I do not want to play around with inconsistent amendments.  I do not understand why institutions managed by or on behalf of a Minister or a health board should be excluded from a definition of children's residential centres. I read the Report Stage debate in the other House on this with interest but as I understand it, this Part VIII is dramatically different from Part VIII before Report Stage in the other House and in terms of the genuine concern that then existed that children's residential centres should be defined and registered the exclusion of institutions managed by or on behalf of the Minister or health board went a little bit by default.  I am not happy that any residential institution looking after children should be permitted to meet standards other than the highest possible.  My amendment simply deletes the exclusions from section 56 because they are quite wide-ranging. They cover all institutions managed by or <Col N="680" /> on behalf of a Minister or health board; an institution in which the majority of the children being maintained are being treated for acute illnesses and an institution for the care and maintenance of physically or mentally handicapped children &mdash; that raises interesting questions about mentally handicapped children who are taken into care for one reason or another; a mental institution within the meaning of the Mental Treatments Acts, 1945 to 1966; and an institution which is a certified school.  My amendment is to give notice that it is an unhappily generous exclusion in terms of the State's own responsibilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin by setting out the background to Part VIII of the Bill.  Under current legislation there are two categories of children's homes.  The Children Act, 1908, provides for the certification of certain homes as industrial schools.  However, for many years they have been withdrawn from the type of work which they were originally doing and they now cater for deprived and neglected children placed by the health boards.  There are 20 homes of this category and they include examples like St. Kieran's, Rathdrum; St. Vincent's in Drogheda, St. Anne's, Kilmacud; Gracepark and Mayfield in Waterford and Nazareth Home, Tralee.  The second category are those approved by the Minister for Health under the 1953 Health Act for the reception of children in the care of health boards.  Examples of these are Madonna House and Miss Carr's, both in Dublin and St. Muriel's Nursery in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While these two categories of homes are developed under two different statutes they now deliver a similar service for children in the care of health boards and all are funded by the health boards.  By virtue of section 64 it is intended that they would cease to be certified as industrial schools or approved homes as the case may be and would become children's residential centres.  Under existing law there is no requirement on a religious community or other body who propose to establish a residential home for children <Col N="681" /> to seek approval or recognition from a health board or from the Minister for Health.  The decision to apply for approval is entirely at their discretion.  In practice, the management of such homes generally apply for approval or certification in order to secure the commitment of financial support for the health boards for their operations.  In some cases, homes may be set up and operated without any direct support from health boards.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was originally introduced it provided for the continuation of this system of approval where applied for by the manager of a home.  At the Special Committee there was unanimous agreement that the Bill should be amended so that it would not be lawful for any person or any body to operate a home for children unless it was registered with the local health board.  The Bill was then amended to give effect to the desire of Deputies that a registration system for these homes be set in place.  I might add that the registration scheme is closely modelled on the new nursing home legislation which was recently passed by the House and has since been enacted into law.  I trust that based on this information the Senator will agree to withdraw this amendment and allow the situation that we have agreed at committee to prevail.</P>

    <Title>Tourism Initiatives: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, recognising the important contribution of tourism to the economy, requests the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to encourage all initiatives directed towards increasing Ireland's share of the world market, especially in view of the downturn in tourism consequent on the Gulf War and its aftermath.</P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to open the debate on what, after agriculture, is the most important contribution to the Irish economy, the tourism industry.  I should also like to take this opportunity of welcoming the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Lyons who has responsibility for tourism.  I look forward to hearing what he has to say in the context of the motion before the House.</P>
      <P>I will start on an optimistic note.  Contrary to earlier predictions, the latest tourism figures available from Bord Fáilte indicate that there will be an overall increase this year.  Last year we attracted 3.1 million overseas visitors, one million more than in 1987, and we are on target at the end of the first three years of the Government's five-year target for doubling tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, growth targets for this year will not be met.  The motion acknowledges the events of the early part of this year.  It has been a rather turbulent year so far due, of course to the Gulf War but also to the recession in our largest <Col N="683" /> market, Great Britain, and our third largest market, the United States.  The economic impact of unity on Germany has also had an effect on the thinking and attitudes of that country's population in relation to tourism this year.  It is rather disappointing that the heady days of the ending of the Berlin Wall and the promise and expectation of a more affluent Germany seems to have, while not coming to a shuddering halt, certainly had to be revised in the light of experience.  That is unfortunate not just for Germany but for us here in Ireland because mainland Europe has been targeted by Bord Fáilte as an area of substantial growth.  Last year almost 750,000 visitors came to Ireland and Bord Fáilte are confidently predicting an increase of 30 per cent plus in that market.  One can only welcome and encourage Bord Fáilte's marketing and their initiative in mainland Europe to realise that ambitious figure.</P>
    <P>It is virtually certain at this stage that there will be a significant downturn in the United States market.  Obviously our larger market, the United Kingdom, will not be as buoyant as heretofore but interestingly Bord Fáilte suggest that there will be an increase in the pure British holidaymaker as distinct from the friends and relatives sector.  Many of my colleagues, on all sides of the House who travel around the country will testify to the fact that in recent weeks there has been a welcome and significant increase in the number of UK registered vehicles on our roads.  Certainly in County Leitrim and in the area that might be loosely referred to as the lakeland area, the upper midlands, there has been a welcome increase in the number of coarse fishermen and their families since the beginning of May.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity on this side of the House of welcoming the British holiday maker back to our shores after an absence of several years due to the sad and continuing situation in Northern Ireland.  It must be a matter of great satisfaction to Bord Fáilte and all tourism interests that their persistent marketing of the positive image of <Col N="684" /> Ireland has helped to some extent to counteract the adverse publicity that emanates from this country among people abroad who take no more than a passing interest in the country's affairs and who, as those of us who travel abroad will testify, sadly have a perception of Ireland sometimes as an island engaged in a massive conflagration involving bombs and bullets on a regular and daily basis. I am glad that tourism interests and Bord Fáilte have managed to significantly counteract that, especially in our largest market.  The traditional British holiday makers who were the mainstay of the tourism economy when I was growing up in my part of the country, and in many others, have returned.  I hope they will find a welcome here and that when they go back home they will tell their friends who, in turn, will make a visit to the Emerald Isle next year.</P>
    <P>At a time of gloom and disappointment at the spiralling unemployment figures here it is heartening to learn that between 1988 and 1990 17,000 new jobs directly related to tourism were created in the economy, well ahead of the Government's target of 25,000 new jobs in the five year plan from 1988 to 1992.  At a seminar organised by Bord Fáilte in early May where those facts and figures were spelled out to tourism interests, I was pleased to see that the tone of the conference was upbeat.  Mr. Dully and his team at Bord Fáilte, specifically their head of communications Mr. James Larkin, pointed out that the 15 per cent growth target set by the Government was three times the international rate. Although we might not be meeting our growth targets this year obviously the Gulf War was as Mr. Larkin put it, the first punch in the solar plexus of the Irish economy.  He was still confident that there would be an overall growth in the Irish market.</P>
    <P>I would also like to add my voice of disappointment to that of Bord Fáilte and other tourism interests at the decision earlier this year of British Airways to pull out of Dublin.  Obviously, this is bound to have a knock-on effect.  According to the information supplied at that seminar <Col N="685" /> the decision affects US business particularly. British Airways carried 40,000 Americans last year and were able to offer entire back-track fares to Ireland from destinations such as Los Angeles, Dallas and Chicago.  Aer Lingus had done a marketing deal with British Airways to pick up some of that business but British Airways' agents were probably less enthusiastic about selling fares on Aer Lingus flights.  However, when a major airline of the international stature of British Airways pulls out of our capital city and out of our country it obviously must have an adverse effect.</P>
    <P>Like many interested in tourism I made my voice known to British Airways and expressed the concern of the tourism sector in my part of the world.  I am pleased to say that the British Airways management are conscious of the impact their decision could have on the Irish tourism industry.  They acknowledged that the decision was not easy and they hope it can be reviewed.  I hope that review will be carried out speedily and that there will be a return by British Airways to this country, with its attendant benefits.</P>
    <P>I am thinking specifically of Dublin as a capital city in a modern European Community context being literally wiped off the map of British Airways in travel agents all over the world at a time when Dublin, particularly in this year of culture, has been attempting to profile itself and present itself as a modern European city.  One cannot underestimate the damage that the withdrawal of British Airways has done to our tourism industry. I said at the outset that I would start with good news and I will maintain that momentum if possible.</P>
    <P>There are a number of specific issues that I would like to address.  This motion allows me the opportunity to direct some comments to the Minister, the first, strangely enough being one that he and his Department may not ultimately be responsible for.  In my contribution I will record what appears to be an anomaly in relation to the concept of agri-tourism. My understanding is that agri-tourism comes under the brief of the Minister for <Col N="686" /> Agriculture and Food rather than the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications.  Perhaps Minister Lyons will clarify that but it is rather strange that if that is the case the conditions attached to implementing the agri-tourism package must go through Bord Fáilte which comes directly under the brief of the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed by the conditions attached to the agri-tourism package. When this exciting proposal was first mooted in Irish tourism many of those involved, especially in my own part of the country &mdash; the Leitrim Tourism Council and people in other disadvantaged areas &mdash; welcomed the development as an important new initiative that would break the cycle of emigration and unemployment that has faced many of our people in disadvantaged areas.  These are areas which have a natural beauty which attracts tourism.</P>
    <P>The agri-tourism package was, at last, an opportunity for farming families to supplement their meagre incomes by going into the tourism business.  At least that was the theory.  The facts are somewhat different.  I had thought this would be an opportunity for small income farming families living on marginal land with no other visible means of support, apart from social welfare, or a breadwinner in the house &mdash; a son or a daughter &mdash; to supplement the family income by putting a room at the disposal of a potential tourist. Obviously standards would have to be met; standards must be maintained in the tourism industry if we are to have an effective image abroad, but that was not the case.  Bord Fáilte operate a system whereby they will only give a 20 per cent accommodation grant to a family wishing to get involved in agri-tourism.  That in itself might be a start.  However, the family who wish to avail of this grant must also provide a business plan to the regional tourism organisation, a plan which must incorporate the additional amenities that Bord Fáilte require before that family can enter the tourism sector. This is a detrimental step and is of no benefit to the small farming families at <Col N="687" /> which it was targeted, it will help only those who are already firmly established in the tourism industry, the people who do not need a great deal of financial help. They are the people who will benefit from the agri-tourism package as it is at present constituted.</P>
    <P>I hope in my limited contribution this evening to impress on the Minister the need for urgent reform in that area.  The main problem facing small farming families wishing to get involved in agri-tourism is the lack of seed capital, the lack of core capital.  It cost money to get involved in tourism and I would have thought that the concept of agri-tourism was to help those families who did not have the financial wherewithal.  Yet, they are excluded from the process as at present constituted.  If sufficient was granted to permit a faming family with one or two surplus rooms to convert the room or rooms into an acceptable bed and breakfast standard it would be a start.  Firstly, it would give them the incentive to get involved and, secondly, on the basis of the ongoing marketing and promotion now taking place in every county, particularly those that are tourist-oriented, they could eventually go back to Bord Fáilte and say that having got involved in the business and generated a certain amount of income they were now in a position to develop by putting in extra amenities and facilities.  As it is constituted, this package is of no benefit whatsoever to the small farmers of the west.</P>
    <P>This will be my final point, because, with the permission of the House, I wish to share part of my time with my friend and colleague, Senator Honan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like also to impress on the Minister, and on the House in general, the importance of coninuing an increased investment in the River Shannon.  Bord Fáilte have produced a special development area plan <Col N="688" /> for the River Shannon.  Many of my colleagues will refer to this in their contributions and, therefore, I will not go into it in detail.  Suffice to say that, as it affects the upper Shannon region, I welcome enthusiastically the commitment of the Government to ensure that the Ballinamore-Ballyconnel canal will be re-opened for cruiser traffic by 1994-95.  I welcome the injection of £30 million into the economy of Leitrim, north Roscommon and west Cavan.  It is a joy to observe the diggers and the JCBs as they operate up and down a stretch of the canal at Leitrim village, some four miles from where I live in Drumshanbo and to know that when the work is finished it and the surrounding areas will benefit substantially from the projected increase in tourism traffic as a result of the re-opening of the canal.</P>
      <P>I could not, in conscience, sit down without requesting the Minister and his Department to give the fullest support to the re-opening of the remainder of the Lough Allen canal which is some four miles up river from the existing Ballinamore-Ballyconnel canal.  Two-thirds of this canal has already been opened to cruiser traffic which would allow my colleague, Senator Honan to get on a boat in the Shannon Estuary near her home in County Clare and take a trip up to Drumshanbo, and she would land less than a kilometre from my home, where she would be most welcome.  However, if Senator Honan wished to investigate and discover the remainder of the upper Shannon regions, specifically Lough Allen itself, the first great lake on the Shannon, she would be denied that access due to the fact that the last small portion of the canal, some 300 metres, is still blocked off.  It is not filled in, just blocked off and ready and waiting for an injection of sufficient capital to re-open it.  If re-opened, the Shannon waterway would then be open to Ireland and the world for cruiser traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot make my argument any more eloquent or impress the Minister any more than I have attempted to do &mdash; and that the various local community interests have attempted to do &mdash; that <Col N="689" /> the amount of money involved is paltry compared to the £30 million going into the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell project. The projected price for the development of the remainder of the Lough Allen's canal could be less than £1 million.  The economic benefits which would accrue, not only to my immediate area, but to that whole region and, indeed, to the Leas-Chathaoirleach's area in County Roscommon would be immeasurable. The feasibility study carried out under the aegis of the Office of Public Works last year has now been completed.  That report is now with the Office of Public Works and I urge the Minister to use his best influence to ensure that a decision is taken soon in regard to the source of funding the completion of this canal project, a source of funding which I hope will come mainly from Europe rather than placing a drain on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I have just about exceeded my time as agreed with my friend and colleague, Senator Honan.  Once again I welcome the Minister.  This motion is important in its timing, coming as it does at the beginning of the tourist season.  I hope the contributions from all sides of the House, both tonight and next week, will contribute something important to the debate that has been taking place in Irish tourism circles over the last couple of months in the light of the Gulf War and the various recessions which our traditional markets have been experiencing. I hope the Minister will be able to give us some indication of the measures being taken both at national and local levels to encourage an increase in Ireland's share of the world's tourism market.  I welcome the motion.</P>

      <P>Tourism which is, and has been, growing so rapidly must be our major force in the business world now and if not now, certainly by the end of the century.</P>
      <P>I have said over and over again that our people are quite good at operating tourism and have proved it even in the European scene.  This is the only sector where I can see jobs being put in place right away.  Perhaps that is a pretty strong statement but with all the talk about job creation certainly the tourism industry is where I see an opportunity for job creation right now.</P>
      <P>Tourism expenditure is widely disbursed and it brings revenue and jobs to the most remote parts of our nation, often where few other sources of employment or, indeed, wealth creation, are available.  Tourism, as Senator Mooney stated, is also combined with agriculture. He elaborated on his worries and reservations about how successful the EC funding had been in that sector.  While supporting Senator Mooney, because he certainly has more knowledge of that sector than I have, I welcome the money that was put in place for those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must have a co-ordinated and properly focused regional development drive incorporating close co-operation between all sectors and various communities.

We, elected representatives are involved directly in tourism and job creation but if bodies are to be set up in the future there should be more discussion with elected members of local authorities.  I may be told that I say <Col N="691" /> that because they are the people who elected me but I say it because they are the people nearest the tourism industry and Governments and Ministers must listen to them in relation to tourism promotion, transport environment or communications.</P>
    <P>It has been recognised that our people have the capacity to make a success of the tourist industry.  We have to face up to the upset in the American market because of the recession and the aftermath of the Gulf War.  A senior person in the tourist world in the west recently said that although bookings for the last quarter of the year were in place, it will still be a hard slog.  I know the Government will not take any notice of the pressures put on them to overfly Shannon. Shannon will remain in place as our international airport not alone while this Government are in office but it will remain Government policy that there will be no overflying of Shannon no matter what pressures come from individuals.</P>
    <P>I do not mind Mr. Wall coming on national television and making a statement that he wants Shannon to be overflown and have flights direct to Dublin. That is Mr. Wall's business.  However, it is wrong for a senior Bord Fáilte official &mdash; and I am not referring to Mr. Dully but to another senior official on &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo;&mdash; to advocate overflying. Shannon is relevant to tourism because it is the life of not just the mid-west where tourists are concerned, but of the whole west coast and the midlands.</P>
    <P>I want to thank Minister Brennan and Minister Lyons for all their personal help in allocating Structural Funds.  I rarely put on record here warm thanks to Ministers.  I do not know where I am on their ballot papers when it comes to Seanad votes but in fairness to them I must put on record my personal thanks to the Minister, Deputy Brennan, for being so sensible about the amount of money he allocated to the west coast.  If <Col N="692" /> he continues that kind of support I should not have any worries about the overflying. We must all work together to maximise the potential from the funds.  The money is given in the belief that it will create employment.  We must together make sure that the money does provide jobs.</P>
    <P>Ireland has considerable natural advantages in terms of tourism.  It has a rich cultural heritage, a tradition for friendliness and hospitality and a relatively unspoiled environment.  Of course, when we are finished with Environmental Protection Agency Bill and all the other Bills there will be no litter anywhere.  But that is for another day.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a sector that I see as being strong and which should be taken more notice of by our Tourism Ministers.  I refer to the theatre and the arts sector.  I see at firsthand the success of a young company outside of Dublin which has drawn extraordinary support from visitors in the Waterford area.  I refer to the Red Kettle Theatre Company, not because somebody directly belonging to me is involved in that company; it is because it is fact.  It is being supported by visitors and people staying in all the hotels.</P>
    <P>There is some daft idea in this country of ours that top theatre should be for the people of Dublin only.  Indeed, the Minister here present has had firsthand knowledge that the theatre is very vibrant in his native Cork city.  My two colleagues opposite know it is excellent in Limerick.  The same applies to Galway and Waterford.  I think it is something &mdash; I have said this to Ministers but they are not listening &mdash; that more notice should be taken of and more funding given to it, because it is an attraction for our visitors. Our people again are good at theatre. The French, the English, the Germans and all the Europeans enjoy theatre, perhaps even more so than the Americans, and we should take a harder look at it.</P>
    <P>I referred to the airport and its importance: 2,000 people are employed directly in the airport and another 2,000 <Col N="693" /> indirectly.  It is supporting 10,000 to 12,000 people and their families.  I understand that when the Americans come to this country they spend a longer period in the west of Ireland and in the midlands than they would on a Dublin entry and Dublin exit.</P>

      <P>It is not local election stuff.  I did not wait until today or yesterday to defend Shannon.  All of us are aware that tourism is of tremendous importance to this nation.  I want to put on record this evening our thanks to the people who came here and invested big money in hotels, and also our own people, when tourism was not as vibrant or when we could not visualise the extraordinary results it is now bringing on stream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in the early part of my contribution, I do not see jobs coming as fast from other industries as I do from the tourism sector.  Again I thank all those who helped out in this sector.  There are certain things that we in Ireland can do well and tourism is certainly one of them. We should ensure that it is marketed well outside.  This is an area the Minister might well consider.  We are being asked if we are getting value for the money allocated to each Department.  Perhaps the Minister would see if we are getting value for the money allocated to Bord Fáilte for promoting tourism and bringing in visitors. If a check is being done on other areas like health, etc., let us examine where big money is being invested and see if we are getting the results from Bord Fáilte right down the line.  I want to again put on record our thanks to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, for sticking by the smaller person trying to invest through the BES scheme.  The Minister did make some changes in the BES in the last budget, but he left in place the help for the smaller person.  We must at this stage take full advantage of <Col N="694" /> the opportunities that the Single European Market will create during the coming decade and after.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to support this motion. I am sure my colleagues on the other side will have no trouble in supporting it and I thank my senior colleague, Senator Mooney, for moving it as spokesperson on tourism.  I hope the Minister took note of my remarks.  If I or Senator O'Toole is here in ten years' time I will still be talking about protecting the Shannon.  I manned it 30 years ago.  It shows how little the Senator knows about the west, even though he is a Kerryman.</P>

      <P>Ní mór dom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis na Seanadóirí a chuir an rún seo síos ar an bPáipéar, mar tá sé riachtanach é a chur ann ar son na turasóireachta.  Dá bhrí sin gabhaim buíochas leo.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senators for providing us with the opportunity to outline to the House the current position on the development of tourism and in particular the Government's response to difficulties created by the hostilities in the Persian Gulf recently.  It is entirely appropriate that Seanad Éireann should consider this important sector in our economy, one of our key growth areas which continues to contribute to economic progress and the creation of new jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to talk first about the Government's targets on tourism.  Our commitment to maximising the performance of the tourism sector remains steadfast.  Four years ago in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> tourism <Col N="695" /> was singled out as a key axis for economic growth with the potential to create substantial and sustainable jobs.  At that time we were accused of the ambitious programmes that we had set, and I acknowledge that they were ambitious programmes.  I will also say that we were determined and committed to the realisation of those ambitious programmes. Basically they were, for the period of 1988 to 1992, a doubling of overseas visitor numbers of over four million per annum, an increase in foreign revenue of £500 million and the creation of 25,000 jobs in the economy.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the performance of those ambitious but, in my view, attainable targets begun by us in 1987.  Central Statistics Office figures for 1990 show that our tourism remains in line with the targets at the end of year three.  Ireland has achieved growth in visitor numbers at more than twice the annual growth rate for world tourism generally.  In 1990, for the first time ever, total overseas numbers exceeded the three million mark. Since 1987 tourist traffic from Britain, our largest market, has grown by nearly 50 per cent; North America by 13 per cent; and continental Europe by a whopping 90 per cent.</P>
    <P>Tourist spending has kept pace with the growth in visitor numbers.  In 1990 the sector earned in excess of £1.1 billion in foreign revenue, an increase of £400 million over the 1987 figure.  When the burgeoning home market is taken into account the total sectoral earnings in 1990 amounted to approximately £1.5 billion. Tourism growth has been translating into the creation of new jobs in the economy at an average annual figure of about 5,000.  Total employment sustained by tourism is now in the region of 80,000 full time jobs, which equivalents up to some 16,000 on the 1987 figure.  Foreign tourism accounts for over 6.5 per cent of GNP, almost 7 per cent of exports and 6.8 per cent of total employment.</P>
    <P>We should ask ourselves the reasons <Col N="696" /> for the improvement.  Results reflect the total transformation of Irish tourism that has taken place since 1987 involving the adoption of a more sophisticated, marked-led approach by the industry.  Ireland consistently lost market share in the decade up to 1986 in all of our main markets; even the domestic market was in decline.  But since 1987 the marketing of Ireland as a holiday destination has been fundamentally overhauled.  Valuable lessons have been learned, and translated into action, about the need to market our tourism products skilfully, vigorously and selectively, matching specific products to particular markets segments and paying close attention to the demand in more affluent markets.</P>
    <P>Ireland's new tourism strategy has four key elements: to develop a more attractive and wider product range; to give better value in terms of quality and price; to achieve increased market penetration; and to ensure that our product is more widely available to potential customers. Emphasis is on the need to diversify the product range on offer and to improve its quality, value for money and overall attractiveness in a very competitive international environment.  Identification of selling opportunities is closely linked to favourable developments in access transport created by the Government's liberal air transport policies.  Increased competition has led to additional capacity, reduced air and sea fares, a more extensive network and improve services, all of which have proved to be key selling points for Irish tourism in recent years.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the Irish tourist trade itself has taken on greater responsibility for the task of selling their own products on the overseas markets, adding a new edge to Bord Fáiltes promotion and advertising. The record since the beginning of the 1987 tourist season has clearly shown the potential of Irish tourism to grow and develop.  The Government's firm commitment to the further expansion of the sector is set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which <Col N="697" /> specifies further challenging targets for the period 1991 to 1993.  They are: an increase in annual overseas visitor numbers by 1.4 million to 4.5 million, an additional £250 million in overseas revenue and the creation of a further 15,000 jobs.  The sector's record on investment since 1987 has been equally impressive. Investment for the three years of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> reached £420 million.</P>
    <P>Investment in tourism is being enhanced by the EC operational programme for tourism, involving a £300 million investment package to run to the end of 1993 and representing the single largest tourism investment programme in the history of the State.  Almost £150 million will come from the European Regional Development and Social Funds to assist investments by the private and public sectors in priority product development, training and marketing. Investment under the operational programme is being channelled into improving the range and quality of our tourism product, marketing and training.  To date, more than 200 projects have been improved involving a total investment of £225 million of which £71 million is being provided by the EC.  This investment will be a major factor in providing us with the facilities and the skills necessary to expand our specialist holiday business and to firmly establish Ireland as a quality destination in affluent international markets.</P>
    <P>I want to respond here to a point raised by Senator Honan about consultation with local authorities on the operational programme, etc.  I want to state that the monitoring of the operational programme for tourism provides for consultation with local interests including local authorities.  Seven sub-regional committees around the country meet on a regular basis to monitor the implementation of the programme and to communicate their views to the overall monitoring committee for the programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="698" /> Mention was made of the BES changes announced in the budget.  The re-direction of the BES announced in the budget will also help concentrate investment in the kind of facilities necessary to meet the needs of lucrative specialist markets.</P>
    <P>Senator Paschal Mooney raised the question of agri-tourism.  I will refer to that generally.  The agri-tourism scheme recently announced under the EC rural development programme will add a further dimension to our product development strategy.  For many years &mdash; in fact the Farm House Association is over 25 years in existence &mdash; farm-based holidays have been a feature of our overall tourism product and one which continues to rate above all others in terms of visitor satisfaction. It is important to remember that. We get our information from our visitors and farm-based holidays continue to rate above all others in terms of satisfaction by our visitors.  The new agri-tourism scheme provides an incentive for them to develop various aspects of their product range from various activities from pony trekking to sailing and interpretative centers. The scheme provides a significant opportunity for farmers and rural dwellers generally to better their own circumstances and at the same time contribute to the drive to establish the image of Ireland as a high quality destination offering a varied and interesting range of attractions in a traditional and natural setting.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the agri-tourism scheme is part of a wider package in the rural development programme, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  Bord Fáilte, because of their tourism expertise, are assisting in the administration of this programme. The conditions relating to grants, etc., have been agreed with the EC Commission.  However, I will communicate Senator Mooney's concerns on the question of agri-tourism to my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>I would like to dwell somewhat on the <Col N="699" /> peripherality of our nation, more particularly in the future when the Channel Tunnel is in place and when we will then be the only island nation of the EC.  In the period up to 1993 the EC operational programme on peripherality will provide investment of about £105 million for passenger terminal and associated facilities at Rosslare and at the State and regional airports throughout the country to accommodate planned growth in tourist traffic.  The £600 million road investment under the programme will enhance access between major urban centres, ports and airports.  Special attention is also being given to the improvement of roads providing access to tourism areas and to designated tourist routes and roads, including scenic routes within tourism areas.  Meanwhile the Government are seeking EC funding for the development of additional roll-on/roll-off ferry capacity on the direct routes between Ireland and mainland Europe.</P>
    <P>Minister Brennan recently met with EC Commissioners Millan and Van Miert in an effort to persuade them of the merits of Ireland's case.  The EC Commission have been asked to agree to co-finance this investment in conjunction with private sector interests.  I should mention that at the two most recent Transport Council meetings, when I was there representing Ireland, I insisted and ensured in the long run that the notion of Combined Transport, as our colleagues in Europe see it, and which embraces rail, road and inland waterways should be extended to include maritime transport.  This is necessary for us because of our peripherality.  I hope that the next meeting in Luxembourg, under the Luxembourg Presidency, will copper-fasten the inclusion of maritime into Combined Transport.  Having done that we will proceed to seek EC assistance and committment for moveable assets.  The Government have pointed out to the Commission that the future of Irish tourism and our economy as a whole will be <Col N="700" /> critically dependent on the competitiveness, speed and efficiency of sea and air access from here to other EC states.</P>
    <P>As you can see, the Government plans for the future development of tourism are positive, ambitious and multifaceted, involving a number of sectors. Clearly we do not envisage any let up in the vigorous efforts which have characterised the initial phases of our tourism expansion programme nor are we contemplating anything other than a continued rise in all of the key performance indicators.</P>
    <P>As well as tourism, nowadays we are all very concerned with the environment. As we might say as Gaeilge, tá sé i mbéal gach éinne.  The Government, as part of this broad based strategy, have also given top priority to the conservation of our natural environment, which remains the bedrock of our tourism.  Its unique quality has been a major strength and one of our strongest selling points in our overseas marketing drives.  At a recent workshop I said it was fashionable now in Europe, and now here, to be green.  In fact, we in Ireland have been green, not for decades, but for centuries; and it is as well that we ensure that we retain that natural environment and that we do not despoil it in any way.</P>
    <P>Careful management of the environment is a vital economic necessity as well as to a social issue and a strong emphasis on environmental protection is now a feature of all public policy.  This was underlined by the establishment in 1989 of a new office for the protection and improvement of the environment with its own Minister of State.  The Government are also committed to the establishment of an Environmental Protection Agency and the Minister for the Environment expects that the legislation establishing this agency will be enacted before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The concern expressed in the motion would indicate that 1991, because of the hostilities and other factors, might be a <Col N="701" /> difficult year.  Prospects for repeating the outstanding performance of Irish tourism over the last four years have been overshadowed somewhat by these international developments.  Even before the onset of the Gulf crisis Bord Fáilte had recognised that the downturn in the US economy and the perceived weakness of the US dollar would depress the demand for foreign travel generally in 1991.  Continuation of the Gulf crisis into the new year, culminating in the actual outbreak of hostilities, had a devastating effect on the normal pattern of overseas holiday bookings in North America.  Most Americans waited to see what would happen before committing themselves to overseas holiday plans.  Advance holiday bookings by Americans here and in our competitor countries were not made at any appreciable rate.  The ban on executive travel by major corporations caused cancellations or postponements of some conferences, incentives and other forms of group travel.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte, in common with many other tourism promotion agencies, put a hold on their major consumer advertising and promotional plans in the US while maintaining a presence in travel trade circles in anticipation of a pick-up in business later on in the year.  The board increased activities in certain specialist markets in Britain and Europe where the prospects of a positive return on the investment were more certain.  Our immediate concern was to ensure that steps were taken to minimise the adverse impact on our overall tourism efforts this year.  We were concerned that the atmosphere of uncertainly and predictions of disaster from some sections of the media would have the effect of confusing and unsettling our tourism industry to the extent that real business opportunities would be allowed to slip from our fingers. Subsequently, Government approval was secured for an additional allocation of £1 million to Bord Fáilte in the 1991 budget for further marketing and promotion in 1991.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> Immediately following the cessation of hostilities in the Gulf a meeting was held with key representatives of the Irish tourist industry in Dublin Castle to consider strategy to retrieve tourism business this season &mdash; in effect, to relaunch the 1991 tourism drive.  This conference was attended by the chairman and senior officials from Bord Fáilte, and 46 trade personnel representing a full cross-section of the industry, including air and sea carriers, the hotel and guesthouse sector, coach tour operators and incoming tour operators.  The conference identified encouraging prospects for further success in 1991 in the UK and continental European markets and concluded that prospects for the US market had much improved but would need an intensive, immediate, promotional campaign.  It was subsequently agreed with the EC to make available to the industry a further £1.25 million ERDF for campaigns in the US and later in the year in the British and continental markets at a special 75 per cent intervention rate.  There has been a very positive response by Bord Fáilte and the industry to this initiative.</P>
    <P>The new North American campaign was launched towards the end of April and included newspaper advertising in 11 major cities and in certain key national and regional magazines; a nationwide cable TV campaign and spot network TV advertising in the New York area, backed up by special offers and trade sales missions to key western and southern cities and incentive houses.  Bord Fáilte are confident that the campaign will help us increase a share not only of the leisure market but also of the incentive and small business travel sectors.</P>
    <P>We now have the benefit of CSO estimates for overseas visitor numbers for the first quarter of the year, in refining our plans for the 1991 season.  As expected, there is a drop in overall overseas visitor numbers compared to the same period last year, but the downturn of 3.5 per cent is not anywhere nearly as <Col N="703" /> bad as originally feared.  Traffic from the UK has remained more or less static, while continental Europe has actually shown an increase of 18 per cent, going a good deal of the way towards offsetting the 37 per cent decline recorded in the US market.  The US figure reflects the very depth of the Gulf crisis, long before our new promotional campaign came into play.</P>
    <P>The first quarter performance provides a timely reminder of the need for further effort if the opportunities of 1991 are to be seized to the full.  The special ERDF funded autumn campaign, which I have already referred to, is aimed at stimulating mid and late-season travel among people who had cancelled or deferred travel plans in the early part of this year. At this stage in our plan for doubling tourism, we can point to an impressive record of achievement.</P>
    <P>While we have encountered major problems this year in terms of both the Gulf crisis and recession in key markets, our response to this has been, and continues to be, both positive and realistic. We have refused to allow ourselves to be thrown into a panic by dire predictions. Instead, we are actively pursuing new business in growth areas to offset expected shortfalls elsewhere.</P>
    <P>As regards the North American market, which is presenting us and all of our European competitors with particular difficulties, the important thing to remember is that Irish tourism has responded not with faintheartedness but rather, by going on the offensive.  With the support of our new promotional campaign, we are battling vigorously for every scrap of business available from North America in 1991.</P>
    <P>Marketing strategy adopted since 1987 has succeeded in increasing annual visitor numbers by over one million.  This strategy and its key elements, including the benefits of a liberal access transport policy, will be maintained and developed. Investment levels will be maintained with <Col N="704" /> the assistance of the operational programmes for tourism, rural development and peripherality up to the end of 1993.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say Irish tourism has come through a process of complete revitalisation in terms of product development, marketing, promotion and economic performance, it is now better placed than ever to take on international competition.  The industry has shown itself to be both resilient in meeting challenges and flexible in seizing new opportunities. I am confident that these qualities will continue to carry us on towards the attainment of our goals in all markets in 1991 and in years beyond.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pleasure in supporting this motion and I compliment Bord Fáilte and all concerned with the tourist business for advances made and those that continue to be made in this vital area.</P>
      <P>Tourism, agriculture and industry are the three major earners of money for this nation.  Many vital services, such as health, education, law and order and so on, require money to be spent on them but cannot earn money themselves.  In tourism we have a definite and positive income earner that has been a good performer in recent times.  However, 1991 is proving a most turbulent year for international travel and very few people are willing or prepared to predict how things will go.  This climate of indecision reflects the aftermath of the Gulf War, Bord Fáilte, however, are currently predicting overall growth in tourism numbers again this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year we had 3.1 million overseas visitors, one million more than in 1987, and at the end of the first three years of the Government's five year plan for doubling tourism we are well on target. That is a good performance and credit ought to be given where it is deserved. Growth this year will fall short of our 15 per cent growth target because of the Gulf War crisis and because of recession in Britain, our biggest single market, and <Col N="705" /> in North America, our third largest market.</P>
    <P>We could usefully reflect for a few moments on our main and vital markets. Last year we had 744,000 visitors from mainland Europe.  This year we have set a target of a 30 per cent increase on that figure.  We have little reason to believe at this stage that we will not achieve this target.  In my view and in the view of many people in the travel world this will be a good year as far as tourist trade on the European scene is concerned.</P>
    <P>Last year we had 1.8 million visitors from Britain.  We will not meet our target this year of an 11 per cent increase on that figure; recession, which has affected business and visiting friends and relatives in that country, will upset our target quite significantly.  However, we expect a big increase in British holidaymakers and I hope we will come near our target in the end.  Last year 443,000 people visited our country from North America and we will not meet our 4 per cent growth target this year because of the recession in America and the Gulf War.  In addition, there is a current American preference for staying at home.  I hope this will change as the year progresses to give us a better return from that market than we now envisage. North American trade could be down as much as 80,000 persons in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The home market and the Northern Ireland market which can be taken together &mdash; the domestic business &mdash; is expected to be very buoyant during 1991. Last year was a record home holiday year; we were fortunate to have with very favourable weather and it is hoped that we will have a similar situation this year.</P>
    <P>Foreign earnings last year topped the £1 billion mark for the first time.  Professor Eamonn Henry of the ESRI has undertaken a study for Bord Fáilte which shows that 17,000 additional jobs were created in the economy in the years 1988-90 inclusive.  This is greater than the target figure of 25,000 which was set down for the five years up to 1992.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> Promotion of Ireland as a holiday destination involves funds from the Exchequer, from the tourism industry and from the ERDF.  We concentrate on those markets which will give us the most beneficial results, so this year our biggest push is in mainland Europe.  The top four countries targeted are France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.  An extra £400,000 has enabled advertising campaigns to run into May rather than finish at the end of April which is the normal time.  A big effort is being made to encourage British holidaymakers to visit Ireland; the south-east and midlands of England are key targets in this respect. In the US we have just completed a £1 million promotion funded by the tourism industry to the tune of 25 per cent and by the ERDF to the tune of 75 per cent.  It is only correct to reflect again on the target figures set in 1988 when we were starting from a position of 2.1 million tourists.  We set a target of 4.2 million tourists by the year 1992 and to increase revenue earning by an extra £500 million in the same period, thereby creating an additional 25,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>The achievement of these targets is vital and every effort must be made to enable the industry to reach them; nothing must be allowed to deflect the industry from its task or to dissipate its efforts in any way.  Bord Fáilte have done a magnificent job and have, in the last few years, been working under extremely difficult circumstances.  With three years of the five-year programme now passed we have an impressive result, in that 40 per cent more tourists have been attracted to Ireland since 1987.  We are meeting our target, revenue is ahead of the figure targeted in 1987, and, most importantly, jobs are being created.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to the importance of creating jobs fast.  Tourism has delivered the goods in this regard and has significantly more potential for exploration.  We have been sensible and have lessened our dependence on the North American market.  We are now <Col N="707" /> concentrating heavily on the European market with very impressive results; nearly twice as many Europeans as Americans come here on holiday each year.</P>
    <P>Agri-tourism has been referred to and while it is a buzz word at present it will provide new opportunities for the agricultural community but should not be seen as the panacea for all the problems of the rural community.  I urge rural communities to consider whether they can provide some productive activity to appeal to foreign tourists but these activities must be market-led and meet perceived needs; therefore, those seeking agri-tourism support should be professional in their approach.  There can be no intervention aid for over-produced rural tourism activities and Irish people should not rush headlong into this area. Properly developed agri-tourism can indeed play an important economic role.</P>
    <P>I want to make one vital point and I address this through the Chair to the Minister.  Agri-tourism is extremely important for the small farmer who needs to supplement his income but as the Minister is aware a farmhouse guesthouse must have a minimum of three bedrooms with appropriate washing and living facilities accompanying those bedrooms; this means a six-bedroomed house for the average family.  Few of the smaller farmers who should be helped by agri-tourism will qualify under those conditions.  Most families require three bedrooms for themselves which means having to erect three additional rooms; otherwise you are talking about a fairly substantial house owned perhaps by people not as deserving of assistance as the people Senator Mooney and others referred to.  It should not go unnoticed that many small farmers whom this agrtourism policy is designed to help are not going to be helped because of its restrictions.</P>
    <P>The question of seasonality is important and we must and can extend our <Col N="708" /> tourist season at both ends of the year. To this end we must develop many more amenities that will attract people for golf and other leisure activities that can be pursued perhaps in seasons other than spring or summer.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for more information to be conveyed to tourists about hotels.  Tourists are very cost conscious and are not always made aware of the middle price range and cheaper hotels. The mainstay of our tourist trade is the middle market and if we are to capture that market we must bear the cost factor in mind.  These people have limited resources to spend and we should inform then of the full range of hotel accommodation available.</P>
    <P>I agree that the advent of the Single European Market in 1992 presents us with enormous tourist possibilities and offers great development potential to us as a nation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the potential and development of the tourism industry.  I welcome the Minister to the Seanad and I note the important statements he has made.  He said that 6½ per cent of employment is derived from tourism and I venture to say that a greater proportion than that is provided by tourism in Donegal. The Minister also informed us of the proposed £300 million package for the development of tourism, which is very welcome.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, accessibility is going to be important to the potential development of tourist areas.  That is of particular interest to me coming as I do from County Donegal where we have much to offer to the tourist.  We may have more to offer than most counties and we remain as yet relatively undeveloped.  We are particularly interested in tourism proposals because we have nearly 12,000 school leavers in the county and our hopes and aspirations are that many of those young people will find a job and a future in tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="709" /> The Minister referred to accessability. My county has particular difficulties because of its proximity to the Border and I want the Minister to take particular note of that.  County Donegal is at a disadvantage because of distance from mainland Europe where ease of access is a deciding factor among holiday-makers. However, my county enjoys unspoiled, undeveloped natural emenities and our national park at Glenveagh, which opened a couple of years ago, has been an outstanding success, with 200,000 visitors in 1990.</P>
    <P>The vast areas for potential development in my county must be recognised. County Donegal has taken the lead in hotel training; the catering college at Killybegs trains students not only for the county but for the whole of the country. 400 students are enrolled at present and there is full employment available for those students when qualified so I impress on the Minister how important it is to make sure that most of the £300 million is not taken up by the few giants in the industry who would leave little or nothing for the regions I am referring to.  I call on the Minister to recognise that tourism regions must be given teeth and funding and tourism must become more than a talking point.</P>
    <P>The north-west tourism region covers Cavan, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal.  That area must be looked at to ensure it receives its fair share of funding because it has suffered many disadvantages.  Promotional funding exists but the people who get the largest share of the promotional cake are not concerned with the north-west region.  Bord Fáilte get the money and spend it on marketing in areas where beds already exist mostly in the south and in Dublin.  We lose on the double because development is not initiated in the north-west region and we fall further behind the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>Are Bord Fáilte going to continue to represent the small number of people who have been successful?  The tourism development potential of the whole of <Col N="710" /> the country should be examined and I ask the Minister if it would be possible to restructure Bord Fáilte for sales and promotions only and to give greater and more direct funding to regional tourism organisations?  My colleague, Senator Honan, raised the question of Shannon. I say, &ldquo;hands off Shannon.&rdquo;  However, a conflict between us would achieve nothing.  I believe strongly that small regional airports like Knock have a major tourism role to play and must not be placed under a burden.  I seldom fly through Shannon but one could make a case to retain Shannon and other regional airports like Knock.  There are two sides to that story and I am not going into the details here today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The BES scheme has been a major help to the tourism industry and I deplore the fact that it is in danger &mdash; the Minister will know what I am saying &mdash; of being hijacked by financial institutions and by international firms of accountants who will have a major input to the BE scheme in selecting the beneficiaries. It is necessary for the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to watch the areas where funds are invested under the BE scheme, because I and other Members realise that there is a danger of funds being invested in safe areas.  That was never the intention of the scheme.  The BE scheme is designed to cater for risk capital.  The institutions that now control the placing of that funding are placing it in developments where the risk is less.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to get people to invest in BES projects in rural Ireland.  The west, and particularly my county, has a lot to offer.  We have most to gain as our jobs and our future depends on the tourism industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that the Minister for State is here because I know the interest he takes in these matters and the attention he gives to replies.</P>
      <P>The motion is self-explanatory.  I am sure the Minister knows that up to 1983 there were no charges.  In February 1983 charges were first introduced.  I applaud any Government or Department who try to balance their budget and raise much needed revenue.  I am not of the school that thinks that money grows on trees and that we can spend recklessly without having to finance the various Departments.</P>
      <P>I presume the Minister will tell us the fees were introduced to raise revenue.  I would like to make it clear that it is perfectly equitable that a developer when applying for permission to undertake a major development should have to pay fees both to the planning authority for the large amount of work which they have to undertake and to the Department, if there should be an appeal.  My remarks this evening do not affect those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When these charges were introduced in 1983 it was £36 for a third party appeal. That was for an individual who was not party to the appeal.  One had to pay £10 to write a letter to the local authority to make a point &mdash; to point out perhaps something which in your opinion might be invalid in the application.  You might want to bring something to their attention. You might notice, as I did recently, that an application stated that there had been planning permission for a house where in fact there was not.  The residents' association wrote to the corporation. At that stage also £10 had to <Col N="712" /> be paid if you wished to bring an observation to the attention of the planning appeals board even if you supported the local authority and were on their side.</P>
    <P>These charges, which put a very heavy burden on third party appellants, were considered outrageous by voluntary organisations, resident associations, ACRA, An Taisce and a large number of groups who mounted a fairly sustained protest.  Thankfully, we must be grateful for small mercies, in February 1985, about two years after it had been introduced, the £10 charge for making an observation to the corporation was dropped. Those who were involved were very grateful for that although they were very disappointed that all the charges were not dropped.</P>
    <P>The situation continued until February 1990.  Everything seems to happen in February in the Minister's Department. In February 1990 the £36 fee for an appeal was increased to £50.  The £10 fee for an observation made to the appeals board went up to £15.  Now £50 has to be paid to request an oral hearing, irrespective of whether you are granted it.  I do not know what percentage of requests are granted; by merely asking if they would be prepared to have an oral hearing you have to pay £50.</P>
    <P>There were also charges &mdash; I will not go into them in too much detail because I am sure the Minister is already aware of them &mdash; for making a reference.  These are very often of importance.  My own residents' association, the Upper Leeson Street Area Residents' Association, being very concerned and distressed to see the great damage to the environment in the city by the introduction of very out of place and incongruous PVC aluminium windows made a reference to the board to ascertain whether the board consider it is exempted development or not.  There again there are charges made for that. To my knowledge, those references are made fairly rarely so I would not be as concerned about them.  It is the other ones that I want to speak about.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> I know that An Taisce, An Bord Fáilte and the fisheries board &mdash; I am not sure if there is a fourth one &mdash; pay only 50 per cent.  They pay only 25 per cent if they want to take an appeal and they do not pay anything for making an observation.</P>
    <P>I have been interested in planning for a great number of years and I am, as a community alderman in Dublin City Council for 17 years, very closely in touch with the residents' associations and voluntary groups not only in the Pembroke Ward and perhaps the Rathmines Ward but throughout the city.  These charges are a very great burden on local residents' associations, voluntary groups and groups whose prime purpose is to assist the statutory bodies in preserving and protecting our environment.  These people are all voluntary workers.  They devote a great deal of their spare time to the activities of their local community groups or residents' association or whatever it may be.  It is most unfair to expect them now &mdash; which is what has happened since the fees were increased &mdash; to engage in continuous fund raising.  Subscriptions from their members are no longer able to cover all these charges.</P>
    <P>These organisations are also involved in a great deal of social activity and good work generally in their areas.  They organise oldfolks parties at Christmas and have street parties in the areas in summer time to enhance and develop the feeling of community and closeness in the locality.  Last year Sandymount entered the Tidy Towns Competition for the first time and I am very happy about that.  To do that successfully involves spending a great deal of money on equipment and so on.  Many associations take part in clean-ups.  Only last evening the Wellington branch of the Upper Leeson Street Association were out voluntarily tidying the verges, trimming, cutting and so on.  In Belgrave and Dartmouth Square the residents were active in pressurising the local authorities to open the parks to the public.  That was very worthwhile and much appreciated.  They <Col N="714" /> run garden competitions.  In Beechwood they have been involved in tree planting. They are also very successfully involved in recycling programmes which the Minister knows are extremely important.  St. Mary's Road, for instance, spent a lot of time getting residential parking permits introduced in their area.  There are a great range of things which a local association does and they are all, the Minister will agree, immensely beneficial.</P>
    <P>It has now reached the stage where these associations find themselves unable to undertake many of these worthwhile projects because they need money to pay the Minister's Department the lousy £50 for the appeal and another £50 for the oral hearing, etc.</P>
    <P>Local authorities, and certainly in my case Dublin Corporation, depend very heavily on local knowledge provided by these organisations to &mdash; and I do not like to use the word &ldquo;police&rdquo; the area &mdash; bring to the attention of the local authority if a house is being allowed to decay or to be illegally pulled down, if an office has been illegally put into a building and so on. The Minister knows it is simply not possible for the local authority to have planning inspectors going around day and night watching for these things, so they rely on local associations for information. In the same way when a planning application comes before a local authority, very often they do not have local knowledge and expertise so they depend on letters from residents' associations, which, of course, are received.  But when residents' associations want to send in a letter to the planning appeals board they find they have to pay £15.</P>
    <P>In Dublin there were eight planning inspectors for the entire city and now there are seven.  The situation is becoming more and more difficult.  Instead of discouraging these local organisations from assisting the planning appeals board, which is under the Minister's aegis, they should be encouraged to feed information to the planning board.  That would save a great deal of money.  The <Col N="715" /> Minister will agree that it is very difficult for seven inspectors to do anything worthwhile.  Very often these associations have to engage senior counsel or solicitors and go to court.  There was a very famous case which I am sure was seen recently about the Richard Crosbie Tavern in Ranelagh where the residents association in east Ranelagh spent £1,500 in 1990 on a court case plus another £700 for an appearance.  This year they spent £9,000 trying to prevent this massive pub which can accommodate about 1,000 being granted a licence.  They do this not in any way to try to discourage legitimate business but because they know that it would make this an intolerable area in which to live.  In my own area every association I know takes an average of two to three appeals, some of them take more.  In addition to that I would like to remind the Minister that they have to spend £30 to get the planning list from the corporation.  There is a whole range of expenses with which they are involved.</P>
    <P>I mentioned how a planning authority depend on a local association for information. When a developer appeals against a decision by the local authority, the corporation attends the planning appeal as does the local residents association. Very often they are able to add considerably to the information available which is invaluable to the inspector making a decision.  I remember about 20 years ago when I was a very young girl I went to my first planning appeal.  It was in the days when there were three or four planning appeals in one morning.  It is quite different now, they have all become so complicated.  The solicitor for the corporation had already done three appeals and I suppose he was fairly exhausted. This particular one was the last one and he said to the inspector, &ldquo;I just want to open the case but there is somebody here beside me who knows far more about this than I do&rdquo;.  I was very young and very nervous in those days but he turned to me and I had to literally put the whole <Col N="716" /> case.  As it happened, he was quite right, as I knew far more about it and had much more detail.  That may be an extreme example but it shows the extent to which the corporation can depend on a local authority.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister will be able to accede to some reduction in this heavy burden of charges.  If a residents' association make an observation to a local authority about an application, and if there is an appeal, the local residents association's observations are not sent on, although the public assume that they are. That means that the local association have to make the observation to the planning appeals board and pay £50.  I will not go on too long.  I am sure the Minister has got the thrust of what I am saying but I hope he will not say, as some of his predecessors have done, that all of this is to deter frivolous appeals being made.  I know and the Minister knows that £50 will not deter any genuinely frivolous, if that is not a contradiction in terms, applicant.  In 20 years of being involved in planning I have never come across a frivolous appeal.  I am aware that they are made and that disgracefully on some occasions people make a frivolous appeal simply so they can go along to the developer and say &ldquo;pay me so much and I will withdraw the appeal&rdquo;.  If those are the sort of people we are thinking about a fee of £50 will not deter them because there is far more at stake.  In the planning Acts there is a very strong section which deals with frivolous appeals and they can be thrown out straight away.</P>
    <P>We must try to pay our way but I do not think it is reasonable to ask that people pay their way to such an extent that they are denied involvement in the democratic process.  What is happening is that these associations are no longer in a position to be involved in the planning process.  Even in an extreme moment of wondering where the Minister might get money from, I am sure he would never contemplate asking people to pay to go out and vote in an election, which is also <Col N="717" /> taking part in a democratic process, but he is making people pay to participate in the democratic processes of planning, thus denying them a democratic right.  I heard from the Minister, Deputy Flynn, that the Department are anxious that local democracy should get a little airing now &mdash; it has not had much for 20 or 30 years.  Some very nice things were said. Mind you, we did not see much of it in the recent Bill.  If the Minister would like to make one small but significant contribution to local involvement by people this is, I suggest, a good place to start.  I thank the Minister for his attention and I hope we will hear a favourable response from him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Senator's views with great interest.  However, I do not believe that the fees payable to An Bord Pleanála in relation to appeals or oral hearings are excessive or that they prevent participation in the planning process.  I should explain that provision for payment of fees to An Bord Pleanála was made in section 10 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1982, which empowered the Minister for the Environment to set the fee levels by regulation. The purpose of section 10, which also provided for fees in respect of applications for planning permission, was to ensure that persons participating in the planning process would make a reasonable contribution towards the considerable cost of operating that process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current fees payable to An Bord Pleanála came into operation from 1 February 1990, under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development Fees) (Amendment) Regulations, 1989 S.I. No. 338 of 1989. I wish to emphasise that this was the first revision of these fees since 1985 and that the only purpose of the revision was to ensure that income from fees would continue to meet a reasonable proportion of An Bord Pleanála's costs.  I refute any <Col N="718" /> suggestion that the fees were increased to discourage appeals.  In fact, the evidence shows that the revision did not affect the level of appeals.  The number of appeals in 1990, when the revised fees were in operation, was almost the same as the previous year.  There were 3,002 appeals in 1990 compared to 3,018 in 1989.  That speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>I reject suggestions that the current fees are excessive by pointing out that the fee for appeals generally is £50 and an objective observer would have to agree that this is a reasonable amount bearing in mind the elaborate and expensive procedures which are called into play when a person appeals to An Bord Pleanála against the planning authority's decision.  I do not accept that this fee is prohibitive or that it would deter the voluntary community or residents' association from exercising a right of appeal to the board.  Similarly, the fee for a request for an oral hearing, also £50, is set at a reasonable level and does not prevent the exercise of rights given by planning law.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that the board must examine any request for an oral hearing in great detail to see whether the circumstances of the appeal would warrant the holding of a hearing.  I consider that a fee of £50 is no more than a reasonable contribution towards the costs the board incur in considering an oral hearing request.  The revised fees introduced last year took account of the position of the voluntary organisations and community groups.  The fee for an appeal relating to a proposed commercial development was raised to £100 in the case of a developer but was set at £50 for other appellants.  This means that a community or a voluntary group can appeal against any development, no matter how major, for a fee of only £50.</P>
    <P>It is a bit far-fetched to try to contend that a fee of this amount would present an impossible obstacle to a group who wish to appeal to the board on a proposed <Col N="719" /> development about which they have concerns or reservations.  I should add that the 1990 revision of the fees retained the existing arrangement under which a reduced fee was payable for appeals by certain organisations.  I draw the Senator's attention to the fact that bodies like An Taisce and the Royal Irish Academy may appeal to the board against the planning authority's decision for a fee of only £25.  There can be no argument about the reasonableness of this fee.  It demonstrates that the regulations take account of the position of the voluntary and community organisations.</P>
    <P>I consider also that the fee of £50 for references to the board about exempted development and for the other matters to be determined by the board is a reasonable amount.  A reduced fee of £25 applies in the case of certain organisations. I am satisfied also that the fee of £15 for persons who wish to make submissions or observations to the board about an appeal or other matter is reasonable and would add in this connection that certain organisations, including An Taisce, are wholly exempt from this fee. It is useful also to put the fees payable to the board in context by looking at the contribution they make to the board's finances.  The board's fee income last year <Col N="720" /> was approximately £230,000 but the Exchequer grant from my Department was £1.5 million, so the fees only accounted for 13 per cent of the total amount.</P>
    <P>The fees collected do not go to the Department of the Environment but to An Bord Pleanála.  I have long experience with local authorities and I want to say that no member of the public or an organisation has ever approached me in regard to the planning fee.  Many think this fee is reasonable.  The fees that are paid go directly to the board.  It is only a small contribution to a board who are totally independent.  I am satisfied that these are very reasonable amounts.  Some organisations are exempt from paying the fee and for others the fee is halved.  The number of appeals in 1989 and last year was 3,000 approximately.  There was no fall-off in the number of appeals coming before An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Senator Hederman raising the matter but I want to assure the Senator that throughout the country, and I travel a lot throughout the country, that has never been a problem and has never been brought to my attention by any individual or any organisation.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6 June 1991.</P>
