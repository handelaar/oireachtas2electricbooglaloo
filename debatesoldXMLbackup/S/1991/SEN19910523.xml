      <P>I have notice from Senator Jackman that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to take positive steps to reduce the burden of the cost of third level education to the middle income PAYE sector.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to take appropriate measures to provide suitable facilities to ensure that the people of the north inner city are safeguarded from joyriding, drug dealing and other anti-social activities in their daily lives.</P>
      <P>Tá fógra agam ón Seanadóir Ó Foighil:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Jackman, Costello and Ó Foighil as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Jackman's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Costello and Ó Foighil <Col N="70" /> may give notice another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Second Stage of the Payment of Wages Bill, 1991 until 1 o'clock.  There will be a sos between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m., and from 2 p.m. until 4 p.m. there will be a discussion on the education motion.  It is suggested that we have no more than 20 minutes for the opening speeches and 15 minutes thereafter for each Senator.</P>

      <P>I hope you will indulge me a little as I want to raise a small matter.  This day 40 years ago something very sad happened in the world.  It was the day on which China formally annexed Tibet.  Could I suggest that the good wishes of this House &mdash; at least informally &mdash; would go out to the 40 years' oppression they of Tibet for the 40 years' oppression they have suffered since then?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned at the time schedule for the education debate.  I do not think many speakers will get in if we have speeches which run to 20 minutes for opening speakers.  We would be happy to see a reduced period of time available to everybody if the debate has to finish in two hours.  Ten minutes or a quarter of an hour would be acceptable to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what Senator B. Ryan said about the problematic and tragic case of the people of Tibet.  It is appropriate because this country tried to ensure the rights of the people of Tibet, as well as being the country that supported the admission of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations.  We have a very strong pivotal role there.  I am glad that an opportunity <Col N="71" /> was afforded.  I am sure it expressed the views of all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if it is proposed to grant time for a debate on the Middle East?  We did have a debate about that Gulf War, but there is now a situation where a debate in this House could be helpful.  There is a man at the moment in Tel Aviv, Abby Nathan, a peace campaigner, the owner of the Voice of Peace radio station, who is starving himself to death in protest against the treatment of the Palestinian people.  I have also been approached by Amnesty International concerning the proposed execution of the man who assassinated Abou Iqad.  A voice of peace coming from Ireland could be useful in the international forum.  Therefore I would ask the Leader of the House to consider urgently the possibility of granting us a debate on the Middle East so that considered voices from Ireland which take a balanced view in this matter could be heard.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my voice to those who want to extend the time devoted to the debate on education. This House has given roughly six hours to a debate on student exchange with the United States, which is a very minor part of our educational programme.  Now we are proposing two hours for our educational programme at home.  We should extend that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of speakers raised the question of extra time for the education debate.  We have had motions of this kind and a number of education debates.  There is also provision for matters on the Adjournment.  We have one today from Senator Jackman.  We have had Private Members' Time devoted to education.  There has been a great deal of time devoted to debates on education in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion by Senator Upton that we reduce the opening speeches to 15 minutes and allow ten minutes for each Senator, if the House <Col N="72" /> agrees to that I have no objection.  That might be the way forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not solve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of a debate on the other matter was not appropriate to the Order of Business.  Senator Norris raised the question of another debate on the Middle East.  We have had two debates on the Middle East problem.  At this point I have no proposal for a third debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Raftery's point was also dealt with in regard to the general query about the extension of the time for the debate on education.  The way forward may be to take up the suggestion by Senator Upton of 15 minutes for the opening speaker and ten minutes thereafter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Not really.  I do not want to be difficult about this but if you have four speakers for 15 minutes each, that is one hour.  Then the Minister speaks for half an hour.  There is time for only two or three other speakers and that is not sufficient.  What I am proposing is that the motion not be concluded today and that it can be taken again some other day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness, the Minister has been told it is a two-hour debate. That has been agreed by the Whips.  If the Minister does not mind coming in some other day, although my view is that we should conclude the debate this evening, I have no objection.  We could resume the debate on another day but at this point the debate this afternoon will be from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.</P>

      <P>If we are having a special debate on education it is a bit of a farce to have the debate for just two hours.  There are quite a few people who want to speak.  It could be three or four hours, or we could do as I proposed and have it open-ended so that the debate could be taken another day.  There are plenty of days in June.</P>

    <Title>Payment of Wages Bill, 1991: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House is of significant historic interest.  Legislation relating to payment of wages reaches as far back as 1464.  The legislation in force today spans the period 1743 to 1896 and is commonly referred to as the Truck Acts.  The central purpose of these Acts was to stamp out abuses associated with the payment of wages to manual workers in kind.  They dealt also with other issues such as deductions from wages and interest charges on advances of pay.</P>
      <P>In recent times, the Truck Acts have been seen as a major barrier to the more widespread use of non-cash methods of wage payments.  The Payment of Wages Act, 1979 sought to address this issue and was in some measure successful. However, that Act stopped short of a fundamental review of the Truck Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Historical records suggest that some of the concerns about trucks in past centuries were as much about limiting unfair <Col N="74" /> competition in trade as about protecting the interests of workers.  The financial value to some employers of paying by truck was such that competitors were likely to go out of business unless they followed suit.  Perhaps, before we consider repeal of the Truck Acts, it would be prudent to briefly review their purpose.</P>
    <P>The Truck Act, 1831 consolidated previous legislation and was geared particularly towards protecting workers against employers who forced them to accept domestic goods and provisions from the company shop in lieu of money wages. The company shop itself was often stocked with inferior goods at inflated prices.  Sometimes, as one contributor to the 1831 debate in the House of Lords pointed out, the employee was likely to have &ldquo;thrust upon him more bacon or more flour than he had occasion for... The articles which were given to him in lieu of wages were frequently things which were perfectly useless to him&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>By 1887, most employers were paying wages in accordance with the Truck Acts but other abuses had crept in.  Employers were now, according to the Commons debates of 28 June, 1887, exacting &ldquo;enormous interest and discount charge for advances, amounting in many cases to 300 and 400 per cent&rdquo;.  The Truck Act of that year amended this loophole, among others.</P>
    <P>Then in 1896, the last of the old Truck Acts was placed on the Statute Book.  By that date further abuses which involved deducations made by employers from wages had become prevalent.  One contemporary commentator suggested that many of the fines deducted by employers from wages were &ldquo;of the most trivial description and so vexatious as virtually to amount to a system of slavery on the part of employees&rdquo;.  The 1896 Act restricted the circumstances in which deductions could be made from wages and set out the procedures to be followed by employers in making deductions.</P>
    <P>There is a widespread perception that the Trunk Acts outlawed the payment of wages by cheque.  This is not the case. The Truck Acts allowed an employer to <Col N="75" /> pay an employee by cheque, provided the employee consented and the cheque was drawn on a bank which was both licensed to issue bank notes and was within 15 miles of the workplace.  Through an accident of history this provision of the Trucks Acts was rendered ineffective by the Currency Act, 1927.  That Act deprived commercial banks of the power to issue bank notes and inadvertently had the consequent effect of making the payment of wages by cheque under the terms of the Truck Acts impossible.</P>
    <P>Perhaps before moving on from this historical review, I should advert briefly to the Truck Act of 1743.  This Act was passed by the pre-Union Irish Parliament which sat in Dublin until June 1800.  It is, I believe, one of a few remaining Acts of that Parliament which are substantially intact on the Statute Book.  The Act was the only one governing truck in Ireland from its passage in 1743 until 1887.  In that year, the 1831 consolidation of the Truck Acts was extended to Ireland.  The 1743 Act, however, was not repealed in 1887 as might have been expected and has remained in force to this day.</P>
    <P>My own interest in the Truck Acts is of more recent origin, prompted by a variety of modern-day concerns about effective and cost-efficient methods of wage payments.  Throughout Europe, there has been a clear move away from cash wages.  Of the countries where figures are available, Denmark appears to have the highest level of non-cash wage payment, with 95 per cent of employees paid otherwise than in cash.  Some other European countries, including Spain, Belgium, and the former West Germany, all report levels of non-cash wage payment in the range 75 per cent to 90 per cent.  In the United Kingdom, the percentage of employees paid wages, otherwise than in cash, is around 65 per cent. Ireland is at the bottom of the league. An FIE survey some years ago showed that just under half of all employees in this country were paid by a mode other than cash.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, the move towards non-cash pay is gaining momentum in this <Col N="76" /> country.  In some cases, security problems arising from armed robbery of payroll cash, have been a major motivation. In other cases, the adoption of non-cash wages has been part of an attempt to harmonise the conditions of white collar and blue collar workers.  The trend has also been facilitated by advances in new technology.  Computers are now a feature of even the most modest business concern in the country.  The efficiency, economy and security of computer based payroll systems have encouraged employers to adopt a unified system of wage payment for all employees.  These advances have, of course, been a spur to change mainly on the employers' side.</P>
    <P>There is, perhaps, just one persistent trend most affecting the attitudes of employees to non-cash wages.  That is the significant change in banking practices which has taken place in recent years. The trend towards more flexible banking, longer banking hours and 24 hour automatic teller machines have all contributed to weakening employee resistance to non-cash wages.</P>
    <P>Aware of these developments and the likelihood of even more rapid future progress, I published a discussion document in November 1987.  The document examined, among other things, the options for repeal of the Truck Acts and for new legislation governing the payment of wages.  The views of all the interests concerned were sought in the resulting consultative process.  More recently, arising from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, I undertook to finalise legislation which would facilitate the move towards non-cash wage payment. The programme committed me to the introduction of a wages Bill during the spring of 1991.  I have, unfortunately, overshot this target &mdash; if just by a whisker.</P>
    <P>A review of the Truck Acts has been long overdue.  As we have seen, almost 100 years have elapsed since 1896 when the most recent of the Truck Acts was passed by the Parliament at Westminister. Not surprisingly, the Truck Acts are being seen, with some justification, as <Col N="77" /> archaic and irrelevant to modern employment conditions.  In some ways these charges are true.  Certainly, the language of the Truck Acts and the bulk of their provisions are out of keeping with today's requirements.  In other ways, the Truck Acts are anything but outdated.  In some sense they embody an essential philosophy which is at the heart of the employment relationship &mdash; a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.</P>
    <P>My purpose in this Bill is twofold: to put in place new provisions for the payment of wages which will meet current and future requirements and to repeal the Truck Acts which have outlived their usefulness.  In doing so, I hope I have garnered for this Bill something of the essence of their philosophy and transformed it into terms which will be relevant to the late 20th century and beyond.</P>
    <P>One view expressed to me in the course of the preparation of this Bill has been that the payment of wages is fundamentally a matter of contract law and, as such, should be left entirely for determination between the parties to the employment contract.  In this view, the best legislative approach would have been simply to repeal the Truck Acts. There is a certain attraction in this approach, particularly if one is of the opinion that the employment relationship has progressed to a stage where employers and employees meet on an equal contractual basis.</P>
    <P>Progress has certainly been made. However, I am inclined to the view, informed by day-to-day experience, that the employment relationship is seldom an equal one.  Where unfair contractual arrangements persist in an employment contract, the employee may feel powerless to oppose them.  There are, of course, good employers who do not exploit the employment contract by imposing unfair contractual arrangements.  Equally, strong unions may ensure, through the threat of industrial muscle, that its members are not subject to unfair contractual provisions.  However, important rights of the nature proposed in this Bill should not be in the gift of either a benign employer or a strong trade union.  They <Col N="78" /> should be available to an employee as a matter of course, as a matter of legal right.</P>
    <P>My approach, therefore, has been not just to repeal the Truck Acts but to replace them with new and different protections for employees in relation to the payment of wages.</P>
    <P>I have also taken a new view on the scope of wage payment legislation.  The Truck Acts dealt only with the wages of manual workers.  In general, there was no legislation governing the payment of wages to other categories of employee. The payment of their wages are mainly a matter of contract and common law. However, while there was no direct legislative protection for white collar workers, the Truck Acts would have benefited them indirectly.  Any employer obliged to adhere to the Truck Acts standards in the case of manual workers would be unlikely to impose less favourable arrangements on white collar employees. Repeal of the floor of rights enshrined in the Truck Acts has thus raised issues relating to the protection of both manual workers and other categories of employee.  I have decided, therefore, that this Bill will, for the first time, confer on all employees a range of rights relating to the payment of wages.</P>
    <P>There are three basic rights enshrined in the Bill &mdash; the right of every employee to a readily negotiable mode of wage payment; protection against unlawful deductions; and the right to written statement of wages and deductions.  The philosophical roots of the first two of these rights are to be found in the Truck Acts; the third is of more recent origin.</P>
    <P>The Bill will facilitate the movement from cash to cashless pay which has advantages for employers and employees alike.  For employees there are advantages in being paid through a bank account, through having less cash at risk of theft or loss and in having access to other services, such as a facility to pay bills by cheque or standing order, etc.  For employers there are considerable savings arising from administrative efficiencies. Staff are not longer needed to make up <Col N="79" /> pay packets and security and insurance requirements are diminished.</P>
    <P>Some employee interests have suggested that the Bill should include a right for employees to time-off for the cashing of cheques.  I think this is an issue best left for discussion and arrangement between employer and employees at local level, depending on the circumstances, like the location of individual firms the distance to travel and local services.  The prospective savings of a move to cashless pay may encourage some employers to offer other incentives to their employees to opt for a change-over to some form of cashless pay.  Initiatives by employers, in co-operation perhaps with banks and other financial institutions and in consultation with their employees and their unions, could in my view go a long way towards providing the necessary momentum for change.</P>
    <P>I would like now to bring Senators briefly through the main provisions of the Bill.  The Bill requires every employer to pay wages by one of the modes of payment listed in section 2.  Basically the list covers all the widely recognised means of paying money &mdash; from cheque and money orders, to bank drafts, credit transfers and cash.  Rapid future change in this area is to be anticipated because of advances in electronic data processing and other developments.  I propose, therefore, to take power so that additional modes of wage payment can be added to the list in section 2, if and when new methods of money transfer are developed and gain public acceptance.</P>
    <P>Section 3 repeals the Truck Acts.  The section also provides transitional arrangements for employees currently paid in cash and for manual workers who have agreed to non-cash wages under the Payment of Wages Act, 1979.</P>
    <P>Section 4 imposes on employers an obligation to give to each of their employees a written statement of wages and deductions.  The statement must be given to the employee at the time of wage payment, except in the case of payment by credit transfer, when the statement <Col N="80" /> should be given as soon as possible thereafter. The exception for credit transfers is necessary due to the nature of the technology.  The employer is unlikely to know the time of the credit transfer in advance.  Indeed, computerised credit transfers are often transacted electronically outside normal business hours when off-peak electricity is available.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is concerned with deductions from the wages of an employee.  The section prohibits an employer from making a deduction from wages unless it falls within one of three categories &mdash; a deduction which is required by statute, such as PAYE or PRSI; a deduction which is provided for in the contract of employment, say, pension contributions or a disciplinary fine; and a deduction to which the employee has consented in writing, such as trade union subscriptions, VHI premia or payments to a savings scheme.  All other deductions are outlawed.</P>
    <P>This section also contains further special restrictions which apply to two categories of deductions.  One such category is where deductions are made in respect of either goods or services supplied by the employer and necessary to the employment.  Included here, for example, would be the employee's contribution towards the purchase or cleaning of work clothes or the supply of transport to work by the employer.  The other category involves deductions arising from the actions of the employee, such as disciplinary fines or bad workmanship.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 and 7 of the Bill provide a complaints and appeals procedure for employees who have been subject to unlawful deductions.  The right of complaint for an employee against an unlawful deduction is to a rights commissioner in the first instance.  There is a subsequent right of appeal for both the employer and the employee to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  Section 8 provides for the enforcement of a decision of a rights commissioner or a determination of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Section 9 empowers the Minister for Labour to appoint &ldquo;authorised officers&rdquo;<Col N="81" /> for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the terms of the Bill.  The powers conferred on authorised officers are similar to those provided in other protective legislation.  Section 10 allows the Minister for Labour to prosecute offences arising under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 11 renders void any agreement which is out of keeping with the provisions of the Bill.  Sections 1, 12, 13 and 14 are standard provisions relating to definitions, regulations, expenses and short title respectively.  The Schedule lists all the Acts which it is proposed to repeal.</P>
    <P>There is one point relating to this legislation which I would like to put on the record.  The transitional arrangements in section 3 have been criticised on the grounds that the legislation does not go far enough in pushing the move to cashless pay.  The arrangements are intended to allow an employee currently paid in cash to continue to be so paid until such time as an alternative method of wage payment is agreed with the employer. The arrangements will also allow manual workers, formerly paid in cash, who have entered into an agreement to non-cash wages under the Payment of Wages Act, 1979, to revert to cash wages in accordance with the terms of the agreement.</P>
    <P>Critics of the transitional arrangements appear to envisage that the legislation would facilitate a move to non-cash methods of wage payment based on some level of compulsion.  There are, of course, serious industrial relations and other difficulties inherent in such an approach. Equally important, perhaps, are the reasonable expectations of the categories of worker involved that they should be treated fairly in the context of the Bill.  It is my experience also that undue haste may be counter-productive, particularly where a fundamental legislative change is envisaged.  An incremental approach to change will often achieve its purpose more fully and more satisfactorily than any plans to accomplish an overnight solution, however well intentioned.</P>
    <P>There are good economic and financial reasons for encouraging the move to non-cash wage payment, for the economy, for employers and, perhaps to a lesser <Col N="82" /> extent, for employees.  Like the critics of the transitional arrangements, it is my aim to help to effect a move to non-cash wages as speedily and effectively as possible. I have, therefore, looked in some detail at the case against the transitional arrangements but have been disinclined to accept it, for the reasons already stated, among others.  The Bill, accordingly, reflects my considered position on this matter and seeks the approval of the House for the transitional arrangements.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I see this Bill as a realistic response to a growing consensus in favour of change in the legislation relating to payment of wages.  There are as many opinions as to how precisely this change should come about as there are interests to express them.  I have had the benefit of hearing many of these opinions and they have all been constructive in shaping my thinking in relation to this legislation. My approach in the end has, I hope, been successful in framing a Bill which will provide a legislative environment that is conducive to the orderly and speedy transition to cashless pay.</P>
    <P>I have accommodated the views of FIE and ICTU in my approach to the greatest extent possible.  I am aware, however, that there are a few sticking points in the Bill about which one side or the other has reservations.  Perhaps it is a measure of the balance achieved that both sides of industry, while assenting to the overall thrust of the Bill, remain concerned that the interests of the other side may have been given a little too much weight.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Seanad for facilitating the introduction of this Bill in the Upper House.  I promised some time ago where it was possible I would, at the request of this House, initiate legislation in this House.  I wish to commend the Bill to the House and I assure Members that their comments and views will be accommodated by me to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome <Col N="83" /> the Minister to the House and to congratulate him on his initiative in introducing this Bill in this House.  I welcome the Bill.  It brings the payment of wages into the latter half of the 20th century and provides for a facility for payment other than in cash.  The Bill repeals the old Truck Act of 1743, the Truck Acts of 1831 to 1836 and the Payment of Wages Act, 1979.  The intention behind the Truck Acts was to safeguard employees who were engaged in manual work from abuses in connection with the payment of wages.  There were three basic protections enshrined in the old Truck Acts: protection against payment in kind, protection against interference with a worker's freedom to dispose of his income as he saw fit and protection against unfair deductions from wages.</P>
      <P>Section 1 of the Truck Act of 1831 required that wages be paid to employees in the current coin of the realm.  The Payment of Wages Act, 1979, enabled wages of manual workers to be paid otherwise than in cash provided the employer and employee had signed a document for that purpose, or an agreement existed between the employer and the trade union representing the employee.  The Bill before us establishes for the first time, for all employees, a range of legally acceptable modes of wage payment and regulate the types of deductions which can be made from wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real purpose of the Bill is to endeavour to take large sums of money out of the way of the many robbers who plague our society today.  It is accepted by all that this is a valid reason in the context of our times and, in fact, is a compelling reason for introducing this change.  Opportunities for robberies must be minimised and the repeal of the Truck Acts is to correct the situation where large sums of money by way of payroll are being held weekly in thousands of places throughout the country and are providing easy pickings for robbers.  In a survey within the past three years it was established that more than 30 per cent of employers are still paying their <Col N="84" /> employees in cash.  In fact, as the Minister said, 50 per cent of employees are being paid in cash.  Most of the bigger employers are, of course, paying in cheque form.  It is important that opportunities for the robbery of large sums of money be reduced because such funds are finding their way into the hands of people whose aim is to undermine our society, threaten the State and murder our people.</P>
    <P>Under the Payment of Wages Act, 1979, agreement between employers and employees were facilitated for the non-cash payment of wages.  If the agreements did not have a review clause the agreement had to provide for termination by either party with four weeks notice in writing.  This Bill allows employers and employees to make open-ended agreements with regard to payment through non-cash methods, without the restrictions of the 1979 Act.  In case of agreements in existance at the time of the coming into force of this legislation the arrangement for termination as the Minister has said, persists.  Employees, therefore, may still rescind agreements, the employer being required to return to cash payment unless there is a new agreement made.</P>
    <P>The survey which I mentioned indicated that 69 per cent of companies covered paid manual workers by cheque. All these companies are still liable to renegotiate these agreements.  This could mean that many companies could have to return to cash payments unless and until they reach a new agreement.  This is contrary to the spirit and the intent of the Bill and the Minister should reexamine this aspect.</P>
    <P>This Bill will reduce the security risk attached to large scale transfers of cash involved in the cash payment of wages. It will help eliminate the risk to gardaí, Army personnel, employees of security firms and the employees themselves.  It will bring the method of wage payments into the 1990s by enabling employers to pay employees by modern methods of monetary transfers &mdash; cheques, money orders, bank drafts, credit transfers and <Col N="85" /> so on.  The Bill will also reduce the inefficiencies in cash payment of wages; it will reduce the cost to companies of cash in transit insurance premiums; it will reduce the cost of security for such arrangements; it will reduce the inefficiencies in cash payment of wages by non-utilisation of electronic methods of cash transfer.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 4 which provides for the giving to employees of an itemised pay statement at the time of each payment, or as soon as possible thereafter if wages are paid by credit transfer.  The number of people we encounter in our advice centres who come for various entitlements &mdash; be they medical cards or family income supplements &mdash; who do not have a detailed summary of their wages, is surprising.  Sometimes they do not even know the amount of their gross wages.  They receive a payment each week and do not receive an itemised account of deductions.  This is to be especially welcomed in that context.</P>
    <P>Section 5 prohibits any deduction by an employer from wages of an employee unless deduction is required by statute, is authorised by a condition of the employee's contract or is agreed in writing by the employee.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 and 7 provides for the procedure for employees to have unauthorised deductions from wages investigated by the rights commissioner and in the event of either party disagreeing with the decision of the rights commissioner the decision being referred to the Employment Appeal Tribunal to make a determination. I would ask the Cathaoirleach to allow me bring to the notice of the Minister the concern of the Employment Appeals Tribunal with regard to the procedure in redundancy payments.  Problems have arisen from time to time with regard to the signing of the receipt for redundancy payments.  This is on the RP2 form and it is often signed by employees, unknowingly, on the understanding that they will receive their redundancy payments. Unscrupulous employers subsequently draw the refund from the Department of Labour but do not pass it on to the employees concerned.  They <Col N="86" /> are, therefore, at a loss; they have signed a receipt and have no redress through the normal industrial relations law.  The suggestion of the tribunal is that the receipt should be separate from the RP2, that there should be two distinct documents. This would assist, though probably not totally eliminate, the difficulty.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for bringing this legislation to the House.  I welcome it and look forward to its speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús fáilte a chur roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach seo agus comhgáirdeas a dhéanamh leis arís as ucht an Bille seo a thabhairt ós comhair an Tí seo.  Taispeánann sé go soiléir arís an suim atá ag an Aire sa Seanad agus an Bille tábhachtach seo a thabhairt os ár gcomhair ar an gcéad dul síos.</P>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity to welcome the Minister to the House and to say how very much we appreciate the fact that he has brought this very important legislation to the Seanad on its first presentation.  It shows again the interest the Minister has in the House.  Whenever he can he brings legislation to this House and we very much appreciate that.</P>
      <P>May I also thank the Minister for his historical exposé in relation to the whole area of payment of wages.  It is interesting to note that the Minister is updating very old legislation.  One particular Act, if I am correct, has been 248 years on the Statute Book.  He is spanning almost 250 years in legislation with this Bill and is an historical day in the sense that we are updating legislation that has spanned a number of centuries.  It is a characteristic of the man in that he set about doing these very important things.  One might ask why some other Minister for Labour did not research and bring this legislation before the House before now.  However, the Bill is very welcome here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first time the Bill will confer on employees, not just manual employees, three basic rights.  One is the right to negotiate a method of payment.  It specifically provides for payment of wages by methods including cheques, <Col N="87" /> credit transfer, money orders, bank drafts and cash.  Further methods can be added by order as the banking system develops.  This is extremely important. There are also special provisions for payment during a bank strike and other industrial disputes which would mean that for the employees, who could not get cash value for normal payment method, facilities will be provided for them to do so and for the transitional arrangement for employees currently paid wages by cash or by a method agreed under the 1979 Payment of Wages Act.  The central purpose of the 1979 Act was to enable manual workers to be paid their wages otherwise than in cash where both employees and employers agreed.</P>
    <P>Some people have said that the transitional arrangements have not gone far enough and we are all aware of the fact that there are a number of people who are currently paid their wages in cash. When people are used to a particular method of payment, it takes time to adjust.  We are all human beings and we all love to get our hands on actual cash, albeit for a short time.  There is a certain air of expectation on pay day, whether it is Thursday or Friday, that we are going to get the cash into our hands.  We recognise the fact that we may not have it for all that long but at least we feel it is ours.</P>
    <P>There are a number of people who traditionally have been paid cash over the years.  When an agreement is reached for the money to be paid directly into a bank account or by some other method there will be a feeling of anti-climax on pay day.  Studies have been done in relation to employees and their attitudes and it has been found that their morale invariably is high on pay day.  It is extremely important, where the changes are being made, that every facility be provided to encourage people who are at present paid in cash to have their wages paid by some other method.  People have a mistrust or an antipathy towards banking institutions, etc. and in some ways that is understandable.  Where large sums of money are being paid in cash, it helps thugs and criminals.  Those people are <Col N="88" /> very adept at finding out exactly where people keep cash.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that people be educated into using the financial institutions, whatever those institutions may be, so that the opportunity will not be given to individuals to attack and many cases seriously injure people in order to get their hands on money.  It is important that the message comes out loud and clear.  It is important that it should be made known that people are not keeping large amounts of money in their houses anymore.  Most companies now have computers as standard equipment in their offices so the facility for transferring wages directly from a business to an employee's bank account is available.  It is extremely important to encourage employees to use this facility rather than making them feel it is being forced on them.  If this method is to succeed it must be seen that employees have the choice either to get paid in cash or by some other method.  Invariably you will find that where the pressure is not being put on employees they will come around to that way of thinking.</P>
    <P>In this modern age and with the move towards a single European currency, it is important that the facility we provide in relation to the transfer of funds right throughout the banking world, particularly in the European Community, is up-to-date.  The younger people do not have a problem with it.  Most young people have their own bank accounts. Moneys are transferred into second and third level students' accounts.  They have grown up with that type of system so they do not find any difficulty whatsoever in using it.</P>
    <P>For the next generation there will be absolutely no difficulty in relation to the payment of wages through bank accounts or whatever other method.  The people we are concerned about are the older generation of people who traditionally have used cash as their method of payment in all sorts of ways.  That is quite understandable.  Going back over the years, people had this old attitude towards banks, that the only time you went to a bank was when you were in <Col N="89" /> difficulty and that they really took you to the cleaners in terms of the interest they charged.  Going back 20 or 30 years, people did not normally use the banking system except when they had difficulty and had to go with their cap in their hand to the bank manager and look for a loan, so a type of mistrust and apathy towards banks developed and persisted.  That is quite understandable.</P>
    <P>Many of the older generation hated and detested the fact that they would owe one penny to anybody.  To have, on occasions, to go to the banks and look for money was against their nature.  There is still that sort of mentality towards the banking system.  What we have to do is to try to encourage those people in their own interest and in the interests of the whole business community to use the facilities that are there.</P>
    <P>The Bill is extremely important in the sense that it is updating all the Truck Acts.  Strange as it may seem, the type of payment in kind that the Minister referred to is not going back in history all that far.  There are still situations quite prevalent in this country in which people are forced to take payment in kind for different types of work.  They may get a certain percentage in wages but certain employers will very conveniently explain that because of X, Y or Z he is now paying them so much in cash and the rest they would get in terms of whatever type of barter situation exists.  That still persists to an extent.  People may not be aware of exactly what their rights are.</P>
    <P>If this Bill did nothing else except highlight the fact for those people that they have rights and that they are not required to accept payment in kind for any work that they have done, it would be worthwhile. It is important to understand the reluctance of employees to protest because they feel that if they do not accept this type of payment they might be out of a job or might be threatened in some shape or form.</P>
    <P>This is most progressive legislation. The Minister is to be complimented on the manner in which he has brought this Bill before the House.  It is going to up date all the legislation in relation to the <Col N="90" /> payment of wages.  It is bringing the whole wages situation into the modern world and into the 21st century.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would obviously like to welcome the Minister.  He is a man whose good taste I can increasingly identify with.  He has very good taste in his choice of which House of the Oireachtas he prefers to introduce legislation in.  It is the one I would subscribe to.  His choice of where he likes to spend his summer holidays is another that he and I have in common.  Indeed, I keep wondering is there some significance in the fact that the present Leader of the Government and, perhaps, the aspiring future leader, both have very similar tastes about where holidays can best be spent.</P>
      <P>I found the Minister's speech fascinating. It was a little pathway through areas of the history of the development of labour legislation.  A little bit nostalgic was the reference to legislation that was passed by the last and perhaps the only all-Ireland Parliament the State has had. However restricted its franchise, it was an all-Ireland Parliament which was taken from us under circumstances that are still very dubious.</P>
      <P>On the Bill itself, nobody could disagree with it.  I am not going to argue about the details and about the things the Minister discussed.  I have neither the competence nor the wish to do so.  There is a profoundly strong case on the grounds of security for non-cash methods of payment of wages.  These things do not always operate as well as they should.  I know of factories in the provinces where the workforce agreed to be paid by cheque, ostensibly in the interests of security and then on pay day they all signed a little mandate which despatched one member of management down to the local bank to cash all the cheques and bring back all the cash, which was hardly the purpose of the exercise.  They got paid by cheque and then somebody else went off and cashed all the cheques.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The percentage of the workforce paid by non-cash methods is lower in this <Col N="91" /> country than in other countries.  It is not entirely understandable why.  We have a relatively young population so we would have a relatively young workforce.  If anything, the dreadful shake-outs in employment of the last ten years would probably have accentuated the proportion of young people in the workforce even more and therefore one would expect their willingness to be flexible would have increased.  Yet we have, as the Minister said, by comparison with Denmark, a pathetically low level of the workforce which accepts payments in methods other than in cash.</P>
    <P>It might be worth looking not just at the workforce and the employers but at the other side of the equation, the banking and financial institutions.  Perhaps there are more reasons on that side of the equation for the reluctance to get involved in non-cash payments than on the side of employer and employees.  It is very hard to convince a worker who works from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. that it is a good thing to be paid by cheque when the bank has closed an hour before he or she gets off work.  It is hard to persuade them that it is a particularly efficient way of doing their business.  It is very hard to convince people that an institution which does not condescend to open at any stage during the weekend is an institution one should deal with in terms of funding.</P>
    <P>I have often said that if the banks were in the public sector and carried on as they currently carry on the cry would be to privatise them in order to make them more responsive to the customers because it would be identified clearly as being a characteristic of the public sector that they were so unresponsive to the customers' needs.  I genuinely believe there is a whole series of matters about banking practices in this country which would deter the average citizen who is not involved with them from getting involved.  There are some that are obvious and some that are not obvious &mdash; for instance, the very welcome provision in this legislation for an itemised statement of wages and deductions.  It <Col N="92" /> would be grand if my bank would condescend to give me an itemised statement of the charges and the basis on which they deduct charges and would actually not believe they had the right to deduct them from my bank account without getting my permission first.</P>
    <P>There are a whole series of things about the philosophy of banking in this country which would seem to raise for the average citizen considerable reservations about payment of wages by methods other than cash.  There is the extraordinary fact that one of the major banks, having introduced automatic teller machines, decided that their second generation ATMs do not accept deposits, which makes it that much more difficult for any ordinary citizen to get access to the institutions.  The banks close at all the times most people need any service industry &mdash; for example, the late afternoon and lunch time.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very valuable and worthwhile. My colleagues have said most of what needs to be said on it.  I look forward to a day when we will have in the not-too-distant future a situation close to that in Denmark where over 90 per cent of the workforce gets paid by a method other than cash.  The old cliché about the cashless society is more true than many of us realise.  For reasons of personal security and also because of the practicalities of life, the days of people carrying large amounts of cash are decreasing. There are areas in the United States, I would suspect, where if a major purchase was made in a retail outlet and cash was produced there would be a considerable sense of shock and horror.  The presumption is payment by some sort of plastic or other method.  The cost to the consumer of these forms of plastic, of course, is another matter altogether.  It would be wonderful, it would make life a lot simpler and more secure for many people and it would reduce the risks and hazards of major bank robberies if people were paid by cheque.</P>
    <P>The legislation is most welcome and I congratulate the Minister on his continuing work to reform this area.  I am particularly glad I know he is easy to persuade on these things that he resisted <Col N="93" /> the blandishments of the free marketeers who would have left employees effectively at the mercy of the marketplace in terms of how they were to be paid, if at all, by their employers.  I pay tribute to the Minister for recognising the fundamental fact that the best way to protect fundamental rights is to legislate for them, not to leave them to the marketplace. The Minister is in many ways the epitome of the Irish economic philosophy as described in <i>The Guardian</i> yesterday, as being a blend of some areas of fashionable orthodoxy, a large dose of pragmatism and a considerable belief in the value of consensus.  If I were to put three terms on the Minister, financial orthodoxy, considerable pragmatism and a remarkable capacity to establish consensus would be three of his best qualities. This legislation and his belief in the way to encourage people to accept non-cash payment epitomises that.  The legislation is welcome.  It deserves a speedy passage and I hope it achieves the objective the Minister has set for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is splendid.  I do not think there would be any difficulty about that.  It is remarkable and interesting that although it is such important legislation there are, as far as I know, no amendments down to it.  It seems to be legislation on which there is general agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to join with Senator McKenna&mdash;I have now advanced sufficiently thanks to Seomra na Gaeilge to be able to understand exactly what he said &mdash; in his expression of pleasure at the respect which the Minister demonstrated towards the House in introducing the legislation initially in the Seanad.  I welcome the legislation and support it, and I look forward to the day when I will be <Col N="94" /> as fluent in the first national language as Senator McKenna.</P>
    <P>Let me also say that the Minister's speech was one of the most interesting I have heard.  It was not over-elaborate, but it did take us through a rather fascinating period of history going right back to 1743.  We are now dealing with legislation which until the passage of this Bill was still active and which was in use in an age when Jonathan Swift was alive as Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral in this city.  It is a remarkable example of the survival of some fragile legislative threads.</P>
    <P>I was interested in what Senator Ryan had to say because only last night I was reading some very moving accounts indeed of Grattan's last speech in the old House of Commons in College Green where he appealed and spoke so passionately and movingly about the destruction of the Irish Parliament by the Act of Union.  In the same book there was an account of the passage of the Bill through the House of Lords &mdash; I think it may have been by Macauley; it was certainly by one of the great British historical writers. He expressed astonishment at the ease with which this measure was passed and the lack of resistence, the almost suicidal opting for self-extinction, by people who had held noble hereditary titles &mdash; not, of course, all of them but at least some of them.  This was followed in this compendium by an account in an English newspaper of how the Great Liberator, Daniel O'Connell, was brought on his release from prison in the 1840s in an enormous chariot, like a Popemobile, which stopped outside the old House of Commons, where he took his hat off in salute and gestured silently towards the House of Commons.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it was a very historical perspective which the Minister gave us, succinctly and clearly analysing for us the conditions of work for ordinary people. It was principally manual labourers who were involved in the early Trucks Acts, but recent developments could disturb the situation for white collar workers and so on.  I understand that what the Minister wishes to do is to establish some kind of <Col N="95" /> harmonious treatment for all workers in this State.</P>
    <P>One other thing occurred to me.  I imagine &mdash; I suppose it is true &mdash; that these Trucks Acts, which have only been brought to my attention by the Minister in bringing forward this legislation, constitute the origin of certain common expressions &mdash; for example, &ldquo;having no truck with&rdquo;, that somebody will have no truck with this notion of a contractual arrangement in terms of the paying of wages.</P>
    <P>Clearly, what the Minister is doing is important and necessary, one of the principal reasons being the necessity for security in the transmission of money. It is a very regrettable fact that bank robberies and attacks on post offices and on vehicles that are conveying large cash sums throughout the country are now a commonplace of Irish life.  I deplore the fact.  When I was young &mdash; and that is not as long ago as some people may suppose uncharitably &mdash; a major bank robbery in the city of Dublin was an event that would cause a headline; now it is a small paragraph, something that is accepted as part of the ethos of the day, and I very much regret that.  I think it has something to do with the disturbances in the northern part of the island which has conditioned us to violence in a most regrettable way. However, it is a fact of life and people are exposed to risk and danger; and anything that can obviate that by a further sophistication of the method of payment is to be welcomed.  For that reason, if for no other, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would also like to say that it is important to congratulate the Minister on his very reasoned approach in this legislation. It is marked in every single line of the Bill.  He has listened to various sources of pressure.  Some people think he is not being authoritarian enough, that he has not attempted a kind of mandatory approach to try to coerce people into this process, which most people are agreed is necessary; but yet he has decided to lead rather than to push and I think he is absolutely 100 per cent right in this.  It is very important that people should not <Col N="96" /> feel coerced, that they should feel they have voluntarily embarked on this new form of receiving their wages.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that the Minister said:</P>
    <P>It is my experience also that undue haste may be counter-productive, particularly where a fundamental legislative change is envisaged.</P>
    <P>I think he is completely right.  He is right not to force, to allow people to become acquainted with the advantages of this situation.  There is question of doubt that, as life becomes more sophisticated, as methods of cash transaction involving computers and so on become more widespread, people will become accustomed to them, they will accept them as part of the normal daily process and there will be very little need to coerce people.</P>
    <P>Of course, some groups prefer cash, and they are not in the manual working group.  There are a number of professional groups who prefer cash in hand, and one of the simple reasons for this is that it does not register anywhere.  It does not register with the bank and as sure as blazes it does not register with the income tax, the Revenue.  I wonder if perhaps there are some implications here.</P>
    <P>With regard to banking, the Minister is extraordinarily charitable towards the banks.  He speaks of &ldquo;flexible banking.&rdquo; I think that from the point of view of the customer it is very rarely as flexible as it might be; in fact, it is a lot less flexible in certain respects than it used to be.  I remember the days when you got your own cheques back.  We actually pay for them.  I always assumed that I would be forever entitled to have them back to enable me to check my accounts and physically to possess the cheque, but all I get is simply a computer read-out that gives amounts and dates.  It does not give me the direction of the payment, it does not say who I paid; and if I have been foolish enough, as I infrequently am, not to fill in the stub accurately, then I have no way of finding out.  I have to say to the Minister that despite what he said about the banks, which is very nice and so on &mdash; he is not critical of them at all &mdash; I <Col N="97" /> do not think that they are as consumer friendly as they ought to be.</P>
    <P>I would also like to say that this Bill, although it is not coercive, is intended to lead people towards a more modern and sophisticated method of payment of wages.  It will generate very considerable business for the banks.  I have no doubt whatever that as this method of payment increases the banks will derive considerable benefit and I just wonder are they going to put anything back into the system in any way.  The banks are benefiting from this.  Is there any way in which they are going to become more flexible?  They are going to make more money.  Why do they not investigate methods of becoming more consumer friendly than they are at present in order to offset the advantage they will have?</P>
    <P>With regard to this question of deductions, which is very important, I think that the provisions laid out by the Minister are very welcome and I do not imagine anyone would object to them.  As an employee of the University of Dublin, this is in fact the way I have received my wages for a considerable time.  I remember the feeling of considerable irritation when PRSI and PAYE and all these things were instituted, because the university extracted them automatically without consultation.  There was a certain instinctive, knee-jerk feeling of resentment that here was the employer actually plucking something out of my wages without my being asked for my consent to it.  Obviously, these are things that are legally required and I have no come back &mdash; although I may say that for some of the PRSI payments we get absolutely nothing.</P>
    <P>There seems to be some kind of an anachronism there.  I see everybody else around the country rushing to get in their false teeth, their eyeballs and their glasses, but for some technical reason I get absolutely sweet damn all and that increases my sense of grievance when these things are automatically ripped out of my pay cheque all the time.  However, I have to say that I feel, as somebody who is well paid and who is, after all, a double jobber, it is only appropriate that <Col N="98" /> I should assist those less well off in the payment of a higher rate of PRSI.</P>
    <P>I notice that everything, apart from these statutory deductions, is prohibited, except for certain items that can be agreed in writing between the wage earner and employer.  The instances that the Minister gives are: trade union subscriptions, VHI premia or payments to a saving scheme &mdash; all other deductions are outlawed.  I presume that this would not outlaw the kind of thing that has proved beneficial in the past.  I have not been involved in it myself, but I am aware of it happening and it is among a number of mechanisms that I have been reviewing in terms of fund raising.  I would like just to explain what it is and perhaps the Minister could indicate whether this will or will not be outlawed; I presume it may not.</P>
    <P>One of the major rehabilitation programmes approached one of the semi-State bodies with a plan to help them to generate money for a building programme. They said: &ldquo;We need to get substantial sums of money.  As usual, it is quite difficult to get this in a lump sum.&rdquo;  I am not sure whether it was the ESB, RTE or Bord na Móna, but it was one of these big semi-State bodies.  They said: &ldquo;You get your wage packet every month.  You get £410.15p or 11p or whatever it is.  Would you consent if everybody in the group organised together by the unions consented to give them 10p or 11½p&rdquo;&mdash; in other words, the odd bits and pieces &mdash;&ldquo;out of the wage cheque every month into a fund for this worthy charitabel cause?  It would be deducated automatically from the wage packet by the accountancy section of the operation, held for a year and then transferred to the charity.&rdquo;  In fact, they generated enormous sums of money.  I think it was on a weekly basis.  Suppose, for example, you are getting 37p from 20,000 employees or thereabout every week, over a year that amounts to a very considerable amount of money; but the people who have decided they want to contribute in this way to a charity scarcely felt it, because it is just the lose change that you rattle around in your pocket on <Col N="99" /> the way home on the bus.  I presume that this will not be precluded from occurring again under the operations of the Minister's Bill and, if it is, perhaps he could just look at that.  It is a very useful method of raising funds in a period of our history when it is actually quite difficult to raise funds even for very worthy charities.</P>
    <P>I note again the reasonable and balanced words of the Minister in introducing this Bill.  He looks at the long, historical panorama of the Truck Acts and so on and acknowledges that they have outlived their usefulness.  But at the same time he goes on to say:</P>
    <P>I hope I have garnered for this Bill something of the essence of their philosophy and transformed it into terms which will be relevant to the late 20th century and beyond.</P>
    <P>This seems to me to indicate a very healthy approach on the part of the Minister with regard to the organic development of law; that where there is something useful and good in legislation even a couple of hundred years old a Minister like the present Minister will investigate this, seek out the principle and, although its operation may have been outdated and outmoded, seek to enshrine this valuable principle in new legislation.  I congratulate the Minister on what I think is an excellent and timely Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly welcome this Bill and I congratulate the Minister for giving us the background to it.  It is interesting to know that legislation relating to the payment of wages reaches as far back as 1464.  It is interesting to read also that the Truck Act of 1831 &ldquo;consolidated previous legislation and was geared particularly towards protecting workers against employers.&rdquo;  Indeed, times do not change, because we are told: &ldquo;the company shop itself was often stocked with inferior goods at inflated prices.&rdquo;  One contributor in the House of Lords said that a man could have &ldquo;thrust upon him more bacon and more flour than he had occasion for....&rdquo;  There is no doubt that <Col N="100" /> in those days too, there were injustices. At present wages are so large and so much cash is involved that it is a great temptation to criminals.  Certainly if this Bill helps to stop that type of crime it will be very worthwhile indeed.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris mentioned that people other than workers wanted some of their fees in cash.  I do not think I could agree with that.  I think the Senator is criticising people of his own calibre when he says such a thing.  These are all honest-to-God people who are providing a service.  Very often for the recipients of those services &mdash; oftentimes only £5 or £10 is involved &mdash; it is easier for them to pay in cash rather than write a cheque, because they just might not have a cheque.  As we know, cash cards and hole-in-the-wall cards are more the in-thing now than the cheque book.</P>
      <P>The Minister said in his speech:</P>
      <P>The trend towards more flexible banking, longer banking hours and 24 hour automatic teller machines have all contributed to weakening employee resistance to non-cash wages.</P>
      <P>I would hope, however that there would be a balance.  We have high unemployment in this country and, as one who worked for many years without any union protection, I know that union protection is needed.  But sometimes I feel all our regulations are loaded a bit against the employer.  I would like to see a better balance there, because the employer is just as much a part of the whole system as the employee: one cannot operate without the other.  The Minister told us, in relation to the Truck Acts:</P>
      <P>In some sense they embody the essential philosophy which is at the heart of the employment relationship &mdash; a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Minister recently referred to the amount of absenteeism in this country; it is something like 25 days per worker per year.  If we should find now that they may be looking for time off to go to cash a cheque and so on, that would be unfair.  I know the Minister said that that is a matter for a discussion.  We <Col N="101" /> should look at that matter because so many working hours are lost that it is becoming nearly impossible for employers to keep going, particularly in the present tough times.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope it will work successfully and that employees will accept wages other than in cash.  The youth of today are particularly geared towards such a system.  If you walk around any town or city you see queues of young people with cash cards for the hole-in-the-wall teller machines.  For that reason, it should be accepted and I hope it will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is important to bring the method of payment of workers into the modern environment and to make the necessary adjustments to the legislation.  Listening to the debate on the Bill I was struck by my memory of working in London as a student during the summer holidays.  I worked in a variety of bars in London then.  Apart from the general plight of our Irish emigrants in London, particularly those who left us during the fifties, one of the things that particularly saddened me was to see many of the people who worked in the building trade in London being exploited at their very payment level.  They were often paid through their local bars or had their cheques cashed in the local bars.  In that way they were exploited in a very real way and it still remains the case for many emigrants in London that they were exploited at this level.  For that reason I thought it good that this legislation should be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would make one comment.  The Minister alluded to a friendly banking service existing at the moment.  I think there is an onus on Government to examine the situation in relation to banking because I would be of the view, from practical experience and from talking to a range of people, that the banks are less than user friendly to the very ordinary &ldquo;punter&rdquo;, to the very ordinary work person and that work person can often be exploited by banking and can be the victim of various charges which are totally beyond his or her comprehension.  I <Col N="102" /> would be concerned in that respect.  It is interesting &mdash; and there have been many glaring examples of this in recent times &mdash; that the very big customers of banking, the mega-customers, will have attractive bands of interest, an attractive banking environment and can negotiate all sorts of things with the banking system, but the average, ordinary working person who avails of the banking service on a day-to-day basis has a much less attractive relationship with the banks.  That is one thing that would concern me as we move into cashless payment and as we move into people being paid directly or by bank giro.  It is an area that merits examination.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation as an advance and as a system in tandem with contemporary needs.  I only enter the one reservation in relation to the user friendly nature of our banking service.  That is not to say that there are not individual people working at branch level in banks who are particularly helpful to individuals, but I feel there is a lot of difficulty out there for many ordinary consumers.</P>

      <P>I dtosach báire ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach agus fáilte roimh an mBille seo.  I would like to welcome this Bill.  It is very timely that we should break down the barriers and the differentiations, many of which were arbitrary, between manual workers and other type of workers.  This was an artificial differentiation that has no place in modern Ireland. More and more I see us moving away from payment of wages in cash. This is desirable and I particularly look forward to the electronic transfer of wages whereby workers' wages would be transferred automatically to their bank accounts.  It has very obvious advantages and one of these is that if you get your money in cash there is a temptation to spend it all, whereas if money is paid into a bank account people will tend to spend as they need to each week.  There is, however, a problem about banks in rural areas.  Restricted opening hours of banks are a monopoly abuse which will have to <Col N="103" /> be addressed if the transfer of wages by agreement from cash payment to cheques or other payment is to proceed as fast as we would want.</P>
      <P>There is no excuse for banks closing at 3 o'clock in the afternoon except for one day a week, closing at lunchtime for one hour and not opening on Saturdays.  This, together with the provision of ATMs in rural areas will have to be addressed. ATMs are available outside many city banks.  Since banks are going to be indirect beneficiaries of a move from cash payments to banking they should provide a comprehensive travelling bank service and ensure it is available in workplaces throughout rural Ireland, and organise schedules in such a way that such banks would be available where possible outside factories and other places of substantial employment on the day or days after the payment of workers.</P>
      <P>There is a role for the post office also. In the review being carried out I hope post office banking services will be identified for development since the post office has branches in all areas and workers wages could be paid automatically into the post office bank which would mean their money would be available to them locally for the five and a half days opening time per week of post offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to two specific provisions in the Bill.  The first is in relation to payslips.  Every worker is entitled to a payslip and I am glad to see this provided for in the Bill.  Every worker's payslip should detail gross pay, deductions and the nature of the deductions. It appalls me that some computer pay slips issue headings in abbreviated forms which the ordinary worker does not understand.  I have been presented with such payslips by workers and have gone through the columns and explained to them the content of their payslips and how the final figure of net wages was arrived at.  Is it now obligatory to give full rather than abbreviated explanations for deductions on a payslip?  Every worker is entitled to a clear and concise explanation <Col N="104" /> of how this net pay is arrived at.  I welcome the fundamental provision contained in section 4 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The second provision I would like to question is where it is stated that deductions cannot be made at will.  Is an employee precluded from making an arrangement with an employer regarding the deductions from his wages of the cost of goods purchased from that employer, under two circumstances; when the goods are charged at full retail value and, secondly, when the employer makes an arrangement to accept payment over a time longer than six months from the provision of the goods?  This provision could pose problems where a builder's provider would provide an employee with a valuable amount of goods and would agree to take payments in equal instalments over a year subsequent to the provisions of those goods, but would in return cost out those goods at full retail value.  Would the Minister clarify whether this would be a legally enforceable arrangement once it is entered into on a voluntary basis by the employee?</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  The day of paying wages by cash will disappear as banking services improve and electronic transfer becomes the order of the day, particularly with the general availability of automated telling machines.  It is desirable that we move towards what will effectively be a cashless society.  The security cost saving from an employer's point of view is tremendous in regard to the transfer of large amounts of money. The State can expect a reduction in the incidence of armed robbery of payrolls. Guarantee of payment is confirmed in other Acts and people are at no risk of not getting paid if they accept a cheque or get a credit transfer.  The old objections to paying people by methods other than in cash have disappeared and this is a forward step in the interest of employer and employee.  Ba mhaith liom an Bille seo a mholadh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to the debate.  The various contributions made and the interest in the debate is up <Col N="105" /> to normal Seanad standards.  I would like to thank Senators Ó Cuív and McKenna, as the party spokesmen, and Senators Neville, Ryan and Norris for their contributions.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out at the beginning of the debate, the Bill contains several significant proposals not least of which is the repeal of the Truck Acts which date back to 1743.  Senator McKenna was right with regard to the period covered.  We are repealing legislation passed by our own Parliament in 1743 and by the British Parliament during the 1800s.  Many of the provisions of those Acts are now outdated and in need of repeal but others have stood the test of time and have been adopted in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The regulation for the making of deductions from wages is a prime example of that.  This Bill goes much further than previous legislation in this area.  For the first time all provisions of the Payment of Wages Act will apply to all employees regardless of the nature of the employment, the amount of service or the number of hours worked.  When the Bill comes into force all employees will be entitled to be paid in one or more of the readily nogotiable modes listed in section 2 (1) and will be entitled to a pay statement and enjoy a right of complaint to a third party where an unlawful deduction has been made.</P>
      <P>The application of this legislation to all employees, as pointed out by Senator McKenna and other Senators, is significant. It will help to lessen some of the class distinctions in employment which is one of the things I am pleased to do this morning with the support of the Upper House.  Distinctions were made between white and blue collar workers in all the Acts over 250 years and go back to the year 1400 when Truck Acts first came into force.  I abhor class distinction in employment and it is good to remove it from our legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware in repealing the Truck Acts that I am removing certain rights enjoyed by many workers for hundreds of years. Manual workers have long had the right to payment in cash, variously referred to in the legislation as ready money and <Col N="106" /> current coin of the realm.  I appreciate that some manual workers rely on that right to payment of wages in cash to this day.  I am also aware that many employees retain that right despite being paid by a mode other than cash by virtue of agreements made under section 3 of the Payment of Wages Act, 1979.  It is for those reasons that I included transitional arrangements in section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would not wish to impose by legislation a mode of wage payment other than cash on an employee who has been entitled up to now to wages paid in cash by virtue of a right enjoyed by many for several hundred years.  Nor would I wish to remove from employees a right to revert to payment in cash by unilaterally altering arrangements and agreements entered into voluntarily and in good faith by them under section 3 of the Payment of Wages Act, 1979.  The views of employers on this issue were made know to me in the course of the preparation of this Bill and similar views have been expressed in the House today.  I have considered fully the options in this case and I am grateful for the support received from all sides of the House.  I am convinced that in the interests of fairness and equity in the transitional arrangements as proposed in section 3, the provisions are right and proper.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on some points raised in the debate.  Senator McKenna, among others, pointed to the various advantages of the Bill.  Senators Neville and Farrell referred to the benefits of taking cash out of the workplace and thereby lessening the number of armed payroll robberies.  In submissions made during the preparation of the Bill, many incidents of payroll robberies where the lives of employers and employees were put at risk were made know to me.  If this Bill helps in any way &mdash; I believe it will &mdash; to lesson such risks to employees then the Bill will have made a significant contribution to many lives and to making the workplace a safer place.  Regrettably, as mentioned by Senators on all sides of the House, fatalities, serious injuries and maiming of both employees, employers and customers <Col N="107" /> have resulted from payroll robberies down through the years.  When we have not had a robbery for a while people forget the danger but they are some of the main reasons for moving away from what might be seen as traditional and long term rights.</P>
    <P>The reluctance of older people to accept non-cash wages and to use the banking system was referred to by Senator McKenna and others.  I would join with the Senator in encouraging them for their own safety as much as anything else to make the transition to the banking system, whether it is to commercial banks, post office or whatever. There seems to be a move in that direction.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Cuív referred to post offices. They have done a good job and will continue to encourage people to use the system.  I would also like to thank Senator Norris for his welcome for the Bill.  The risks associated with the transfer of large amounts of cash is indeed one of the main reasons for the Bill.  The Senator mentioned the role of the banks in this area and I hope that banking and other institutions, such as building societies, will be supportive of employers and unions who meet to negotiate new arrangements on cashless pay.</P>
    <P>As regards the fundraising points mentioned by the Senator, I do not expect there will be any problem here when the consent of the people concerned is forthcoming. Here I refer to section 5 (1) (c) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan expressed surprise at the low number of employees who are paid otherwise than in cash in this country as compared with other European countries. The figures I mentioned this morning will have been highlighted in the media and will be a surprise to a lot of people but they are staggering.  Some countries have 95 per cent cashless pay while in Ireland we are talking about slightly over 50 per cent although it is growing.  Our major trading partners and competitors enjoy from 75 per cent to 90 per cent cashless pay, so we are a long way behind that.  Indications are that <Col N="108" /> there has been a growing move towards non-cash wages in the past few years and this move is perhaps facilitated, as Senator Ryan suggests, by our own workforce. A more recent Federation of Irish Employers survey referred to by Senator Neville would indicate a rise from the 1987 figure of 51 per cent.  The extent of the increase cannot be determined with any degree of certainty but it is moving in the right direction.  This Bill will allow employers and employees to make arrangements and agreements to make this change on a permanent basis.  I hope they will use this Bill and I think there is general support in the Houses of the Oireachtas for it.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris is concerned about the banking system and Senator Ryan made similar points.  Most of us have had unsavoury experiences with banks.  Those who have not, are familiar with the experience of others in that regard. Unfortunately the form of the banking system is not within my remit so I will not undertake that debate today.  Senator Ó Cuív mentioned major developments in banking.  Competition between the commercial banks and other financial institutions for banking type services helps towards more friendly banking for the future.  There is not much point getting into a debate about how a worker who works from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. five days a week can cash a cheque if there is no arrangement for time off.  I am sure our colleagues in the banking world will take account of that.</P>
    <P>We do not want to be dictatorial but banks should look at the security implications of this Bill.  Banks have great security problems and bank officials are always at risk in their workplace.  Many city banks and some banks around the countryside have had at least one experience of a major robbery.  Some banks that I know have had regular robberies.  A year has not gone past in the last decade when they have not had to face bala-clavas, guns, picks and axes.  They will be conscious of the reason for not putting further pressure on their own colleagues and on trade union colleagues in other workplaces that have to face the risk of <Col N="109" /> a robbery.  That debate is taking place and we ask them to do what they can to enable all staff to use bank facilities.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville expressed fear that pending new arrangements under the Bill employers might be obliged to return to cash payments.  The position is that the transitional arrangements of the Bill provide for the continuation of existing arrangements until both sides agree to an alternative.  Therefore I do not expect the proposals in the Bill will lead to any demand for a return to cash based payments. Senator Neville made a point about the RP2 as used under the Redundancy Payment Act.  I will arrange for the examination of the problem he referred to.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville's analysis of the Bill was most welcome.  I thank the Senator for that and I am heartened that he sees many of the advantages in this Bill that have been the basis for my decision to bring it forward.  There are serious problems associated with cash wages nowadays and the Senator covered most of them &mdash; the threat of armed robberies, cost inefficiencies connected with the use of antiquated modes of payments and other difficulties already mentioned in my speech at the start and by other Senators throughout the debate.</P>
    <P>He has also identified section 4, which provides for pay statements, as a significant provision and Senator Ó Cuív has asked me about that also.  A similar section can be found in the Payment of Wages Act, 1979 but, as highlighted in some newspapers during the week, this Bill provides apparently for the first time for the case of an employer who fails to provide an employee with a pay statement. We are talking about unambiguous, clear, detailed, understandable statements and the fine for not providing such a statement is £1,000.  It is a sad reflection that we should have to talk about fines in order to ensure that a person receives a pay statement setting out their gross to net pay for an honest week's work.  I am sometimes amused that when taking action to protect what might seem a perfectly legitimate individual right some individual employers <Col N="110" /> say the Minister or the Department of Labour are bringing in more draconian legislation which makes it impossible for employers to exist in a modern, competitive society.  The matters I am talking about were talked about a few hundred years ago in the Houses of Parliament in College Green.  The major draconian legislation I am imposing on employers insists that they tell employees what wages they are being paid and what deductions are being paid to the State.  If anyone finds that too draconian, I am not sure where we are.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville expressed reservations about the transition arrangements.  As I said in my speech, I have nailed my colours to the mast with this provision. The bottom line is that employees who, in good faith, have entered into renewal contacts for non-cash wages with employers should not be deprived of a contractual and legal right by this Bill. Equally, I urge employees and trade unions generally to take the broader view and move speedily to the cashless option but people should not be occupied trying to find obstacles in this.  This move will be beneficial and society has begun the move already.  It may take a few years for people to follow it fully but we should not be talking about paying half our workforce in cash.  We should get away from that.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Cuív raised the question of an employee who agreed with an employer to payment in kind.  I refer the Senator to section 5 (4) of the Bill.  Such an arrangement as he suggests would be possible but it would not be enforceable by the employer.  Alternatively, the parties could use section 5 (1) (c) of the Bill under which the employee could consent to a deduction in respect of the goods in kind.  The Bill is concerned mainly with money wages and if the benefit in kind is in addition to money wages as such it is excluded from the scope of the Bill by section 1 on the definition of wages.</P>
    <P>Many Senators, including Senator O'Reilly, are concerned that I am delivering employees into the hands of the banks.  I would draw the attention of Senators to section 2 of the Bill and it is <Col N="111" /> a point on which we have to be careful. The list of modes of wage payment are wider than might be thought.  For example, cash is an option.  The facilities of An Post may be used; the Trustee Savings Bank which is not a commercial bank but a bank set up under statute by the Minister for Finance may also be used and this bank has longer opening hours than the commercial banks.  We have taken the point about the banks and signalled the wider area.  I hope that employers and trade unions and non-unionised workers, who form a significant part, of the workforce will realise that many options exist to conclude agreements quickly and move into cashless pay.  Employers will be able to make the necessary arrangements for cashless pay with new employees coming onto the labour market.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for being so supportive of this legislation.  In 1987 we put forward a discussion document; it has been our practice in the Department of Labour to try to update our laws and we have spent much time on this.  This Bill is the fruit of that work and it has been welcomed by Senators from all sides. There are no amendments and I would appreciate if we could proceed with the debate and dispose of the Bill.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann &mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  notes that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> as it relates to education confirms the importance of the education system for the future well-being of the country as well as its role in the country's economic development;</P>
      <P>(2)  agrees with the overall strategy contained therein to the effect that the opportunity should be provided for all to develop their educational potential to the full;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  welcomes the various initiatives referred to in the document for all levels of education and particularly <Col N="113" /> those which are directed at countering educational or social disadvantage;</P>
    <P>(4)  looks forward to the publication of a Green Paper framed as a strategy paper on education which will afford the opportunity to all parties concerned with education to offer views prior to the publication, in due course, of a White Paper.</P>
    <P>I welcome this motion which has been tabled by the Leader of the House.  I want to thank him for having given us this opportunity for a wide-ranging debate on education.</P>
    <P>The motion also provides us with an opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Minister for her many achievements since she became Minister for Education in 1987.  Indeed, she has been one of the most successful, if not the most successful, Minister for Education since the foundation of the State.  Under her stewardship significant progress has been made in every area of the educational service.  The Minister has stated on many occasions that her objective as Minister for Education is to fundamentally reform the education system to meet the changed circumstances which pupils and teachers face today.</P>
    <P>I believe it is right and proper that this House should acknowledge what has already been accomplished.  It is important to put on the record also the fact that this year again the financial allocation for education at £1.416 billion is the second largest financial allocation for any Government Department.  It represents over 18 per cent of the net Exchequer expenditure.</P>
    <P>The education Bill to which the Minister is committed will be a major milestone in the educational life and history of the country.  Everybody with an interest in education is looking forward with great eagerness to the publication later this year of the Green Paper and it is in everybody's interest that there will be the widest possible discussion and public debate on the Green paper when it is issued.  I look forward to this House being given an opportunity, as I know it <Col N="114" /> will, to contribute to that debate.  The debates on education in the Seanad are always constructive and well informed. There are in this House many Members with a particular interest in this area and I am confident the Minister will take into account the views of Members of this House on the Green Paper when the White Paper is being prepared.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> as it relates to education confirms the importance of the education system for the future well-being of the country as well as its role in the country's economic development.  Enshrined in the programme is the most comprehensive public commitment to education ever on the part of the Government and the social partners.  The overall strategy or objective of education policy is stated clearly and simply, that is, to provide the opportunity for all to develop their educational potential to the full and the methods by which this strategy will be achieved are spelled out in clear, unambiguous terms.</P>
    <P>A broadly based education will be provided for all ability levels during the compulsory cycle of education, that is, from six to 15 year olds.  Pupils will be encouraged and facilitated to continue in fulltime education after the compulsory period.  A range of education and training programmes suited to their abilities and aptitudes will be provided.  Post-secondary education will be available for all students interested in pursuing such an education and capable of benefiting from it.  Efforts will be intensified to address the needs of children with educational difficulties and under-achievers, in particular, during the compulsory cycle.</P>
    <P>Second chance education or training will be provided for those leaving the system prematurely.  Mature students will be facilitated within the education system in upgrading their education or training levels.  Indeed, in all of these areas the Minister has already shown herself to be somewhat of a trail blazer.  I shall be referring in more detail to some of the many initiatives already undertaken by her.  A vitally important commitment in the programme is that particular attention will be paid to children suffering <Col N="115" /> educational or special disadvantage.  The importance of the early identification of such children is recognised.  This early identification will be supported by a programme of remedial teaching, guidance and counselling and the development of home-school links.</P>
    <P>The programme outlines in detail a number of specific areas for which particular initiatives are proposed.  At primary level, overall pupil-teacher ratio will be reduced to 25:1 by September 1992.  This will be achieved by retaining all existing posts in 1991 and 1992, and by creating 250 new posts.  The additional new posts required to achieve the 25:1 ratio will be created in September 1992. I refute the recent allegations by a certain spokesman on education that these new posts would not be created.  The fact is that these new posts will be created in the coming September and in September 1992.</P>
    <P>The proposed reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio is very welcome indeed. I believe that a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio is one of the most positive contributions any Minister for Education can make to improving the quality of the education service.  The only Ministers for Education who have ever reduced the pupil-teacher ratio in this country have been Fianna Fáil Ministers for Education.  It is my earnest hope &mdash; and I am sure the earnest hope of all teachers &mdash; that this initiative is only the start of a phased process that will continue until the end of this decade.  I welcome the agreement which is referred to in the programme that the matter will be further reviewed at the end of 1993.</P>
    <P>I believe there is no primary school anywhere in the country in which there is not at least one pupil who could be said to be educationally or socially disadvantaged to some degree.  I do not need to tell the Minister how important individual attention is in the case of such pupils.  It is true to say that a certain amount of individual attention is important as far as every pupil is concerned, if such were possible.  My own view is that the ideal classroom situation, as far as <Col N="116" /> teacher and pupils are concerned, is one which is a combination of class contact, group contact and one-to-one contact.</P>
    <P>Class size is the factor which determines the extent or the degree to which this is possible.  If a class is too large, no matter how dedicated the teacher, individual attention is not feasible, irrespective of how beneficial it would be in the case of a particular pupil.  This is why all teachers feel so strongly about the question of large classes and why in the past there was so much frustration among teachers which led to the stress that has been referred to on so many occasions as far as teachers are concerned.  That is why I believe that nothing would boost the morale of teachers more than to know that full advantage will be taken of the demographic situation which will obtain over the remaining years of this century to achieve a significant across-the-board reduction in class size.  There is a related matter to which I would like to refer very briefly and which, I believe, will have to be addressed.  That is the almost impossible situation that obtains for teachers in one-teacher schools, but particularly in one-teacher schools where the enrolment is in the region of 20 pupils or more.  I do not know how many such schools there are, but I believe there are quite a few. However, I know the Minister will have no difficulty in guessing the one which is uppermost in my mind.</P>
    <P>The policy at the moment is that where the parents of an area wish to retain a school which is in operation the Department will continue to recognise and fund that school until the enrolment falls to somewhere in the region of eight.  I agree with this policy.  I do not need to elaborate on the difficulties which confront a teacher in any one-teacher school, and particularly in a one-teacher school with an enrolment of over 20 pupils.  The teacher has to implement the curriculum with six classes and pupils ranging in age from four to 13 years of age.  There are pupils to be prepared for First Communion and Confirmation.  There are pupils with learning difficulties and various other problems.  I know the Minister <Col N="117" /> understands and recognises the difficulties involved.  I believe all such schools should be designated as disadvantaged and some special staffing arrangement should be worked out in these cases.</P>
    <P>There are various options which could be examined or considered.  Perhaps the Minister would consider including a reference to this matter in the forthcoming Green Paper.  Time will not permit me to deal in detail with all the other initiatives which are outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> but I want to refer briefly to some of them.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the reduction of the pupil/teacher ratio in primary schools.  This matter is also being addressed at second level.  A pupil/teacher ratio of 19:1 for recruitment purposes will be phased in over 1991 and 1992.  This will mean that an additional 500 posts will be provided in these two years.  In addition, a further 60 posts will be allocated to post-primary schools in disadvantaged areas for the 1991-92 school year.  There is also provision in the programme for the recognition on an ex-quota basis of vice-principals and whole-time posts for guidance in certain categories of second level schools.  A six-year cycle of post-primary education will be introduced for all pupils commencing their post-primary cycle in September next.  This is something that Members from all sides of this House gave a very high priority to in the debate we had here on education late last year.</P>
    <P>The question of the in-service training needs of teachers was also referred to at great length in that debate.  This matter is also being addressed in the programme. An additional £0.5 million will be allocated for this purpose in 1992.  This figure will be increased to £1 million in 1993 and in subsequent years.  In addition to disadvantage, I want to reiterate a point that I have made on a number of occasions.  That is, that nobody has done more than the present Minister to deal with the problem of disadvantage at every level, but particularly at primary level, which is the sector I know best. <Col N="118" /> Last year 100 extra teachers were allocated to schools serving disadvantaged pupils.  The special fund for disadvantaged schools was substantially increased.  New criteria were agreed for assessing the degree of disadvantage in primary schools.  The home school liaison scheme came into operation.  The number of remedial posts in primary schools was increased by a further 30. The grant to primary schools under the free book scheme was increased by a further 20 per cent, having been increased by 17 per cent the previous year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides for a further allocation this year of £1 million in addition to the current provision for the various areas of disadvantage in the educational system.  This additional allocation will increase to £2 million in 1992, and £3 million in 1993.  I had also intended to refer to the free book scheme in primary schools and to the fact that the children in infant classes will be able to benefit from this scheme for the first time. I had also intended to refer to the scheme in second level schools.</P>
    <P>I just want to say, in conclusion, that there is now a firm commitment to the implementation of a programme early in 1992 to upgrade or replace all substandard buildings at primary and second level and at EC third level colleges.  I welcome this.  Already, outstanding work has been done by the Minister over the four years since 1987.  The outstanding school building problems will, therefore, be addressed over the next five years, and the problems will be eliminated.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to repeat what I said at the outset &mdash; that no Minister for Education in the history of this State has made a greater contribution to the education service and the education life of the country than the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke.  Education is now, without question, at the centre of the stage.  It is of crucial importance to the future well-being and development of the country.  It is fully recognised and acknowledged.  I believe that future generations will owe her a great debt of gratitude.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="120" /> Looking at the motion I noticed as I went through the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, that it is taken word for word from items Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the programme.  I would have to say that the motions, as formulated &mdash; and I take them as four separate sections &mdash; reflect the usual confusion in Government thinking.  For example, there is a confusion of principle, strategy, tactics and action.  Item No. 1 states that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> as it relates to education, confirms the importance of the educational system for the future well-being of the country as well as its role in the country's economic development.  It is a statement of principle to which we all prescribe, but confirming something as being important without the corollary of a well-formulated strategy, opposite choice of tactics and leading to real action, is not what I would have wanted.  What I have seen here is an exercise in the dissemination of platitudinous pap.  I really feel that it is in no way impinging on the real world. While agreeing with the overall strategy contained in item No. 2, to the effect that opportunity should be provided for all to develop their educational potential to the full &mdash; I think here lies the weakness, emptiness and hollowness of this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's union agreed 94 per cent with those very words.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to show that when we go through and breakdown in the actual programme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what your union agreed with &mdash; both the formulation of those headings and the breakdown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>They are generalised statements.  My record in the House shows that I have a practical approach to everything.  What I am saying is that a <Col N="121" /> strategy represents a coherent thoughtout, well-articulated and formulated mechanism for achieving predetermined goals.  As far as I am concerned, <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> includes no such strategy, and to call the items in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> a strategy is to fracture the use of language beyond credibility.</P>
      <P>What in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will enable all pupils to develop their educational potential to the full?  If it would facilitate such advance, the strategy should make commitments on resources.  I am talking about specific commitments on resources, curriculum, pastoral care, special education in a meaningful way, proper career guidance and real improvement in pupil/teacher ratio.  What has the strategy got to say specifically about the public capital programme in respect of education?  What commitment is there to refurbishing existing stock?  What commitment is there to building new schools and to new facilities within schools?  If that strategy were there, I would be quite happy to endorse it.</P>
      <P>Going on to number 3, in its terminology it gives the game away.  We are asked to welcome the various initiatives. Looking up the meaning of the word &ldquo;initiatives&rdquo; we find that to &ldquo;initiate&rdquo; means to start, to set in motion, to begin, to perform the first act or right.  Wherein lies the strategy?  What has been set in motion?  What consolation can the students, parents and teachers take from this first step or series of first steps?  I am asking, to coin a phrase, where is the beef?  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is supposed to improve the lot of those who go to schools and to units for the disadvantaged.  This is to be welcomed, but we need to analyse this in greater detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the evidence suggests that this type of reasoning must be accompanied by appropriate curricular changes: pastoral care in schools, pastoral care systems, psychological support systems and home school liaison.  I will agree that the Minister has the home school liaison in place. <Col N="122" /> It is working exceptionally well.  It is something that should be extended.  One particular category is almost totally ignored &mdash; the emotionally disturbed. There is a substantial increase in numbers but there are no increases in resources.</P>
    <P>To take Limerick as an example, there is no unit for emotionally disturbed students in the mid-west despite the fact that the survey conducted by the MidWestern Health Board/University of Limerick showed evidence of enormous problems.  I am asking what initiative is being taken in respect of these.  I am talking specifically about emotionally disturbed children.  We are very much aware of the breakdown of society, marital break-up, disadvantage and social problems, and even though those children are not specific to any particular class, there are emotionally disturbed children and they are not being catered for.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Government speaker referring to the Education Act.  A Green Paper is not, and has never been, a strategy paper.  It is an options paper.  It is a consultative document.  The White Paper is the strategy or policy paper.  I am worried about the verbiage and the procedural confusion there which is perhaps covering the fact that the Minister &mdash; and I would like a commitment from her regarding the Education Bill &mdash; may be getting cold feet.  There is no reference in this motion, after the publication of a White paper, to the Education Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>The exact lines on page 33 are taken out, as in the motion.  It says that a Green Paper, framed as a strategy paper in education, will be issued by summer 1991 and will afford the opportunity to all parties to offer views.  Then it goes on to say that it will be followed by a White Paper in early 1992 setting out the Government's policy, and that will be followed by an education Act.  I think it is quite in order for me to wonder why the last little bit, seeing that it was taken word for word from PESP, did not come in to say &ldquo;followed by an Education Act&rdquo;.  That is the big question which people are asking.  Will the Minister have the courage to actually take on an education Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to clear up once and for all the issue raised by Deputy Higgins in the Dáil, the pupil-teacher ratio and the jobs to be created.  The creation of 250 new posts is a prerequisite to the pupil/teacher ratio at the 25:1 level in September 1992.  My understanding is that there are 323 vacancies on the panel at the moment and that the Department's first priority is to fill those posts.  Will the 250 new jobs be created by September 1991?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>They are already created. The circular went out in March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the numbers on the panel?  Where will the jobs be?  It is interesting that the newly qualified primary teachers coming out of our colleges total 250.  Will the jobs be there for them?  I would refer again to specific figures regarding our class sizes which, I think, have been bandied around quite a bit.  The classes are the largest in Europe. We have 602 primary school classes with 40 students; we have 1,799 classes with between 20 and 24 students.  We have over 3,000 classes of between 25 and 29 pupils; we have over 5,500 classes of between 30 and 34 pupils, and nearly 5,000 classes of between 35 and 39 pupils. <Col N="124" /> It is impossible for teachers to cope with class sizes of over 30 pupils.  There are 11,000 teachers having daily classes of over 30 pupils.  That surely contradicts the commitment given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in relation to reduction of pupil/teacher ratios.  I will not go into the figures because time does not permit me, but Italy has a ratio of 15.2:1; France 22.4:1; United Kingdom 22.1:1.</P>
      <P>Moving briefly to the post-primary sector, certainly the improvement the Minister has in mind in the PESP of 19:1 will help, but it will help the larger schools, not the smaller schools.  In a typical school in Limerick there are 600 pupils and 32 teachers.  A similar grammar type school on the border in Scotland, in a town in Berwickshire, there are 600 pupils and 80 teachers.  These are facts.  If 80 teachers are required for 600 pupils in that area, surely 32 in relation to 600&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>How long is their school year?  There are other things attaching to service regardless of the PTR; there are other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in Europe, and we have 600 pupils to 32 teachers as opposed to 600 pupils and 80 teachers. I will move on very quickly to career guidance counsellors.  I spoke on that subject on the previous occasion the Minister was here.  Counselling is essential.  What is happening now is that there are overstretched counsellors having to concentrate on career guidance.  Counselling by its very nature, is a one-to-one situation. Even the 0.5 of a wholetime post for guidance in schools, whether secondary, community or comprehensive, is for the 350 to 499 pupils.  I welcome even that from the Minister.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that everything is bleak.  I am saying that we welcome all improvements, but really we have to go much further.  I welcome the six-year cycle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards in-service, I would really want to know about it.  It states in PESP that there is a study on the in-service <Col N="125" /> needs and the resources that will be necessary to put them in place.  A figure of £0.5 million is mentioned for 1992 and £1 million in 1993.  I would agree with the Minister that pupil assessment is an advantage to pupils, but I would particularly like her to home in on management of schools.  We know if authority is devolved to local management structures that parents, teachers and management alike will have to be subjected to intense in-service training if they are to take over, as they are doing, from religious orders. Even the religious orders themselves need that training.  This is very important.</P>
    <P>I would like to know the Minister's policy as regards rationalisation.  I understand that it is essential.  I know that there is a social problem in small towns where losing a school, obviously, is the equivalent of losing a factory as far as shopkeepers are concerned.  The situation is that you have funding already promised, committed, for replacement of sub-standard buildings at the three levels by 1997. If there is a crisis in building, as happened in the Newtown Forbes case, you will find moneys having to be put immediately into situations where you have a pressing problem.</P>
    <P>There are £24 million pounds allocated over the period of years in <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> but I am asking what happens if there is a crisis, because the whole programme will fall into disarray.  There is a queue waiting for money.  I think it is an inadequate response because it will take at least five to ten years to clear the backlog.  There is tremendous impetus for rationalisation at the moment and communities that have been riven and have had tremendous problems in trying to come together on the school of their choice &mdash; as the Minister knows it has taken tremendous skill, diplomacy and talking and so on, to get to an agreement on the school of their choice &mdash; are now waiting in expectation.</P>
    <P>This new state of the art school with a great range of programmes for meeting the needs of all kinds of pupils is hypothetical because I believe we are going to be into the next decade.  We are going to <Col N="126" /> have queues of disillusioned and disgruntled parents who have worked hard to resolve a problem in their communities in regard to rationalisation.  I would say to them that I think rationalisation has to take its place in the queue and aim for the 21st century.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's statement that the unions have agreed on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> programme but the reality is that parents, teachers and the students themselves are not benefiting on the ground. The most severely disadvantaged &mdash; I will refer to this again when I refer to my own area &mdash; are those with no class for emotionally disturbed children.  I could go on at length and I think the Minister realises now that we could talk for ever on this issue.  I have not even mentioned third level and the difficulty of access to third level.  That would be a debate for another day.</P>

    <P>We are here to debate a very important issue and we have to recognise the fact that whether people like it or not a tremendous amount of development and activity has taken place in the educational sector when times were difficult and money was scarce.  However, the Minister for Education has, in no small way, ensured the success and development of the whole educational system.  We have <Col N="128" /> to recognise that and I believe that all Senators on every side of the House, if they were honest, would know that.</P>
    <P>What amuses me about the attitude in relation to things that are and are not done is that I am hearing very negative contributions from individuals who are members of local authorities.  We had a situation here in the House some weeks ago when people cried from the rooftops about local democracy being taken away and that the first part of the Local Government Bill was going to take powers from local authorities.  We had this from a party who in actual fact have done nothing over the last number of years except to try in every way possible to take away power from the VEC system of education.  I wonder if Senator O'Reilly or Senator Jackman would have any comments to make on that.  It is the specific policy of Fine Gael to take the control of the VEC system from the local authorities and from the VECs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>

      <P>In the post-primary sector, the new junior cycle programme is now in operation.  I would have expected &mdash; of course, after listening to what I heard today I will not be surprised at any type of attitude &mdash; that that development in relation to the new junior cycle would be welcomed on all sides.  It is a very welcome development.  Plans are well ahead for the development of the new senior cycle.  Surely nobody will object to the fact that we have to bring all those systems into the modern age, or <Col N="129" /> do we want to stay in the middle of the 19th century?  However, that is for individual people to make up their own minds about.</P>
      <P>The process of the gradual reduction of the PTR in post-primary schools through the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, which Senator Jackman referred to and which will commence next autumn and will continue in 1992, is a very welcome development.  Scare-mongering, innuendo and suggestions that these things are not going to happen are very unfair.  The Government and the Minister are committed to that development and the reduction on a gradual basis of the pupil-teacher ratio down the road. That has to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>There is the additional career guidance provision.  In relation to what Senator Jackman said, there will be the introduction of the quota status for vice-principals in the larger schools.  The extension of the sixth year school cycle in all post-primary schools is indeed a very welcome development.</P>
      <P>In relation to the disadvantaged, the Minister has allocated £1 million this year to redress the various problems; this will be increased to £2 million in 1992 and to £3 million in 1993.  Second chance education is also highlighted in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, one example being the very important Youthreach scheme for the young unemployed who have left school without any qualifications or vocational training.</P>
      <P>The VTOS provides long term unemployed with the opportunity to return to the educational system and to improve their knowledge and their skills.  The allocation for adult literacy in community education schemes was doubled by the Minister last year and is being further increased this year.  A programme will begin in 1992 to upgrade and replace all substandard buildings in primary, post primary and VEC colleges by 1997. Again, that is a major commitment and surely no one can say it is not evidence of a Minister who is committed to dealing with the development of the whole educational system.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only did I not imply that but I was just about to go on, if the Senator had waited for me to finish my sentence, to compliment the Minister on the successes she has had in education to date.  I regret very much that this debate, which I think is an extremely important one, should descend to a level of wrangling between political parties and that there should be a mention of local elections coming up, etc.  That does not become the Members of the Seanad and we should take as constructive an attitude as possible to this motion which is extremely important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to compliment this Minister for Education and preceding Ministers for Education, be they Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or whatever, &mdash; I do not care; it is of no interest to me &mdash; on the splendid job that has been done in this country in the area of education.  We have a splendid and proud reputation in this country in respect of education.  I had the opportunity both this year and when I was Lord Mayor to travel abroad a great deal and I am always proud and heartened by the attitude of other countries with regard to our education system.  They hold it in <Col N="132" /> very high esteem and our graduates who go abroad can hold their heads high in the international field.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that improvements cannot be made.  We should put as much of our financial resources into education as we possibly can.  I know we are always looking for extra money to be put into everything but if we put more financial resources into education many other problems would be sorted out.  At the lower end of the scale it is perfectly obvious that those who are more disadvantaged cannot get out of the downward spiral of deprivation unless they have at least a decent, basic, good secondary education.  If possible, we should encourage as many as possible of our people to go into third level because we know that when they go abroad competition for jobs is very tough and the better educated our emigrants are the better chance they have of employment.</P>
    <P>The ten minutes at our disposal does not permit one, and I do not intend to go into any specific detail, but I would like to make a plea to the Minister not to abandon the idea of giving our young people a liberal education.  I believe it is extremely important.  I think in many quarters the idea of a liberal education where young people study liberal arts, study the humanities, is considered to be slightly outdated but I believe we need to envisage or to try to look forward to the next 20, 30 or 40 years to what sort of a world our young people will be facing. When I say a liberal education or studying the humanities I mean liberating young people, liberating all of us, to be truly human, liberating us from our ignorance. It may be as basic as teaching our young people to read, write, speak, listen, understand and think.  We should not lose sight of that.</P>
    <P>There is now such an emphasis on points in secondary education that those basic values on which western civilisation has been built have been lost sight of. The great events in western civilisation have been based initially on the study of humanities, on the spirit of inquiry which has led people on to great heights.</P>
    <P>If I may, I will paraphrase from the <Col N="133" /> French the following quotation: &ldquo;The whole art of teaching is only the art of awakening the natural curiosity of young minds ...&rdquo; In other words, education is nothing more than arousing the interest or enthusiasm of young people and then satisfying it.  That is what we should keep in mind and I think it has been lost sight of.  I remember a very interesting study which was carried out by Trinity College some years ago.  They looked at the job opportunities for young people leaving university with a particular craft, with a particular skill, whether it was engineering or law or whatever it was, and they initially did better in the job stakes.  They got the jobs quicker, they got better pay in their jobs.  But they also looked ten years down the road to see what had happened to those young people and, interestingly enough, ten years later those who had had a broader education, who had not concentrated on a specific craft but who had started with a liberal degree, who had studied the humanities out-passed those who had come out with a specific craft.</P>
    <P>People should not think that what I am saying is all pie-in-the-sky and very laudable for people who can afford it.  It is, I believe, important for young people. There is no point in pumping information into children.  They can get that anywhere. They have it 24 hours a day.  They have it from the media.  We are all vulnerable to information pounded at us from the media.  It has now reached a situation in advertising where it is 10 second sound bites.  That is apparently all we can now absorb because we are being so harassed and hammered with the information being pumped at us.  More and more time is spent communicating less and less.  What we want is to give our children knowledge, not information.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the detailed question, time does not permit, but I would say to the Minister there is going to be an opportunity to have smaller class sizes and we should be looking at the quality of education.  I have nothing but praise for the splendid job, by and large, done by our teaching profession.  They have a very proud record and I think that <Col N="134" /> the quality of the teachers is what is all-important.</P>
    <P>There should be some better system of assessment of teachers and of their ability because this is what is important.  We heard a very extended debate on the Gay Byrne show recently about whether a teacher could be dismissed or not for total incompetency.  I am not going to go into that, I do not wish to say whether they can or they cannot.  The general impression came across that there was certainly room for improvement in that area.  Teachers might, in certain instances, welcome appointments for a limited period.  They must get worn out like the rest of us, burned out.  It is understandable because of the pressures they are under.  Some flexibility for them might be a good thing.</P>
    <P>What we need is to judge on results and by results I mean not simply on points but on how our young people are prepared to meet life and to meet the sort of life which is undoubtedly ahead of them, when, I believe, above all they will need flexibility.  I know that our graduates abroad are snapped up and I know that they are admired in England and in the United States and, indeed, in Europe. Flexibility, it is said, is one of the outstanding traits of Irish graduates.  That is something we should try to encourage in our youngsters at secondary level also. We should encourage maturity and balance.</P>
    <P>I suggest there is an area we could look at for a better use of the physical resources of schools.  Schools are there, the physical resources are there 24 hours a day.  How many hours in the day are they used?  I will mention an unfortunate example, Iraq, which could not be very popular at the moment.  I remember my first visit there many years ago.  I was extremely impressed.  They had a great need to try to get the women particularly educated in Iraq and they used the schools for 16 hours out of the 24 hours. They had three rotas.  They had one lot going from early morning until lunch time, they had another lot going in the afternoon and they had adults going until late at night.  That is an area that we could look at.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="135" /> I would also like to say a word about the value of education, what we have to offer.  I think it can be a real boom to our economy.  I know that our universities, our medical schools, the college of surgeons, all these institutions are held in very high esteem abroad and the Government should look very seriously and enthusiastically at the opportunity which exists there for selling education abroad. Already, large numbers of foreign students are coming into this country but that is something which could be greatly developed and expanded.</P>
    <P>I know our third level education institutions are highly thought of in the Arab world, in the Far East and in most places around the world and there is a great opportunity for us to put these resources to the benefit of some of the less-developed countries and, indeed, to make money for Ireland out of it.  I do not see why that should not be done.  I am one of those who believe that if they can afford to pay, let them pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Miss Keogh Miss Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Miss Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to the Seanad.  We should all acknowledge that our educational system is just about one of the best in the world in general, and the curriculum is substantive and relevant in general terms.  Education in the last few years, and there were some words of praise for our present Minister and past Ministers, has been productive and progressive in general but I do not want to look at those kinds of comfortable generalities.  I want to look outside of those, to a couple of specific areas, because we have to show concern in education.  We have to spot the emerging needs, to identify change and we, as legislators have to serve as a catalyst to make sure that that change is brought about.  In the context of the discussion on the Education Act, we should look at exceptions to the general rule and see what needs to be done.  I know others have tried to do that.  I would like to look at some things that are not right yet and at what we have to get right, starting now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senators heard me speak about <Col N="136" /> this before.  I think in particular that pre-schooling is not right.  It is not even nearly right.  The services are not yet subject either to regulation or registration so we have a situation where we pretend children do not exist until they are four years of age.  At four, they can enter our formal school system and we say: &ldquo;I see you. You exist&rdquo;.  Before that, invisible kids. We are not fooling anybody in this regard.  We are not fooling the parents of those children who know that the period between birth and four years of age is a time when more learning takes place than in any subsequent period.  If the child, when he or she grows up, goes to university, goes to any kind of college, works harder than hard, that child still will not learn more in its first four years at college than he or she learned in the first four formative years of life.</P>
    <P>Those first four years are when they lay down the foundations for language, for relationships, for an understanding of their environment and for the capacity to reason.  It is when they learn how to learn and yet we really pretend that they do not exist.  We are allowing them to fall somewhere between the Department of Health and the Department of Education. We are allowing them to be put into nurseries and baby-minding situations some of which have no proven educational value and a minority of which are positively worrying.</P>
    <P>That is bad enough when a toddler or a three year old is from an environment that is rich in words, stimulation and security.  It is bad enough in that situation to postpone our educational responsibility for the child, but it is a disaster when the toddlers from an environment where stimulation, security and literacy are all at a very low level.  It is a disaster when the toddlers come from a deprived background, where the television serves as an electronic baby sitter.  We know, and we should not pretend not to know, that early intervention can remove or lessen problems which otherwise line up for children who come from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. Unfortunately, as yet we are not providing that intervention in any coherent <Col N="137" /> way.  We are not acknowledging our responsibility to cherish all of the children equally in this, the single most significant developmental period of their lives.</P>
    <P>This is happening because we have a hangover in our thinking that says toddlers and children are there, of course; they require the stimulation and care, education and warmth, of course, but that is the mother's job.  That is true. No argument with that, but it is the father's job and it is the job of a nation which recognises that the pattern of work has changed and changed for good. Women are working outside the home and both parents are working.  As a nation we have to make sure that our planning takes account of and responds to that by addressing the needs, educational and otherwise, of the first four years of the life of every citizen.</P>
    <P>If this country has managed to evade its responsibility to &ldquo;pre-schoolers&rdquo; then we have a problem and it is a problem for which there is no voice and no platform.  I have made the case, and it is a strong case, that we should have a council for the status of children which would allow us to focus on the needs, potential and rights of children as, indeed, we focused on the needs, potential and rights of women.  We have a Council for the Status of Women.  That does not mean that all women's problems are going to be solved but it has been a constant presence forcing us to acknowledge the important issues affecting their lives.  A council for the status of children or even a commission examining the issues affecting them is something that we badly need, bearing in mind that we have a dangerously complete power over our children and that they have very few ways of fending off that power.</P>
    <P>When it comes to primary schools one of the major issues is that life skills must be developed as an integral part of the curriculum.  The basic skills of communication and numeracy are already well recognised as essential.  The concept of partnership between school, home and community has been underlined by the success of individual projects and which <Col N="138" /> have been recognised as essential.  The concept of partnership between school, home and community has been underlined by the success of individual projects and have forged strong links between all three.</P>
    <P>I mentioned life skills.  I do not think it is something that you learn once and then have for the rest of your life.  Times change, and life skills have to change with them.  I, like many of my colleagues, was a teacher.  I was trained to teach and I had the right skills at the time.  But I would not have those skills in the future because problems are emerging for children within our educational system and just were not around when I was teaching. There will be problems in the next few years that are not around now.  One of the obvious challenges would be what happens when children with AIDS have to be integrated into our schools.  Integration is the key word.  We have to try to integrate those children and other disadvantaged children, whether physically disabled or mildly mentally handicapped, into our existing school system.</P>
    <P>Some people mentioned the disadvantaged. It is the single most important area for special care and understanding &mdash; those children from homes disadvantaged through very low incomes and who are disturbed by family backgrounds.  This was brought home to me very forcibly late last year when visiting a school near me.  About 37 per cent to 40 per cent of the intake of junior infants came from one parent families who were also suffering great deprivation in a whole variety of areas.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is an uncommon experience.  When we talk of the partnership between parents, school and community we realise it needs a special approach from our educational system.  I know there is work being done in this area, but under the new Education Act a new major countrywide drive to overcome these problems is needed.  We cannot create parallel ghettos; and, if our teachers are to cope, there has to be a major re-examination of training procedures and a provision of ongoing inservice training to enable teachers to <Col N="139" /> manage the complexities that now face them.</P>
    <P>One of the things we should look at is the unaddressed problem of the transition between primary and secondary schools.  Transition has really been appropriated by the latter section of second level schooling.  In fact the transition between primary and secondary school is often the factor which makes a success or a failure out of the whole proces of second level schooling.  Students make that transition in a kind of obstacle course mode. They do not know what they are trying to prove and have only the most vague expectations.  There is no continuity really, not even a report form which would ease the arrival of the student in his/her new school and ease the introduction to a new teacher.</P>
    <P>We have to work harder to achieve holistic education, education that looks at the whole person in their context rather than regarding each individual as a hot potato to be dumped from hand to hand and forgotten.  If our educational system is to look at the whole person in their context then, of course, we have to reexamine the leaving certificate programme and do it quite quickly.  It is predominantly academic, which means that it is unsuited to the needs or abilities of those who are not academic by inclination. It does not address the whole area of life skills.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the option of a two-year uniform curriculum with common core subjects.  That means that the students would gain a senior certificate at that stage.  After that they could follow a post certificate cycle where specialisation would be carried out.  That could be either vocational or directed at entry to third level education.  I do not think curriculum reform should be unduly influenced by the requirements for a third level education.  The school leaving age could be extended so that all students acquire a senior certificate.  The best elements of the present leaving certificate programme, which consists of the ideals of a liberal education, should be drawn on in addition to the senior certificate <Col N="140" /> programme and the vocational preparation and training programmes.  Those two are marginalised because of the perception of their lower status.  That is an error.  I think an integrated programme could eliminate that type of difficulty. Programmes should include learning how to learn, how to solve problems and to integrate learning and doing.  That offers everybody a basis of preparation for living an adult life.  It focuses on enterprise, which we need so badly, and on teamwork, where initiative and creativity in work situations are valued.</P>
    <P>I agree with many people that our young people are becoming part of what I term a commodities market called the point system.  If we were to examine how our teenagers are covered by some of our better newspapers at the moment we would find that the overwhelming bias is to interpret them through these points. The acres of coverage given to points is part of a vicious circle which is narrowing rather than widening the options for young people.  It represents a supply and demand theory, where the price of entry to popular or sought after courses are points.  We need a balance between the points system and the assessment of suitability for various courses.</P>
    <P>I know that third level colleges, universities, institutions and RTCs provide a wide range of courses from certificate to degree level.  Many people advance the argument that certificate courses could be run in tandem with post leaving certificate courses, particularly those that are of a vocational nature.  Even within the present system those colleges which provide certificate courses have a higher retention rate of students to leaving certificate. Of course, the knock-on effect of that would be that there would be increased capacity within third level colleges for courses leading to diploma or degree.</P>
    <P>One of the great truisms of education is that it is a lifelong thing.  We all feel comfortable saying that.  Unfortunately, to a great extent it is a lie here or a fairly diluted truth.  Other countries like France take it very seriously.  They talk about the third age and they actively encourage <Col N="141" /> retired people to go back to college and get the degree they have always wanted or study a discipline that is new to them. It creates a different atmosphere in universities.  It extends the active and happy life of older people.  It prevents the stereotyping of older people by young people and vice versa.  It is time the Department of Education provided an imaginative, positive initiative to put a bit of life into our constant claims to regard education as a lifelong process and in our claims to value our older citizens.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed Education Bill.  I am glad we have the opportunity to put forward some of our ideas here on education today and I look forward to contributing to the debate in the future. I thank the Minister for being so cooperative and so willing to listen to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to start by thanking the Minister for agreeing to come along for this debate.  I understand that she is more than agreeable that we might have a quarterly or fairly regular debate on education in this House.  I would like to see it established on a basis whereby we could expect that we would have the Minister in the House for such a debate.  I would certainly like to thank the Minister for facilitating us in that matter.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I congratulate the Minister for the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the matters contained in it in relation to education.  I am not always that generous with praise in this House, but where it is due we should not skimp on it.  Certainly there are very many good elements in relation to education in that document.  Therefore, I will not be opposing the motion before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is in the document on education is very much a milestone in terms of the progress that has been made in educational development.  We were experiencing a very long period of educational cutbacks and at least now we have stopped that and are now hopefully in the process of eliminating the worst of the excesses in terms of cutbacks over the last number of years and beginning to <Col N="142" /> build on the strengths of our educational system, and they are many.</P>
    <P>We have had an educational system run on a shoestring.  Indeed, Senator Keogh referred to an area which is not even covered in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>&mdash; the whole question of pre-schooling.  We do not make State provision for that area and there is no mention of it in the programme. It is unfortunate.  That is part of the reason our primary school begins as early as it does, at the age of four. Nevertheless, it is an undoubted fact that a tremendous amount of development takes place in the young child at an age prior to that and it is a matter that we must address in the future.</P>
    <P>I mention in passing that we were discussing yesterday the whole issue of educational exchange.  I suggested yesterday that that is a matter in which the Minister's Department should have a considerable say.  I could not see why it was relegated solely to the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It refers to matters such as research, studies, student transfer and exchange and teacher exchange.  I would have liked to have seen some formal representation on the commission of the teaching profession to ensure that their professional expertise was used when students or teachers were being selected for the exchange programme.</P>
    <P>In relation to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, we will be seeking to ensure that the commitments made are honoured in the future and that we build on them.  We must remember that this is not by any means the be-all and end-all of educational development; it is the beginning of a positive development in a broad sphere of areas of education. I want to ensure that they are met and, hopefully, that they are improved.  A pupil-teacher ratio of 19 : 1, which is all that will be there when the programme is over, is still not a great pupil-teacher ratio; half a career guidance teacher is not a great number either.  There are many matters where we would like to see development in the years to come as well as honouring the existing commitments.</P>
    <P>The question of in-service training is <Col N="143" /> one of the major areas.  It is referred to in the programme and there is funding made available in the programme for it. I do not think the programme is adequate enough to deal with the requirements of a comprehensive in-service training structure, which obviously we need in this country.  At present we are spending approximately £1 million between the primary and post-primary sector on in-service training.  That is much less than 0.1 per cent of our annual educational budget.  When you consider that we spend 85 per cent of our annual educational budget on teachers' salaries and when you have that high level of labour intensive activity, it is very important to ensure that the full professional potential of those teachers is tapped.  That is why you cannot separate in-service training from education.  Less than 0.1 per cent of our total educational budget going on in-service continuous training, professional development, personal development is not good enough.  We need a full-scale structure.  We need a structure whereby in-service training is available on a national basis throughout the country so that all teachers are able to avail of it. We have various <i>ad hoc</i> courses, summer courses, we have had the day courses for the junior certificate but we have to provide a service that is accessible to all and to do that we must put the structure in place.</P>
    <P>I would envisage that the ideal structure needed at local level is the teacher centres that are in existence at present on a temporary basis and staffed by people who are on a part-time basis.  They are short of funding all the time.  They get a certain contribution &mdash; I think it was £181,000 last year &mdash; from the Minister's Department, but that is very little to operate on.  What we need is a full-scale structure.  We need a full-time director as they have, for example, in Drumcondra. We need a secretariat.  This is the system that is operating in Northern Ireland.  I believe that, whatever structure we put in place, this should be the unit of delivery in relation to in-service training.  To do that we have £500,000 for 1992 from <Col N="144" /> the progamme and £1 million for 1993. To my mind, that is less than useless to deliver a meaningful in-service training structure.  That is an area I would like to see addressed.  The money that is there is fine in the context of what we have at present in relation to in-service training, but not in the context of what we need and with what we must have to bring us into line with European countries.</P>
    <P>In relation to the sixth year cycle, I am obviously delighted the Minister has made that part and parcel of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> It is a worthwhile development.  It is belated, we have been looking for it for a long time, but at least it is there. What remains now is to ensure that the sixth year cycle is properly integrated into our post-primary system, that we are able to avail of it and get the maximum out of it.  To do that we must ensure that the funding and the personnel are in place.</P>
    <P>Of course, the programme does not refer to that in terms of how the Minister is going to resource the sixth year cycle. It makes provision for the sixth year cycle, but obviously it will require certain resourcing and staffing levels.  I think it will require a lot of development to ensure that it operates at a good level. For example, we discussed the last day the transition year option.  The transition year option to my mind has always operated on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  It has been more or less thrown in for teachers to take up, the guidelines have been given, but the resources have not been put in place. Neither has the curricular side of it been developed in what we would regard as normal curriculum development &mdash; for example, the way we approach the junior certificate and the senior cycle, with course committees, with full-scale examination of curricular needs and developments. It is left to the individual school to put forward their portfolio and it is left to the co-ordinator to deal with it and to bring what numbers of staff they can get who are willing to participate.  Even though it will require extra work from them, they do not get extra pay for it and they do not get extra resources.  That is not the way to operate.  I think it is an <Col N="145" /> excellent option, but in terms of how it is catered for at present it leaves a lot to be desired.  That must be looked at very carefully.</P>
    <P>I understand we have some 122 or 124 schools at present engaged in that programme; but they are doing it bravely from their own resources and using their own personnel, who are getting nothing extra for it in any sense &mdash; and by &ldquo;any sense&rdquo; I mean from the Department of Education.  It will be a development that will be part and parcel of the three year cycle at post-primary level.  This is the time to examine it and to ensure that it is properly developed to take its place as part of the cycle.</P>
    <P>We then have the question of certification for the sixth year cycle. Obviously, the leaving certificate is the major certification in post-primary education: it is still the leaving certificate but now with six years.</P>
    <P>There have been major developments in recent years.  Already we have the transition year option, the vocational leaving certificate, the post-leaving certificate courses, the vocational preparation and training courses.  All of these are worthwhile developments that have taken place over the years.  We must ensure that we put in place a structure which incorporates all those developments that fit within six years of post primary education.  It is very important that we do not jeopardise the situation by allowing developments to take place that go off at a tangent from an integrated post primary system, where the results of the fruits of three years of post primary education at senior level are dovetailed into one recognised certificate.  I would like to see that development taking place.</P>
    <P>In relation to the leaving certificate itself, it is now the recognised examination &mdash; and the Minister has done a lot of work on that herself &mdash; for access to third level.  In 1992 we hope we will be at the stage where the CAO and the CAS are blended together and there is a common points system and a common entry points system for third level.  Again, it would be a shame to see that jeopardised. I must refer specifically to the <Col N="146" /> proposals by the City of Dublin VEC whereby special bonus points will be given to its students who are at present on post leaving certificate courses that come within a six-year cycle, that they will be given priority in an elitist fashion in regard to access to the six constituent colleges of the Dublin Institute of Technology, thus making it more difficult for students from any other part of the country, or indeed from any other secondary or vocational school elsewhere.  What is happening here is that the CDVEC are a law unto themselves in this matter and that militates against every other VEC because the DIT is for the benefit of the entire nation, not for a particular VEC.</P>
    <P>There are many other things I would like to go into with the Minister.  I would like to explore the question of the new school model she mentioned and I would like particularly to look into the question of what is proposed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in relation to how schools can operate in the future, the broadened parameters of their operation in a community context and how they can operate in terms of continuing education, in the context of adult education, literacy work, Youthreach and the VIOS.  I would like to look into that and see how that can be structured so that secondary schools in particular can tune into that.  It is an area that has largely been the preserve of the vocational system to date: there is no system whereby a secondary school can really become a community school, properly speaking, at present.  There is need for a co-ordinating structure.  I have mentioned before that what we need at this time is to look at our providers in that area, the VECs and what have been the religious bodies.  I would love to see the whole area being integrated into a single system whereby post-primary education would be delivered by a co-ordinating body that would be responsible for providing back-up and research for all our post-primary schools.</P>
    <P>An area we have been reluctant to go into in recent years is the whole question of educational broadcasting.  Nowadays <Col N="147" /> that is a big issue.  We have distance learning. But here in Ireland our national station does not have personnel or does not have a slot for educational broadcasting. It is about time we looked at that again. It existed up to the mid-seventies and then it was done away with.  There was special funding from the Department of Education for it for that period of time. It would be well worth while looking into that area again because it is part of modern technology and part of the lifestyle and ethos in which our youngsters develop.  It could be a very useful learning programme for us.</P>

      <P>I think it is time that we bring the debate down to a commonsense level.  It is time to add realism to the debate.  It is time to add a voice of opposition to the debate.  It is clearly the case that the only party who opposed the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in the Dáil was my party and that remains the case.  All is not well in education, firstly, with the pupil teacher ratio.  There is no way that we compare to the European situation in that regard. It is the tragic and sad reality the blunt reality, no matter what we may say that at the moment 602 classes in the primary sector have 40 students in their classes. That is a factual situation admitted by the Minister to our spokesperson, Deputy Jim Higgins, in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>There are many small schools around this country without remedial teachers and there is a crisis of remediation around the country.  I would also say that there is a total inadequacy at the moment in the free book scheme.  There is also a great problem at the moment with the capital building programme for schools. There are layers of bureaucracy and ridiculous administrative obstacles to the grant system, particularly for the third level colleges.  When my good friend, for whom I have great personal regard, Senator McKenna, addressed the House it is a pity that he went off on a complete flight of fancy.  It is a pity that he let his imagination fly with him.  What was interesting was that</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> It is very significant that the level of stress and frustration and the low level of morale among our teaching profession at the moment has resulted in the fact that the ratio of female teachers to men is three to one.  There is total frustration in the teaching profession at the moment. There was a survey carried out&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  There was a survey carried out by the Irish National Teachers Organisation this year for their Congress which showed a high level of frustration among teachers throughout the country with the job at the moment.  That is a factual situation. I put it to the Minister that the fact that we have so many small schools without remedial teachers and the fact that we have among the largest class sizes in Europe is a total indictment of this Government's performance in education.</P>
      <P>It is my contention that there is nothing more in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> other than a set of platitudes.  I have a lot of respect for Senator Costello, but I was disappointed to hear him acting as the Government press officer in this debate.  I must genuinely put that to the House.  Were I not to do that, I would be failing in my personal responsibility.  It is my contention that this has been a lost opportunity in regard to education.</P>

      <P>I thank the Seanad for inviting me to the House today.  Lest it appear that I wanted this debate &mdash; I am very glad to be here and am always glad to talk in public and answer any questions &mdash; it was not I who prompted or requested it, but Seanad Members on the Opposition side.  Some Opposition members then found themselves in an invidious position.  If I had been in Senator Jackman's shoes &mdash; and I will tell her at the end what I would have done &mdash; I would not have handled it as she did and would have come out better, perhaps. <Col N="150" /> However, it is for the Senator to decide upon her tactics.</P>
      <P>I am most interested in this debate and before I go into the points, may I say one thing with regard to Senator O'Reilly, whom I like very much; I have had many interesting conversations about education with him.  He started by saying what a dreadful thing it is that there should be three female teachers for every male teacher. In the Dáil, the Opposition spokesman on education, Deputy Jim Higgins raised this also on Dáil Question Time.  He proceeded to tell the world how wrong it was that there were more female than male teachers.  I said what was wrong was that the women were not getting into the principalship positions, that their greater numbers were not reflected in areas of responsibility or in principalship posts and I regret that.  His complaint was that there were too many women teachers.  Bully for the women teachers and more power to them.  They bring a note of realism into the classroom. I reject any criticism of the ratio of 3:1 women teachers.</P>

      <P>Speakers on the motion were Senators Mullooly, Jackman, McKenna, Hederman, Keogh, Costello and O'Reilly and I thank them all for their commitment and efforts in the case of education.  Most of them have been, or are, involved in education, a reflection of the high calibre of people who come to the Seanad and who make their mark in the education system.  Various points were brought up by the Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point was raised by Senator Mullooly, Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Education who was most thoughtful and <Col N="151" /> reflective in what he had to say.  He praised where praise was due and cavilled where there was need for further consideration of questions.  He was clear on the specifics of the PESP and he welcomed the proposed reduction in the pupil teacher ratio and the programme for disadvantaged pupils.  He referred to one teacher schools and change is proposed in the circular which went out in March on this issue.  For the first time in the history of the State there has been a reduction in the one teacher schools but it needs to be looked at further and I take that point and various other points he made.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman had difficulty coping in the particular circumstances.  What I would have done&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">

      <P>You are a member of the union which wholeheartedly accepted the salary proposal and the genuine commitment to education contained in the PESP.  The Senator's union fought as did the INTO and the TUI for many changes which got into the PESP.  Neither the unions, nor the Department got everything they wanted but everybody fought dearly for the specifics.  The Senator said the proposals were platitudinous; that there was nothing in them.  I refer her to page 31 of the PESP where it says within the foregoing broad general framework it is proposed to initiate action on a number of specific areas as follows.  The programme continues for five pages and deals with such matters as when each article is to be introduced.  Senators Jackman and O'Reilly continued on the reckless course of saying that these things were not going to be.  In March the primary schools were notified of their allocation, post-primary schools are currently being notified, allocations are available for the TUI sector and the voluntary sector and for community and comprehensive schools.  They have been <Col N="152" /> told the numbers of teachers they may employ.</P>

If the Senator wants all those letters to be sent to her individually I could try to do it but it would be a difficult task.  Figures were arrived at within the ratio bands.  There is no special political significance to their getting it.  As I speak, the unions, management, parents and the Department are working through the 80 remedial teachers, 30 teachers for disadvantaged children, the massive expansion in the home school liaison scheme, <Col N="153" /> the special teachers for children of travellers, the visiting teachers for young travellers and the changed ratio for the children with special disabilities in special schools for the handicapped.

      <P>I would to God the gift to see ourselves as others see us.  We will go on to the next speaker, Senator Hederman, who made a good speech. She did not praise or give out but spoke out about education in the way I like to hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>She agreed with everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>No, she did not agree with anything I said.  She spoke about the <Col N="155" /> correct meaning of the word &ldquo;education&rdquo;. The Senator should not throw a tantrum.  She spoke about the correct type of education necessary to equip a young person to survive, to live, to be able to call upon her own resources and the resources about her.  She spoke about the correct meaning of the term `liberal education' which is a broad thrust along the path of the humanities and not an early specialisation.  I agree completely with that.  Early specialisation &mdash; this dual track arrangement which counties are going into and coming back from, going into a vocation at 15 years to be earmarked forever &mdash; all wrong.</P>
      <P>Within the leaving certificate one should be able to take up academic subjects and practical subjects, subjects which would encompass the broad range of educational provision.  The leaving certificate must remain the benchmark and to apportion children to a vocation at the age of 15 or 16 to say, &ldquo;All you are going to do is this&rdquo;, is wrong.  It does not equip children mentally or render them adaptable, resourceful or resilient to encounter any other kind of specialisation or for the broad thrust of life.  I am strongly committed to this view.</P>
      <P>Senator Keogh spoke about the need for pre-school provision.  Children come into school at four and the Department of Education only recognise formal schools; the Department of Health look after what exists of pre-schooling provision. Children go to school at a younger age in Ireland than in any other European country.  Participation in formal schooling at four is unknown in the rest of Europe.  Perhaps when resources permit, we will address this matter.  At the moment we cannot; we are trying to concentrate on the school proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator mentioned the transition between primary and post-primary, an old chestnut of my own that I have often spoke about.  The Senator also spoke of a council for the status of children.  I had a sudden thought; what about a council <Col N="156" /> for the status of men?  That is a joke, because it conflicts with what I said earlier.</P>
    <P>Senator McKenna gave a very robust performance and I thank him for his espousal of my causes.  What the debate about local democracy is between Senator McKenna and Senator O'Reilly, I am not quite sure.  It seems to refer back to a debate of last week.  The Senator rightly identified various points within his own education sector, particularly at the vocational level and he identified expansion in second chance education and in education for the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello welcomed what was being produced in education and rightfully said we need more of it.  That is my own contention and the recommendation in the PESB, which says that all of these provisions will be reviewed when that point is reached and allows, under the three year programme, for ongoing discussion and debate, is welcome in that context.  The Senator raised some educaational specifics which I wish to comment on.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello mentioned the Education Exchange Act.  There should be a tie up under that Act between the new lingua programme and the way it is broadening out into Europe and I intended to have a word with my colleague about that.  There were three other matters.  One was the need to put in-service training on a proper footing.  A report was commissioned which has now been received in draft form and will be resubmitted in its finality.  I am glad to be able to announce this year an extension of the provision of teachers' centres.  The centres have been informed and this will be made public quite soon.  It is a modest step but it is the first time such a step has been taken in years.</P>
    <P>The transition year is an interesting matter.  During a debate in the Seanad last year it was discovered that transition year pupils around the country in 124 schools were taking the formal State examinations of this country or of the <Col N="157" /> UK.  I disagree with that because the announcement of the transition year, backed by Mrs. Gemma Hussey and it was a great step forward, was accompanied by a strong letter from the Department stating that it was not to be an examination pressure year; it was to be a year in which young people would find themselves and have time to do other subjects, would have time to come to the Seanad and listen to fevered debates, to go into Switzers and browse among the clothes, to do humanitarian work &mdash; visit a prison and see what happens there &mdash; and see how they could contribute to society.  That is what the transition year was intended to be.  Along the way some schools were naughty and decided, maybe under peer or parental pressure, that there was a need for an examination structure.  I disagree with that.  In furtherance of what I said at Easter, and what I have said here, I have sent a letter to all the second level schools giving them a date by which they must respond &mdash; the date has gone past &mdash; saying if they wished to continue with the transition year they must say that they are not participating in any formal State examinations, and their replies have come in.</P>
    <P>We have three years to formulate a correct policy for transition.  This is what Senator Costello was touching on.  Every pupil beginning post-primary school in September will have the option of a transition year.  It is, of course, a matter of choice.  Some pupils will not want it and some parents will not deem it necessary but they will have a choice.  We have time now to formulate a correct policy for the content of a transition year, for the resources to go with it and for its objectives. We are lucky to have that time.  I will be asking all of the constituents within the NCCA to look at that matter very closely.</P>
    <P>I like Senator O'Reilly on a personal level and I am disappointed as a teacher that Senator O'Reilly would not welcome <Col N="158" /> a lowering of the pupil/teacher ratio among other things.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to be able to address this House on this motion. The script is there for the benefit and education of the Members and I would recommend it strongly to them and, indeed, to the transition year pupils.  I would be very glad to supply them with scripts and perhaps someone could see to that when the students are leaving because it would be interesting and part of their day out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The script refers to the Primary Curriculum Review Body and the newly constituted NCEA, to the Murphy review, and to the junior and leaving certificates. The NCCA and the bodies on it are at present looking at all the senior cycle provisions and the entrance procedures to college.  There was no mention in the debate of the question of the number of <Col N="159" /> honours and all that meant.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is a unique and significant development along the road of educational reform for which I have obtained the backing of Government and social partners and for the resources necessary to make substantial progress.  Education is now commonly regarded as the key to economic and social progress in the modern world.</P>
    <P>Increased attention had been paid to developing the capacity of the education and training system to better serve the interests of the economy and substantial progress is being made in increasing links with industry.  The approach of a new area based strategy will be to provide second chance education or training for those who leave the formal system before completing their second level education.</P>
    <P>With regard to Youthreach, the former Minister, then Deputy Hussey, had two VTOs, we have 34 VTOs.  In four years she provided half the number of remedial teachers I introduced in one year.  The most significant provision in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> from the point of view of the reform of education is the commitment to issue a Green Paper on education by the summer of 1991, a White Paper in early 1992 to be followed by an education Bill.</P>

Why not wait until the Green Paper comes out first and then we will have a full and open debate on it?

I have also requested school management authorities to actively promote all means of effective co-operation between the schools and the parents' associations.</P>
      <P>The expansion in educational opportunities from the mid-sixties onwards has brought about a quiet revolution in the way we are as a people compared to what we were 25 years ago.  Education is like that.  It has a profound impact on the way a person thinks, perceives and acts and colours what you are going to be in later life.  We could stay here day after day debating this topic.  The idea of a regular debate on education in this House was floated last year because of the existence of the Educational Cultural Panel and the number of teachers among the Senators.</P>

      <P>Minister, you are very welcome to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. I would like to share some of my time with Senator Doyle, as agreed.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister for Education, who was here prior to this, to take positive steps to reduce the burden of the cost of third level education on the middle income PAYE sector.  The figures I have before me show that 37,500 students attend HEA colleges.  There is an inequity between students of HEA and students attending other third level institutions, because the ESF grants are not means tested.  Of the 37,500 students, 27 per cent get full grants, both means and maintenance; 9 per cent get partial grants, either means or fees; 24,000 students get no State support.  These are the people that I ask the Minister to assist through increasing of the third level grants to the middle income PAYE sector.  The 24,000 students get no State support.  They are people on modest incomes.</P>
      <P>These are not high flyers, or financiers who do not need funding, they are people on modest incomes.  The problem is that the thresholds are too low.  One example that I will give to the Minister is that of a married man with three children. He is on an income which I consider extremely modest in these days, of £15,000.  He receives no grant.  Not along that but he cannot get for his children fees or maintenance.  There are many people in our society on incomes of £15,000 who have high expectations for their children.  They realise, as we have been told over and over again and, indeed, it surfaced in the debate on education today, that the higher the levels of qualifications within the education system, the greater the opportunities of getting jobs at the end of the day.</P>
      <P>There is no point in having our students emigrating to Europe, inclusive of Britain, or to America, or wherever, with minimal educational standards.  We in Ireland have always been a nation that has put tremendous store on education. Over the centuries, from the time of the island of saints and scholars, the stress on education has always been a No. 1 priority with parents, so much so that they sacrifice much to ensure it.  In the early years, obviously, we just had primary school, which was available to all. Then a follow through came of entry to second level with the advent, 25 years ago, of free education.  Of course, it is obvious that free education will come to third level.  It is expected today that parents will want third level education for their sons and daughters &mdash; not just sons as it has been in the past, but daughters as well.  I know there is a high level of girls in the third level system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will go back again to that £15,000 income.  It certainly is a barrier to the children of parents who wish them to have access to third level.  If you look at the grant, full and inclusive of maintenance, the maximum is £3,068; that is the minimal cost.  I am talking about the maximum grant, which is not all of the cost factor to parents if they wish their sons and daughters to experience and benefit from third level education.  If you subtract that £3,068 from the average <Col N="165" /> income of £15,000 for the man who does not qualify for a grant, he is left with an income of £11,932.  Of course, if there are three average, or intelligent, children and if they qualify with their honours to go to third level &mdash; the children could be close in age &mdash; I cannot see how those parents would have a hope of either having even one of their children getting the opportunity of third level education.</P>
    <P>The sad thing is that some students who get places in HEA colleges have to turn down their first choice and opt for other third level colleges.  I am not saying that they will not get a good education in other third level colleges, but surely everything to do with options today and with developing the potential of the individual to the full, must ultimately be to get that student into a third level programme of his or her choice.  We do not want square pegs in round holes.  If they have qualified for the HEA but the money is not within the family income, and there is no grant to send them to a third level college, they are denied access.  Surely we are supposed to cherish all the students of the nation equally.</P>
    <P>People are coming to me asking about the grant system.  The grant system militates against the PAYE sector.  The statistics show that the self-employed are far more successful in getting those grants and so their children have access to third level education.</P>
    <P>Let us look at a family with children who did qualify.  A father may have an income which allows him to qualify.  He may have a number of children.  It is a heartbreaking decision for parents to see the first child going to college, but the second or third child with equal abilities &mdash; or better &mdash; wanting the opportunity to go, are unable to do so.  The parents may have to make that heartbreaking decision.  These are the children of teachers and Garda sergeants.  I am referring to people who have come to me pleading that something be done to enable their children to have the benefit of exploring their potential to the full. <Col N="166" /> I am asking the Minister to try to do something, whether by income tax rebate or whatever, to ensure that the PAYE sector &mdash; the middle income sector &mdash; are not affected in relation to equal opportunites for their children.  It is something that is going to become an issue.  When the Minister comes back again, as she promised today, the whole question of third level will become an issue.</P>
    <P>I am not even going into the problems of the socially deprived students today. That is a debate for another day.  I am talking specifically about the middle income PAYE sector with expectations. Some PAYE sector workers have had the opportunity in the past of third level education for themselves.  As I said, if I were to open the debate to the socially disadvantaged, some of whom were very bright, I would stress that they certainly do not even get near the prospect of third level education.  Today, I am asking the Minister to take positive steps to reduce that burden.  They have other costs like mortgages, etc., which I could enumerate. Some of them have suffered redundancy, but they still place the same value on education and wish their children to be able to pursue the courses of their choice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Our children are not born equal.  That goes without saying.  We have to ensure equality of opportunity for all of them so that they can realise their individual potential.  The only way that can be done is through ensuring equal access to all tiers of our education system. It is the one goal all Governments must have, and it is certainly the goal of Fine Gael.  The only way we can be seen to be cherishing all our children equally is by allowing them equal opportunity.  It starts by having equal opportunity throughout the education system.  We are specifically talking this evening about equal access to third level education, and access for the middle income group to be quite specific.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As my colleague said, if we were to <Col N="167" /> open the debate now to the socially disadvantaged it would be a far broader issue.  There are many bright young people who cannot even consider the option of third level education because their parents are not in a position financially to add to whatever maintenance and fee grants they may, or may not, be entitled to.</P>
    <P>I come from a constituency in Wexford that has no third level institution of any kind.  We are acutely aware of the problems this causes to all levels in society, particularly the PAYE sector we are discussing today.  We are surrounded in Carlow, Waterford and Dublin by different third level institutions, but none is close enough for the young people to live at home and to travel daily, thus avoiding extra maintenance costs.  Ideally, we should be addressing ourselves to free third level education for all young people who meet the basic academic qualifications or the basic qualifications for the particular course &mdash; the specific honours that are laid down.  That is the only way we will have equality of access, and equal opportunity for all our young people to third level education.  I know that cannot be done overnight.  I would be very interested to know if the Minister has the figures of the costings if we were to open third level colleges to all those who qualify, regardless of means.  I imagine the cost to the State would be fairly stiff.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, what I would like to ask the Minister, particularly for those parents who would like to be able to pay for their young people at third level colleges &mdash; particularly from places like Wexford, where they have to pay maintenance fees for the young people from Monday to Friday &mdash; at least to make the extra cost to the parents tax allowable. Parents in the PAYE sector may have more children at home.  We must seriously consider this, as young people today once they are over 18 years of age, are adults.  These young people are adult <Col N="168" /> dependants, in every sense of the word, of their parents if they are being fully maintained by their parents.</P>
    <P>The cost of keeping these young people, over and above whatever grants may or may not be coming to them, has to be fully borne by their working parent or parents, depending on the situation in the home.  My plea to the Minister is to make those costs tax allowable to ensure that as many young people as possible avail of third level education.  Without certification today, our young people have a bleak future.  We are looking at 20 per cent unemployment at the moment. Now, 10 per cent of those unemployed suffer from all sorts of social problems, such as alcoholism, depression, marital and family problems of one kind or another.  We must do everything possible to ensure that our young people do not face the dole queues of the future.</P>
    <P>It is statistically well recorded and charted that the greater the educational qualifications and the greater the certification of our young people, the greater the realisation of their individual talents and potential, the smaller the chances are of them ending up on the dole queues. That is what we must be aiming for, particularly in areas like Wexford where we have, tragically, a very low uptake at third level.  I would risk being contradicted by the Minister that we have perhaps the lowest uptake at third level in the country because of the logistical problems, as well as the financial problems, of getting the young people to third level colleges.</P>
    <P>I would also request, in the context of this discussion, that the Minister would give serious consideration to the provision of a third level institution in Wexford. We would settle for a satellite college running courses that are relevant to our industries, given our location and our attractive Europort.  We would be in a position to attract more jobs if we were able to give the third level education that is necessary for high-tech industries today.  A third level institution is essential <Col N="169" /> for Wexford, to ensure that we do not languish at the bottom of a pile in terms of the number of our young people that make it to third level institutions of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>The only long term address to poverty is through the education system.  Let us not create a new poor, a category of people whose parents may be at work but who, after they have paid their PAYE, do not have sufficient disposable income to keep young people at college in terms of maintenance fees, books, clothing and whatever pocket money that is essential.</P>
    <P>We are living in a changing world, we are living in a society in transition.  It is no longer brawn that counts, it is very much a matter of the brain being developed as well.  There was a time where there were sufficient unskilled jobs for our young people to opt in that direction if they were not in a position to see their education through to third level. That is no longer the case today as I think the Minister will fully realise.  The Gulf War did one thing for us; it made us realise that even when it came to armies fighting it was no longer brawn that counted, it was the smart weapons, it was technology that won that war, rightly or wrongly.  It is an indication of where the brain has taken over from brawn in the world today.  We owe it to all our young people to ensure that those who meet the qualifications get a full third level education and are not hindered by the fact that their parents are not financially in a position to keep them at third level colleges of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>Certificates equal money in the bank for young people today.  That means they are less likely to be dependent on the State, more likely to be at work and to provide their own houses, to look after their own health, to look after their own children's needs.  It is an investment in the future of our country to invest in third level education for our young people today.  Education, particularly in languages, will open the possibility of employment in Europe generally for our <Col N="170" /> young people.  Let us not preclude any young person, whatever their talents, from being mobile enough to take up employment wherever they might want to do so, preferably at home if that is their first choice but let them look to Europe, providing we are sending them to Europe well qualified and equipped to get the jobs that are available there today.  Young people will be in their own limited world if they are imprisoned in a life without education, without third level education in the context of the debate today.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister realises the crisis that exists among the PAYE sector for those who want to do best for their children. There is one thing that motivates us all, regardless of our background or our interests in life, and that is we want our children to have a better chance in life than we had ourselves.  We all want better for our own children: that is what motivates us all.  It motivates us all in this House; it motivates us in local government; it motivates us whether we are on the residents' association or the parents' committee or the board of management of the local school.  We are really doing it for the next generation to ensure they get at least as good a chance as many of us got, but better in most cases when the chances were not available for some of us.</P>
    <P>The motivation is good.  We take risks with our children and let them grow. We must be sure we do everything possible to ensure a happy, healthy and secure future for them in the town and country of their choice so that we will have a generation who can look after themselves. They will not have to look to the State, as many people regrettably had to do in this generation because they were not able to continue in education themselves.</P>
    <P>I will be very interested to hear the Minister's views on whether he could provide third level education in County Wexford, one of the few counties that has no third level institutions.  Hence there is <Col N="171" /> the lowest uptake by young people in Wexford of third level education.  It is my plea to the Minister.  We have talked about it for a long time and I would like to see some action on it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is as well to put this motion into its financial context. In the present year the gross allocation for educational services is £1,416 million. This is the largest allocation ever made for education and it represents in the region of 6 per cent of GNP.  After social welfare and health, education is the next largest spender of Exchequer resources. In 1991, £300 million or 21 per cent of the gross allocation for education, is for the higher education sector.  This is 6.4 per cent greater than the 1990 allocation.</P>
      <P>The priority of the Government must be to provide additional student places across the range of higher education institutions to meet the increasing demand. In this context the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> commits the Government to provide about 9,000 additional third level places, 3,600 in universities under the special undergraduate expansion initiative, 600 for UCD at Carysfort, 1,500 by spare capacity in the colleges of education including Thomond College, 2,000 through RTC and other third level facilities under the National Development Plan and 1,000 with private sector financial involvement being explored by Limerick University.  In addition, central services and physical facilities in the third level VEC sector will be further strengthened to enable them to cope with increasing enrolments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan £75 million will be spent on capital works in the third level area.  In association with the 3,600 additional places being provided in the universities a further £15 million will be provided for capital development.  Further capital allocations will be provided under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to <Col N="172" /> upgrade and replace substandard accommodation in VEC third level colleges.  In addition to dealing with the additional third level places, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> also contains special provisions to deal with improving access to higher education from the under-represented socio-economic groups.  Funds will be made available to forge links between third level institutions and second level schools in disadvantaged areas.  Dublin City University which has developed a special relationship with second level schools in Ballymun is an excellent example of this kind of initiative.</P>
    <P>Through these kinds of links the benefits of third level education can be brought home to students who through lack of knowledge or motivation might not have considered higher education as an available option.  Initiatives of this kind will lead to increased retention rates at second level and one would hope will help to redress the imbalance that exists at present at third level between the different socio-economic groups.</P>
    <P>On the student support front almost £60 million was provided last year under the higher education grants, VEC scholarships and ESF grants.  The number of students receiving assistance under these schemes was 34,500, an increase of 6,000 on the previous year and of over 10,000 in 1981-82.  Positive steps are being taken all the time to improve the schemes of student support.  For example, expenditure on the higher education grants scheme has increased from £3.4 million in 1981 to £27.5 million in 1991, while the number of grant holders has more than doubled in the period from 1981 to 1991.</P>
    <P>This motion must also be looked at in the light of the extent to which progress has already been made, as evidenced by the foregoing.  Notwithstanding the heavy demands on the Exchequer for educational services, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides that the higher education grants scheme will be re-examined in the context of <Col N="173" /> increasing the income eligibility limits for families with more than one child attending third level education and in developing a more equitable income assessment for all applicants.  I have no doubt that this examination will lead to improvements in the scheme and will help those whom both Senators have in mind.</P>
    <P>In the context of the second chance education, the examination of the scheme will include the assessment of income eligibility of mature students on the basis of their own and, if married, that of their spouse's income and secondly, regarding the mature students who secure a place in third level institutions, as satisfying the academic requirements of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I take the points that have been fairly made by both Senators but I think that the funding of third level education must be placed in the context of the significant improvements that have taken place over the last number of years.  All of us would like to see a more fair playing pitch with regard to eligibility for third level education and it is in respect of trying to make more opportunities available especially towards the less well-off sections of our community that series of initiatives have been taken both as part of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> programme, and indeed outside it.  However, I think it is a little unfair of the Senators to simply make a demand in the way it has been done without doing so in the context of the considerable improvements that have been made, indeed without being cognisant of the very significant demands in all areas of the education sector and indeed all areas of the economy.</P>
    <P>I would like to respond specifically to the Senator's question in regard to Wexford. I think the Senator will accept that many areas throughout the country make consistent demands for having their own third level institution and clearly it would not be desirable to have a proliferation of such institutions throughout the country. I would have the view that to expend <Col N="174" /> the scarce amount of resources in the way the Government have now decided through the increase in places in existing institutions gives much better value for money and a much better opportunity to Wexford people than would the very considerable expenditure which would be involved in the creation of a third level institution, even a satellite institution, in Wexford.  I could only answer that question by asking can the taxpayers of Wexford afford a third level institution any more than the taxpayers of so many other parts of the country who feel they should have such an institution?  In fairness the improvement in transport, in the accessibility to existing institutions, will considerably improve the situation in Wexford and in other parts of the country. It is the Government's intention to continue to provide more resources so that the major work that still remains to be done providing greater access and opportunity can be achieved as we go on. Positive progress has been made and will continue to be made under the policies that are being pursued by the Government.</P>

      <P>Personally, I would favour such a suggestion.  In particular it is rather difficult for families of PAYE taxpayers who have two or three children attending university.  The idea of some form of tax incentive for such families has a lot of appeal.  We are back to the same old story that that costs money and that is money the Exchequer can hardly afford.  I know the Minister is quite keen on such an initiative and I am sure she will continue, as all of us will, to try to bring about such a development.</P>

      <P>Everything the Minister said we have read already in <i>Programme for Economic and Social <Col N="175" /> Progress</i>.  I can see where the higher education grant scheme will be re-examined. It is written in here.  We are all very much aware that there are anomalies in the system where the self-employed have access to grants and we know that their salaries are way ahead of the PAYE workers.  These discrepancies and anomolies are evident every day of the week and they have to be examined and addressed in order to achieve fairness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point about the anomalies but the Department have been very rigorous in ensuring that local authorities take every possible step to ensure that an accurate assessment of income is attained and that includes now insuring that all assessments are backed up by an evaluation by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>Where people in different localities are found to be eligible for grants and it appears to members of the VEC, such as the Senator, that they are not entitled to those grants, then that is a matter for the local authority to carry out investigation to ensure that people who are not making proper returns of income do not receive those grants.  From the Department's point of view, we have tried to ensure that a very rigorous examination is carried out. I accept that in years gone by people received grants who were not entitled to them because of the absence of that very rigorous assessment.</P>
