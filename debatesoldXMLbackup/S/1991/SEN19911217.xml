      <P>I have notice from Senator Hugh Byrne that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to outline the Teagasc proposals regarding the closure of the soft fruit centre in Clonroche, County Waterford, and other centres.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to outline the present position of the extension of the DART to Greystones, County Wicklow, and to provide extra subvention to Bus Átha Cliath to ensure adequate bus services.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that the extension to the Girls primary school in Adare, County Limerick, is constructed in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Byrne, Ross and Neville as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Byrne's matter and it <Col N="1690" /> will be taken at the conclusion of business, Senators Ross and Neville may give notice another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed today to take Item No. 2, Criminal Damage Bill, 1990: Committee Stage, to 6 p.m; there will be a sos between 6 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. and from 6.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. all Stages of the Industrial Development (Amendment) Bill, 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be opposing the Order of Business because of the proposal by the Government side to guillotine through the Industrial Development (Amendment) Bill to take all Stages this evening. There is no need for the Bill to go through all Stages this evening and we have to object on principle to that.</P>
      <P>May I also say, a Chathaoirligh, we have come to that time of year where the famine of legislation of the past few months is now replaced by the urgent need to get through three or four Bills this week. We object very strongly to having to take all Stages of the B &amp; I Line Bill as is being proposed, even though it has not yet finished its run in the Dáil. We wish to state our objection to that and to the general repetition of what happens in the last week of this session every year &mdash; this sudden, urgent need to get through business that could have been taken very easily over the past few months. For that reason we will be opposing the Order of Business today.</P>
      <P>However, I do not want to be entirely negative. I would like to congratulate the Leader of the House on getting the Electoral Bill into this House. It is very important legislation and at least we will have something to start working on next session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what Senator Manning has said. Every <Col N="1691" /> year this happens. We are sitting twiddling our thumbs for weeks dealing with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can speak for quite a number of people on your side of the House, if I may address Senator Honan through the Chair. There is a sufficient degree of honesty in Fianna Fáil to acknowledge the fact that virtually nothing has been happening in the past few weeks and we are then faced with an indecent rush of legislation at the last minute. This indicates an inability on the Government side to manage the business of the House, so I will certainly be voting with the Fine Gael Party on the issue of the Order of Business. I think it is lamentable. I do not blame entirely the Leader of the House. He has a difficult job but it clearly is the responsibility of the Government to treat this House with some degree of respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I start on a positive note and add my word of congratulations and thanks to the Leader for organising the Electoral Bill to be taken in this House first. On that point I think the pleasant side of it finishes. I am totally opposed to the way the Order of Business is being organised today. It is a disagrace. We are faced with having four Bills to be rushed through this House in four days as we came to Christmas. That is not way to do business and it gives ammunition to those people who want this House abolished. I am totally opposed to what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House if it would be possible in some way to do something about my good friend and neighbour from Sligo, Mrs. Holly McLoughlin, who lost her husband. He was killed in South Lebanon by the Israeli forces. She was offered a paltry £50,000 in our money and a letter of regret. In this day and age when you get £50,000 <Col N="1692" /> for a loss of a toe nail, I think it is scandalous. I am sure everyone in this House would agree that it is no way for the Israelis to treat this case. They admitted that they acted wrongfully and deliberately. I ask this House to do something to strengthen the claim of Mrs. Holly McLoughlin, a woman with five children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the nature and sensitivity of the matter I did not want to say this, but we should not really discuss this on the Order of Business. I appreciate the Senator's comments and probably the House accepts that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say to the Leader of the House that I object very strongly to the proposed time limit on the discussion on the Industrial Development (Amendment) Bill. I want to point out to the Leader that this is a very important Bill. It was introduced or published on Friday, 5 December. It was debated in the Dáil the following Thursday and passed under pressure there. Now it is in this House a matter of days later and we are being given something like three hours to dispose of it. There is half a billion pounds of taxpayers' money involved in this legislation and there is the abolition of another State body. I think it is totally unfair to the standing of this House to ask us to dispose of an important measure like that in three hours and I would like the Leader to reconsider his proposal in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter I have referred to on a number of occasions: the situation that over the past two months all we have processed in this House has been two Bills and now in the last four days we are asked to process four Bills. In any circumstances that is a total imbalance in the way the work of this House has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Criminal Damage Bill, I am delighted to see we are not taking all Stages today, because I think we should never have the situation where <Col N="1693" /> more than one Stage is taken on the same day. However, if the Committee Stage is completed by six o'clock &mdash; and probably it will be &mdash; then that is all right, but I do not think the guillotine should be imposed on that Stage either because it is important legislation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Industrial Development (Amendment) Bill, it is absolutely ludicrous that we take all Stages on the one day. It is a very important Bill, involving very large sums of money and a huge policy change in relation to industrial development and a number of semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>We should have the debate on unemployment as a priority. We will not have it now before Christmas, but we should have it immediately after Christmas. Considering the number of articles and media coverage given to emigration to Britain, the United States and elsewhere, we have to address this whole area of employment, of unemployment and emigration of our young people. I ask the Leader of the House to make time available at the earliest possible opportunity in the next session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning led off with a question in regard to the Order of Business for today. There are very good reasons why the IDA Bill must be completed today. I indicated &mdash; I think it was last week &mdash; that we would be having this Bill and would be passing it before Christmas. In regard to the B &amp; I Line Bill, I indicated perhaps two or three weeks ago exactly what would be the programme for that Bill. It would come to the Dáil at a certain date and would come to us very close to the Christmas recess. That is exactly what has happened and I gave sufficient warning about it. Unfortunately, this is a fact of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been here for almost 11 years and at every recess, no matter who is in Government, we find that there are always two or three Bills which must be passed in the last week of the sitting. That has happened. It is not of my doing. It is just the nature of the business of both Houses of the Oireachtas. To my knowledge it has happened consistently over <Col N="1694" /> the past 11 years at least and I am sure it happened before that also. Senator Norris supported that view. He and other Senators, including Senator Manning, referred to the Electoral Bill which I am pleased we will have in this House. Obviously, we will be discussing it as soon as possible in the New Year. It is a very important Bill, a Bill of 176 sections, and I am very pleased it is being initiated in this House. I think it was Senator Norris who mentioned coming back early, and I certainly do not mind coming back early. In fact, my plan is to come back before the budget. There will be plenty of legislation for us.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton's point about four Bills being passed this week is inaccurate. Two Bills will be passed this week. We are not passing the Criminal Damage Bill or the other items of legislation referred to on the Order Paper, but two Bills will certainly be passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the Appropriation Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>My apologies. That is three. The Appropriation Bill is a standard piece of legislation and must be passed. It is a bit different. It has always been passed at the end of the year and then we have further discussion on it in the New Year. Discussion is not closed off when we pass the Bill before Christmas.</P>
      <P>Other questions asked related to when Bills would be taken, times and so on. I would like also to comment on a question asked by Senator Farrell. I know the case well and I share his concern and his views.</P>
      <P>Senator Howard and Senator Costello referred to the same aspects of the legislation for today. In reply to Senator Costello, I will certainly consider a debate on unemployment when we resume in the New Year.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are related and may be discussed together. I wish to inform the House that due to a misprint the word &ldquo;program&rdquo; in the first line of amendment No. 2 is misspelt and in the second line of the same amendment the phrase &ldquo;for the purpose of section 5&rdquo; should appear in brackets. Senators should note that. We regret any inconvenience caused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;access&rsquo; in relation to data means access which unreasonably invades the privacy of the data;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I always thought the spelling of &ldquo;programme&rdquo; was optional, that you could have &ldquo;program&rdquo; or &ldquo;programme&rdquo; but I am always willing to be corrected on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to define more clearly what we mean in relation to the offence of accessing data. As I said on Second Stage, I regard the criminal offence as being far too wide. My main argument against this legislation is that effectively we have dual legislation, an updating of the 1861 legislation and an appendix in relation to unauthorised <Col N="1697" /> access to computer data and programmes.</P>
    <P>As we relied so strongly on British legislation in relation to this Bill, we should follow their procedure in relation to it and have separate legislation. Britain has a Computer Misuse Act, 1990, and a Criminal Damage Act, 1971. We could usefully have followed that procedure especially since we follow so closely the wording of the British legislation. However, we have muddled the two together giving us an inadequate and unacceptable Bill. I still do not think it is too late for the Minister to separate the legislation. The Bill will have to go back to the Dáil since the Minister accepted an amendment there and it would be no harm for him to have a good think about the matter over the Christmas and see whether the wrong procedure was adopted in presenting the Bill in this manner.</P>
    <P>We must try to improve by amendment the sections that are seriously inadequate. One area where the Bill would benefit is by defining the word &ldquo;access&rdquo; where it unreasonably invades the privacy or the confidentiality of the data. The civil law covers normal abuses of access to data. If we criminalise access to programmes or data, the very least we should do is define &ldquo;access&rdquo; and say it is an unreasonable invasion of the privacy or the confidentiality of the data rather than use a catch-all umbrella phrase.</P>
    <P>Pirated software at present breaches the Copyright Act and that offence is dealt with under the civil law. Let us take the case of an employee using a computer in the employer's office to produce private letters. As the Bill stands, this is unauthorised access, without the person's consent. It would be unreasonable to think that accessing a programme or a file to produce a private letter would incur criminal liability. I am not saying that will happen but the Bill does not specify where the offence lies. The Bill is so broad that, as it stands, any unauthorised use of a computer to access data, which may not be of a serious nature, is an offence. We need to define &ldquo;access&rdquo; in more definite terms and state that it is accessing confidential financial secrets, <Col N="1698" /> files, for example, the medical files of somebody looking for a job or something of that nature.</P>
    <P>We are dealing for the first time with the very complex area of computer hacking or unathorised access to data and we should not approach it in this clumsy fashion. Our first approach should be in the context of attempting to define it. What are we looking at? Are we looking at economic loss, private personal loss or the ordinary day to day use of a computer where somebody uses somebody else's pass in an office to gain access to a file which is not necessarily personal or sensitive. There is nothing in this legislation which provides parallel categories <i>vis-á-vis</i> other categories. It is a criminal offence. One must have a lawful excuse which means authorisation from the owner.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 are the sections to which access refers &mdash; a person who, without lawful excuse, operates a computer to access data. It makes use of the computer unlawful unless the person can prove they have an excuse. That is the nub of it: any use of a computer to access data is unauthorised and is unlawful because it is unauthorised unless the person doing it can prove they have an excuse. There is no presumption of lawful excuse but, worse still, there is no attempt to indicate something that could better be dealt with by the civil code. It is simply a breach of regulation. It is not a terribly serious matter. It goes on every day, for example, photocopying from a book without permission. It happens regularly in the classroom that a book is photocopied and given to children. If the Copyright Act stated this was a criminal offence would a classroom of children be subjected to criminal law because they had infringed the copyright laws? The same type of principle is involved here &mdash; because one gains unauthorised access, whether of a serious or non-serious nature, one is subject to the criminal code and no distinction is made.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider this amendment, to define access so that it will be seen as a serious matter for example, an unreasonable infringement <Col N="1699" /> of confidentiality, of secret or sensitive information of financial, medical or economic files &mdash; and let us know what he has in mind. Surely he is not talking about the day to day use of a computer. However, that is encompassed in the Bill as drafted and that is why, even at this late stage, we should abandon those sections dealing with computer hacking. We should ask the Law Reform Commission to look at this area, give them 12 months or two years to report back to us and then let us proceed with the legislation.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept this amendment and to distinguish between the serious category of offence in relation to accessing computer data and the non-serious type of offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. We are introducing many new terms that have become acceptable in the computer world and it is important that we state as precisely as we can, what we mean by them. On Second Stage Senators expressed a great deal of concern about section 5. As pointed out by Senator Costello, when we say that a person without lawful excuse accesses information, people who are innocently accessing information and obtaining access to computer programmes might well be charged with a criminal offence. This view was very forcibly expressed by Senator Ryan and others on Second Stage and this amendment goes some way to clarify what is meant by access.</P>
      <P>We have come to accept computer terminology but since we do not know what legal interpretation will be put on them the more precise we are the less likely we are to create difficulties afterwards. There is no doubt but that the area of computerisation is developing very quickly. Its introduction into the education area is now gathering momentum. Within ten years, computers could very well replace school books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People access information on others passes over a period of time and a person could be charged with a criminal offence even though they accessed information <Col N="1700" /> quite innocently, as they saw it. If we do not clarify in as great a detail as possible what we mean by &ldquo;accessing information&rdquo; we could find ourselves in a serious situation when these new terms are interpreted legally. To interpret &ldquo;access&rdquo; in relation to data as meaning access which unreasonably invades the privacy of the data goes some way towards clarifying what we mean when we talk about access to computer information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. Lyons) Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. Lyons)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. Lyons)</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments have the object of amending section 5 of the Bill so that it would not be an offence to access without authority any non-confidential data or data in relation to which the owner of the data does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy. I regret that I cannot agree to a restriction of this kind on the scope of section 5. The mischief which that section is designed to avoid covers deliberate penetration of computer systems without authority with the object of assessing particular data whether that data are sensitive.</P>
      <P>The section endeavours to deter all forms of hacking, including accessing of various sytems in the expectation of coming across some information of interest to the hacker. The information accessed in the course of this trawl of data systems could include what the Senator described as data in relation to which the owner does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy. In fact, it probably would but we want to deter this practice which can cause damage and impose substantial financial burdens on industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be useful if at this stage I made some general comments about hacking as it arises in other amendments also. Hacking consists of getting access to computerised data without having authority to do so. It can be done either from inside or outside an organisation by someone not having any legitimate connection with it. Insider hacking takes place when an employee with legitimate access to the data equipment either uses it for a <Col N="1701" /> wrongful purpose or exceeds his level of authorisation in accessing particular data. The insider may, of course, be using a terminal that is located far from the central processing system of the organisation concerned.</P>
    <P>Outsider hacking takes place when persons who have no legitimate connection with a data system gain access to it by using a telephone line in conjunction with an electronic device called a modem. It is the kind of activity that people most often think of when referring to hacking. I emphasise that hacking cannot be prevented by security measures, though it can be made very difficult. All systems are potentially vulnerable to insiders, and these include people with authorised access to a system connected to the system in question.</P>
    <P>The outside hacker has many hurdles to overcome. He or she must first identify a telephone line connected to the computer and then ascertain the appropriate password to gain access to the system. However, telephone numbers of existing data lines and passwords and the methods by which they are changed are publicised and exchanged between hackers in western Europe and in North America by means of on-line &ldquo;bulletin boards&rdquo;. Hacking has been made easier also by the development in recent years of interchangeable software that can be run on any hardware.</P>
    <P>A hacker can cause considerable damage. If the computer system has only an information storing role, the hacker can erase the information or introduce false data. If it has an operational role, if it is dealing with, say, inter-bank fund transfers, air traffic control, stock control, automatic reordering, airline and hotel bookings, payrolls, the hacker can re-write these systems or add false data with the possibility of substantial damage and financial losses. In both cases he can introduce viruses or worms, that is, programs that replicate themselves and either use up the capacity of the system or delete existing data.</P>
    <P>Even if no damage is caused &mdash; I want to emphasise this &mdash; hacking gives rise to further costs on industry. First, there is <Col N="1702" /> the cost of security measures and of monitoring the system to check whether there have been unauthorised attempts to enter it. Then there is the cost of investigating any instance of hacking, however trivial. Frequently the computer owner may be advised to close down a system and rewrite the software completely as a precaution. I think I have said enough to show that hacking is a serious, anti-social activity and it is right to criminalise it.</P>
    <P>I refer to the offence of hacking as set out in the Bill. There are three ingredients in the offence and all of them must be present before an offence can be committed. First, at least one computer must be used. For example, an employee could take home with him a disc containing data he was not authorised to access and access the data by inserting the disc in his own computer. An outsider hacker will operate both his own and the target computer or computers. Second, there must be no lawful excuse; in other words, the person operating the computer must not believe he has the necessary authority or consent to do so or that he could get it retrospectively. This is provided for in section 6 (2).</P>
    <P>Third, the person must operate the computer with intent to access data. The offence will not be committed by someone who gains access to data simply because he is incompetent or careless or has not been properly informed about the limits of his authority. It will also not be committed by someone whose intention in operating a computer is, say, to play a game on it. Reference was made to that kind of activity during the Second Stage debate by my learned colleague from the same city as myself. Neither will an offence under section 5 be committed by someone who steals a person's ATM card and uses it to obtain money. Here, again, the intention in operating the bank's computer is to obtain money. However, an offence of damaging data would be committed under section 2 of the Bill as the transaction would have altered the data in question. In addition, there would, of course, be an offence of theft.</P>
    <P>It is essential for a successful prosecution <Col N="1703" /> under section 5 to prove each one of these ingredients of the offence beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, a person whose intention it is to play a game on the computer does not satisfy a key condition necessary to establish a basis for such a prosecution. This is not to say that the use of an organisation's computer for such purposes by a student may not be as serious as using it for, say, penetrating records of examination results before they are published. The software for such games could undermine the integrity of the main computer. There are many examples of viruses being introduced in this way and causing serious damage not only to that computer but also to any other outside systems to which it is connected.</P>
    <P>This morning in the newspapers there is a report of a survey which suggests that a third of our top 200 companies have suffered at least one computer virus attack and that most of them believe the risk from viruses is increasing. While section 5 does not make it an offence to play games on another person's computer without authority so long as that is the sole object of the operation, I do not wish to minimise the possibility of unwittingly causing damage by such a practice.</P>
    <P>To return to the amendments, the House will agree that any form of hacking, whether or not it is confined to nonsensitive data, should be stopped and for this reason I cannot go along with the Senator's amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that with all these people playing with each other's programmes and so on one would hope that no virus might be contracted from the games they were playing.</P>
      <P>On a serious note, I agree with much of what the Minister said but I wonder how appropriate is it? The reasoning behind the amendment, which I fully support, is that we are dealing with a kind of portmanteau legislation. Through certain sections of this Bill the Government are attempting to introduce material which is properly the subject of a completely separate Bill. The Minister, rather engagingly, acknowledged that were circumstances covered by this Bill where, in fact, no damage whatever was caused. May I remind the Minister that the title of the Bill is the Criminal Damage Bill, where it starts wandering into areas where no damage is caused I wonder how suitable is this kind of arrangement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of computer hacking is important. Of course, there are serious difficulties and problems caused for companies, indeed Governments. Sensitive data can be obliterated by the introduction of viruses. In fact, we have just passed Friday the 13th and there is a celebrated virus which is called &ldquo;Friday the 13th virus&rdquo; because it is triggered by the date appearing on the computer clock. As a result, it cannibalises all the information from that date. I agree with much of what the Minister says but it is not directly germane to this Bill with the exception of computer viruses where, clearly, criminal damage can be caused. <Col N="1705" /> The Minister spoke about cases either of practical joking in certain instances or espionage, industrial espionage principally, but they are not, in my opinion, proper to a Bill that deals with criminal damage. For that reason I support the amendments which have been placed in the name of the Labour Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened intently to the Minister's reply and I found it very much off the mark. It was very informative about the substantial offence of computer hacking &mdash; unlawful and unauthorised accessing of data. It is a very serious matter.</P>
      <P>What I was saying is that we have to establish what is sufficiently serious to warrant criminal prosecution. We must establish when a computer is operated in a matter which should be subject to legislation and when it is simply a matter that is of nuisance value and should not be subject to the courts. What the Minister is doing in this Bill is simply introducing a catch-all definition in relation to section 5 and 6, thereby ensuring that this legislation will be inoperable.</P>
      <P>How can one possibly criminalise all use of a computer? Obviously it is not intended that the legislation should apply to computer games but what is there in any of the sections to declare exceptions or indicate areas not subject to the application of the legislation? All areas of computer operation are covered by the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 states that a person who without a lawful excuse operates a computer (a) within the State with intent to access any data kept either within or outside the State or (b) outside the State with intent to access any data kept within the State shall, whether or not he acceses any data, be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £500 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding three months. Where is the categorisation there? Where is the serious offence and the non-serious offence? Where are the games? Where is the provision for use of a computer merely for entertainment purposes or <Col N="1706" /> reckless use of a computer by the employee?</P>
    <P>Surely there is an onus to report on the employer, or the owner of the computer; no such onus is contained in this legislation. The owner may allow the computer to be operated because it contains no sensitive material. The onus to report should only exist if the computer contains serious material that can be abused, and the legislation has not specified that. We need to look at the question of owner expectation, to establish what is an invasion of personal privacy and confidentiality of material in the computer. Those questions are relevant to this legislation.</P>
    <P>Many offices throughout this country operate in such a way that there is no question of accessing certain files which are potentially damaging. As Senator Norris said why create an offence when no damage has been caused? That is the nub of it. One can access information, operate a computer or interfere with computer data. One cannot use a computer without using the programme and a programme is largely neutral. There is nothing sensitive about the contents of a programme. Why criminalise this activity and make it subject to imprisonment or a very substantial fine where no damage may have occurred?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken time to reply to this amendment in order to take into account anxieties raised by Senators on Second Stage and the tabling of the amendments made it necessary to deal adequately with the points raised then and again today on the amendment. I do not know what Senator Norris meant when he said we were playing games; I wonder what games he was talking about. If they were computer games we will stick with that. If some other kind of play acting is involved maybe he could explain that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated already that there are three main ingredients necessary to substantiate an offence. I do not think it is necessary for me to outline them again, but if Senators feel that I should spell them out in a shortened version I will do <Col N="1707" /> so. The amendment as proposed has the object of amending section 5 of the Bill so that it would not be an offence to access without authority any non-confidential data or data in relation to which the owner of the data does not have a reasonable expectancy to private information. Despite what the Senators have said, I regret that I cannot agree to a restriction of this sort in section 5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of the Bill are extremely wide, in fact absurdly so. Section 5 is about unlawful accessing, to use this very displeasing term. The section applies to a person who, without lawful excuse, operates a computer (a) within the State with intent to access any data kept either within or outside the State, or (b) outside the State with intent to access any data kept within the State Precisely how is it proposed to prosecute people who commit offences outside the jurisdiction of the State? I cannot follow this. Presumably this section is intended to cover multinational corporations with international financial transactions or, for example, dubious occurrences within the new financial centre, but to claim to control people who operate outside the State is a wide, and impractical proposition. What policing authority will be vested with responsibility for investigating this form of offence, for example? I cannot believe that the Garda who, for lack of resources, have, unfortunately, already found themselves incapable of dealing with massive fraud and in a very regrettable comparison with Northern Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would like to return to the point on criminality on which the Minister has not fully staisfied me. Matters are being criminalised here which, the Minister himself acknowledges, might cause no damage.</P>
      <P>I understand that the powers of the Bill do not derive from the Title and I hope that the authorities in this House do also. When I attempted to put down amendments on another Bill which would have saved the Government some trouble, the advice incorrectly given was that the Title controls the content of the Bill. I am sure the Minister will return to me and say that it may be called the Criminal Damage Bill but he can put whatever he likes in it. If he does, that will clarify at least one theoretical point that will be of value to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I acknowledge what the Senator is saying. The title of the Bill is Criminal Damage Bill, 1990.

That is why we are dealing with it and that is my only response to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by Senator Norris is relevant. How is it intended to prosecute offences in and outside the State? The point is relevant to a discussion on how unauthorised accessing is allowed to operate and the lack of definition for it. We would need a super police force to enforce this provision and our police force is more than stretched already, trying to deal with existing white collar crimes of fraud and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 2, I do not think the Minister has replied to the remarks I made. There is first, the question of the unreasonable invasion of the confidentiality of the data belonging to the owner, to indicate the seriousness of <Col N="1710" /> the offence. That is covered by amendment No. 1. Amendment No. 2 states that there must be a reasonable expectation by the owner of confidentiality on his part. That side of it has to be taken into consideration. There are many owners of computers and section 6 refers to consent being got from the owner of the computer. Many computer owners would consider that a large quantity of the data is not of a private or a confidential nature. That is a reasonable assumption. If one desires to criminalise unauthorised accessing, some distinction is necessary as to what constitutes sensitive material in the data bank or what constitutes a serious infringement of privacy.</P>
    <P>We must also consider the <i>mens rea</i> aspect. The Bill does not cover the state of mind of the owner as to what constitutes a serious matter. Surely this is relevant and I ask the Minister to refer to that in his reply.</P>
    <P>There is a quantity of menu-type material in computer data banks. For example, a type of electronic bulletin or notice board operates within a network of computers and it exists in a semi-public, semi-private fashion for those who access it in the network. There may be no authorisation given by any of the individual owners of computers in use but the material is intended to be accessible to anybody looking for information on an electronic notice board; in respect of a bulletin of that nature it is not intended to get anybody's permission.</P>
    <P>How does one distinguish between the catch-all definition in section 5&rdquo; without lawful excuse&rdquo; and &ldquo;lawful excuse&rdquo; as defined in section 6 as the consent of the owner? This constitutes a misuse of terminology or, if not, definitions of the terms used should be provided at the beginning of the section and it is not. I am trying to improve that situation with these two amendments to indicate where a serious breach and interference with data takes place to ensure that we do not criminalise all accessing of data but only serious cases where damage has been done. That is the major fault of this Bill.</P>
    <P>We all agree we are totally opposed to <Col N="1711" /> unauthorised accessing of data and to serious criminal offences where vast sums of money are defrauded through the abuse of data information and so on. We will not deal effectively with this problem by means of legislation which does not define the categories of crime. How are we going to deal with it? Will it be policed and how can we ensure that we do not interfere with non-serious matters and criminalise matters that should not be criminalised?</P>

      <P>I repeat the reasons the amendments are not being accepted. They would defeat the purpose of sections in the Bill with the result that it would not be an offence to access nonconfidential data without authority or data in relation to which the owner does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Senator Costello referred to the question of distinguishing between private and non-private data. The object of this section is not to protect privacy, though it may well help to do so. The section is intended to deter the practice of penetrating systems without authority, causing losses to industry, whether or not the data used are sensitive. I hope that covers the queries raised by the Senator.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 2 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) For the purpose of section 6, the accessing of data shall be deemed to have been &lsquo;authorised&rsquo; person has <Col N="1713" /> lawfully been granted use of a computer from which the data may be accessed, and mere breach of any conditions or regulations attaching to such use shall not render the access of the data unauthorised&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What we are trying to do here, as in the other two amendments, is to define more precisely the application of the Bill. This Bill is very broad and we could usefully limit its application by inserting the words &ldquo;mere breach of any conditions or regulations attaching to such use&rdquo;. In the normal world there is a very wide use of computers, and the manner and purpose for which the employee may use them very often overstep the bounds of the specific work intended under the contractual relationship between the employer and employee. Very often an employee will write a letter which may not actually be part of the business in which he is employed. Such a matter is a mere breach of the contractual relationship and the authorisation whereby an owner gives specific consent to an employee to use the computer for purposes to do with the business. Where such authorisation is not given the use may constitute a criminal offence. Why should it be made into a criminal offence if the breach is not of a serious nature? We should have a category specifying petty breaches of regulations or conditions which constitute unauthorised use and operation of a computer but do nobody any harm. This unauthorised use may take up five minutes of the employee's working time but that is not a criminal matter, at worst, it would be a civil matter. These are nuisance elements in all walks of life and just because we have new technology does not mean we should simply create a criminal offence right across the board.</P>
    <P>There are other areas in the normal interaction between people in relation to modern technology which can be specified. Let us say, for example, I had a Banklink card and I decided to give my spouse the number, despite the specific prohibition by the bank which says <Col N="1714" /> nobody should have access to that confidential number, except the bank customer who has been given it specifically for his or her purposes. One is supposed to erase or destroy the number as soon as one gets it, retain it only in one's memory and not to pass it on to anybody else. If I were to give the card to my spouse or a member of the family to extract a certain amount of money from a bank, that would involve operating through the bank computer and feeding material into it without the authorisation of the owner of the computer, which is the bank. I would say that is a mere breach of a condition or regulation attaching to the use and not a serious unauthorised use or abuse of the computer. It is not a form of accessing that should be liable to a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Minister will say the Bill is not intended to or does not cover this area, as with the games, but, nevertheless, the legislation is so broad that it does cover this area. Why introduce legislation covering far more than is intended and therefore impossible to police? The Bill is unworkable, unenforceable and will create more problems than it will solve. We have a problem we all recognise, but let us not solve it in this amateurish fashion. Let us solve it by a proper examination and identification of where the serious criminal offences occur and not the mere breaches of regulations or conditions agreed or imposed by an owner.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity here to improve this legislation, bad as it is. If I had a choice I would simply jettison the entire section. That would be my advice to the Minister and I would like him to consider it. Obviously it does not come directly from the Minister but this Bill has been ill-thought out in terms of its combined effort not just to update the criminal damages legislation but to bring in legislation on the misuse of computers.</P>
    <P>This amendment will move towards defining where actual damage is caused, where an offence meriting criminal liability occurs. If we define areas that can be eliminated, then we are doing a useful day's work. In other words, we are saying <Col N="1715" /> that offences that are mere breaches or that interfere with some agreement but are not of a serious nature, will occur anyway, whether we like it or not. That is the way people interact and interrelate. There will be little twists and turns in the way equipment is used but making such matters subject to criminal liability in this legislation would not solve anything.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept this amendment as an improvement on the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be extremely concerned if criminal liability in the area of employer-employee relations were introduced for minor irregularities regarding accessing information. It has been the premise of our industrial relations that this should be dealt with on the basis of agreement and regulation between the employer and the employee or their representatives. To bring about a situation where minor accessing of information outside what has been authorised by the employer could become a criminal offence moves away from our whole industrial relations approach to date. The last thing needed in industrial relations, at that level, is the introduction of legal sanction. The sanctions that normally relate with regard to disciplining an employee who accesses something in a minor fashion should be applied through the normal disciplinary procedures within an organisation, that is the approach taken in similar circumstances with regard to accessing filing. For example, it is not a criminal offence for an employee to obtain access to an unauthorised file. It may very well be an offence against the regulations or against the person's conditions of employment and an employer can take sanction, but it is wrong to introduce a criminal liability and criminal proceedings in relation to such an act simply because it relates to computers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the section was meant to do this but effectively it does so. The amendment will bring the employer-employee relationship with regard to using computers into line with the area <Col N="1716" /> computers replace, that is, the normal filing of information and the normal confidentiality of information hitherto kept on file. This Bill effectively makes accessing that information a crime. The purpose and effect of this amendment is to change that and return to the normal industrial relationship between employer and employee where a breach takes place. I will also be very interested in the Minister's response to the scenario outlined by Senator Costello with regard to a spouse obtaining money from a bank cash-dispensing machine which is effectively a type of computer. I look forward to his reply on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The objective of the Senator's amendment is to exempt from section 5 of the Bill any person who has been granted the use of a computer from which data can be accessed even though that person may have breached any conditions or regulations attaching to the use of the computer. Acceptance of this amendment would be contrary to the principles underlying section 5.</P>
      <P>Section 5 is designed to deter hacking, that is unauthorised accessing of data whether it is carried out from within or from outside an organisation. In fact, most of this unauthorised penetration of security systems is done from within or, if it is done from outside, has involved collusion with an employee on the inside. The consequences of hacking, the damage to systems and the extra financial burdens caused, can be the same irrespective of whether someone has granted the hacker the use of the computer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point of criminalising such activity, a question has been posed on the difficulty of convicting the person involved. Certainly the investigation of unauthorised remote accessing of data will give rise to special features. Detection and prosecution may be difficult in some cases but that is not a good reason to desist from legislating. It is an unfortunate fact of life and the same can be said of other types of crime. Detection and prosecution is possible, however, even at the moment as is evident from successful prosecutions of hacking in <Col N="1717" /> Britain under the Criminal Damage Act of 1971.</P>
    <P>To make the enforcement of this legislation practical, the Bill confers considerable powers of search and seizure on the Garda. For all their intellectual prowess some prosecutions for hacking demonstrate that hackers lack some sophistication and may I say, modesty in hiding their attempts. For example, in the case of a prosecution of, and I quote the &ldquo;mad hacker&rdquo; in the UK in 1989, the police stated in evidence that they found a copy of the hacker's handbook beside the terminal together with various access codes. The Garda will also, of course, be free to obtain technical specialists from outside, such as technical advice on the operation of a computer system as they may require. It must also be remembered that, even at the moment, the Garda may be called upon to investigate computer-related fraud or theft and I cannot recall any specific cases where criticisms have been levelled at the Garda's competence in dealing with such matters.</P>
    <P>Senators Costello and Neville raised the question of a husband giving his wife his bank card and his Pin number to get money from the bank. That is not an offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained in reply to amendment No. 1, the intention there is not to access data but to get money, so one of the essential elements of the offence is clearly missing, as I outlined in my initial response.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>May I respond to the last point the Minister made because I think it is not entirely accurate. You can use bank cards not only to obtain money but to obtain bank statements. Presumably that will be covered? Perhaps the Minister could respond to me on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have serious worries about this. This is a reasonable amendment because it seeks to limit the extent of criminality and not to make trivial offences into serious crimes. We are talking about people who <Col N="1718" /> have been given a certain level of authorisation for a computer and then being criminalised if they go beyond the conditions and regulations. It is a very subtle area.</P>
    <P>The Bill also purports to criminalise acts that take place outside the State. In other words, the Minister is saying if somebody in Montevideo uses a computer within certain regulations or specifications and gains access here that person is subject to the criminal law. I am at a loss to understand how we can claim to be able to control activities which originate outside the State. This goes right through the Bill, particularly with regard to computer operations. There is a series of points there, the first one being that the Minister is disingenuous when he said there is a difference in using a bank card. Perhaps there is if they are only taking money out, but I would remind the Minister that it is not only money you can extract using a bank card; you can also extract information about an individual's bank account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put a specific example to the Minister and ask him to clarify if it would constitute an offence. In an organisation where a young person who is responsible for purchasing, out of curiosity accesses the list of customers whom the organisation supplies, having been specifically instructed not to access such information that would be a breach of company rule. As I understand it, under this Bill that would also be a criminal offence even though the act was committed out of curiosity and for no ulterior motive. If the employer found the computer print-out with the list of names, he would have evidence which, if he were bad enough, he could supply to the authorities and have criminal charges brought under this law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The longer we proceed in teasing out this and the other amendments the stronger the case gets for saying this is a catch-all Bill. It is ill-defined in terms of the degree of criminality and the degree of seriousness <Col N="1719" /> which incurs criminal liability. The Minister has not adequately answered us on any of the points raised. As Senator Norris has pointed out, you can access a bank code to obtain other things besides money. You can get a statement in which case you have got through to the data which may be confidential. That, of course, could be serious. The offence that is being criminalised is operating the computer with intent to access the data, whether one succeeds or not. Any form of light-hearted playing with a computer, whether or not the file is serious or sensitive, is still an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of industrial relations we are moving into a huge new area if we criminalise what is of a basic regulatory nature between an employer and an employee and which may be specified in whatever contractual relationship has been established. There is a whole area of contractual liabilities where there may be breaches of that contract in terms of the employer and the employee subject to various disciplines which are agreed in the workplace. We are here, impinging on that rather recklessly and saying that, irrespective of the seriousness of the breach, it is a criminal matter. We know how the workplace operates, it is not a rigidly black and white case. There are degrees whereby you have minor or trivial breaches of what would be the normal <Col N="1720" /> expectation of the employer and the employee. The employer very often turns a blind eye to certain practices that develop from time to time. An employee who uses a computer not solely and exclusively for the purposes authorised explicitly by the owner and employer is now involved in a criminal offence, according to this legislation. Surely we have to define what is or is not a serious offence before we start upsetting other areas of contract, regulation and conditions in operation in the workplace, in the trade union movement and so on?</P>
    <P>In relation to &ldquo;the mad hacker&rdquo;, I would be delighted to see the Bill specifying how to deal with a mad hacker but we do not have anything to deal with a person who compiles a handbook of hacking for interfering with sensitive and highly confidential material which may very well end up being used in fraud. We are looking for such a Bill, one which specifies its function, what area of hacking it wants to deal with whether on the economic or the financial side, whether it is with regard to State secrets, or is it the mere use or misuse of a computer by somebody who does not have got the authority of the owner. We have no such distinction in this Bill and until we have such distinction we will have bad legislation.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to section 1 (d), will the Minister reply to the repeated concerns expressed by Members on this side of the House as to how he proposes to deal with an offence committed outside the State involving damage to property within the State? In what way will such an offence be policed and how will the person involved be brought before the courts? This question has already been asked on three occasions by Members on this side of the House. If a section of the Bill is not enforceable it will damage the whole Bill. Will the Minister say how he proposes to deal with a person who, in relation to data, damages or accesses information from outside the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure to be followed in a case like that is an extension into other legal areas such as extradition. To have people extradited would be one way of complying with the question raised by the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose section 1 because too many loose elements are not sufficiently defined to enable us to deal with the rest of the Bill. The Minister said we can deal with such persons by extradition but I would like him to develop that point further; will Interpol be involved at any level? In the context of the European Community and political union, will some form of common legislation operate as this is a multinational type of offence? Under what section of the Extradition Act will this operate without it being necessary to introduce new legislation or to amend the existing Extradition Act, 1965? I am not sure whether that is possible at present but I would like the Minister to indicate whether he intends amending the Extradition Act, 1965.</P>
      <P>Section 1 does not define the causes or categories of damage. There is a reference to damage but the reference to data is strange. It is not just data that can be accessed through a computer in information form but also in programme form without a distinction as to the seriousness of accessing a programme. Many computer programmes are neutral and I am not sure how that, in itself, has the taint of criminality about it. What creates a confidential matter and a nonconfidential matter or a private matter and a non-private matter? What exactly is the damage caused here? That is not defined in the Bill &mdash; the Criminal Damage Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Neville and I asked about the relationship between employer and employee, how that will operate in terms of trade union law, contractual rights, duties of employer and employee and internal sanctions that are the normal part and parcel of the workplace. Where does the criminal act begin, and where does a mere breach of practice start? These matters have not been addressed in this section and the Bill is unclear in what it sets out to do. I accept that nobody decided to tag on an element of computer hacking to the Bill and call it criminal damage. I have already criticised that as a very sloppy and inadequate way of introducing legislation, but what I am really concerned with is that having attempted to deal with the unauthorised accessing of data, no attempt was made to distinguish between a serious and a non-serious matter. Section 1 to deal with computer data fails to define the terminology used or to set out the objective <Col N="1723" /> of the Bill. The Minister made clear what he sees as the objective of the Bill, and I agree with everything he said about dealing with serious criminal matters that can result from unauthorised abuse of computer facilities, data banks and so on. However, that is not what the Bill does; it does much more, it covers all computer activities.</P>
    <P>This section lacks the necessary definitions, limitations, and specifications to enable us to tell precisely what is or is not a criminal offence. The computer world is large and growing. It involves the largest technical innovation in terms of its impact and use worldwide. Therefore, we simply cannot criminalise computer use right across the board. This Bill is inoperable and unenforceable and the Extradition Act will not solve the problem either. It is not a solution and we do not have a police force to operate, supervise, monitor or regulate it. That is another area that is not addressed in the legislation. As I said, there is a lack of definition in this section; and there is nothing in this Bill which says what creates a criminal offence, other than the catch all sections 5 and 6 which are so broad that everything is covered by them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Minister's reply to my query on damage or information accessed outside the State, I do not accept that the operation of an extradition arrangement would be satisfactory. It would satisfy in the event of the person who committed the offence being identified, but does the Minister propose to investigate such offences? What arrangements will be made between police authorities of this and other countries? This is a highly sophisticated and complicated area and thorough and complex police investigations would have to take place. As information can be accessed from anywhere in the world through computer hacking, how does one investigate such occurrences? What are the arrangements for charging such people and for extraditing them to this State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1724" /> The Garda authorities expressed concern on numerous occasions about policing arrangements in the EC, especially with regard to the introduction of the Single European Market and opening borders involving free access of people. Many of us are concerned that this may give rise to the free movement of drugs and arms. Even within the EC, there are policing problems with regard to normal policing arrangements. Therefore, how complex will the arrangements be for investigating and bringing people to trial from anywhere in the world? If it is not possible to do this, then surely this will be a bad law as it cannot be fully implemented. I would like to hear the Minister's view on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello asked if the objective of the section is to deal with matters such as economic or financial loss or at protecting privacy. In short, it is aimed at deterring hacking and I have been stressing that point throughout this debate. That is the sole aim of this section but if it succeeds it will also help to protect privacy, avoid financial loss caused by hacking and maintain the integrity of computer systems.</P>
      <P>Earlier, Senators Neville and Costello asked about the categories of offences and expressed concern at the prospect of minor breaches of the law by employees being criminalised. In practice, an employer should make clear to his employees the information they are not authorised to access. I would approach this in much the same way as other matters which can have a criminal aspect in the workplace and about which some concern was expressed. For example, employees may take home pens or stationery or they may make telephone calls without authority. This does not usually cause any problem provided the activities are minor and that is where I would draw a parallel in terms of this Bill. Substantial loss can be caused by unauthorised accessing of data by employees and the purpose of this section is to deter that. I want to emphasise that this section is there to deter hacking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to damage to data caused by <Col N="1725" /> someone outside the State, that offender can be extradited if the other country has a corresponding offence in their law, and most countries have a similar provision. We have extradition arrangements with most developed countries and damage to data is an extraditable offence where the maximum penalties, as apply here, exceed 12 months. If there is a corresponding offence in another country with a similar penalty, extradition can take place without any need to extend or alter the Extradition Act as was suggested. I hope I have answered the queries raised by the Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the purpose of the Bill is to deter hacking; we are agreed on that. The definition of hacking &mdash; in so far as it is given, the word is not used in the Bill at all &mdash; is the unauthorised accessing of data and that is its limit. There is nothing about the purpose for which the data is accessed or the seriousness of the data, whether it contains information about millions of pounds or information that can ruin a person's reputation. It simply refers to the unauthorised accessing of data without lawful excuse. We are agreed on that but that is not the proper way to introduce the legislation. The Bill, as drafted, makes a criminal offence of any unauthorised use of computer data or program. It states that it is a criminal offence for a person who, without lawful excuse, operates a computer within the State with intent to access data. It is no good for the Minister to talk about somebody who takes a pen or a pencil home because the Bill does not make a distinction between a minor or a trivial offence and a serious one and until somebody explains that I have to interpret the Bill as I see it in sections 5 and 6.</P>
      <P>If, say, the copyright on software is infringed or pirated it is a civil offence and not a criminal offence. We are saying here that it is a criminal offence to use anything that is pirated or unauthorised in relation to a computer but in many other areas it is a civil offence, not a criminal offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1726" /> The example I gave earlier about photocopying material is relevant. In the context of the new junior and senior cycles &mdash; both of which are being introduced with major curricular changes at present &mdash; the textbook is no longer the mainstay of the curriculum, and every teacher is photocopying various parts of books, making videos and distributing photocopies to students in the classroom. I want to draw a parallel here. Is a person who has not got authorisation from the owner of the book or the video equipment that is being used in the classroom guilty of a criminal offence? The same is true in terms of computers. I cannot see why one is a criminal offence irrespective of the seriousness of the matter, another a civil offence and there is no offence at all if it is a trivial matter.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that an adequate answer has been given as to why section 5 exists and why no attempt has been made to define or categorise criminal offences. We need a provision in the Bill, stating the objective of the Bill, the area we want criminalised and policed and under which cases can be brought to court.</P>

      <P>Amendment Nos. 4 and 8 are related and both may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;(1) In any case under this Act, where the extent of the damage alleged exceeds £100, the accused person shall have the right, as shall the Director of Public Prosecutions, to elect for trial on indictment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) In all other cases the matter shall <Col N="1727" /> be tried summarily in the District Court.</P>
    <P>(3) The maximum penalty to be imposed on summary conviction shall be six month's imprisonment, or a fine of £1,000, or both.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is establishing the constitutional right of the accused to a trial by jury. As I said, this legislation is very broad and any type of criminal conviction could result in a permanent stain on somebody's character, affecting their good name, their future and all the rest of it. Therefore, it is very important that the accused &mdash; particularly in the context of this Bill which is so ill defined &mdash; who may be charged with a very minor offence should have the option of electing for trial by jury if the alleged amount of damage would exceed £100.</P>
    <P>First, the Bill is very broad and criminalises areas that should not be criminalised. Second, it is a very important principle that we maintain the right to trial by one's peers &mdash; the right to trial by jury if the accused wishes to avail of it. That essentially is the content of amendment No. 8 &mdash;&ldquo;A person shall not be tried without a jury for an offence under this Act without his or her consent&rdquo;. The amendment is giving two options which are slightly different. One is a specification of £100 as a cut off mark; the other is that in all cases there should be the option of a trial by jury. I urge the Minister to consider that point, since we have now criminalised all unauthorised accessing of data, whether it be serious or not. If this legislation is implemented strictly, we could find ourselves, with many others, who never expected it, appearing in the courts. Since we are casting the net so wide it is right that we should ensure there is the option of a trial by jury.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>At present a person accused of committing malicious damage to property exceeding £50 is entitled to insist on a jury trial. In their report the Law Reform Commission recommended <Col N="1728" /> that the accused should not have an absolute right to trial by jury for any minor offence of this kind. This referred to the obligation on the District Court to ensure that a non-minor offence is not tried summarily. If the district justice concludes that the offence charged is not a minor one, then the case can only proceed on indictment so that the constitutional right to a trial by jury in such circumstances is fully preserved.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that in some of the old statutes, such as those relating to larcency, a trial by jury can still be insisted on for the most trivial of offences. However, I do not see that any special case can be made in this context for criminal damage offences. The fact remains that there is no constitutional right to trial by jury for a minor offence. There are many precedents for the provision in the Bill giving the Director of Public Prosecutions discretion to proceed summarily, or on indictment, and the practice is subject to the safeguards I have mentioned. I regret, therefore, that I cannot accept these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Criminal damage is never a minor offence if it is opposed by the person who is alleged to have committed the offence. Criminal damage is a serious matter. It is one in regard to which we should maintain protection rather than reduce it. We have added now to the area of criminal damage a much broader offence, the offence of unauthorised accessing of computer data. That is as broad an offence as we will ever find in our legislation; it is the broadest criminal offence I have ever come across. I have no doubt that the net that has now been spread encompasses the unwary, those who least expect it. The employer who owns a computer would least expect that he would have to give total authorisation for every use of that computer; otherwise it is subject to criminal action. The least we can do in those circumstances is to provide protection parallel with the scope we have allowed to be established in respect of this offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This emphasises once again why we <Col N="1729" /> must have the offence of computer hacking, why we have to make it so broad. Yet we are reluctant to ensure the right of trial by one's peers. I think we are getting this out of proportion. If we are providing catch all legislation, we have to ensure that there is a jury trial option. As I said, people may come before the courts who never expected to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to what the Minister said. Not being a legal person, I understand that the safeguards under the Constitution are automatic and where it is deemed that an offence is serious, the accused will have the option of a jury trial. Senator Costello has identified serious damage to property as something in excess of £100 in value. I am satisfied that the Minister's explanation covers that area. I was concerned that a jury trial should be available in a serious offence, but I am satisfied that what the Minister has outlined will cover my concerns.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
      <P>Section 3 agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4a:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 4, after &ldquo;has&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or has had&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very simple amendment. If accepted section 4 would read:</P>
      <P>A person (in this section referred to as the possessor) who has or has had any thing in his custody or under his control intending without lawful excuse to use it or cause or permit another to use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Too often we see criminals who are able to overcome lapses in the law &mdash; if you like to call it that &mdash; and use a situation where they can overcome the intent of the law. I think this was discussed in the other House as well. If somebody had an object and disposed of it before he was <Col N="1730" /> arrested, before he was questioned or before he was intercepted by the police, could he then say that he did not have any object in his hand?</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment would be to ensure that a person who had such an object would also be guilty of the offence and subject to the provisions of the Act. Too often, as I said, we see criminals who are experts in overcoming difficulties in the law, using the right of silence in many areas. In this situation I would be afraid that somebody who had, say, an implement to damage property could dispose of it before he was intercepted by the Garda and could then say that he had not any such object in his custody. I believe my amendment would overcome that difficulty.</P>

I hope Senator Neville would agree with my response and that he will not press the amendment; otherwise, I have to say that I could not accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Neville has identified a problem here. A person who has &ldquo;or has had&rdquo; anything in his custody or under his control &mdash; would seem to broaden the scope and enable the law to operate more effectively. We talked already about prosecuting and how best to do it without lawful excuse. If we say somebody has something in their control, should we not also extend it to somebody who has had something in the vicinity or within a short time previously? Later, we refer to an arrest taking place in the context of somebody who has been seen in the vicinity of the crime. Since that would be subsequent to the event, why can we not go prior to the event as well, <Col N="1731" /> if we are going to provide rights of arrest to a citizen as well as to a garda where somebody is perceived to be in the vicinity of where criminal damage has occurred? It would seem a reasonable amendment to extend the powers in dealing with somebody who would be intent to damage property by including prior possession of equivalent that might be used for that unlawful purpose.</P>
      <P>I would be in favour of this amendment. I would like to see the Minister tease it out more comprehensively, especially when it is taken in the context of the arrest section &mdash; section 12. Section 12 (3) provides:</P>
      <P>Where an offence to which this section applies has been committed, any person may arrest without warrant anyone who is or whom he, with reasonable cause, suspects to be guilty of the offence.</P>
      <P>There is also reference to the arrest of someone suspected to be in the act of committing an offence or about to commit an offence. This amendment would seem to fit in with the powers that are given in section 12.</P>

      <P>I can see the point being made by both Senators. It would seem on paper to be a very small adjustment to make. I have no great difficulty with it myself, but I understand the parliamentary draftsman has confirmed that the form of words used in this section is adequate to cover the possession of articles or substances with intent to cause damage. If you think about it for a minute, possession is always in the past, after being arrested anyway. Perhaps we are putting too much play on the words &ldquo;has&rdquo; and &ldquo;or has had&rdquo;. It is the responsibility of the parliamentary draftsman to guide us in the wording. I have a doubt myself but I am slow to say that both gentlemen are wrong. However I have to take the advice of the parliamentary draftsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My other concern is that if we begin at this stage to amend little words like &ldquo;has&rdquo; and &ldquo;or has had&rdquo;, how many more times <Col N="1732" /> do we have to do it? Perhaps that is another question we should look at. If necessary it must be done, I suppose; but I have to stick with the original decision. As I indicated, I hope Senator Neville agrees that the form of words used in the section is adequate to satisfy his concern and that he would agree not to press the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that what the Minister has said is tantamount to agreeing with our views on this. However I do not think that amendment would damage the Bill. At worst, it may reaffirm a situation that is already there but I cannot understand how it would do any damage. It would certainly close the loophole that this side of the House, and indeed the Minister, are concerned may be there; we believe it is there. I think it would enhance section 4 if this amendment were accepted because, as I said earlier, too often that the criminal mind finds ways and means of overcoming the spirit of the law and the intent of the law cannot be implemented because of the deviant resourcefulness of the criminal mind.</P>

      <P>The Minister has to take the Bill back to the Dáil anyway. While that is being done, there would be the opportunity for the draftsman to have another look at it and see if, in view of what has been said, he is satisfied with the wording or if it is less than adequate. Perhaps that would be a more satisfactory way to deal with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), line 26, to delete &ldquo;or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;or to pay compensation to the owner of the data&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to deal with an offence which is liable to summary jurisdiction, summary conviction, and therefore is something we should be looking at in the context of greater flexibility of sanction rather than adhering to the old two-some sanction of a fine or a term of imprisonment. I do not see any reason we should not include compensation. It is reasonable to pay compensation to the owner of the data. The ease with which a fine or imprisonment is mentioned, even in summary matters, always causes me some concern. We seem to have no problem imposing fines or imprisonment no matter how trivial or how serious the offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time we looked at the reform of the prison system and the value of the prison system. All the criminal legislation that goes through this House simply presumes that a sentence of imprisonment is a norm, in all circumstances, but in the context of summary offences a sentence of imprisonment should not be the norm. We should be providing alternative sanctions rather than sanctions of imprisonment. We should be exploring fines, compensation for damage done, community service orders and any range of alternatives to incarceration that we can come up with. What will three months' imprisonment do except cost the State <Col N="1734" /> £100 per day? That is the same as a fine not exceeding £500 or three months' imprisonment. A working week has hardly elapsed before the State has spent as much as was imposed in terms of the fine.</P>
    <P>We do not consider these in terms of the cost to the State or the value of a sentence in terms of reformation or rehabilitation. Our prisons are bursting at the seams. People in prison have all sorts of problems that seem to grow. We have a disproportionate number of suicides in our prisons because of conditions there. Very few points can be made in favour of our prisons. I have hardly heard anybody in either House say that imprisonment is a useful sanction. We should take the initiative and say suggest getting rid of the sentence of three months imprisonment as part of the sanctioning mechanism and put in its place the payment of compensation to the owner of the data, the person whose authorisation has not been received, the person who has not provided the lawful excuse, or the person who has been infringed upon, whose information or whose file has been interfered with. If we do that we are not doing something terribly radical or unthought of; we are acting in accord with the provisions of the Whitaker Committee who said that the vast majority of summary offences can be dealt with by non-custodial means, that the presumption should be not a prison sanction but an alternative sanction. That is a Government established committee. Those are not the recommendations of a radical body but of a large number of civil servants and people in the community, respected in all quarters, who examined the situation scientifically and came to the conclusion that our prison system was operating ineffectively in dealing with minor and trivial offences.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider this amendment as a useful statement of intent by the Government to expand the sanctions in terms of summary convictions into an area that would be more beneficial to the person against whom the offence was committed &mdash; namely, the owner of the data &mdash; in that he or she <Col N="1735" /> would get something out of it; second, that the State would not have a further financial burden imposed' and third, that the offender would not benefit in any case by a sentence of imprisonment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. It goes to the core of what we have called for in this House on numerous occasions when discussing the reform of our prison service. There should be a full investigation of alternatives to prison sentencing. It costs at least £700 per week to keep a person in prison. If alternative arrangements can be made &mdash; and I believe they can &mdash; they should be explored fully. Compensation to the victims of crime is one of the areas that should be introduced. This amendment introduces that as an alternative to imprisonment for minor offences. We all accept that serious offences require incarceration and one would hope there would be more rehabilitative facilities for people than exist at present.</P>
      <P>For minor offences it is a wrong and outdated practice to send people to an overcrowded prison. Most of them do not go to prison anyway. One day of their short sentence is as much as they spend in prison because the prisons are overcrowded. This proposal is certainly in line with Fine Gael policy. For a number of months we have had a motion on the Order Paper calling for the Seanad to look at alternatives to imprisonment for minor offences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just referring to and verifying our policy on this issue. The point I am making is that we should look at alternatives to prison. The proposal that compensation should be made to <Col N="1736" /> the owner of the data is worthwhile and should be extended to all offences that involve personal damage of any sort. We should also look at other areas if, on occasion, fines cannot be collected. What do you do if somebody is fined £500 and you cannot collect it or, if somebody is given £500 compensation, how does he enforce that if there is no prison sentence as an alternative? Attachment of income or confiscation of property of the convicted person should be looked at. Participation in training courses might be seen as an alternative if a person failed to pay a fine. Confiscation of property for failure to compensate the victim of crime is a much better alternative to sending somebody to prison for three months at a cost to the State of approximately £10,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to leave it open to the court to require a person who has been convicted of an offence under section 5 &mdash; which deals with unauthorised accessing of data &mdash; to pay compensation to the owner of the data. The objective of the amendment is achieved by the combined effects of sections 2 and 9. The scope of section 5 is confined to deliberate unauthorised access to data or attempts to gain such access. The offence will be committed either when access is achieved or when the computer is being operated with the objective of gaining access but no access is actually achieved. It will be committed even when the hacker merely looks around the system he has penetrated. Depending on the level of security in the system, a hacker may not get beyond a look at a list of what the system contains. However, if the hacker gets beyond the read only stage, if he adds to the data or alters it in any way, manipulates either the data in the system or the instructions in the program, he will then be committing an offence under section 2, that is, the offence of damage to the data which carries very heavy maximum penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the alterations to the data have caused any loss to the owner of the data, the court is authorised under section 9 to <Col N="1737" /> make a compensation order against the convicted person. Section 5 is designed to deal with simple hacking or attempts at hacking where no damage is involved to the data concerned. The compensation aspect arises only where damage has been caused, and that is covered by sections 2 and 9. I cannot go along with the Senator on this amendment. I understand the point he is making but it is covered by both sections 2 and 9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear about sections 2, 9 and 5 in that context. What we have are two different sets of sanctions. The sanction in section 5 refers to computer hacking and the range of sanctions in section 9 refer to criminal damage and section 2 refers to damaging property. On Second Stage I praised the flexibility of the sanctions in section 9. Section 5 deals with computer hacking, and unauthorised access to data is only one type of offence and covered in section 5. I do not see why we cannot have the same flexibility in relation to sanctions for computer hacking as we have for criminal damage expressed in section 2, and which is covered in section 9 in terms of sanctions. I ask the Minister to extend the sanctions for this offence to the range of sanctions in section 9. I do not think there is anything unreasonable about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accessing data or attempting to access data can be a very serious matter. We should specify the offence in terms of indictment as well as in terms of summary offence but when we are talking about infringement and summary conviction, we must address the offence under section 5 which deals with the unauthorised accessing of data. Despite what the Minister has said, there is no reason we cannot extend the range of sanctions to offences covered by section 2. The legislation could direct how a judge may act rather than telling him the sanction is either a fine or imprisonment. Let us tell a judge that there is a range of sanctions which are probably less costly, more effective, and more beneficial to the victim. Why not tell the judge that? The only way to tell that to a judge is by <Col N="1738" /> putting it in legislation. Why be afraid to write into legislation that we want reform by way of alternative sentencing for somebody who is convicted of a summary offence &mdash; and it is a summary offence if it merits either a fine of £500 or three months' imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice bring most legislation before this House. Let us break the cycle where the two sanctions are specified. In section 9 we have provided for compensation, payment by instalments and an appeals system. Let us do the same in section 5. I cannot see any good reason not to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Where damage is done, under section 9, the person causing the damage is liable to a maximum fine or imprisonment or both. Every court is empowered under section 9 to make an order for compensation for damage to property. Data is property and computers are property. There is no point trying to make distinctions that are not there. Section 9 states:</P>
      <P>(1) On conviction of any person of an offence under section 2 of damaging property belonging to another, the court, instead of or in addition to dealing with him in any other way, may, on application or otherwise, make an order (in this Act referred to as a &ldquo;compensation order&rdquo;) requiring him to pay compensation in respect of that damage to any person (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;injured party&rdquo;) who, by reason thereof, has suffered loss (other than consequential loss).</P>
      <P>Section 2 states:</P>
      <P>a person who without lawful excuse damages any property belonging to another intending to damage any such property or being reckless as to whether any such property would be damaged shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that sections 9 and 2 cover the Senator's problem. I oppose the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>If sections 9 and 2 cover it, why do we have an offence at all under <Col N="1739" /> section 5? Section 9 specifically refers to section 2 as the Minister indicated, on conviction of any person of an offence under section 2 of damaging property belonging to another, etc. We have a range of sanctions in relation to section 2. Section 5 has a separate sanction for a separate offence. All I am asking is that in relation to this separate offence we include another sanction. There is no contradiction between what is in section 9, what is in section 2 and what I am trying to do by amending section 5.</P>
      <P>I cannot see why the Minister cannot take on board a perfectly good amendment which is in line with what he has done in section 9. I praised the Minister the other day for expanding the range of alternative sentencing. Why not continue that? Let us do it across the board in relation to the two offences. I do not think anything the Minister has said would suggest that my amendment, supported by Senator Neville, would be less useful or inadequate. The amendment has its own merits. The Minister has not indicated anything that takes away from the amendment. In other words, it is not an inappropriate amendment. It is a most appropriate one and is in keeping with the other sanctions in the Bill. It would be a beneficial development for us to indicate to every judge in the country that we expected them to avail of the broadest possible range of sanctions that are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister look at this on Report Stage? The sanction in section 5 is against the spirit of the Bill. It is a reforming Bill in the area of sentencing, as indicated in section 9. It looks as if there has been a lapse into the old way of looking at sanctions. Would the Minister look at an alternative to a prison sentence in circumstances where the offence is a minor one. Someone sentenced to three months in prison is unlikely to spend a week in jail because of the present difficulties which are likely to continue for some time. That is one side of it. The other side is the cost to the State. Surely sanctions other than <Col N="1740" /> imprisonment must now be considered in the light of modern penal studies which would suggest that there are other ways of penalising people that are much more productive than sending them to prison for three months for a minor offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated earlier, we are not tying the hands of the courts or the person damaged to claim damages or compensation. In fact, the court is authorised under section 9 to make compensation against any person convicted of damaging another person's property. There is no other explanation for it. If compensation is applied for, the judge is authorised under section 9 to award compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying that damage to property by accessing unauthorised data does not arise under section 5 &mdash; no damage will take place. Is that what the Minister is saying because section 9 refers specifically to section 2, not to section 5, and section 9 does not cover section 5 in that context?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The objective of this amendment is contained in sections 2 and 9, not taken individually but taken together. It strengthens the Criminal Damage Bill and it would be wrong for us to take a line here and another line there where it suits us. Both sections have adequate strengths for any judge, court or lawyer to impose summary fines and/or imprisonment or both and also to grant compensation if damage is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>If the objective is achieved in sections 2 and 9, why have we an offence and a sanction in section 5? If section 9 only refers to section 2 which relates to damage to property and section 5 has the stated offence of unauthorised access to data with a stated sanction, then section 9 does not cover section 5 or it is not seen by the parliamentary draftsman to cover section 5. Without going over the same ground again, the Minister knows the point that Senator Neville and I are making and <Col N="1741" /> the desirability of introducing alternative sanctions that is at the heart of it.</P>
      <P>If the wording were varied a little and instead of eliminating or deleting the term of imprisonment, which obviously I would prefer, we added on a third sanction and said a fine not exceeding £500, a term of imprisonment not exceeding three months or compensation to the owner of the data, then we would be retaining, if the Minister wishes, imprisonment as a sanction. To bring it in as a third option in the same terms as it is stated in section 9, would not go against the substance of the Bill. As he has kindly agreed to do in relation to amendment No. 4a, the Minister might reconsider this for Report Stage. If he can at that stage categorically state that there is good and sound reason that option should not be left in, then we will accept it. I would like him to look at it again in the context of section 9.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is no damage then there is no compensation. On the doubts raised about section 5, if the hacker goes further than reading the data, if he alters the data or interferes with it in any way, he is damaging the data and commits an offence under section 2, thus giving rise to the probability of compensation being sought or granted because a person's property was damaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that section 5 covers a situation where no damage is done. While the amendment would be in difficulties because of that the spirit of the amendment should be looked at. There are alternatives to imprisonment other than compensation which the Minister could look at. I am talking about community activities, etc. There is a range of sanctions which the Minister could look at other than sending people to prison for three months where they serve three days and cost the State over £3,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 deals specifically with accessing data. That is a crime in itself. The objective of this section is to deter hacking. Damage arises if the <Col N="1742" /> hacker alters or interferes with the data or the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 refers to damage to property, physical damage. Damage can be assessed and evaluated financially without it necessarily being physical damage. It is still possible to think in terms of compensation to the owner or the victim against whom the unauthorised infringement took place. It does not stand to reason that, because there was no damage within the terms of section 2, there was no damage caused which can be redressed through compensation. That is possible in virtually all circumstances. If damage is assessed in terms of a fine of £500, this is a financial assessment of damage and in a sense that is compensation to the State which may go into the Exchequer in various forms. Since the same principle is involved why can we not turn that around and say that compensation will be used as a sanction for the unauthorised accessing of data? There is no doubt that could be financially evaluated. That would be a more reasonable sanction than thinking in terms of imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to call a fine of £500 compensation to the State. That borders on the ridiculous. A fine is a fine and compensation is compensation. There is a fine for the crime of unauthorised accessing of data in section 5, sections 2 and 9 deal with damage to data and compensation for damage caused. There are two separate transgressions here and it is incorrect to say that a fine of any amount of money &mdash; £10, £500 or £1,000 &mdash; is compensation. That is not correct. I do not think that we should deal with it along those lines. I am still opposed to the amendment because it is not relevant.</P>

    <P>In page 6, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following new subsection: <Col N="1743" />&ldquo;(2) Subsection (1), (in so far as it relates to accessing data not owned by the State), applies only to access which is capable of causing economic loss to the owner; and accordingly a person who accesses data contrary to this section shall be liable for any such economic loss.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Data owned by the State presumably is covered by the Official Secrets Act. This Bill makes it an offence to unlawfully obtain or seek to obtain official secrets or data owned by the State. Where it applies to economic loss, how are we to determine that? Is it the Minister's intention to protect business, financial and entrepreneurial interests? If that is the case, we should limit its application to this area and say we have a major problem with fraud that is being perpetrated by the operation of computers. We must distinguish between what creates economic loss and what is merely of non-economic intent.</P>

    <Title>Industrial Development (Amendment) Bill, 1991: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has three functions. The first is to amalgamate the National Development Corporation with the Industrial Development Authority, and to transfer all NADCORP's assets, liabilities and commitments to the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, the Bill makes provision for a number of amendments to the Industrial Development Authority Act, 1986. These will allow the Industrial Development Authority to hold or dispose of stocks, shares and securities transferred from the National Development Corporation. The proposed amendments will also increase the financial limits relating <Col N="1744" /> to the aggregate amount of grants which may be made to the Industrial Development Authority by the Exchequer, as well as extend the applicability of employment grants to all industry. Additionally, the Industrial Development Authority is being given greater power in relation to the holding of preference shares, and the power to hold shares in its own name. Finally, the Bill will increase the aggregate financial limits applicable to Shannon Free Airport Development Company which are contained in the Shannon Free Airport Development Company (Amendment) Act, 1986.</P>
    <P>It is the provisions in sections 9 and 10 of the Bill, increasing the aggregate grant limits applicable to the Industrial Development Authority and Shannon Free Airport Development Company, which make it a matter of urgency that the Bill be enacted before the Christmas recess. I would like to stress that these provisions will not increase the amount of Exchequer funds which are actually allocated each year to the agencies as part of the budgetary process. The provisions are intended simply to increase the cumulative amount of Exchequer funds which may be allocated to the agencies over a period of years. The cumulative figures were originally set by enactments in 1986. Amending the now almost exhausted cumulative limits will simply allow the agencies to continue carrying out their respective mandates.</P>
    <P>To this end, I propose, with the agreement of the House, to amend the Industrial Development Act, 1986, by increasing the aggregate amount of grants that I can make to the Industrial Development Authority. This aggregate limit was set by section 14 of the 1986 Act at £700 million. The grants concerned are used by the Industrial Development Authority to meet its administrative expenses and to discharge its obligations or liabilities of a capital nature and are, of course, the basic resources used by the Authority to fulfil its statutory functions. By the end of 1991, the Industrial Development Authority will have used <Col N="1745" /> up £688 million of the limit, and it is expected that the £700 million limit will be exhausted in a few weeks' time. It is, therefore, critically necessary that the limit be raised now, so that the Authority can continue to carry out its statutory function without interruption. The proposal in section 9 of the Bill is to raise the aggregate limit to £1,200 million, which will enable the Industrial Development Authority to continue assisting industry, without recourse to the Oireachtas for legislation, for a further period of five years approximately.</P>
    <P>I also propose, subject to the agreement of the House, to increase the aggregate financial limits applicable to Shannon Development. The figures concerned were last increased in June 1986 and the cumulative limits were exhausted at the end of last month. Thus, it is equally urgent that the aggregate limits applicable to Shannon Free Airport Development Company should also be raised as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As far as Shannon Free Airport Development Company is concerned, section 10 of the Bill provides for an increase from £130 million to £150 million in the aggregate amount the Minister for Finance may subscribe in taking up shares in the company; and an increase from £105 million £150 million in the aggregate amount of grant-in-aid, voted annually, which may be made to the company.</P>
    <P>Share capital subscribed to the company is used for capital expenditure on the industrial estate at Shannon and in the mid-west region. The main elements of expenditure are land acquisition, construction of factories and ancillary works. The grant-in-aid moneys are applied towards meeting the company's running expenses and providing financial assistance to companies on the Shannon Industrial Estate.</P>
    <P>The report of the Industrial Policy Review Group which I established last June is due to be completed very shortly. I intend to take all appropriate action open to me once the report becomes available. I would like to stress that this Bill should not be confused with any <Col N="1746" /> measures which the review group may recommend, as I propose to deal with these swiftly at a later stage. The reason for proceeding with this Bill at this time stems from the fact that the statutory limits on the grant giving powers of both the IDA and SFADCo are just about exhausted, and new legislation is required to extend them. Furthermore, by amalgamating the National Development Corporation with the IDA, I am continuing the process of rationalisation and refinement of the State's industrial promotion activities.</P>
    <P>The review of industrial performance published in December of last year drew attention to the large number of promotional measures undertaken by different State agencies, the increasing use of equity by the IDA in assisting companies, and the move to a situation where up to 50 per cent of financial supports to medium-large indigenous industry would be in the form of equity or other remunerating forms of aid. The review also pointed to the improved flow of equity into Irish industry from other sources, for example, through private venture capitalists, the smaller companies market and the Stock Exchange generally.</P>
    <P>Such developments have lessened the justification for a separate State agency mandated to promote equity investment. It has become difficult to distinguish NADCORP's developmental role from that of the IDA. Furthermore, with the IDA increasingly taking equity in projects it supports, as well as imposing stricter conditions relating to job performance and repayability of grants, any distinction between the two agencies on the grounds of commerciality is somewhat nebulous. By 1993, the IDA share-holdings are likely to be considerably greater than anything to which NADCORP could aspire. The review concluded that in order to provide a more cohesive and integrated approach to State equity investment in enterprise, the activities of the corporation and the Authority should be more closely integrated.</P>
    <P>The legislation now before the House <Col N="1747" /> is the latest in a series of significant developments which have taken place since 1987 in the restructuring of the State agencies involved in industrial development and promotion. Other such restructuring included the establishment of FÁS to take over the functions previously undertaken by AnCO, the Youth Employment Agency and the National Manpower Service, the merger of the National Board for Science and Technology and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to form EOLAS, a single agency with responsibility for the development, application, co-ordination and promotion of science and technology in Irish industry, and the merger of Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council to ensure that the State provides marketing support to Irish companies from a single source. The integration of the activities of the National Development Corporation with those of the IDA is a logical step in this process of restructuring of our industrial development mechanisms.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation, established under the National Development Corporation Act, 1986, was set up at a time when there was a shortage of investment funds in the Irish economy. It was felt that there was a need for a State role in equity investment in order to move away from a traditional reliance on bank borrowings as a means of financing start-ups and expansions.</P>
    <P>NADCORP's primary function, as set down in section 10 of the 1986 Act, was to establish, invest in or manage any enterprise which the corporation considered to be profitable or capable of becoming so. It was also required to establish an investment fund, known as the &ldquo;Revolving Investment Fund for Employment&rdquo; into which was paid any money realised on investments, dividends and any profits earned by the corporation. The fund was intended to be used to fulfil any investment objects of the corporation.</P>
    <P>The performance of NADCORP, however, has fallen below expectations, with the corporation rarely drawing down <Col N="1748" /> its budget allocation. To date, NADCORP has invested approximately £26 million and it currently holds shares in 57 companies which employ around 2,000 people. It is generally accepted that State support is necessary to encourage new developments and to help offset the various diseconomies facing Irish industry. However, State support can take a number of different forms, such as equity, grant payments, preference shares and remunerating forms of participation.</P>
    <P>In January 1990, I emphasised NADCORP's developmental role, with the corporation participating as an integral part of the Government's overall industrial development strategy. While the private venture capital market was relatively under-developed when NADCORP was established, there had, in the intervening years, been a significant growth in venture capital support mechanisms. I pointed out, therefore, that it was necessary to reassess NADCORP's role with a view to increasing the focus on developmental and strategic projects.</P>
    <P>I expressed the view that there was a need for a switch in emphasis with NADCORP becoming more developmental while retaining a long term commercial objective. There was, and still is, a pressing need for the development of certain indigenous sectors of strategic national importance, such as electronics and software. I indicated that an important objective for me as Minister for Industry and Commerce would be to integrate NADCORP's operations more fully into the central focus of industrial policy.</P>
    <P>As of 30 September of this year, the IDA held both ordinary and preference shares in some 113 companies amounting to a total value of £21 million. This amount is likely to increase significantly in the next few years as the IDA, in order to ensure a better return for the State's investment in the development of industry is increasingly using this form of support to indigenous industry.</P>
    <P>In the light of these considerations, I believe there is no case for the continuation of NADCORP as a separate <Col N="1749" /> entity, and one of the purposes of this Bill is to merge its activities with those of the IDA. This will provide a more coherent and integrated approach to State equity investment. Allied to this are the proposals contained in the Bill to allow the IDA to hold or dispose of stocks, shares and securities transferred from the National Development Corporation. The IDA will be permitted to hold more than 50 per cent by way of preference shares, and will also be given the power to hold shares in its own name. Such shares were previously held in the name of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In merging the activities of the two agencies, I do not propose to extend the IDA's existing remit, which enables it to invest in industrial and international service activities. While NADCORP's mandate was somewhat broader, allowing it to invest also in most commercial undertakings, its investments were mainly concentrated in manufacturing companies. Nevertheless, section 7 in the Bill will allow the IDA to invest by way of the purchase or taking of shares in enterprises where NADCORP currently has holdings to which the IDA's remit does not extend. It is intended that all NADCORP's property, rights and liabilities will transfer in the first instance to the IDA. Subsequently, in so far as SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta are charged with responsibility for development in regions where certain NADCORP holdings are situated such holdings will be transferred to SFADCo or Údarás na Gaeltachta as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the preparation of the final accounts of NADCORP and their presentation to the Houses of the Oireachtas. As is usual in legislation of this sort, there is a provision in the Bill to exempt the IDA from the payment of stamp duty in respect of the properties and rights transferred to it under this Bill. There are also provisions to ensure the continuity of any contracts and agreements entered into by NADCORP and to ensure that any legal proceedings to which the NADCORP is a party, will not be brought to a halt on account of the transfer of NADCORP's <Col N="1750" /> assets and liabilities to the IDA. The rights and liabilities transferred by the Bill may be sued on and recovered by and from the IDA.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the Bill proposes to make a number of amendments to the Industrial Development Act, 1986, and I have already referred to the urgent need to raise the aggregate grant giving limits permitted by law. In addition to these and amendments stemming directly from the amalgamation of NADCORP with the IDA, I also intend, for example, to extend eligibility for employment grants from the current restriction to small industry, to all industry. Small industry is defined for this purpose as companies employing fewer than 50 people and with fixed assets of less than £800,000.</P>
    <P>The IDA has found that employment grants, which are more targeted on employment <i>per se</i> and less on the acquisition of fixed assets, can provide a useful additional flexibility in its industrial promotion activities. This is also in accordance with the commitment made in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to widen the use of such grants.</P>
    <P>The Bill also amends the provisions of the Industrial Development Act, 1986, which requires that shares purchased or taken by the Industrial Development Authority shall be registered in the name of the Minister for Finance. This requirement does not exist in relation to the existing NADCORP portfolio. I believe that the provision in the Industrial Development Act, 1986, acts as a disincentive to the increased use of investment by the Industrial Development Authority in its industrial promotion activities. Consequently, the Bill provides for the transfer to the Industrial Development Authority of shares which have been purchased by the Industrial Development Authority but are currently held in the name of the Minister for Finance. The Industrial Development Authority will also be given the power to retain all amounts representing the dividends from these shares.</P>
    <P>I emphasise to the House that industrial policy must be seen in its broadest <Col N="1751" /> sense as including all of the factors through which public policy can influence industrial development. It is not just a question of Government and State agencies providing industrial incentives, but must of necessity include the active participation of all participants in the economy, employers, employees and consumers.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in the preface to the review of industrial performance last December, I will continue to make further changes in our industrial policy as are required. The full range of promotional and advisory activities must be subjected to a continuing system of objective evaluation which relates expenditure undertaken to defined objectives and measures of performance. I will be keeping under consideration the possibility of further refinement of our policies with particular emphasis on the need to develop a strong indigenous industrial sector.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset that I established the Industrial Policy Review Group last June to examine all aspects of public policy which inpinge on industrial development, including the taxation system, PRSI, manpower, education, training and industrial supports. The group has been concentrating on the development of Irish owned companies and examining how policy could be adjusted to boost the development of indigenous industry in the medium and long term. I expect to receive its report shortly and I will act on it with all necessary speed.</P>
    <P>The actions which I am now proposing do not in any way detract from whatever actions may be necessary as a result of the group's report. They are very relevant and will ensure further progress in refining our range of industrial incentives. They will also ensure that we can maintain a flexible response allied to securing the best possible value for the expenditure of scarce State resources.</P>
    <P>Finally, I reiterate the particular difficulties which make it necessary to have the Bill enacted as soon as possible &mdash; the exhaustion of the aggregate grant limits <Col N="1752" /> applicable to both the Industrial Development Authority and Shannon Development Company.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was first published on 5 December, 1991, less than two weeks ago. It was debated and approved under the pressure of time in the Dáil within a matter of days and this evening the Seanad is asked to take all Stages of the Bill in three hours. The reason advanced by the Minister is that two State industrial development agencies are about to run out of funds for grant aid, and for other purposes. The Industrial Development Authority are almost at their present limit and that limit will be exceeded in a few weeks' time.</P>
      <P>Shannon Development Company have already exceeded their limit and therefore are undoubtedly already restricted in their activities to some degree. It would be a very serious matter if the Industrial Development Authority and the Shannon Development Company were to find themselves so restricted and this House would be willing to accommodate such a situation. This House would also be justified in asking why the Minister, the Government or the State bodies concerned had to wait until virtually the 11th hour before coming forward to rectify the problem that had arisen in relation to the financial limits.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Development Authority and Shannon Development Company are major State bodies and it must have been apparent to each, as it must have been to the Department of Industry and Commerce and to Government, that these financial limits had been reached or were about to be reached. I find it difficult to accept that legislation should be introduced in the last sitting days of the year to put this matter right. This is not a commendable way for high powered semi-State bodies to carry on and it should not be allowed to pass without comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there would always be a willingness to rectify this situation but this Bill proposes to do more than that. The Minister pointed out that the House is <Col N="1753" /> being asked to vote through, on the back as it were of the capital requirements of these two State agencies, a proposal to abolish a worthwhile national body, the National Development Corporation. It would be preferable in order to deal with the contents of the Bill now before us to introduce two separate Bills, one to deal with the immediate problem of funding and another to be taken over a reasonable period of time during which every opportunity would be provided to discuss the merits or the demerits of the proposed abolition of the National Development Corporation. As far as I am concerned, to present both in one measure is an attempt to compromise the House in its examination of the merits of what are basically two or even three separate objectives.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that the Bill has three objectives. The first is the abolition of the National Development Corporation and the second and third are to increase the financial limits of the IDA and of the Shannon Development Company. Frankly, I regret the proposal to abolish the National Development Corporation and despite what the Minister said in his speech I still doubt the justification for that move. In the short period of its existence the National Development Corporation has filled a valuable role in industrial development and job creation particularly in small and medium size industry. Its role as originally intended has been discharged fairly well; that role was the provision of venture capital to industries in the categories I mentioned.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation was set up in 1986 to help to reduce Ireland's immense problem of unemployment by investing venture capital in job creation projects. It is the only State-sponsored venture capital body and it is empowered to invest in the following type of job creation projects: manufacturing projects, tourism projects, agriculture, fisheries and food projects, long term contracts between food producers and food processors designed to improve the consistency and quality of supply, marketing companies helping <Col N="1754" /> particular sectors and projects derived from work done in researching universities and research institutions financed by the State. In all of these areas of economic activity jobs can be created and the State is already spending substantial sums of money there in the form of grants and tax breaks without any direct return to the taxpayer. In contrast the National Development Corporation has been empowered to invest in these areas on an equity basis where the taxpayer could receive return in the form of a dividend or a capital gain. The return would then be used for job creation.</P>
    <P>At a time when 265,000 people are out of work it is wrong for the Government to abolish a body such as the National Development Corporation. The work of that body is all the more necessary at a time when banks are restricting drastically the credit available to expanding businesses and when private venture capital is scarce. To abolish the National Development Corporation at this time is very foolish.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation's role is different from that of the private venture capital bodies. Private venture capital bodies require a rate of return which will satisfy their private clients. The National Development Corporation in contrast can take a long term point of view and can look to longer-term job creation at a time of high unemployment. I believe such a body is still most necessary.</P>
    <P>In the mid-eighties when the National Development Corporation was set up, venture capital was a relatively new form of finance. That body filled a void especially when one contrasts the attitude of the banks then as compared with the present in regard to high risk finance. Many firms are viable today because of the presence over the years of the National Development Corporation. The high risk nature of investment has contributed to the growth and maintenance of jobs and, as the Minister outlined, the investment has been something like £26 million in almost 60 projects involving 2,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Government <Col N="1755" /> towards the work of the National Development Corporation changed dramatically in 1987 following the change of Government and the position of the corporation from then on was gradually eroded. It was not wanted by the Government. I believe that had the attitude of the Government of the time been different, it is possible the continued success of NADCORP would have contributed to job creation in a most effective way.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that the State will have a certain role in the provision of venture capital in future, but is the Industrial Development Authority really the right vehicle to make such decisions? The Industrial Development Authority first get a project into the country, then they assess the level of grants they will play to that body. They are further expected to decide, under this legislation, on the level of venture capital they will invest and the size of equity they may take in the firm in question. To me that is stretching objectivity to the limit. It would be much better form a body which is independent of the Industrial Development Authority, such as NADCORP to make such decisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated he has set up an Industrial Policy Review Group which he expects to report to him shortly. He has confirmed, this evening the review group will look at all State agencies involved in industrial promotion. I suggest that before abolishing NADCORP he would have been much wiser to wait until the report of that review group was available.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his speech, has mentioned a number of amalgamations or cases of streamlining of bodies associated with his Department. Not so long ago Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council were amalgamated into a new body called An Bord Tráchtála. Now the Minister is proposing that the Industrial Development Authority should swallow up NADCORP. I believe that while common ground existed to make worthwhile the amalgamation between Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council <Col N="1756" /> the situation in regard to the Industrial Development Authority and NADCORP is quite different.</P>
    <P>Of course the role of the Industrial Development Authority is crucial in promoting industry in this country as is their role in relation to foreign investment. I expect that the Industrial Policy Review Group will have some interesting views to express on the performance of the Industrial Development Authority and how successful or otherwise they have been in the discharge of their functions over the years. It is often difficult to find a method by which the success or otherwise of a body such as the IDA can be measured. Nonetheless, such an examination is crucial, as we are expected to approve this increase of £500 million.</P>
    <P>It would have been helpful to the House had the report of the review group been available to us now. It would also have been very helpful if the Minister in his speech this evening, had expanded on his own analysis of the progress or otherwise of the IDA as he sees it. On the basis of information available to us we would find it very difficult to refuse to agree to extending by £500 million the financial limits of the IDA but I would be much happier if we had had the report of the Industrial Policy Review Group before us or if the Minister had been more forthcoming in his own views and analysis of the performance of this body.</P>
    <P>The other industrial promotion body involved in this legislation is the Shannon Development Company, which is affected by section 10. The effect of what is proposed here is, again, to increase the financial limits, in this case by a sum in the region of £65 million. The Shannon Development Company is a unique organisation whose objectives as prescribed in law are: &ldquo;To secure sustainable economic growth through the integrated application of industrial and tourism development and by exploiting the comparative advantages withing the Region and to secure the growth of Shannon Airport in trade, passengers and services&rdquo;. It is what could be described as a regional development authority, perhaps the only one in the country; I do not <Col N="1757" /> know how I would describe Údarás. It is a prototype, a model of what people claim should be the type of organisation that should be brought into existence if regional development authorities were to be created for other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The western bishops, for example, a few weeks ago held a two-day conference in Galway. They are concerned at the population decline, the lack of jobs and so on throughout the province of Connaught and the west in general. It was very obvious from the tone of the conference that they believed that a regional development authority would have a valuable function to discharge in the west of Ireland. If the Shannon Development Authority is a regional development authority, as I believe it is, and if the Government created it, support it and would use it as a basis on which to develop the concept, then there is a very clear obligation on the Government to protect and to encourage such an organization.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of the Shannon Development Company should now be assessed and the Industrial Policy Review Group are undoubtedly doing that. Its work, its capacity to meet its target and to have a positive influence in its area of activities should be examined. I think it is reasonable to ask if the mid-West has fared better because of the presence of Shannon Development. It is also relevant to ask if its role or its functions as a regional development authority is in competition with national bodies for the same customers and the same resources.</P>
    <P>Shannon Development has been criticised by public representatives, and in a sense I deplore their readiness to criticise so often. I believe that such criticism is unfair because basically, the Shannon Development Company is a progressive organisation that has shown enterprise and initiative in quite a number of areas. Where enterprise and initiative are involved there is always an inherent element of risk taking and it is impossible to guarantee 100 per cent success on every occasion. If public representatives focus on the unsuccessful aspect and, at <Col N="1758" /> the same time, ignore the real achievements of such an organisation, then the effect of that criticism is to damage the morale and confidence of the staff and board of the company. There should be a balance in criticism. Not all the criticism I have heard is justified. SFADCo is a worthwhile organisation which brought benefit to the mid-western region in both industrial promotion and tourism. They did so very effectively in their earlier years &mdash; but perhaps not so well in more recent times.</P>
    <P>This Government and perhaps previous Governments, have failed to protect that regional development authority from the cuckoo in the nest attitude displayed by other State agencies. I ask the Minister when replying to comment on the relationship between the IDA and the company in attracting industry to Ireland. Is the relationship one of cooperation or conflict and competition? If the relationship is not one of co-operation, then it is a contest between David and Goliath, a national body with vast resources competing with a smaller regional body. To what extent does Ireland and, in particular, the mid-west lose out in such a situation? Are the Industrial Policy Review Group examining this question? Tonight, presumably we will be voting to increase the resources of one organisation by £500 million and another by £65 million and I do not want to see the positive results that could flow from that being negatived by petty bickering.</P>
    <P>I want to address another question to the Minister in relation to a suggestion that has surfaced, which may or may not be accurate. Is it true that the Minister, on an overseas promotion trip within the past few years, was astonished to find a map of this country, supposedly circulated by industrial promotion agencies on behalf of Ireland, in which the mid-west and the Six Counties were blotted out? That is a reasonable question to ask, and the Minister may or may not wish to respond to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about this possible conflict between certain State agencies and the regional authority in the Shannon area.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a passing reference to tourism. One of the statutory obligations placed on SFADCo is to secure the growth in trade, passengers and tourism of Shannon Airport. One of the projects of the Shannon Development Company which we may be funding tonight, is the concept of a hub in the Shannon region. Unfortunately almost every North American airline that has been approached by Shannon Development Company was advised by two other State agencies &mdash; Bord Fáilte and Are Lingus &mdash; to forget about it because the Shannon stop-over is going to end.</P>
      <P>I deplore the attitude of the chief executive of State agencies who, in recent months, have come out publicly and contradicted and disputed Government policy on strategic matters in the mid-west. I want to ask the Minister, as the representative of the Government here this evening, if the Government have any authority or self-respect left, when they permit these individuals to challenge and criticise their policies in relation to very sensitive issues in that area. These are fundamental matters which I felt should be referred to.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Leas-Chathaoirleach to permit me to present Senator Wright with a copy of the Aer Lingus winter time table, in case he might ever wish to fly to Moscow and should seek information from Aer Lingus as to how he would get there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Having voted &mdash; and we very likely will &mdash; to increase the financial limits of SFADCo by £65 million, we have a duty <Col N="1760" /> to ensure that the value of what we do is not negatived by this sort of conflict of interest within State agencies.</P>
    <P>I want to make one final point. There is a Mercedes car parked outside this House with an engine that runs on vegetable oil. It has been around for 18 months. From what I have heard I believe it has outstanding development potential for the creation of jobs and benefit to the economy. I have been told there is a market across northern Europe for those engine units &mdash; for example, for pleasure boats &mdash; of something like £300,000 per annum. It is friendly to the environment and has many other advantages. The enthusiasm of the promoting agencies in this country towards this have been remarkably lukewarm compared to other jurisdictions. There is a lack of interest and of hunger for exploring its possibilities. When it is in production elsewhere, we may then ask if the person who brought it to the attention of the industrial promotion agencies in this country had been a slick German, a Japanese, a Jew or a Yank instead of an Irishman, this engine would be in production in Ireland now. I do not think the promoting agencies would have let it slip so easily through their hands.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will deal with all the points I have raised. In conclusion, I reject the proposal to abolish the National Development Corporation and support the funding for the IDA and SFADCo. I look forward with interest to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation and I also welcome the Deputy Minister, O'Malley, to the House. I do not understand why on the Order of Business the Opposition voted that we would not pass this legislation this evening. Senator Howard knows that the money is needed in our constituency and I do not know why he could not be gracious and let it through. He wants two Bills instead of one. This one Bill, is sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand its objectives are threefold and it makes provision for a number of amendments to the Industrial Development Act, 1986. It will allow the <Col N="1761" /> IDA to hold and dispose of stocks. The IDA have been given greater power in relation to the holding of preference shares and the power to hold shares in their own right. The Bill also looks after SFADCo.</P>
    <P>It is because of the second and third of these objectives that the Minister has asked us to pass this legislation before the Christmas recess. I was quite surprised that my colleagues on the other side of the House could not see the sense of letting this Bill through this evening. The difficulty is that the IDA by the end of 1991 will have utilised an amount of money almost up to their limit and, therefore, further moneys must be provided as the present £700 million it will be exhausted within the next few weeks, and certainly before the Dáil resumes. An extraordinary amount of money has to be put in place for the IDA. If the integration of the activities of NADCORP and the IDA is a logical step in the restructuring of our industrial development, I welcome it. Since I came into this House in 1977 I have opposed duplication of services. I have seen confusion where two authorities are supposed to be doing the same thing.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute the work of the IDA, but, if we have to give them £500 million I would beg the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, to watch what they do. I do not have much to do with the IDA as SFADCo is the regional body in my area but I worry at times because of their treatment of other industries in the past.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard said the IDA were the authority who looked after smaller industries. I could never understand successive Governments humouring, entertaining and trying to encourage large foreign companies and giving them colossal grant aid while good Irish-owned companies got into financial trouble. We would have more unemployment if we did not have grant aid from Government.</P>
    <P>A company I know of in the past two years needed certain protection and when the banks tried to use the big stick against them they could not fold up their tents and move, they stayed and they survived. This has happened all over the <Col N="1762" /> nation. Senator Howard is correct; companies have gone to the wall because of being dealt with too roughly, at too early a stage, by the banks and also the IDA did not seem to be there at the time to help. I note also in this Bill that the industrial services were only available to small units of industry.</P>
    <P>There are three aspects to this Bill. It amalgamates NADCORP with the IDA; it makes a number of amendments to the Industrial Development Act, 1986 and it raises the grant-giving limit permissible from the IDA and SFADCo. May I say I welcome the employment grants currently available to small industries.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong of me not to refer to the grant aid to SFADCo. It would be foolish of Senators or others to think Shannon and SFADCo concern only three constituencies in the west of Ireland. That is not the situation where Shannon Development, Clare, Limerick and Tipperary are concerned. If a Government have a policy of decentralisation, putting offices here, there and everywhere, having big official openings, they must not at the same time allow pressure groups to take from the west coast of Ireland. Shannon concerns not just three constituences but is a matter of concern to places from Donegal to Waterford and the midlands as well.</P>
    <P>The limit for funds to SFADCo is rising from a total of £105 million to £150 million to be devoted to day to day administration costs of the company plus grants paid to Shannon industries. The share capital of the company is being increased from a total of £130 million to £150 million for factory construction programmes. This will allow not just Shannon but the whole western region to continue to do for itself what it has shown itself to be capable of doing in the past; it will create the economic base which will sustain activities, individual jobs and the whole social community in the western area. It would be good for some of my Dublin colleagues to remember that we are not just talking about one constituency.</P>
    <P>I understand that Shannon has been setting out to have an aviation centre to rank alongside other internationally <Col N="1763" /> accepted centres such as Singapore. Shannon already has a background in aviation and it employs 2,000 people in aviation-related business. However, perhaps more significantly, it is a major owner of aircraft spearheaded by GPA but including a number of other companies based at Shannon. This small area now has the third highest ownership of aircraft in the world after the US and USSR. Because of its current position in terms of aviation, Shannon has been chosen as an obvious primary location for the ongoing development of the sector and Shannon Development have been given the responsibility to make Shannon a true world aviation centre. This is all relevant to section 10 which provides for the allocation of money. Aviation is now being developed as the electronics were 20 years ago. To date Shannon Aerospace has been the most significant project in terms o size. They are due to become operational in October 1992 and the company already have in excess of 300 employees with another 400 engaged in construction work. It is predicted the full employment potential of this project will not be reached until 1996 when employment reaches 1,100. I could go on and on about Shannon Development &mdash; I suppose I have a right to do so, as I am probably be the oldest serving member from the area.</P>
    <P>When I talk about Shannon Airport I am not taking into consideration just one or three constitutencies but the entire coast from Donegal to Waterford, including the midlands. When there was a strong challenge to Shannon Airport about 18 or 20 years ago we had the top brass in State bodies making similar statements but no chief executives would have challenged the policy of the Minister or the Government. The chief executives today should realise they are being paid substantial salaries from taxpayers' money and, therefore, should not challenge Government policy which is good for this nation. As I said, it is not just the areas of Shannon, Limerick and Clare we are talking about but the entire west <Col N="1764" /> coast, including the midlands. If we overfly Shannon and fly direct to Dublin &mdash; which is already overcrowded &mdash; Dublin Airport will not be able to deal with the extra traffic. It is unlikely that other Senators will make a similar statement because they will be thinking about votes. However, whether in Government or not I have no trouble making this statement because if decentralisation is part of Government policy no chief executive or group of pilots in a company should challenge that policy. When the Government decides to change that policy so be it.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the marina at Kilrush. My late husband, Derry, who had the honour of serving in this House before me, had strong views on the development of the lower Shannon region from Kerry to Carrickaholt. For that reason and, also, because it borders the Minister's constituency, I ask him to consider the development of the marina at Kilrush. I have charts and files on the plan for the development of the lower Shannon region; there is enormous potential there and nobody knows that better than the Minister.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Minister extending the IDA's financial limit, I ask that he provide a watchdog because I do not have the same confidence as others in the IDA. If I am wrong I will have no trouble admitting that, particularly if somebody can tell me they are doing everything right and that all the money is being spent in an appropriate manner. As a former Cathaoirleach I visited the United States officially. While there on a trip I wanted to do something for my country. However, on the IDA industrial maps I looked at the mid-west region was blacked out because the IDA were not responsible for that area, and on the Bord Fáilte tourist map the mid-west was also blacked out because SFADCo had responsibility for that area, not Bord Fáilte. I ask the Minister to ensure that there is no conflict between these semi-State agencies.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Senator Howard's worries about the conflict between senior officials or executives in State-sponsored bodies <Col N="1765" /> such as SFADCo, Bord Fáilte and the IDA, but I am concerned when I hear that State agencies are not willing to cooperate but rather compete to such a degree that they do not want one agency to get ahead of the others. I have seen the results of this. There should be more give and take, because it is not good policy to see one part of the country blacked out on a map. The people in America do not know why there is a black spot on those maps. I do not know how Senator Howard is going to vote, but I expect he will vote that the money goes through for Shannon and not vote for something else. I ask him to reconsider this matter. We should all work together to pass this Bill this evening.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and hope the Minister, Deputy O'Malley noted my remarks and concerns. If people in State sponsored bodies or elsewhere have to be disciplined, so be it. They should be told what Government policy is because there seems to be some confusion about that at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always a pleasant and stimulating experience to listen to Senator Honan. I must confess I share many of Senator Honan's prejudices, whether that is good or bad, I am not so sure. I agree with her attitude about the way certain people conduct themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to one or two points made by Senator Honan, particularly in relation to the marina at Kilrush. I am based in Dublin. That is the area I hope to represent, the area I try to represent, but, of course, I come from an area about three or four miles outside Kilrush and I am disappointed and concerned at the failure to develop the marina there over the past year or so. This is disappointing in view of the high hopes for this area which has a considerably high level of unemployment. I join with Senator Honan in exhorting the <Col N="1766" /> Minister to look again at the problems which exist in relation to that venture and to find solutions to them. There is no doubt about the enormous potential of the Shannon area. Therefore, it is difficult to understand why a venture such as a marina in a place like Kilrush cannot succeed. I do not know the reasons for the failure to develop the marina but I would like the problems to be solved. To some extent, that is irrelevant to the business we are discussing here this evening.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the timing of this debate and the time restrictions which are in place. We have an enormous unemployment problem; the Estimates published this evening reckon an average unemployment figure of 275,000 people in the coming year. At the same time, over a period of three hours we are discussing a Bill which deals with fundamental aspects of industrial policy; just three hours to discuss a very important issue. We are also discussing it in the runup to Christmas, a time when a great deal of legislation will be pushed through the Seanad. This is not the proper way to address the problems of industrial policy or, indeed, the problems that arise from key decisions of a fundamental nature such as this decision to abolish NADCORP. It is a very foolish way to conduct our business and is indicative of the deficiencies in this Government's industrial policy.</P>
    <P>The Government do not have a coherent industrial policy. They make it up as they go along, stumbling from day to day. Therefore, I do not know why the Minister and the Government could not restrain themselves until the report and the review on industrial policy are published. That review and report are scheduled to be published at the end of January. Why did the Government not wait until then to introduce this legislation? The Government have an open mind on what will be proposed in this review of industrial policy. It is that type of contradictory behaviour which leads me to believe that they are stumbling along from industrial post to industrial pillar as far as policy is concerned. They <Col N="1767" /> have not got a coherent view on where they are going or on the objectives they would like to attain. They certainly do not seem to know how the objective of increasing employment will be realised.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us is short-sighted and foolish. The National Development Corporation should not be abolished. At the same time, I am not really surprised at this decision. The National Development Corporation have had a difficult existence. There was tremendous trauma before they came into existence and indeed, when they were established. It was a traumatic process and many political wounds remain. The setting up of the corporation was opposed tooth and claw by people, some of whom I would consider to be pillars of the new right, for resons that derived from the deepest ideological beliefs. This was regrettable because those people, from time to time, describe themselves as pragmatic. In effect, the National Development Corporation were starved to death. They were subjected to financial malnutrition and, finally, were finished off this year. The amount provided for the corporation in the Estimates this year was only 50 per cent of what was needed to keep them viable. The corporation never got going and, for that matter, were never given an opportunity. Notwithstanding their limited existence and the small amount of money made available to them, they provided a useful service and this is an indication of the potential which exists for an organisation such as the National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>It is now proposed to merge NADCORP with the Industrial Development Authority. I have grave reservations about that type of process and those reservations are derived mainly from my assessment of the lack of achievement by the Industrial Development Authority. I have grave reservations about the Authority and, like Deputy Molloy's attitude to the establishment of a windmill on islands off our coast, I have held that view for a long time. Our food industry is in a chaotic state. The IDA have failed abysmally to create an environment in <Col N="1768" /> which the food industry could develop. That industry has enormous potential but it is in a dreadful state. It is bedevilled by scandals, has failed totally to get branded products on the market, to develop new products and to reach criticial mass in respect of research and development. The key organisation in determining the shape of the food industry should have been the IDA but they have been all over the place in relation to that industry. At one time they talked about plant, now I gather it is going to be about marketing.</P>
    <P>It is to the credit of the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, that in 1981 he commissioned the Telesis report. It is a pity so little has been done about that report because it marked a new, far-reaching and, indeed, far-sighted view of Irish industry. It identified the fact that this country was concentrating to much on foreign manufacturing firms coming here to generate the type of employment we need. It also illustrated clearly the need for the development of strong indigenous Irish industry and that has not happened. We have failed to develop a strong indigenous industry and we have been failing to do that for the past ten years despite the recommendations of the Telesis report. That failure did not happen by chance. Following the publication of the Telesis report, the Industrial Development Authority opposed tooth and claw its contents. They did everything in their power to rubbish it. It is because of that carry on that the necessary developments, change of mind and shift in policy had been slowed down to the detriment of a strong indigenous industry. That is a great pity. History, of course, sorts out all these matters and we now have a widespread belief that a strong indigenous industry is essential. However in the early eighties, the IDA firmly resisted that report and did so for a long time. I am concerned about the merger of development corporations with the IDA because of the IDA's view at that time.</P>
    <P>Over the last few years there was much talk about developing the &ldquo;climate&rdquo;. We all know it is not easy to change a climate and changing the financial climate can be <Col N="1769" /> a difficult process as well. It is like trying to adjust the weather, it does not always work. The pillars of the new right believe that if we get the climate right there will be industries and jobs everywhere. However, the stark reality is that 275,000 people will be unemployed next year. So much for the climate and the capacity to change it. The Telesis report clearly indicated that the lines of policy we were taking were wrong, and yet for a long time we were unable to make those changes and accept the contents of that report.</P>
    <P>The ESRI predict that over the next five years employment in manufacturing industry will decline, and in this context we are talking about closing down the National Development Corporation and handing it over to the IDA, an organisation with this record of failure and total inability to create more jobs. Nowhere is that more true than in their failure to exploit the potential of the food industry. It is a miserable and appalling failure. It is a dreadful failure because the IDA were, in many ways, the central formulators, the key generators of industrial policy to the extent that an industrial policy existed in this country. They set the pace and had the resources and capacity to do so; they were a dominant force in the genesis of industrial policy. Over a ten year period they have got it wrong and that is particularly true in the shambles we now see in the food industry.</P>
    <P>I am happy that in the latter days of his reign, Deputy Reynolds, as Minister for Finance, was beginning to accept that some intervention was needed and to talk in terms of following the model set in the Swedish and Nordic countries. I welcome that. That is a very desirable change and a welcome move from the policy of generating the climate and then hoping everything else would work out.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the need for research and development, areas which have been neglected. Research and development are fundamental to industrial development, to generating new products and getting new products on the market. Unless we are prepared to make a far greater investment in research and <Col N="1770" /> development there will be difficulties in the long term. That is particularly true in the case of the food industry. Over the years we have failed for the most part to put in the kind of research and development investment needed. We have failed to generate new products but I do not want to pretend that that is easy and that it does not, on some occasions, results in considerable losses. However, we have to be prepared to make that investment and to absorb enormous losses so that we will succeed in generating winners.</P>
    <P>The level of research and development and the way we have approached it has not been done in the most appropriate way. There is a much greater need for investment in research and development which will result in new products and getting them on the market. It is important that we spend more on that type of research, using the fundamental knowledge which is already available and trying to apply it. It is very important to develop research in some of our key industries.</P>
    <P>Anybody who looks, for even a second, at the state of research and development in some parts of the food industry could be driven to despair. The amount of research and development which has been invested in the meat industry is dismal, indeed appalling. There are no worthwhile products on the market, no new products of any value are being generated; we are just not performing at that level of research and development. Yet if we are to exploit our potential we must have branded products, which people will clearly identify, on the European and world markets. I do not know how we can expect to do that given the levels of technology employed in the meat industry, which still centre around killing animals, sawing them down the middle and putting the meat into boxes. It is better than sending them out on the hoof, but it is a long way from what is needed. That is the type of end product the key generators of industrial development ideas in the IDA have allowed to happen over the years and why I am critical of them here this evening.</P>
    <P>I repeat I am very disappointed that <Col N="1771" /> this Bill has been introduced at this stage. I am particularly disappointed that the Minister has not waited to see what is in the review of industrial policy which will be available in the next month or so. Why is it necessary to rush this Bill through in three hours in Christmas week when it relates to matters of fundamental importance, to the greatest economic challenge this country has faced in a long time, namely, creating jobs to reduce the number of people &mdash; 275,000 &mdash; we estimate will be on the dole queues over the next 12 months?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that I am able to agree with one item in Senator Upton's speech &mdash; but one item only &mdash; that there is unanimous disapproval and dismay that the Bill is being pushed through this House tonight. While I accept the urgency of one part of the Bill &mdash; about financial limits &mdash; I do not think that applies to the second principal part, that is, the amalgamation of the two State organisations. Senator Upton or any other member of the Labour Party, should not be allowed make speeches of that sort without their being examined or analysed. It is very easy for many of us in Opposition to oppose a lot of what the Government do, because we never have to explain or answer for our actions while they do. I resent and dismiss what Senator Upton says about the National Development Corporation being frustrated by those he described as the new right and their deep ideological beliefs, not that I feel I am one of them, but simply because the National Development Corporation was the product of the deep ideological beliefs of the Left at the time. It is no secret that there were difficulties within Government about that and that the Labour Party in Government got their way at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the deep ideological beliefs of the Left &mdash; incidentally, they have now changed dramatically, and Senator Upton's speech was an indication of the schizophrenia which is attacking the Labour Party &mdash; the <Col N="1772" /> National Development Corporation was born. They were born out of totally false hopes, out of fairyland promises from the Labour Party. My memory is not very good, but I think the authorised capital was about £300 million. It was portrayed in Labour Party folklore as the solution to the unemployment problem at the time. Somehow the State was going to produce all this money and create jobs. That is what it was to be.</P>
    <P>This Bill recognises one thing with which I agree &mdash; and the Minister's speech is a euphemism throughout because he talks about it not living up to expectations &mdash; the Bill that is, that the National Development Corporation, by the standards and the hopes set for it by the Labour Party, have been a dismal failure, because they have created a negligible number of jobs. I would dispute the figure of 2,000 contained in various reports. The National Development Corporation was a false political expectation and it is now, unfortunately, being looked at in that light by the Government. They really do not know what to do with this creation of the Labour Party. The Labour Party, having been in Government and having produced it, landed the next Government with the National Development Corporation. They now say they do not want it removed, because they are not in the position of having to decide whether to remove it. They are starved of finance because this do not have the sort of finance that Socialist parties, the once Socialist parties, the former Socialist parties, believed in pumping into the economy willy nilly. It is important that we recognise that any analysis of the National Development Corporation simply does not live up to the expectations or the hopes we all had for them.</P>
    <P>There is more schizophrenia in Senator Upton's speech. He referred to R &amp; D. We would all love to spend lots of money on research and development in industry. That is a very worthy objective and is always a primary objective of the left but it is never costed. They never say we will have to pay for it and we will get the <Col N="1773" /> money from X, Y and Z. The real problem with the Labour Party is this: unlike the other parties who threaten to spend money while in Opposition and then find that the realities of Government do not allow them to do it, I have a feeling that if the Labour Party got into Government again they too would spend the money they did not have. That would be a serious problem, because from what Senator Upton said, I suspect we would find them spending money they did not have on research and development, expecting the results to come through later. That was what they expected from the National Development Corporation. They promised jobs at any capital cost to the Exchequer, money to be borrowed here there and everywhere.</P>
    <P>Although I oppose this Bill for several reasons, I am afraid some people are opposing it for all the wrong reasons; they made promises and no Government could have delivered on the expectations of the National Development Corporation and I am afraid the National Development Corporation failed in that way. What we are seeing in this Bill is the mercy killing, the euthanasia, in many ways, of a creature which was created by the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt Senator Upton, because I will have plenty of time to reply to him. I am opposed to the Bill because I think one of its problems is that we have one white elephant of the State swallowing another white elephant of the State, we do not have any particular thought going into it and this part of the Bill certainly could have waited. I accept the Minister's bona fides in regard to the first part, that the Bill has to be passed by the end of Christmas but what we have not done, and what nobody has done in the last few years, is a thorough analysis of these semi-State companies and deciding what to do. To a certain extent we are saying we will jumble them all up together and see what happens because <Col N="1774" /> if one does not work, it may work in the other.</P>
      <P>The IDA, constantly the subject of criticism, suffer from one particular defect &mdash; it is almost impossible to cost the expense and the return, as is the case with money State companies, like Bord Fáilte, CTT and others. They make their own particular efforts; they make a stab at it from time to time and usually use the yardstick of cost per job. That is a very laudable effort &mdash; I think the cost per job now is £14,000 &mdash; and they go on to say that half of that amount is recouped by the Exchequer, and that the cost per job is constantly declining, as it has done in the last few years. While we do not dispute those figures, especially the way they are calculated, it is an intangible concept to say how many of these jobs would have been created if the IDA were not there. We know how many jobs would have been created if NADCORP were not there, because they created so few, but it is very difficult for the IDA to say this. The merging of NADCORP with the IDA, the takeover of one by the other, will not help us to do an individual analysis of what those two organisations were doing. We are in real trouble and I await with interest the report of the working party the Minister set up in this area. I think we are in serious difficulties when we get into that area because we can draw any conclusions we like. Senator Upton's thesis cannot be totally destroyed because this whole area is up in the air and could be open to any sort of interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I worry about the use of the IDA by the Government and the fact that it is politicised to a certain extent. I also worry about that board of directors are political appointees. As a result, it is very difficult for us to say it is an independent authority. I worry that there are those on the board &mdash; and on many other boards &mdash; whose loyalty is to a party rather than to the State. It is a pity the IDA, which use so much State funds and make very sensitive decisions in terms of grants, loans and taking equities in companies, <Col N="1775" /> can be subject, and undoubtedly are subject, to political pressure, especially in the present circumstances.</P>
    <P>I, and I am sure many other Members of this House, have been subjected to pressures in this area. I have had people telephone me asking if I could organise something with X who is on such and such a committee of the IDA. They believe that politicians can influence grants, permissions of one sort or another because they get in touch with their friends. I do not believe the IDA should be subject to this sort of pressure but I do believe this practice has developed because many appointments are politicised. One area where I personally received a certain amount of pressure was the International Financial Services Centre. Somebody rang me up looking for the go ahead from the IDA in this area. I thought it was unfortunate they felt I could do such a thing, but they made certain connections and felt it could actually be done. I did not do it, but I imagine other politicians are subject to the same sort of pressures. If that sort of politicisation were removed the IDA would certainly be seen not to be a party political organisation.</P>
    <P>I would like to take the single example of the International Financial Services Centre to dispute some of the claims made by the IDA. Because their brief is so wide, and because the returns and the analysis of what they do is so subjective, it is very difficult to judge if they are a success or failure. However, the IDA by their very nature &mdash; the same is true of all these State-sponsored bodies &mdash; have to issue an annual report; and have to claim enormous successes for themselves. The IDA, which were delegated responsibility for selling the International Financial Services Centre, each year have to claim great success, emerge with a long list of names of companies which have come here, and, indeed, with employment numbers. I think these claims are very doubtful. In the last report they list the International Financial Services Centre projects announced in 1990. They claim credit for about 30 companies that <Col N="1776" /> are listed there &mdash; some from Ireland and the majority from overseas, as they are meant to be &mdash; and they claim credit for producing 600 jobs there.</P>
    <P>Certain questions should be asked about those particular claims and about the International Financial Services Centre. I do not think any serious analysis has been done of that Financial Services Centre yet. Despite the fact that, quite rightly, it is claimed that up to 150 companies moved into the International Financial Services Centre during the period in question, the employment figures are dismal. While well known names like Morgan Grenfell and others came here, despite the enormous trumpeting about catching an international fish, the numbers employed in each of these organisations and these units are in single figures &mdash; they are very small. In fact, in the last report of the International Financial Services Centre I read the projected employment remained very small.</P>
    <P>Those expectations have not been fulfilled. The number of new jobs that were promised in the original Fianna Fáil manifesto, I think of 1987, ranged between 8,000 and 10,000. It is impossible to know how many new jobs were created, as is the case in so many of these projects, but we know the companies from overseas are employing only very small numbers. We also have to ask how many Irish people are employed by those overseas companies. How many of these jobs are being given to foreigners who are repatriating the money? What is the net effect and benefit to the Irish economy? Is it negligible? We have to ask also why the IDA have been unable to attract an anchor tenant, because I believe the original objective of the International Financial Services Centre was to gain an anchor tenant, a world famous name which would be attracting high quality, operations to the centre. No international company set up a large operation in Dublin, despite the fact that well known international names have been attracted.</P>
    <P>The other question I would ask about the claims for the Financial Services Centre which were made by the IDA is: <Col N="1777" /> how many of the jobs being created have simply meant people relocating across the Liffey? It is very difficult to know how much revenue is lost to the Exchequer because so many Irish companies simply relocated &mdash; I am thinking of the major banks and other Irish companies &mdash; from Ballsbridge to the Custom House Docks site. What loss was there to the Exchequer providing incentives to induce them to do that? How many new jobs were created there and how many would have been created anyway? That is something I suspect we will never know.</P>
    <P>We should also ask why a financial services centre promoted by the IDA has now agreed and allowed a large amount of the space there to be taken up by solicitors and by accountants. Once again it seems they are moving in and taking advantage of the rates and rent allowances which were designed specifically to attract people from overseas and to produce a net added value to the Irish economy. We have solicitors and accountants simply relocating there getting tax advantages. That whole area is shrouded in confusion because it is very difficult to get answers; in fact, it is impossible to get an accurate answer to what the net loss to the Irish economy is against the net benefit.</P>
    <P>I doubt the extravagant claims being made by the Government every time they announce a new fish has been caught and brought into the International Financial Services Centre. In reality, it is usually a very small operation and not all that is happening there is a plus. In reality, the centre is falling way below the expectations which were part of the Fianna Fáil manifesto of 1987.</P>
    <P>The problem with this Bill is that we are merging two white elephants, and without any particular plan. NADCORP have not produced the socialist Utopia of Senator Upton's former dreams and, as a result, they are being merged with the IDA, which are not really subject to proper analysis and scrutiny. What we have to do, and what we should have done, is await the report. This is jumping too far; it is merging two white elephants and it may even produce a few little baby <Col N="1778" /> elephants. We ought not jump the gun. We could acknowledge the failure of NADCORP, but we could also have asked to see the report because now the process is irreversible and the real focus and scrutiny should not be on NADCORP but on the IDA. This serves only to prop up the IDA when I think it really is in need of serious reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who have contributed to this debate. I have listened to their views with some considerable interest and I will endeavour to deal with a number of the points raised.</P>
      <P>I would like to start with some of the points made by Senator Upton because he was trying to confront some of the issues. However, I felt he was quite erroneous in his approach to a number of them. He did, of course, have to lament the demise of NADCORP and &mdash; admittedly, not very enthusiastically &mdash; he tried to suggest that it had been a great success. He did not overplay that one, and I think he was right there. Its genesis, which was touched on by Senator Ross, is interesting. That is why I was particularly fascinated to hear Senator Howard tonight lament its passing. I think he is going to vote against it, because it was announced, as I recall, early in 1983 by the late Deputy Cluskey, who was Minister for Industry and Commerce. He announced that the Bill would be drafted and would be up and running in a matter of months. The Bill finally appeared, somewhat reluctantly, in 1986 in an extremely watered down form from what Deputy Cluskey had originally in mind. The reason it took three years was that the Fine Gael party were adamantly opposed to it. They made it abundantly clear that they did not agree with the idea and they did no see it working. Of course, they were right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of its being starved for funds, this point was made in the Dáil and I did not get the opportunity, unfortunately, to reply to it there. The point was made by Senator Upton, by Senator Howard and others tonight. I would like <Col N="1779" /> to give the House some figures. NADCORP have been in existence for six years &mdash; from 1986 to 1991, inclusive. During that time their Exchequer capital allocations totalled £33 million; the amount they sought to draw down from the Exchequer was £20.1 million and the total amount they invested during that time was £25.83 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what it would buy, but what I do notice &mdash; and I sought to inform the House to that effect &mdash; is that they chose to draw down, rather remarkably in these days of shortages of money, £13 million less than the Exchequer had allocated to them. I wonder why. Their investments of £25.83 million at the moment have a book value of £19 million but, of course, their market value would be significantly less than that.</P>
      <P>Senator Upton went on at some length about the deficiencies in the food industry. I do not disagree with him that there are very serious deficiencies, and it is particularly regrettable because it could be and should be the strongest part of our indigenous industry, but I hesitate to speak about it at any length here because I and my Department have no responsibility for the food industry. In fact, we are excluded from it; I wonder whether that is one of the institutional strengths of the arrangements that were made in 1987. I doubt it. I think it is a matter for the review group to report next month I do not know whether they will or not. Senator Upton deplored the lack of research in the food industry. That is certainly true. There is no question about that. It really is very regrettable, but it is not just on the manufacturing alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody was comparing for me recently the amount spent in this country on breeding and the quality of the breeding and the rate of improvement in genetics in animals in recent years. It is sad to have to admit that the rate of improvement in our animals, particularly in <Col N="1780" /> cattle, both beef and milk, is the lowest in the European Community. To listen to some of the people who pontificate about it, one would think it was almost the opposite. It is a very sad fact. The lack of commitment and not just money &mdash; to research, the inability to see the need for it and the value for it in agriculture, is regrettably, reflected on the food side of industry as well. One reason we are so very weak is because we have never accepted that. I do not know whether any changes in the structural or institutional side of the food industry will be recommended. I imagine they will. One of the outstanding and most successful Irishmen in the food industry is a member of that group, Mr. Hoskins of Northern Foods, a company turning over more than £1 billion, and doing so very profitably and very successfully. He is an ideal man to give a sense of direction to the Irish food industry.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton went on at some length about the IDA and the way they resisted the Telesis report. He is right in that. I thought they, perhaps, overdid it, but he should be fair enough to admit that some of them at least resisted it because they thought it was wrong; more of them resisted if for a totally different reason.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to come into this House in the nineties and hear Senators talk about the IDA, because when I was here in the seventies and early eighties there were paeons of praise for the IDA from all sides of the House. It has changed. I think it is healthy, because it was sycophantic in the seventies. Senators kept telling the IDA how great they were, and they were even greater when they put a factory into Deputies' or Senators' constituencies, but at least an attempt is now being made, I am glad to see, in both Houses to analyse the IDA critically and to weigh up and assess the value or otherwise of agencies like the IDA and Shannon Development, Eolas etc. These agencies are very expensive and we are entitled to analyse their relative success or otherwise.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators were concerned that there was not sufficient evaluation and monitoring of the IDA but I assure <Col N="1781" /> them that their policies are monitored as is their spending.</P>
    <P>The point was made that because the Telesis report was not accepted or implemented as fully as it should this county lost out. Perhaps it did. I was associated with obtaining the Telesis report. I was Minister about the time it was delivered but I was not in the Department when the time for implementing it came about. It is probably fair to say that the views of the IDA prevailed at that time, as they so often did at different stages of our history. Senators are quite right to say there should be a far more critical analysis and evaluation of the success or otherwise of policies that have been followed. That is exactly what I am endeavouring to do and that is exactly what this review group are being asked to do.</P>
    <P>I had a verbal report from the chairman today who told me they will be finished on time which is remarkable. It is a radical report. I may not like a lot of it but at least I will have something to think about. I look forward very much to reading it because it will be valuable. He told me that the group with whom he has worked is one of the most successful he has worked with because of the qualities of the individuals concerned. I was very glad to hear that because they are people of outstanding calibre.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross referred to the 2,000 jobs and said it was not correct to say that they were all created by NADCORP. Of course it is not correct nor did I suggest that. I simply said that there were 2,000 jobs in companies in which NADCORP invested but most of those jobs would probably have been there anyway. It is certainly not correct to say that the 2,000 jobs exist only because of NADCORP.</P>
    <P>The Senator chose to make what I thought was a pretty cheap point about members of the Authority of the IDA and about the IDA as an organisation being subject to political pressures, particularly in the present atmosphere. That is an example of how badly he reads the situation because if they were ever subject to political pressures they certainly are not in the present atmosphere. <Col N="1782" /> It is my experience of the IDA that if people did try to subject them to political pressures, they very rarely, if ever, succumbed to those pressures. That is still their position and it will remain that way. It was a particularly unfortunate remark to make about the members of the Authority because I have taken some care in the appointment of members even to the extent of leaving vacancies on the Authority sometimes for prolonged periods. I have taken care that every member of that Authority whom I appointed, and I believe those who were appointed by people before me are people of outstanding calibre &mdash; I am satisfied on that &mdash; whose integrity is beyond any doubt and each of whom is qualified in their own way to make a significant contribution. I believe they do so. It is grossly untrue and a travesty of the facts to say that the loyalty of members of that Authority is to a political party or parties and not to the State. That is absolutely totally untrue and I repudiate it with contempt.</P>

      <P>On the question of the IFSC, the IDA's connection with it is simply that they were asked to promote it abroad and bring in banks, insurance companies, and so on. They have done that. I acknowledge that the numbers are not as great as we would wish but I expect that because of the relative success of most of those who are there, the numbers will begin to build up from now on. The number of people employed on the ground is disappointingly small but I believe it can take off from now on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Howard criticised the attitude <Col N="1783" /> of agencies generally towards projects with big potential, particularly if they were Irish or being promoted by Irish people. He instanced the reluctance of the IDA to promote an engine which runs on vegetable oil. I am not qualified to make a judgement on these matters but I can tell the Senator that some of my greatest successes and the IDA's greatest successes is when we said &ldquo;no&rdquo; to proposals. I can recall being advised by all and sundry, including some people in the IDA but fortunately not the ones who counted, to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to De Lorean at a cost of £100 million. We said &ldquo;no&rdquo;, so not everything that on the face of it seems attractive is necessarily the best. The IDA have a strong obligation to assess and study in detail projects that are put forward and just because something sounds unique, interesting or different, it does not necessarily follow that it will be a commercial success. Sometimes, those who advocate these things would be the first to criticise the IDA for having put public money into them.</P>

      <P>I do not know if a general Bill of this nature is one where it is appropriate to discuss the problems of Kilrush but I was asked, as it were, to keep my eye on it. I already have my eye on it. Senator Honan said she did not know whether there was a problem and I regret I have to tell the Senator there is a rather serious problem in Kilrush. <Col N="1784" /> We have to try to minimise the very heavy losses which have been sustained there.</P>
      <P>There is a lot one could say about Kilrush, not so much about Kilrush itself or the project there but about what brought about the problems that now exist there but I will refrain from that tonight. Perhaps in a few months time it would be more appropriate to deal with that but there is a very serious problem there unfortunately and it does not do the general question of regional development any great good to see things such as were allowed to happen at Kilrush.</P>

      <P>I share the surprise expressed by some Senators at what is happening in regard to policy matters on the part of chief executives of some State bodies. There is none of that happening in my Department, and it will never happen in my Department. Beyond that I do not think it would be appropriate for me to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of industrial policy generally, on which Senator Howard invited me to comment, I look forward to having a worthwhile debate on that topic and on the fundamental changes that will be necessary after the publication of the report of this review group after January. I believe they will do an excellent job, and it is remarkable that they will have completed their report in six months. As I said earlier, this is due to the high calibre of the people involved and the level of support they got from within my Department. There is nobody on that group from my Department or from the IDA. It is better to have people from the outside rather than people who are necessarily biased in favour of the <i>status quo.</i> We will get a fresh look at it and I hope its fate will not be as disappointing as the fate of Telesis ten years <Col N="1785" /> earlier. I hope I will be around for a while to try to implement some of these things.</P>
    <P>One of the points I made to that group was that I did not want them to look at industrial policy simply as what this agency or that agency do, whether the grant level should be a bit higher or a bit lower, what the relationship of agencies was to one another, and so on. There is much more to industrial policy. I asked them to look at everything that impinges, either positively or negatively, on industrial development in this country, particularly on the indigenous side.</P>
    <P>Education clearly must be of fundamental importance. The relevance of our education system to industrial development must be very important because the people in industry are the biggest single input and the preparation of those people &mdash; I do not mean in short term training but in their educational background &mdash; is of fundamental importance. The training and manpower policies which are run separately from my Department or from the IDA and so on, are of great concern because the amount of money involved is enormous. We spend £180 million a year &mdash; most if it from the European Community &mdash; on industrial and vocational training. We have to ask ourselves if we get good value for this huge amount of money. We may well not, and that is why I look forward with considerable interest to what they are going to say.</P>

      <P>There is a range of other matters, such as aspects of taxation, and not just corporate tax but personal taxation; and the whole field of social welfare, even though it may seem a long way from industrial policy, as we have tended to practice it. It all comes back to trying to draw together all the matters that impinge on it either positively or negatively and trying to make changes on a broad front which will contribute to greater industrialisation and employment here.</P>
      <P>Both Houses could usefully and profitably debate these questions based on that document, which I hope will be available in about a month's time. They have been asked to concentrate especially on the development of indigenous industry, because that is our particular weakness but not exclusively. This is most important because our industrial successes, as they are perceived from abroad at least, tend to be those which emanated originally overseas. We do not have the same level of success among Irish owned industry, or anything like it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity of raising the issue of the prospect of the closure of Clonroche Soft Fruit Centre. When I mentioned it earlier today somebody thought I was talking about a sweet. Clonroche is the only soft fruit centre in the country and currently employs six full-time workers &mdash; that may seem to be small &mdash; ten part-time workers and at present there are 15 FÁS workers there for nine months. The FÁS workers are engaged in a basic horticultural skills course which covers the work done at the centre. They do a full course on vegetable growing. Crazy figures like £400 million have been given to extimate the cost of imported vegetables which we should be growing ourselves. I am not sure the figure is accurate; I think the Minister present, Deputy Kirk, has said the figure is closer to £100 million. Whatever the figure, it is scandalous and one way of redressing the balance is to train people such as the 15 FÁS workers in Clonroche at present.</P>
      <P>In relation to vegetable growing, not alone should we be able to halt importation but, because of our climate and expertise, we should become net exporters. The fact is we import £27 million of chipped potatoes each year, a crazy statistic in a country with a potato growing tradition and presumably a tremendous expertise in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 450 farmers grow soft fruit at Clonroche and my collegue from Wexford, Senator Doyle to whom I would like to give some of my time on this subject, would agree that many a smallholder is being kept on the land because <Col N="1789" /> of strawberries; 450 farmers grow strawberries in Wexford. The industry is worth about £7 million nationally, the bulk of which comes from Wexford.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that Clonroche is in the geographical centre of the soft fruit industry. That is a vital advantage because small farmers growing fruit can drive to the centre, they do not have to invite the adviser out at a cost, they may get advice and be back home within a few minutes. I am told these people will be referred to Oak Park if Clonroche is closed and I hope the Minister tonight will tell us it will not be closed following the views we will express this evening. Five million pounds worth of strawberries are exported each year; this should be taken seriously. Clonroche is the only horticultural centre dealing with soft fruit.</P>
    <P>Bee-keeping is a small industry which earns for 2,000 beekeepers and for this country £1 million per year. The only active beekeeping centre in the country is situated at Clonroche where progeny testing is carried out for better strains and to upgrade the industry. If Clonroche is closed the industry and enterprise of soft fruit and beekeeping will stagnate at first and then slowly decline because it will not be possible to remain competitive if research and advice are not available on site for the small farmer.</P>
    <P>I was interested in today's <i>Irish Press</i>, that TDs have received assurances about Belclare. The article says that last night two Fine Gael TDs claimed they were given assurances by Teagasc Chairman, Joe Rea, that Belclare Research Centre would not be closed under any circumstances. The report says that Enda Kenny and Galway East TD, Paul Connaughton, were given categoric and specific assurances by both Joe Rea and Teagasc's director, Dr. Pierce Ryan that the centre would not be closed down. Mr. Kenny last night reportedly called on the Teagasc board to honour that commitment and assurance. I understand that Teagasc are meeting today and I would like the Minister to confirm or deny what I quoted from the paper. It is important that we be told whether assurances can <Col N="1790" /> be given beforehand on a station that was to close down, and I am disappointed no such assurance was given about Clonroche. Are things happening in places other than where they should be happening?</P>
    <P>Approximately, 1,500 strawberry pickers &mdash; adults and children &mdash; from County Wexford are involved in the industry. Children earn pocket money and money to buy schoolbooks because generally they come from the smaller type farms and the worst off families. Many a household appliance has been bought from the proceeds of strawberry picking.</P>
    <P>Having made the case for keeping Clonroche open, I would like to raise the subject of cost. The annual cost of the centre at Clonroche, excluding staff because they will be redeployed is £170,000. The annual income to Clonroche from a commercial farm selling vegetables and soft fruit is £123,000. The centre currently costs the country about £50,000 per annum and living in that constituency and having benefited from research and advice at clonroche I can tell the House that it is worth a lot more than £50,000 and it would be crazy to close it down.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my attention today that the Gorey Teagasc office is to be closed. I would be very disappointed if that were the case. I am not absolutely sure about it and I would like the Minister's views. I know that Joe Rea is chairman of Teagasc, Dr. Pierce Ryan, a Wexford man, is director and Teagasc themselves will have a major say in what, if anything, should close. Centres and area offices earning their keep should not be interfered with. The figures I have mentioned tonight and which are possibly on the conservative side were given to me by a decent group of workers at Clonroche who did not seek high publicity; they put their case to me and I have put it before you. I appeal to the Minister tonight in the light of what I have said and considering the employment situation in Wexford, to ensure that Clonroche does not close.</P>
    <Col N="1791" />
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Byrne for sharing time with me on this important topic. To add to what he has said in relation to the threatened closure of the soft fruit research station in Clonroche comes appalling news this afternoon from the board of Teagasc that between 50 and 60 more jobs are to go in Johnstown castle. There are only 103 people left on the payroll in Johnstown Castle following the very severe redundancy programme implemented there over recent years. Now we hear that over 50 per cent of those left are, to quote the terminology used on these occasions nowadays, &ldquo;surplus to requirements&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>All I can suggest is that, in desperation, the board of Teagasc, because of genuine underfunding or whatever are choosing politically sensitive centres in different constituencies to force the hand of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, and through him the hand of the Minister for Finance. If it is a ploy to use constituencies and sensitive research centres like this, that ploy must be deplored. If this action is genuine attempt by the board to live within their means, we must look to the Government for answers, but this evening we look to the Minister for Horticulture, Deputy Kirk, to come to the aid of these two most important centres in County Wexford.</P>
      <P>In relation to Clonroche, the statistics have been given but they bear repeating. Clonroche is the only soft fruit research station in the south-east, the major area of soft fruit farming. When we hear so much about Common Agricultural Policy reform, diversification, and alternative farm enterprises, how can the Government allow one of the few research centres that deals with an alternative enterprise to be closed down? It is unthinkable and I hope the Minister has an answer for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same argument applies to the importance of bee-keeping, a small part of overall agricultural production but a most important one for the south-east where our climate, flora and fauna are particularly conducive to excellent honey production. Wexford honey is famed, as are Wexford strawberries and other soft <Col N="1792" /> fruit. We produce raspberries, gooseberries and other minority fruits; research is carried out to identify strains most suitable to our climate. Apart from that, there is the jam and contract market that could be expanded enormously if more attention were given to it. There is also the yoghourt and soft cheese markets where soft fruits of various kinds are used, a most popular area for growth.</P>
    <P>The Minister has heard the figures and knows how cost efficient Clonroche is. Excluding salaries, the shortfall at Clonroche annually is only £47,000. It was the Minister's mission &mdash; and we supported it &mdash; and it is the mission of the Teagasc board to make each centre as self-sufficient as possible by charging for their services and recouping as much as the farmer or the public can afford for the service offered. No case can justify the closure of Clonroche, a modern, state of the art plant, highly cost efficient, one of the most cost efficient research centres in the country and located ideally for the job it has to do. Staff and management there are to be congratulated on the efficient and most important research centre they run.</P>
    <P>If it is the Government's intention to abolish Teagasc by stealth, it would be more honest for the Minister to say so. Worse, to add credibility to this exercise, they have employed as their hatchetman the former head of a major farm organisation. The lack of sensitivity being displayed in the area of research and development indicts this Government, particularly the former Minister for Agriculture and Food. I hope, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, that the new man in the job, Minister Woods, himself an agricultural scientist, will display more sensitivity and appreciation for the importance of research and development and educational advice, particularly as farmers face into Common Agricultural Policy reform with a most uncertain future ahead of them and endure a difficult present with the collapse of farm incomes generally.</P>
    <P>We only spend one-third of gross agricultural output on research as the EC <Col N="1793" /> generally and we are dependent on agriculture and agri-business as our major industry. We spent only one-sixth as much as the UK on agricultural research, and the UK is an industrial nation. Where are we going? What are this Government trying to do with Teagasc, our agricultural research, advice and education centres? What was Joe Rea been asked to do? We must request the Minister to state whether Mr. Rea has done the job he was appointed to do by the former Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy. I appeal to the Minister of State, a man who appears to have some sensitivity, and the present Minister for Agriculture and Food, to ensure there will be no more closures of this insensitive kind that bear no relation to the needs of farmers as we approach the next century and try to compete not just with the twelve but with an enlarged European group of 24 or 30 nations, with eastern European problems, pressure from GATT negotiations, from the Cairns group of countries and from the US and we compare badly with other countries when it comes to money being pumped into agricultural research, education and development.</P>
    <P>Only last Friday the former Minister for Agriculture was in Dublin and he addressed the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities &mdash; we refer to that as the EC committee &mdash; of which I am a member. On Friday morning I travelled to Dublin especially to be part of the cross-party team that questioned Commissioner MacSharry on the implications of the Common Agricultural Policy reform for Ireland. One of the last points the Commissioner made and emphasised was the importance of agricultural research to the future of agriculture. I somewhat facetiously requested him to have a word in Joe Rea's ear before he flew back to Brussels. He was not slow to remind me that that was a national rather than an EC issue &mdash; we were talking about former colleagues at one stage.</P>
    <P>If the Commissioner for Agriculture in Brussels can underline the importance of agricultural research for the family farm <Col N="1794" /> at this difficult time and to ensure a commercial future for farmers generally, how can the Government fail to recognise the importance of the work being done in the soft fruit and bee-keeping industries in Clonroche? Clonroche is a most efficient centre that asked for little money from this or from previous Governments. Similarly important work is being done in soil analysis and in a wide range of research areas in Johnstown Castle.</P>
    <P>Finally, could I once again emphasise the importance of agriculture to this country? One sentence says it all, and yet we continue to decimate this industry by refusing a research back-up and advisory team for it. During the last few years Teagasc, under the present chairman managed to abolish the economic unit in Sandymount established to interpret the new directives coming from Brussels and to explain to the Irish, both officialdom and farmers, the importance of changes in the EC rules.</P>
    <P>Forty two pence in every £1 of what we export comes from agriculture and agri-business, and yet we have decided to abolish the State advisory and research service that backs up this industry. This cannot be accepted and I trust there will be an explanation here tonight from a Minister who has shown sensitivity in this area. Otherwise I will conclude that this Government have washed their hands not just of Clonroche and the important work carried out there and not just of Johnstown Castle, but of other centres threatened with closure in recent weeks &mdash; as we read in farming newspapers and farming supplements in our national daily papers.</P>
    <P>Debate on these closures has not taken place in this House as it should; it has been removed by the procedures set up by the previous Minister.</P>
    <P>My final plea to the Minister of State, and through him to the present Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Woods, whom I hope will exercise greater sensitivity to the agricultural research area, is that he will bring some sense into the dissemination of our agricultural research known as Teagasc, to put on the record how important the <Col N="1795" /> Government view this service, to bring our farmers forward in the face of common agricultural reform and worldwide pressures on their products. I urge the Minister to confirm tonight that there is no truth in the rumours in that the Teagasc centre in Clonroche is about to close and I ask him, and my colleague Senator Byrne will join with me, to ensure that the proposals from the board this afternoon do not lead to further decimation of the staff at Johnstown Castle.</P>

      <P>Under the Agriculture (Research Training and Advice) Act, 1988, Teagasc are charged with the provision of agricultural research training and advisory services. It is incumbent on the Authority to deliver these services in the most efficient and cost effective way. Indeed, the Government's objective when establishing Teagasc was to steamline and make more effective the delivery of these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1796" /> Teagasc is a national organisation with considerable resources throughout the country. As such they must regularly review their activities in the light of changing circumstances. I understand the Authority are at present considering management proposals for the reoganisation of Teagasc's structures and operational programmes. These discussions are continuing and no final decisions have been reached by the Authority.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of the reported assurances having been given by the Chairman of Teagasc of Deputy Kenny or Deputy Connaughton. All I can say is that proposals in relation to restructuring are under consideration and no final decisions have been taken by the Authority. Until such time as decisions are made by the Authority and submitted to me, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on them.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 18 December 1991.</P>
