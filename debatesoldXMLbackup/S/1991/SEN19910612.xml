      <P>I have notice from Senator Mooney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to investigate the reasons the Lough Allen Canal from Leitrim town to Acres Lake has not been properly maintained, the result of which is a deterioration of the canal on both banks, which if not rectified could prevent the normal passage of cruiser traffic leading to a serious reduction in tourists; and the subsequent adverse economic impact on Drumshanbo and Leitrim.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to include the Coast Road between Limerick and Tarbert, the N69, for investment under the operational programme for peripherality.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the light of the report adopted by the Parliamentary <Col N="786" /> Assembly of the Council of Europe on the case of Mr. Raoul Wallenberg to express to the Soviet authorities in Moscow the wish of the Irish people that they should: (1) reopen the file on Mr. Raoul Wallenberg and his driver, Mr. Vilmos Lanofender, and to state unambiguously what has become of them; (2) to allow an international commission made up of historians and other experts access to all the relevant archives; (3) and, presuming that they are alive, to return them immediately to freedom and their families.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Raftery of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to take the necessary steps to make safe the pier and breakwater in Ballycotton harbour, which are in a very dangerous condition following the storms in 1990.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Mooney, Neville, Norris and Raftery as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Mooney's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Neville, Norris and Raftery may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today is item No. 2, continuation of Committee Stage of the Child Care Bill to 4 p.m. My understanding is that this would be sufficient time to complete the Committee Stage.  From 4 p.m. to 4.45 p.m. it is proposed to have a sos to allow amendments to be considered for Report Stage and to circulate them.  From 4.45 p.m. to 6 p.m. we will continue with Report Stage of the Bill.  There will be a sos from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. and at 6.30 p.m. we resume the second portion of the Fianna Fáil motion on tourism, the Private Members' motion.  From 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. we will take item No. 3, the University of Limerick (Dissolution of Thomond College) Bill, 1991.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House whether he can report on progress in relation to the foreign affairs committee that has been promised on several occasions and indeed promised by the Taoiseach himself. There are many issues we would like to debate in this House &mdash; they come up regularly on the Order of Business by way of expressing our frustration at our lack of input into them &mdash; the ongoing democratic deficit that is growing between the decision-making process in Europe generally, particularly with political union, and the whole security issue yet to be thoroughly debated by this House, the issue of the annual price talks and the lack of input by this House and the debate on the income crisis in farming generally.  Again, with the democratic deficit, the decisions are being made in Brussels and we are not having any input into them.</P>
      <P>This is a question to the Leader of the House.  Could we please have a forum through which we can debate all these issues &mdash; the ODA issue, both governmental and non-governmental help to the countries in crisis, Bangladesh, Africa, and we all have our different areas. Senators on all sides raise issues that should properly be dealt with at an all party foreign affairs committee.  I would like to ask the Leader if, without pushing it aside or saying he has no information, he could inform this House as to the progress on this committee that has been promised by the Taoisach.  Could he assure this House their will be senatorial representation on this committee when it is established?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is worthwhile recalling last week's Order of Business in the light of what Senator Doyle has just said and also the need for more debate on issues. One way of approaching this would be to increase Private Members' time.  We had come to a stage recently where we were very close to some sort of agreement on being able to take further motions in Private Members' time.  I really feel it would take a lot of pressure from the Order of Business and it is something <Col N="788" /> which I would appeal to the Leader of the House to respond to in a positive way. It seems it would solve many difficulties.</P>
      <P>Could I also get some indication from the Leader of the House about Report Stage of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill?  I am not pushed on this.  If it is not ready, it is not ready; but I think we should have some indication.  I believe it is not going to be ready for July.  I have heard that it is, but I do not believe it is going to be.  We would be better off to be told that and to know we are going to deal with it in August or September, or whenever we come back.  I want to make it clear that I am not pushing.  There were a huge number of areas where amendments had to be made, but I think we are entitled to have some indication as to when it will be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nice to be back in the House again.  Would the Leader of the House consider allowing us have a debate on the postal service?  It is a matter that is being debated tonight in the other House, and was debated there last night. Quite clearly, it is a matter of immediate national concern judging by the huge crowd of postal workers who marched to Dáil Éireann.  I ask the Leader of the House to facilitate us by allowing this House put on the record its position and the views of the Members, on the Government side and the Opposition side, in relation to this very important national issue, that is not just of an urban nature but very much of a rural nature as well.</P>
      <P>May I also support Senator Doyle's request for information on the progress, or lack of progress, of the foreign affairs committee as was promised by the Taoiseach? It would provide us with a forum whereby we would be able to channel many of the requests that are made here for debates on a wide variety of international issues.  That would be one way for us to try to deal with one area that has been causing a lot of trouble here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That leads us on to the other point, which is, how can we best deal with topical issues?  We still have not resolved that matter; it is coming up again and <Col N="789" /> again and we have to address it.  I ask the Leader of the House to take the initiative to see that more time is made available either in Private Members' time or in Adjournment time or more issues allowed to be debated so that we can deal with matters that are of current concern to the Members here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to endorse the view of Senator Doyle that at the earliest possible opportunity we should have a debate on European affairs.  I specifically request the Leader of the House to consider regular debates and a regular monitoring of our performance in relation to 1992.  I say this because we have had the NESC report, the ESRI and the Cecchini report, which all call into question our fitness for 1992.  I am concerned that we are not monitoring this carefully enough and I appeal to the Leader of the House in the future ordering of business in the Seanad that on a periodic basis we have a debate on 1992, our preparation for it and the implications for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what Senator Doyle and other Senators have said about the desirability of setting up the foreign affairs committee. I would like to make the point that the Leader of the House on numerous occasions here has expressed his support for our views on that, that he believes it should be a joint committee and that Seanad Éireann should have its proper representation on the committee. I have no reason whatsoever to doubt his goodwill in this matter and that should be put on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should note, however, that in this connection all the evidence is that individual national parliaments in Europe are more and more putting pressure on their Governments in the ongoing developments of the talks towards European union and inter-governmental conferences. The whole move now in the Community is that national parliaments should monitor the march, if you like, to federal union and the inter-governmental conferences.  It is appalling if we are going <Col N="790" /> to be deficient in that.  I, too, would be anxious to know honestly what the view of the Leader of the House is on the reason for this extraordinary delay or whether he has any comment to make on the bizarre interpretation that somehow it has to do with the falling out of old buddies.  I am ready to believe anything at this stage and I will not elaborate on that statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the request to the Leader of the House to make more time available, especially to deal with the European Community.  We have seen this week a continuing fall in agricultural incomes.  It is unfortunate we do not have an opportunity of debating or at least concentrating our minds on these problems that farmers are facing over the next few months.</P>
      <P>I would like if the Leader of the House would indicate whether it would be possible to have an early debate in the Seanad to consider the new appeals system and the situation after the latest extension of the disadvantaged areas.  From now on this is going to be a very important contribution to the viability of many thousands of farmers in this country and this House should have an input into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As my party's spokesman for Foreign Affairs, I, too, believe we should have an opportunity of an input into a foreign affairs committee.  I ask the Leader of the House, in support of what Senator Doyle has said, if he would indicate whether we can have an early input into the formation of such a committee.  It is important that the Oireachtas should be able to make a contribution and concentrate our thoughts on many of the areas with which our Ministers are dealing every day. Decisions are taken in our name and the democratic system is continually bypassed here time and time again.  I would ask Senator Fallon if he will use his good offices to ensure that the House is represented on the proposed foreign affairs committee.  Will he also give the House an opportunity of considering making a submission to the Government on the <Col N="791" /> present situation and the huge disappointment of many thousands of farmers after the latest extension of the disadvantaged areas scheme?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I want to put on record that I am perfectly happy with the proposals the Leader has for dealing with the Child Care Bill today.  Can I put on record &mdash; maybe it is slightly disorderly &mdash; the very positive response of the Minister to the debate in this House on Committee Stage of the Bill?  One is more than happy to facilitate a Minister who is as positive in his response as that.</P>
      <P>There are a couple of matters I would like to raise on the Order of Business. One is a small suggestion in the light of the problems we ran into the last day.  I would hate us to end up with only a quarter of an hour left for Report Stage of the Child Care Bill and to feel at six o'clock this evening that we could not finish it, because, as you correctly pointed out the last day, it would be in breach of procedures.  I would suggest that we do not timetable a sos, even though I am absolutely certain we will have one, so as to make sure that no procedural problem will prevent us from finishing the Bill today.  That is only a suggestion and the Leader may respond as he wishes.</P>
      <P>I agree with all of my colleagues on the need for a foreign affairs committee and I join in their request to the Leader for some clarification on the matter. I also ask my Fine Gael colleagues for clarification of newspaper reports that they were seeking only to have a minuscule number of Seanad Members on that committee.  The number reported was three.  Since I did not see a subsequent denial maybe they would find out for us, when the Leader is finding out about the Government's views, what Fine Gael's view is on Seanad representation on that committee, because three is a derisory representation of this House on such an important committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It was three from our party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="792" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael's aspirations to large numbers of seats, if anything is perhaps a little bit out of touch with reality at present.  I am not running in the local elections so that will not be the answer.</P>
      <P>On the issue of foreign affairs, it is time we had an open-ended, extensive and serious debate on the problem of famine in Africa.  I do not mean a two hour symbolic wringing of hands; I mean a debate in which each of us has sufficient opportunity and time to deal with this issue and with the extraordinarily inadequate response of the international community to it.  I propose, not in any disorderly fashion, to continue to raise this issue in this House not in any way claiming superiority but because I think it is an extraordinarily important issue. Probably it is the most important single critical issue facing the world and I appeal to the Leader to begin by allowing us a serious, open-ended and extensive debate on the problem of famine in Africa, because millions of people are going to die and it is our duty to do what we can to put pressure on the large world institutions, among them the EC, to produce the sort of response in the time-scale that it is necessary to do.</P>
      <P>May I also, on the issue of foreign affairs, compliment Senator O'Reilly for raising the question of 1992?  I see us hurtling down on this ideological skateboard into 1992 quite unaware that the Cecchini report, which everybody believes in, has been contradicted by the NESC report, which says the opposite to what Cecchini said.  We are in for dreadful problems and the matter should be dealt with seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, Motion No. 47 on the Order Paper, in the names of my colleagues, Senator Ross and Senator Murphy, welcomes President De Klerk.  May I invite them to take that motion off the Order Paper, given the appalling revelations in yesterday's London <i>Independent</i> about the connivance of the South African Government and certain black groups which are effectively conniving to murder other black South Africans?  Of course, it has been denied but the facts are that <Col N="793" /> the revelations are very damning and very convincing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of a general consensus that suicide should be decriminalised and that emphasis should be placed on compassion and assistance and a Christian approach to it, and in view of the the need to bring the criminal law into conformity with the views and outlook of the present day, would the Leader of the House allow time for discussion of item No. 8, the Bill to decriminalise suicide?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Doyle on the matter of European affairs.  One of the things about Europe 1992 is that it is like what Job says: &ldquo;The thing I fear most has come upon me.&rdquo; That is the way we are going to be very shortly.  For that reason I support totally the request that we should have an opportunity of expressing our views in a constructive way as part of a monitoring process.</P>
      <P>On the question of the viability plan of An Post, I know there are difficulties procedurally with that.  I am not going to press the point, but perhaps the Committee on Procedure and Privileges might examine tonight whether the Cathaoirleach has any discretion in the matter of whether a debate can be held on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this morning's &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo;, Seán Barrett &mdash; the Trinity economist, not the Fine Gael TD &mdash; gave a lot of information about the abuses that have been discovered in the Comptroller and Auditor General's audits down through the years.  This is not any one Government; this is many Governments during the years.  Quite frankly, the reason I am putting the matter to the Leader of the House is simply because I do not think people should be afraid to be accountable. We should have an opportunity for a general debate on these reports and the abuses.  After all, we are spending taxpayers' money and we rather than someone on the radio should be able to show that we are responsible and have accountability.  Therefore, I ask that a series of those reports be put before the <Col N="794" /> House for a general debate without decision.</P>
    <P>The next matter is the Third World. Senator Ryan is quite correct there.  The people of the Third World, if those who are talking about competition are correct, are going to be our customers in the long term.  On the humanitarian side, what we are giving to the Third World is a pittance.  We need to have another look at that and have another debate in the Seanad on how we could step up that contribution to the Third World.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no monopoly of interest on any one side of the House in relation to what is taking place outside of these shores, but, as a former emigrant, I have down through the years taken a particular interest in emigrant welfare and obviously have followed with great interest the debates &mdash; those of them that are made public &mdash; of the Anglo-Irish Parliamentary tier.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House, in the context of what has gone before, whether there is any vehicle or whether he could explore either with the Government or within the Committee on Procedure and Privileges an opportunity for this House to debate the deliberations of the Anglo-Irish Parliamentary tier.  We are indeed honoured to have representatives from both sides of the House sitting on this history-making committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point that the House is well represented. Having said that, what is of more concern to me is that I, as a Member of this House, am excluded from discussing the debates which go on at the Anglo-Irish Parliamentary tier both here and in London.  I know the valuable work they are doing is very relevant to this House. I am asking the Leader, as there seems to be an absence of a vehicle for debating the deliberations of that body, to give consideration to exploring the possibility of bringing some of their reports into this <Col N="795" /> House &mdash; those that can be published in the public domain, because many of their deliberations are <i>in camera</i>&mdash; and specifically those dealing with emigrant welfare issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the major crisis in farm incomes which is getting worse daily, of the discussions on the Common Agricultural Policy and of the crisis in the sheep industry, particularly with regard to the collapse of lamb and wool prices, will the Leader of the House give time for a debate on agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to item No. 17 on the Supplementary Order Paper &mdash; it is critical of the Government but I do not wish to raise it in any controversial sense &mdash; about the repercussions of the European Court judgement on the question of homosexual relations, I would like to put a question to the Leader of the House, in view of the questions asked last week by Deputy McCartan in the Dáil and the answers he received, which was to confirm what the Minister told this House, that legislation would be introduced in the autumn.  I take the Minister's bona fides in this absolutely but would the Leader find out now from the Minister whether it is intended to initiate this measure in this House?  I am sure the Leader would agree with me that this would be a most appropriate Chamber in which to introduce it, first, in view of the considerable expertise of many Members of this House and of the calm and dispassionate debate that could be held here and it could then be passed to the lower House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to support what Senator Doyle said in regard to the foreign affairs committee.  I also very much hope this will be confirmed by the Leader.  I have asked questions on many occasions.  On the Supplementary Order Paper, you will find a detailed motion in my name.  It is an expediency motion; it does arise on the Order of Business.  I took this in Private Members' time in the last session I am very anxious that there should be proper representation.  A point was raised by <Col N="796" /> Senator Mooney with regard to the Anglo-Irish Parliamentary tier.  That gives great concern with regard to the foreign affairs committee because the Independent benches were deliberately and unscrupulously and, in my opinion, illegally and undemocratically excluded. We are the only representatives who have constituents in the North of Ireland and in the United Kingdom and it is absurd that we should be so disgracefully excluded.</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the rescue trust, there is a motion on the Order Paper, No. 54: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann expresses concern regarding the increasing use of torture by many regimes world wide, and commends the work of the rescue trust...&rdquo;.  May I ask the Leader of the House to be aware that I have asked my representative to raise this matter at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I sought to secure a room for the briefing of Members of this House and was denied that, which seems an extraordinary denial of parliamentary privilege.</P>
      <P>May I, finally, refer to Senator Neville's no doubt well-intentioned placing on the Order Paper of the Bill regarding suicides?  It is an area that needs to be examined.  I will be opposing this Bill vehemently because of the appalling provision that seeks to make a deadletter of the suicide of a person, and an active matter and a matter of criminal sanction with regard to anybody who assists somebody to commit suicide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Will somebody indicate to Senator Norris that I wish to address him?  The Senator is nowhere near relevancy in regard to the Order of Business.  The Bill in question is not before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Bill was referred to and you permitted Senator Neville to make an extended speech.  I would like to point out that this is a highly dangerous <Col N="797" /> Bill as currently framed because it criminalises something many people would have strong reservations about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to support Senator Brendan Ryan's call for a debate on the situation in Africa.  It is only when we see the awful scenes on our television screens that we react in a very generous way.  All western countries and the EC have an obligation to try in some way to resolve the situation in the long term and I support the call for a debate on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a couple of matters on the Order of Business. First, perhaps the Leader of the House might state his intentions in relation to the taking of the University of Limerick (Dissolution of Thomond College) Bill. Secondly, in relation to legislation for next week and early July, Senator O'Toole mentioned one Bill and it might be an idea if the Leader of the House could communicate to us in the course of the next few days or so generally what legislation it is proposed to take over this period.</P>
      <P>We know that there are difficulties with Ministers and their advisers coming back with legislation and it is not easy for spokespersons to be prepared.  Thirdly, I understand the committee on crime is to be reconstituted.  Is it the intention that Members of this House will serve on that committee?  It certainly would be appropriate if they were given an opportunity to serve.  I welcome the decision to reconstitute the committee.  We will press for the quick implementation of matters mentioned yesterday in relation to assisting the victims of crime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call from Senator Ryan that we have a debate on the famine in Africa and the Third World generally.  I had an experience recently <Col N="798" /> which, with the Chair's permission, I would be glad to mention.  Even though we have such splendid organisations as Concern, World Mercy, Gorta, Trócaire and various other organisations helping the Third World not enough money is collected or goes there.  I had an experience recently where I was approached by a nun from a far distant place and she was looking for help.  She was a doctor and wanted medical supplies.  We brought her to the Department but she did not qualify under the rules that existed.  To my great surprise, satisfaction and joy, I was told by the civil servant I was dealing with that, as civil servants, they had set up a special fund where so much was taken from their income, to meet projects such as this one which were worthy and worthwhile but still did not qualify for aid.  I thank the Chair for giving me an opportunity to mention that. At times we all complain about the faceless men in the Departments but in this case the faceless men were doing more than people might think they would do for the Third World.</P>

      <P>Is the Leader surprised to find me, a Dublin politician running in the local elections, supporting Senator O'Keeffe's plea for a debate on regional imbalance?  This certainly will not get me any votes in the local elections in Dublin.  I agree with Senator O'Keeffe. Centralisation in this country has gone much too far.  We are the most centralised country in Europe.  There is nothing in the recent local government Bill or any other legislation to suggest there is a trend in the opposite direction.  Would the Leader of the House agree that we could have a debate not only on the disaster that it may cause in Senator O'Keeffe's area but also on the disaster that it is causing in our capital city where the quality of life is deteriorating considerably? Moving a few civil servants around the country is not decentralisation. We should have a debate on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Senators, including Senator Doyle, raised the question of a foreign affairs committee.  I can only repeat what I have said before: my information is that this committee is <Col N="804" /> being formed.  I have asked, and I am hopeful that there will be Seanad representation on that committee.  A number of Senators asked for a debate, as did Senator Manning last week, on developments in the EC.  There was some criticism of me in connection with that matter which was unfair.  If one examines the record over the past number of months one will find that we had a number of debates on foreign affairs.  We had a debate on the Middle East, on Sudan and we had a debate twice on the Gulf.  The other House was clamouring for a second debate but they had only one.  We had a debate on eastern Europe. We had a debate on agriculture twice and that has a clear EC dimension.  If anything, I have been over-helpful in arranging for such debates.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole queried the Order of Business, as did others, and asked about topical issues.  I repeat what I said: if the rules are changed I will abide by them but I must live within the rules as they are.  Senator Costello asked about the postal dispute.  We were first into the race with a debate on that matter.  We had a debate and had the Minister present months ago long before the other House debated the issue.  The Senator also raised the matter of debates on topical issues and a foreign affairs committee which I have dealt with.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Reilly asked for a debate on EC affairs and, in particular, the situation after 1992.  In regard to the debate on EC affairs and noting developments in the EC, as was mentioned last week by Senator Manning, I am hopeful we will have a debate on that matter next Thursday. Obviously all matters that were referred to by Senators Hourigan, Naughten and others about agriculture and the EC can be raised.  It should be a lively debate and I am looking forward to it.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy queried the establishment of a foreign affairs committee as did Senator McDonald.  I note what Senator Ryan said on the Child Care Bill. He also asked for a debate on South Africa I accept that it is important but I have no plans for such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> Senator Neville asked about item No. 8.  I have no plan to take that.  Senator Harte asked about An Post and a debate on the Third World.  I have indicated my response on that.  In so far as Senator Mooney's point is concerned, I have not seen any report of the Anglo-Irish tier. It is obviously something that would interest us all.  I will investigate it and report back to him.  I have noted Senator Norris's comments in regard to item No. 8.  He asked about the legislation which is referred to in item No. 17.  I will endeavour to do what I can to have that legislation initiated in this House, if at all possible.  I have no plans for a debate on item No. 54.  Senator E. Ryan referred to South Africa.  I will do something about a debate on that as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave asked about the University of Limerick (Dissolution of Thomond College) Bill.  That Bill as I indicated on the Order of Business, will be debated from 8 o'clock to 10 o'clock this evening.  If we find that at 9.30 p.m., for example, Second Stage is completed we will move on to Committee Stage if the House agrees.  That is what I have in mind.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave asked about legislation for next week.  That is a long way off but on Thursday we will have an EC debate and either the Fisheries Bill or the Sea Pollution Bill on Wednesday.  He also asked about other legislation.  The Competition Bill is coming to us and Environmental Protection Agency will be with us in July and we will have at least two days on Report Stage on the Environmental Protection Agency. Senator Hanafin asked about a debate on South Africa and he also asked about an education debate.  We had the Minister here a number of times.  She was here two weeks ago and we had what I regard as an exhaustive debate on education.  I do not intend to ask her to come into the House for some time yet.</P>
    <P>I noted Senator O'Keeffe's point which was not relevant and neither was Senator Hederman's point regarding regional imbalance.  I have no proposal for a debate on that matter.  Neither have I a <Col N="806" /> proposal for a debate on the disadvantaged areas mentioned by Senator Hourigan.  He also mentioned health.  I have not given any assurance of a debate on health.  I try my very best to honour any commitment I give but I have not indicated there will be a debate on health at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim ath-fháilte roimh an tAire.  Tá an tír ag feitheamh leis an mBille seo le dóthain ama anois agus ba chóir dúinn críoch a chur leis inniu.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 80 arises from a curious exception in section 56.  Let me remind the House that Part VIII of the Bill deals with children's residential centres. I understand from what I have read and what the Minister said at an earlier stage that Part VIII represents a considerable extension of the original intention of this Bill in response to wide cross-party support for the need to regulate children's residential centres.  That is to be welcomed in the spirit in which the debate on the Bill has been dealt with, at least in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am worried that the debate on children's residential centres which took place in the other House focused so much on the desirable prescriptions for registration &mdash; I do not want to go over the registration again &mdash; but it introduced a requirement to register a process of refusal of registration, process of appeal etc.  The whole Part, as it is now, is, in its philosophical intent, most welcome, the problem is that we are into the area of <Col N="807" /> the unreal use of language which characterises legislation in that in section 56 the definition of a children's residential centre is &ldquo;any home or other institution for the residential care of children in the care of health boards or other children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.&rdquo;  That would seem to any reasonable person a perfectly reasonable definition except that it goes on and lists a series of exclusions from (a) to (e), for example &ldquo;(a) any institution managed by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government or a health board,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Some of the other exclusions have perhaps some rationale and I appreciate that there are certain institutions managed by the State which perhaps should not come under the definition of a children's residential centre.  However, if children are to be taken into care under the provisions of this legislation and go into a residential centre which is run by a health board they should, by law, be entitled to precisely the same protection as children in institutions that are not run by a Minister or the health board.  It is important, for instance, to point out that the recent terrifying report produced in Britain dealt with what happened in an institution run by the social services in the area.  It was not a private institution.  It was not run by anybody else other than the State.</P>
    <P>The trouble with Part VIII as it stands is that there is no provision for the Minister to set standards for residential children's centres owned by the State.  It is interesting that in the previous Part which dealt with pre-school services there is specific provision in section 54 for the Minister to make regulations about securing &ldquo;the health, safety and welfare and promoting the development of children who attend pre-school services provided by health boards&rdquo;.  I cannot understand why it is right that, on the one hand, we should have regulations which would ensure that the standard of service provided in health board pre-school services would be of an acceptable standard and yet have no equivalent provision under Part VIII.  I can understand the difficulty of health boards registering <Col N="808" /> their own residential centres but there ought to be a clear and explicit obligation to maintain the same standards when the services are run by a health board.</P>
    <P>My amendment is an attempt to respond to that.  In order to avoid wasting time I accept that my amendment is defective and I will not push it.  It is by way of a holding operation to invite a response.  It registers the need to include residential services run by the State under equivalent provisions to those that apply to services run by the private sector.  I accept that it would be impossible to regulate some of the institutions as many of them are hospitals and would need to meet much more stringent standards than those that would be imposed on a children's residential centre.  The basic problem seems to be to ensure that we will not have two different standards of care. I do not think that is the intention but the legislation should make clear, as it does with the pre-school services, that two different standards of service will not apply to the private and the public sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment on the grounds that it is so important in all realms of human activity that State institutions set a headline for the rest of society and that headline must be seen to exist.  I am a great believer in requesting all sectors involved in child care, pre-school and after-school services to meet the highest and strictest obligations in the best interests of infants. Consequently, it is doubly important that we match that request to those private institutions with a commitment on the part of the State to have the highest standards. I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment. It is invidious to make provision for the registration of certain residential <Col N="809" /> centres for children and then in the same breath to exclude other areas where children are detained, are taken into custody or are in institutional care.  That is at the nub of the matter.  It is a very welcome development to see the provisions in section 58 on the conditions for registration of children's residential centres and it is most unwelcome then to see the extent of the exclusions that are introduced in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of section 56.  I am also not happy with the provisions for supervision of pre-school service, because there is no provision for registration.</P>
      <P>The Bill would have been much improved if we could also have put a responsibility on the Minister for Education not just to make regulations in the context of securing the health, safety and welfare of children, but also in ensuring that these schools were registered.  It is one of the scandals of this country that there is no registration whatsoever for pre-school centres.  Anyone can establish a centre and it is not subject to monitoring or regulation.</P>

      <P>The registration should be right across the board.  Of course, registration and the terms for registration are specified at primary and second level but instead of having it limited we should extend it.  Section 56, specifically excludes areas because they are under the direct control of the Minister, a health board or the terms of the Children Act, 1908.  These are invidious exclusions, I would be interested in hearing what the Minister has to say as to why it was decided there should not be specific conditions for registration and criteria set up which would be on a par with what is listed in section 58.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the amendment.  I believe that Senator Ryan has followed the method he employed the last day, at least to my satisfaction, of unveiling inconsistency, when he places <Col N="810" /> section 56 with section 54 where the Minister already intervenes to regulate homes operated by health boards in the case of the pre-school area.  It seems to me that there is a question of consistency here.  It is important that there be a level playing field.  I am a little concerned that a number of the groups excluded here are among the most vulnerable.</P>
      <P>I know Senator Ryan said that it was appropriate in some way to exclude institutions but I am not so sure that is the case.  My argument would be that one presumes all institutions for the care of children with acute illness, the mentally handicapped and so on, would already be required to meet the minimum standards laid down in this Bill and go considerably further and because they are already required perhaps under other instruments, or should be required under other instruments, to meet the minimum requirements laid down in this Bill, then that cuts away any reason for excluding them.</P>
      <P>I would point out that among the institutions referred to there is a mental institution within the meaning of the Mental Treatment Acts, 1945-1966.  Our view of mental illness and of the appropriate methods of treatment of mental illness have changed very radically since 1945, and certainly even since 1966.  If there is a discrepancy I assume the discrepancy operates in the way I said and that these institutions already meet the requirements laid down in this Bill.  If they do not, then it is high time they did.  I would put in an aside here, that we have been waiting for a very long time for a mental health Act to be brought forward in the Oireachtas.  Perhaps the Minister might use his good offices to ensure that such a measure does emerge.</P>

      <P>Before we concluded the debate on the Bill last week, I explained the background to this part of the Bill and in particular the fact that under existing law there is no requirement on a religious community or other body who propose to establish a residential home for children to seek <Col N="811" /> approval or recognition from a health board or from the Minister for Health. At the special committee of the Dáil there was unanimous agreement that it should not be lawful for any person or body to operate a home for children unless it is registered with the local health board.  The Bill was then amended to give effect to the desire of Deputies that a registration system for these homes be set in place.</P>
      <P>I would now like to deal with the specific points raised by Senator Ryan in amendment No. 80 and the other contributions about the list of homes and other institutions that will not be subject to the system of registration we are setting up here.  Paragraph (a) deals with institutions managed by or on behalf of the Government or a health board.  These have been excluded because it would make no sense to have institutions run by the Government or by a health board subject to registration and inspection by a health board, perhaps the same health board.  I do not understand how one could register oneself, inspect oneself and verify and vouch for oneself.  It would be illogical and impractical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan certainly did, not alone today but last week.  I have made this point on several occasions during the debate particularly in this House and indeed in the other House and on Committee.  We cannot take any section of this Bill in isolation, we must look at the overall Bill.  Senator Honan mentioned this earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Homes run by health boards will instead be subject to regulations to be made under section 37 (3) and will be liable to inspections by officers of the Minister for Health under section 66.  It is important that we note that.  Paragraph (b) refers to hospitals and similar institutions. Paragraph (c) refers to centres for mentally and physically handicapped children.  These institutions are being excluded from the registration system <Col N="812" /> because it would not make sense to have children's hospitals and centres for handicapped children subject to statutory registration while all other hospitals and centres dealing with handicapped adults are not subject to similar controls.  As the House is aware, there are differing views as to whether centres for the handicapped should be subject to this type of State control.  I do not think it would be realistic to attempt to resolve this difficult and contentious issue in the context of this Bill particularly at such a late stage in its progress through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d) refers to certain mental treatment institutions.  Paragraph (e) refers to certain industrial and reformatory schools.  These are already subject to statutory control under other legislation and it is not necessary to subject them to a second layer of statutory control under this Bill.  I hope this clarifies the reasons for the various exclusions.</P>
    <P>I am very grateful to Senator Ryan for the very positive attitude he has adopted in indicating he is prepared to withdraw this amendment.  I trust the information that I put before the House puts the matter in context and shows that where the health boards have a specific role they will have that role and where the health boards have another specific role <i>vis-à-vis</i> other caring situations the Department of Health and their inspectorate will be the people to ensure that they, as the subsidiary body, live up to the proper standards we all wish to achieve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we have arrived at the stage of whether it is being pressed or not.  It is not for the first time the Minister and I are perhaps more at one than myself and some of my colleagues on this Bill.  I am not arguing with anybody but there is an anomaly, namely, the exclusion.  The exclusion is not of a similar kind to the exclusion for the pre-school services.  Let me read out what is said about the pre-school services.  These are pre-school services run by the health board under section 54, which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="813" /> The Minister may after consultation with the Minister for Education and the Minister for the Environment, make regulations for the purpose of securing the health, safety and welfare and promoting the development of children.'...</P>
    <P>That is four things, health, safety, welfare and promoting the development.  That is for pre-school services.  The regulations the Minister will introduce for the children's residential centres will be even more detailed.  Under section 60 the regulations are that the Minister shall for the purpose of ensuring proper standards, adequate and suitable accommodation, food and care for children while being maintained in centres and the proper conduct of centres, make such regulations. Then they are to prescribe requirements as to the maintenance, care and welfare of children while being maintained in the centres to prescribe requirements as to the numbers, qualifications and availability of members of the staff.</P>
    <P>There are also to prescribe requirements as to the design, maintenance, repair, cleaning and cleanliness, ventilation, heating and lighting of centres, prescribe requirements as to the accommodation, including the amount of space in bedrooms, washing facilities and sanitary conveniences provided in the centres, prescribe requirements as to the food provided for children while being maintained, etc.  Quite rightly, this is enormous and important detail about children's residential centres.</P>
    <P>The regulations the Minister has to introduce will, by law, be greater in detail than those to deal with pre-school services. I am not arguing about that.  If you go back then to section 37, which Senator Honan quite rightly addressed, you have is, by comparison, an extraordinarily week section.  It states:</P>
    <P>The Minister shall make regulations with respect to the conduct of homes or other premises provided by health boards under this section and for securing the welfare of children maintained therein.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" /> Can somebody explain to me why we need the detail of section 54 to deal with pre-school services provided by health boards, the even greater detail of section 60 to deal with children's residential centres provided by non-health board agencies and then the vague, almost aspirational generality of section 37 to deal with children's residential centres? That is the nub of the issue.</P>
    <P>The nub of the issue is not my amendment. It is the apparent deliberate refusal to go into detail about the standards of centres run by health boards which are children's residential centres.  The Minister, so far, has not explained to me why that is, why there should be this vague statement of aspiration in section 37 by contrast with the detail in section 54. Section 37 simply refers to:</P>
    <P>... regulations with respect to the conduct of homes and other premises provided by health boards under this section and for securing the welfare of children maintained therein.</P>
    <P>It does not even say anything about the Minister making regulations about the physical accommodation, the sleeping arrangements, the quality of heating or of food.  Why will children's residential centres provided by health boards not have that detail in the regulations?  Why is it not in the law that those things should be contained by the regulations?  It sounds &mdash; I say this without wanting to get into a confrontational situation &mdash; like cutting corners for the health boards.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of detail specified in section 60.  I cannot understand why the law about health board pre-school services is more explicit and more precise than the law about children's residential centres provided by health boards.  I cannot understand why that distinction was made and I invite the Minister to clarify the matter for me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure I may diverge from Senator Ryan but I agree with him on this.  It is all about standards.  Perhaps I misunderstood the issue.  Senator Ryan indicated he was talking about standards. I believe that is what it is about.  I am <Col N="815" /> a little worried because it seems to be parallel to the situation in which local authorities, for example, are exempt from their own planning regulations.  The local authority engaging in development, do not have to seek planning permission to engage in such development.  I have always felt that was wrong and led to abuse, or could lead to abuse in certain circumstances.  I again return to the point that many of the groups here are the most vulnerable groups in our society.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to spell out, for example, what lies behind paragraph (e) which is industrial schools.  In this country industrial schools have a history that is by no means unblemished and I certainly would like to be reassured that minimum standards were observed in such institutions. I am interested and heartened by what I think was a certain degree of movement from the Minister with regard to paragraph (c) and (d) because he suggested that perhaps there was a view with regard to the facilities and to the need to regulate facilities for mentally handicapped persons, particularly children and so on but that perhaps this was not the correct place in which to embark on such an exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case there is any doubt whatever in the House, I have the greatest respect for the people who engage in the care of mentally and physically handicapped children.  The Minister mentioned the fact that in preparing this section his attention was drawn to the fact that there were certain religious orders and so on who were apparently excluded from registration under the legislation as it existed and that this part of the legislation, as currently framed, will bring them in.  I welcome that but I have to say I am aware of the remarkable and wonderful work that is done by many religious orders in caring for the most profoundly mentally and physically handicapped people in this State, including children.  Like all citizens of this country I am grateful to them for this remarkable work.  This does not, however, mean that they should not be subject to control and I welcome the fact <Col N="816" /> that they may come in under this legislation. I reiterate it is a question of standards, of ensuring that all such facilities meet the required minimum standards.</P>

      <P>I was not here on the last occasion.  Unfortunately I was not allowed to be in the House.  I am particularly interested in this legislation and I would obviously like to hear what the Minister has to say in this area.  This section is of the utmost importance. Senator Ryan is teasing out the whole area of the criteria and the standards in terms of children's residential centres.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that the purpose of this section, is to deal with the residential children's centres which were not previously registered.  They were the institutions that were under the control of the religious communities.  If that is the case, surely the argument is sound that if we are specifying the conditions, the criteria and the standards that have now to be maintained in this area &mdash; an area that was previously outside registration because they were under religious control &mdash; by the State in any of its centres where children are taken into care they should be of an equal standing?  Whether that refers to a certified school which deals with children in a different fashion as distinct from promoting their welfare so to speak, surely, basic standards should be prescribed across the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about standards and rigid regulations to ensure that children are treated in a humane and a sensitive fashion.  However they come into the care of an institution, an arm of the Government or of a health board would this not be the opportunity for the Minister to ensure that the standards are maintained at a minimum level across the board? This is the concern that is being expressed <Col N="817" /> here.  The Minister asked why should you have a health board registering itself and monitoring itself as that is its function. Implicit in it are the standards, the specified conditions of section 58 and particularly section 60, the regulations in relation to children's residential centres. In order to be registered these are the criteria that must be met.  It is not the registration <i>per se</i> that we are interested in; it is the content of the criteria and the standards that make up the requirements to enable registration to take place.  It is disappointing that there should be a specific exclusion of other institutions which are equally concerned with the welfare of youngsters even though they have arrived in those institutions through a different route.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, we must acknowledge that we have rules and regulations <i>vis-à-vis</i> existing centres and anything involving health boards.  There are clear regulations and guidelines.  Not alone that, we have the system in position that we can impose existing regulations, new regulations, extra regulations or changed regulations quickly with control through the Department of Health on the various health boards.</P>
      <P>On the matter of private residential centres, they must get some indication, some advance notice, of the type of standards we expect and the type of regulations we will be considering.  This is why section 60 is so detailed and expicit.  On the pre-school situation we are taking these in under control for the first time. There has to be a difference.  Senators can be absolutely certain we want the State standards to be the highest possible. We can impose them quickly and we want to make sure that the rest come in tandem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no effort to exclude health board institutions or State institutions from these standards.  We must acknowledge they have a specific role in particular areas of activity, whether it is the psychiatric area, in a special hospital area, the mentally handicapped or physically handicapped area.  We cannot impose standards and regulations through this <Col N="818" /> Bill that would be in conflict with existing roles and that is the reason for their exclusion.  There is no ulterior motive in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not quite yet.  I do not want to be repetitious but this issue, as we are pursuing it now, is different from last week.  The Minister makes a very plausible case, as he has done on many issues in this Bill, and as he knows himself he has persuaded me on at least a few occasions to change my mind.  On this one he says, for instance, that there is no need to go into detail about health boards because of the powers the Department of Health have to make things happen quickly whereas section 60 is considerably detailed because of the fact that private agencies are involved.  Why does he need to go into more detail about pre-school services run by health boards than about children's residential centres run by health boards?  I do not understand why he needs more detail in section 54 then he needs in section 37.</P>
      <P>My amendment is simply a vehicle to raise the issue.  I am quite certain if health boards are registering their own centres you will have challengers in the courts very quickly from private individuals claiming that they were not getting fair treatment.  Why is there a difference between section 54 and section 37 in the detail there?  I do not understand that. That seems to raise the question of different standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I take what the Minister said that there was no deliberate intention in terms of excluding the institutions there, that there were different standards there than those now being specified.  The point we are making is that this would be the opportunity to ensure that the standards would be updated so that you would have a common set of standards for all those taken into care, whether in private or public care.  What is the reason for not extending the cover prescribed in section 60 to all the areas listed in <Col N="819" /> paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e)? What is the argument for not updating that and thereby amending the requirements that exist in relation, for example, to certified schools at present?  This legislation can resolve that.</P>

      <P>The health boards do not run pre-school services.  They have a function in the running of pre-school services but they do not run them themselves. If there is a need in a particular area the health board may run pre-school services; this is an enabling section.  This is why it is framed differently to that in section 37, where the system is already in position.  Overall, we do not want a diminution of standards.  We want an improvement of standards, we want standardisation of standards.  Senators can be absolutely certain that in any regulations drawn up the same type of regulations will be applicable right across the board irrespective of whether the services are run by a private group, by the health board or by some other body on behalf of the State.  There will be a standardisation of regulations and our goal will be to ensure that the regulations and standards are equal right across the board and maintained to strict criteria.  We must take into account that in certain circumstances there are other criteria governed by other Acts and by other services where we cannot just say &ldquo;this is the standard regulation for this service&rdquo; and ignore the other role or area of service that would be given by that same institution. This is why there must be some difference.</P>

      <P>I will discuss amendment No. 88 with amendment No. 87.</P>
      <P>Section 63 provides for the introduction of a pension scheme for the staff of the 40 or so children's residential centres around the country.  This has long been sought by the staff concerned and by their trade unions and associations.  I am anxious to bring the pension scheme into operation as soon as possible after the Bill is enacted.  The section, as now drafted, will serve to delay the introduction of the pension scheme.  This is because the existing paragraph (c) provides that the scheme will only apply to centres that are registered under this Part.  Obviously it will take some time to set up the new registration procedures and to make the necessary regulations for the purposes of this Part.  As the section is now drafted, the pension scheme could not be introduced until all those preparations have been completed.  As I said, I am anxious to avoid any delay and I propose the deletion of the existing paragraph (c) to enable this section to be brought into operation in advance of the other provisions of this Part.  It will be brought into operation by ministerial order under section 1 (2) as soon as possible after this Bill is enacted.</P>

      <P>A significant omission is being introduced by the amendment and <Col N="823" /> that is that the section applies to a residential centre which is registered as a children's residential centre in accordance with this Part.  That has been omitted and that would be the only sector where there is registration in the context of the specified criteria, regulations and standards as stated in section 60.  Will the Minister be more explicit as to when he expects the section to apply fully to this sector also?</P>

      <P>We are being fairly explicit.  We are talking about the 40 or so children's residential centres we have taken over in the last number of years. The staff have been seeking this for a long time and when the Bill is passed the Minister will decide the necessary orders as soon as we have everything in position to proceed.  We are very committed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>For two reasons, first, because I did not want to waste time and, secondly, because I did not get a chance to go through them, I am disappointed all the regulations under this Bill will be in a form which will not require the assent of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Normally in legislation as complex as this, <Col N="824" /> with much of the regulatory material being of enormous significance, the drafters of the legislation identify certain areas which would be more appropriately dealt with by a positive vote of both Houses of the Oireachtas being necessary to introduce them.  In all the regulations under this Bill approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas will not be needed.  Only a negative vote can prevent them from being implemented which suggests that they are fairly routine regulations.  It is clear that many of the regulations in this Bill are not routine and I am disappointed that the distinction was not made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ryan.  It would certainly be better if we had the more positive presentation of the regulations before the House so that we could debate them and seek to amend or change them because they are of considerable substance.  I refer particularly to section 54 which involves the Ministers for Health, Education and the Environment. There is a great deal of consultation involved in relation to health, safety and welfare.  Therefore, many of the regulations could well benefit from a perusal by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are adhering here to the normal position.  Where regulations have to be made which create some change of emphasis or something like that, the Minister or Department involved may have to bring them back to the Houses of the Oireachtas for sanction. We will be positive at all times and it is normal for the Minister to make the regulations.  Of course, they will be publicly available if anybody wants to raise any questions on them at any time. We want to proceed with the making of the regulations as quckly as possible to ensure that the Bill can be enacted rapidly.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 67 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe in a free national health service.  Therefore, I want to record my dissent at the idea of charges being imposed for any service proposed by a health board.  I will not delay the House with a long argument about it. Most people whose children will need the services provided under this, or who will avail of the services provided under the sections referred to, will be poor.  This provision has been inserted because of some obscure individual in the Department of Finance carrying on the crusade of the Department of Finance about eliminating everything that people get without having to pay for it.  Therefore, I want to register my objection to the idea of charging people, for instance, for the use of health board-provided child care services or pre-school services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Likewise, I register my objection to section 67 which makes provision for charges being decided at the discretion of the health board as to when and how they may be imposed.  We are talking about a Child Care Bill and there are special provisions in the Constitution where the State has responsibility for the imprescriptible rights of the child as it is stated in the Bill.  It is singularly inappropriate that there should be provision for charges, or for the care of children to be made conditional on charges being made by individuals, the parents or This is a most undesirable element in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section enables a health board to impose charges in respect of certain services provided under this Bill.  It is not envisaged that charges will be imposed in the vast majority of cases since most children in care and families who avail of child care and family support services come from the lower socio-economic groups.  We must take into account <Col N="826" /> the fact that one cannot have a bald solution for every eventuality.  There may be wealthy families where there is an estrangement between spouses and so on and where a child may not be aware of a trust fund or a decision taken in its favour that would allow major accumulation of resources.  Due to domestic difficulties in that family perhaps the various benefits conferred by the State over the years could be transferred to improve facilities in that home or to further improve State services.  It will only apply in certain eventualities, because in the vast majority of cases it would be illogical and impractical to impose any charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my fault, neither was it the fault of these benches that the Order of Business took a long time.  So far on this Bill I have not blamed this Minister for anything, so he should not invite my wrath.  I may well end up blaming him for this because if he is right that the vast majority of the parents of the children who will use the services provided under sections 34 and 54 will not be able to pay, what is the point of imposing a means test on everybody in order to catch 5 per cent of the parents? Unless the health boards have the usual clever trick of using a standardised means test everybody will undergo a means test to catch 5 per cent of parents unless the medical card qualification is the criterion. To suggest that every parent who is not entitled to a medical card would somehow be a fit target for a debt which can be in force in any court of competent jurisdiction as subsection (5) says, is going a long way beyond the tiny minority because any working person on the average male industrial wage will in most cases be well outside the income limit for <Col N="827" /> a medical card.  There is a catch in this. If the means test will be as benign as the Minister suggests and apply to such a small minority then it should be there because it will cost more to administer than it will generate in revenue.  Otherwise it will be the medical card, in which case it will catch many people, the majority of whom will be relatively badly off.  We cannot have it both ways, it is one or the other.</P>

      <P>I will keep my remarks purely to the amendment.  We have a free education system and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> on which I congratulated the Minister for Education not so long ago for her contribution to it extending free education to the age of 18 years.  It ended at 17 years old until recently.  Now there will be a six year cycle in our schools and a free system. Certainly we do not want to go back to the situation in education whereby parents were means tested.  It is a basic right. Health is also a basic right for children. We are now extending the area of the service and the promotion of the welfare of children from the age of 16 to 18.  It would be proper to synchronise health and education as the basic rights for the <Col N="828" /> development of children and, therefore, we should not have a means test.  I do not want to go into the whole question of the administration of it and where the cut-off point would be and so on.  The basic constitutional right is that children should have the right to health and education up to the same level.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 69 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="829" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware, as the Minister is of the time constraints but I have written beside section 69 &ldquo;wow&rdquo; with an exclamation mark beside it because of the sweeping nature of the provisions of section 69.  Section 69 extends the powers of a chief executive officer of a health board to any function in respect to a decision as to whether to provide a service and make facilities available and to any function in respect to a decision about recovering a charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an extraordinary extension of the powers of the chief executive officer. It deserves at least to be justified <i>vis-àvis</i> the fact that the health board is supposed to be a democratic body.  I am fascinated by subsection (d) which states &ldquo;any function in relation to the payment of a grant or allowance to a voluntary body...&rdquo; Does that mean that the health board members will have no say in the allocation of grants to bodies?  My experience of health boards is that the members tend to be much more responsibe to voluntary organisations than, in some cases, to some senior officials.  Most large organisations, not just health boards, have a way of dealing with many senior officials which would not encourage enthusiasm on the part of the laity if they had to deal with them.  Any function in relation to the supervision of pre-school services is fair enough but what about sub-paragraph (i) where it states &ldquo;any other functions as may be prescribed&rdquo;? Will the Minister tell us the limit of other functions that may be prescribed? Section 69 (1) states &ldquo;The following functions relating to a health board shall be functions of the chief executive officer ...&rdquo;, it goes on to list them and at the bottom sub-paragraph (i) states &ldquo;such other functions as may be prescribed&rdquo;.  Does that mean if the Minister wishes he can make everything in this Bill a function of the chief executive officer, or what is the limit?  This again is the classic apparent unwillingness to draft legislation that binds both sides. Essentially this means that anything the Minister may conclude and which, perhaps, needs to be done differently, can be handed over to the chief executive <Col N="830" /> officer without approval from anybody.  I find that astonishing.  We do not need sub-paragraph (i).</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to hear the Minister's views on this point.  I have a horror of giving more powers to chief executive officers of health boards.  I would like the Minister to explain this further because if some of the elected people of the health boards saw this section I am sure they would also have worries.  Will the Minister clear this point for Senator Ryan and some other Members because we sometimes see at first hand the use of the power they already have?  I would not like to see chief executive officers get greater power, if this is what the section means, without more people knowing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Ryan and Honan have put their fingers on a very relevant point.  The powers of the chief executive have to be clearly specified. It appears from this section that those powers are broad enough to cover everything and that health board members have no role whatsoever.  From a sweeping statement such as that contained in section 69 a chief executive officer can virtually decide unilaterally in relation to just about everything in the context of the care of children, where money is to go, supervision, registration and, of course, such other functions; the Minister may prescribe other functions as the case may be.  It is an enormous catch-all section which gives free rein to a chief executive officer to more or less do as he or she thinks fit without reference to the health board members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be a catch-all section but it has been a catch-all section for 21 years because it is virtually similar to the same section in the Health Act, 1970.  It is not intended that the various functions shall be performed by the chief executive officer personally.  By virtue of this section the chief executive officer will be able to avail of his powers under section 16 of the Health Act, 1970, to delegate any function assigned to him to <Col N="831" /> specified officers or classes of officers. The Minister is empowered to give directions to the health boards and to the chief executive officers in this connection.</P>
      <P>This section assigns resonsibility for various functions under the Bill to the staff of the health boards through the chief executive officer.  That is the position pertaining to local government.  Normally the manager carries out the functions as specified in law.  Through that enabling device he is able to transfer his powers to the relevant professionals and administrators who work for him.  Of course the members of the board will have clear functions to make binding decisions and the chief executive officer as the management head of the board will instruct his staff to carry out those decisions.  This is totally in line with the provision in the 1970 Health Act.  Otherwise we would have to specify exactly what every professional and administrator in a health board could do.  By doing that we might debar them from carrying out certain humane services that would be of vital necessity in the interests of children which would have to be done at very short notice and very quickly.  I do not think anybody would like that situation to prevail.</P>

      <P>I notice that the explanatory memorandum for this Bill, at least the one dated 1988, does not contain the normal explanatory and financial memorandum which was normally published with legislation in recent years.

      <P>The necessary resources and personnel for the administration of the legislation has been a concern expressed by professionals in the area both inside and outside this House.  There is nothing specific other than a three line reference to whatever may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance.  If we are going to update our child care services then we are talking about having the trained personnel and the facilities to administer the legislation.  There may well be recruitment requirements in this area.  There are support services for families by implication in the area, there are minimum standards which obviously will require certain resources and finances to ensure that there is an upgrading for the existing residential centres.  It seems to be legislation that will require substantial funding and it certainly will require a more formal statement in relation to expenses than what we have here.</P>

We were dealing with technicalities earlier but I deliberately refrained from contributing to allow us to get to Report Stage, which is important.  I want to put on record my party's concern in the area of financial support for this Bill.  It was my party's view &mdash; and it remains our view &mdash; that the entire <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the costings and the budgetary provisions therein, are questionable and events since then indicate our correctness about that.  I am concerned that there <Col N="833" /> may not be adequate moneys to enact the Bill and I am concerned that it is not clear that such money will be there.  There is nothing explicit about that.  The Bill will not work unless there is a major financial injection.  I am concerned about the whole organisation of our national finances at the moment.  I genuinely doubted the validity of the whole financial projections from the very outset this year and unfortunately I have been proved to be correct.</P>

      <P>I would like to allay the fears in relation to section 70 as it is an enabling section.  It is an admission that it will cost money to provide the services contained in the Bill, that the State through the Exchequer, will be responsible for the provision of those moneys; there is a further mandatory and legal implication that they shall be paid for out of the Exchequer and that they shall not be dependent on irregular allocations of funding at the discretion of anybody, a Minister, a Department or a health board.  The cost of running child care services will come from the Exchequer and will be included in the annual budget.  Our commitment was shown this year when in the 1991 budget the Minister for Finance, at our request in anticipation of the Bill being passed, provided for the first time in the history of the State advance funding in the event of the Bill becoming law.  A sum of £1 million was allocated, proof positive of our commitment.  Section 70 will ensure that the taxpayers' money will be used in the interests of our children.</P>

The subsection refers to any substance &mdash; a member of the Garda Síochána may seize any substance which is in the possession of a child; the amendment deletes &ldquo;misused&rdquo; and puts in its place &ldquo;inhaled&rdquo;.  Would it not be more appropriate to have &ldquo;consumed or inhaled&rdquo; in that it refers to any substance?

It appears to me &mdash; I could be wrong &mdash; that what it is actually <Col N="835" /> saying is that if somebody under 18 supplies somebody else with a substance, a solvent, than other in the course of business they are somehow being exempted from the provisions of this.  I would not be keen on this.</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) means that it would not be an offence for a group of youngsters to pass solvents to one another to sniff.  This is achieved by making it a defence for a person to show that that he was under 18 and was not acting in the course of a business. However, if he were acting in the course of a business &mdash; for example, as a shop assistant &mdash; he would be guilty of an offence.  This is to prevent shop assistants, shopkeepers, or staff in general merchant premises from circumventing subsection (1) by having solvents sold by persons under 18 &mdash; in other words, they could not employ a person under 18 behind the counter and say &ldquo;You can sell away to that group over there&rdquo; and then claim he was under 18.  By moving it from that arena to the other arena we have the offence.</P>

      <P>What is the thinking behind not making it an offence for kids to pass potentially very dangerous solvents to each other with a view to abusing them?  I do not understand the objective of not making it an offence.

The second point is that we cannot in law <Col N="836" /> criminalise the offence of passing a substance around, but we can make it an offence for somebody to supply it, to sell it, to make it available.  We do not want a situation that a person under 18 behind the counter acting for their master can claim immunity from the law by saying that they are under 18, that they could pass it even though they were getting commercial gain for their master for it.</P>

      <P>The original version of section 18 (4) was the subject of a great deal of discussion in the Dáil and I brought forward amendments on Report Stage to deal with the concerns that had been expressed about it.  Subsection (4) as it stands provides that where a health board applies for a care order and the <Col N="841" /> court is satisfied that it is not necessary or appropriate to make a care order, but that it is desirable that the child be visited in his home by the health board the court may instead make a supervision order.  I am firmly of the view that this is perfectly sensible provision.  It will ensure that where the evidence of the circumstances of the case was not sufficient to justify the making of a full care order, the court will still have discretion to grant a supervision order in appropriate cases.  I do not accept the suggestion made by some commentators that this provision would be used as a safe option by the courts and the result would be that health boards would have to settle for supervision orders in circumstances in which a care order is what is required.  Over the last few years in particular the courts have developed a great deal of expertise in dealing with child care matters.</P>
      <P>I have every confidence in the experience and expertise of the Judiciary to weigh up the evidence before them and to decide on the most appropriate type of order in the particular circumstances of the case.  In any event, it is important to bear in mind that if it becomes clear that the supervision order is not working or that it is insufficient to ensure that the child is properly cared for and protected there is nothing to prevent the health board returning to court within days or weeks if necessary with a fresh application for a care order.  In view of what I have said, I ask Senator Costello to review the situation and perhaps he might be good enough to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment amazes me, particularly as the phrase in question was inserted in the Bill on Report Stage in the Dáil with the full agreement of all sides of the House.  The purpose of the provision is simply to enable the court to make a supervision order during the period when an application for a care order is being considered. As the House will appreciate, it may take a few weeks before a decision on a care order is reached.  This provision enables the court to place the child temporarily under the supervision of the health board in the meantime.  This is a useful provision which we should retain in the Bill.  In view of this I would not be able to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage I was urged by a number of Senators to look into the possibility of bringing forward an amendment on Report Stage to provide for the appointment of guardians <i>ad litem</i> for children in care proceedings. I have examined the matter in detail.  I had several consultations with the Attorney General, the Minister for Health, officials in the Department of Health and they, in turn, with officials in the Attorney's office.  I sincerely thank everybody who has been of such assistance to me with this Bill but particularly with this section.  I have come to the conclusion that such a provision would have much to commend it.  Accordingly, I am pleased to bring forward this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) will empower a court, in proceedings under Part IV and VI of <Col N="844" /> the Bill, to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i> for the child in any case when the court considers it necessary to do so in the interest of the child.  Subsection (2) provides that the expenses of a guardian <i>ad litem</i> shall be paid by the health board involved in the proceedings.  Subsection (3) will entitle the health board to apply to the court for an order requiring the expenses of the guardian <i>ad litem</i> to be paid by any other party to the proceedings. Subsection (4) provides that an order appointing a guardian <i>ad litem</i> for a child shall cease to have effect where the child subsequently becomes a party to the proceedings.  The detailed provisions regarding guardians <i>ad litem</i> will be dealt with by way of rules of court.  I am advised that it is not necessary to provide for this in the legislation itself.</P>
    <P>I am sure that this amendment will be welcomed by all sides of the House.  I, for my part, have at all times been prepared to take on board any worthwhile proposals which would enhance the legal framework we are putting into place and I commend this amendment to the House.</P>

Subsequently I had discussions with the Minister and I am extremely grateful to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very significant step that we have taken today.  I am glad the Minister is prepared, after discussion with the Attorney General, to go through the stage of recommittal.  It shows that the Minister is very anxious to make this a very good Bill and to use this House as it should be used and take on board the amendments tabled.  None of us is being a dog in the manger.  The fact that this is a Government amendment rather than one that has my name on it is a matter of total indifference to me.  All I can say to the Minister is well done.  This will be a <Col N="845" /> much better Bill as a result of this.  The various organisations that gave me and other Senators meticulous briefings in this area will be very pleased indeed that the Minister has shown himself broad-minded and flexible enough to take on board this very good amendment.</P>

    <P>We had a long discussion less than an hour ago on the need to have considerably greater detail in terms of the ministerial regulations under section 37 to deal with children's residential centres. Having listened to the Minister and accepted that health boards should not regulate themselves, it appears the only way to deal with the children's residential centres under the control of health boards is to have the Minister responsible for the standards.  I am simply suggesting in this amendment that the Minister be required standards.  I am simply suggesting in this amendment that the Minister be required to prescribe the same sort of standards in the same areas for health board children's residential centres to those that are currently prescribed for non-health board children's residential centres.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. It is quite clear that in order to make it work and ensure standards are maintained the buck has to stop with somebody. In this case it is quite clear that the buck stops at the Minister's desk.  The Minister will be required to ensure that standards are maintained.  This helps the Minister to ensure that standards are determined and thereafter insisted upon.</P>

      <P>I add my support for this amendment.  We discussed it in detail about an hour ago as Senator Ryan indicated. We would like to see standards, criteria and regulations provided which <Col N="848" /> would standardise provisions for all centres whether they are private, public or under the aegis of the health board or a Minister.  This amendment would specify quite clearly that the Minister would take on responsibility for ensuring that suitable standards are laid down.  This would considerably enhance the provisions that are laid down for certain areas in child residential centres.</P>

I am at a slight disadvantage in that because of meeting a local delegation I missed the first few minutes of discussion on the amendment.

What is involved in subsection (d) in terms of space would seem sensible.  This amendment is worthwhile and sensible.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to insert an additional subsection in section 37 which spells out some of the matters that may be dealt with in the regulations.  It is based on provisions contained in section 60 (2).  I have already indicated that the regulations under section 37 will be broadly similar to those under section 60.  I am, therefore, prepared to accept the amendment but there is one slight error which might be <Col N="849" /> amended by agreement.  Perhaps, with the agreement of the Chair and the House, we could agree to change the second last line to read: &ldquo;any such records or of extracts therefrom by officers of the Minister&rdquo;.

      <P>One of the primary purposes of this section and of the regulations to be made by the Minister under it is to ensure that the long term interests of children in care are protected and promoted. Section 3 provides that in the performance of its functions under this legislation a health board must regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.  It follows from this that a health board, when reviewing the case of each individual child in its care, must taken into consideration the short term as well as the long term needs of the child.  Having regard to what I have said, I hope Senators will accept that the amendment is superfluous and that it will not be necessary to pursue it.

      <P>&ldquo;(3) A person who gives notice under subsections (1) and (2) shall include in such notice a statement that the service will be provided in accordance with the terms of sections 48 and 50 of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment I am not prepared to withdraw.  Amendment No. 16 deals with the process whereby people who are provided pre-school services are required to notify the health board.  The Minister will be aware that I took issue with my colleagues on this side of the House about the requirement of registration.  What I am concerned about is that whatever is done should work.  I did not think the process of registration as entered into last week was correct and I voted with the Government on the amendment &mdash; fortunately nobody noticed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister would have survived without it, however grateful he was.  The public need some assurance and I propose in this amendment that when a person is giving notice under subsections (1) and (2) of the section they must include in such a notice a statement that the service will meet the standards specified under section 48 and 50.  Section 48 is the section under which the Minister prescribes regulations and section 50 is a general statement of the duty to provide a service of an acceptable standard.  It seems reasonable that if anybody writes to the health board and say: &ldquo;I give notice that I am providing a pre-school service&rdquo; the person should say: &ldquo;I undertake to meet the standards specified in sections 48 and 50&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The idea behind this section was to take pre-schools out of garages, back gardens, back kitchens and various other unsuitable places and environments in which they were held until now.  There was a genuine concern at educational and social levels that people would comply with regulations.  All aspects of the Bill have been considered in great detail.  It would be ridiculous to allow it to fall at the final fence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whereas ignorance of the law is never an excuse in the eyes of the law it cannot assumed that people would go into this business without making themselves aware of the provisions of the Bill.  It is quite likely that people will say: &ldquo;That is a grand room and I will use it&rdquo; just as they have done until now.  The reality is, and precedent after precedent has proven the fact, that it takes an awareness of the law to change attitudes.  The equality legislation is a prime example.  People continued with their own process of appointments, etc., until they suddenly found a case was being brought against them.  Then they had to make themselves aware of the requirements of the law.  The same will happen with this legislation.  I do not believe that people setting up in this business will make themselves aware of what is required of them under sections 48 and 50 unless we require them to do <Col N="852" /> so.  This amendment requires them to check it out.</P>
    <P>The matter has been debated at length. I ask the Minister to accept this amendment as it is clearly in line with his own thinking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this because it emerged from the debate that we had on the question of notification versus registration, where Senator Ryan jumped ship and argued with the Government against the amendment I put down.  He has very skilfully excised for us the principle we were looking at that we should not allow the eruption of fly-by-night operations.  I am very happy that Senator Ryan has taken on board the principle of what I was arguing for.  I accept that my amendment was defective.  He has done what I would like him to do and I urge the Minister in a spirit of uncharacteristic humility to accept the correction to what we were trying to do earlier.</P>

Pre-school services are operating in an <i>ad hoc</i> way at present without proper monitoring or standards.  It would be excellent if we could tighten the provisions under section 49 (1) and (2), which is the reference to giving notice, tie it up with the registration requirements. This amendment would considerably enhance the provisions, ensure that the criteria are adhered to and the law is fully implemented.</P>

It could not apply to a person who is already carrying on a pre-school service and who is required to give notice under <Col N="853" /> subsection (1). I assure Senators Ryan and O'Toole and others who have spoken that the points they are trying to address in this amendment will be dealt with when the manner in which notice of a pre-school service is to be given to a health board is being prescribed by regulations under section 48.  On the basis of this assurance and having regard to the fact that the amendment is significantly defective, I would be sincerely grateful if my colleague would withdraw the amendment. I assure Senators we will take it into account when we are drawing up the regulations.</P>

      <P>56.  For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that the provisions of this Part shall not apply to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the care of one or more pre-school children undertaken by a relative of the child or children or the spouse of such relative,</P>
      <P>(b)  a person taking care of one or more pre-school children of the same family and no other such children (other than that person's own such children) in that person's home,</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator Ryan for withdrawing amendment No. 15.  The House will recall that on Committee Stage Seantors Honan and Ryan expressed concern about the possible application of the requirements of Part VII to relatives minding children on behalf of parents.  The purpose of this amendment is to make it absolutely clear that the provisions of Part VII do not apply to the care of pre-school children undertaken by a relative or a neighbour of the parents.  The whole thrust of Part VII is to regulate facilities such as playgroups and crèches which cater for groups of young children from different families. It was never the intention to interfere in arrangements made by working parents with a relative or a neighbour of theirs to look after their children for them.  This amendment would place this beyond doubt.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (a) exempts a relative or his or her spouse from the requirements of Part VII.  Paragraph (b) exempts a person taking care of children of the same family only in that person's home.  Paragraph (c) exempts a person looking after not more than three children of different families in that person's home.  I consider that three children of different families as a reasonable threshold and if a person minds more children the arrangement should constitute a pre-school service which should be subject to supervision and regulation.  The exemptions provided for in the amendment are both reasonable and desirable and I hope the House will accept it.</P>

In relation to the question of identifying children who are at risk, we have put in place a considerable apparatus and there are marvellous improvements made in this legislation in relation to that area, but we still have a problem in terms of identifying those who are at risk.  Who will have responsibility for this?

    <Title>Tourism Initiatives: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="859" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann, recognising the important contribution of tourism to the economy, requests the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to encourage all initiatives directed towards increasing Ireland's share of the world market, especially in view of the downturn in tourism consequent on the Gulf War and its aftermath.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with the whole question of tourism, I am not speaking directly to the motion in terms of whether this is an anti-Government or a proGovernment motion.  There is a general consensus that tourism is an area in which we all move along together, positively.  I want to make a number of points about a number of areas which I feel we need to concentrate on.</P>
      <P>I will now accept, though somewhat reluctantly, and I am late coming to the conclusion, that Board Fáilte have worked out our weather forecasts and what our climate is likely to be.  This is not a sundrenched island to be sold abroad as such. That is a reality that is slowly dawning on the rest of the world as well.  Far from being a liability it is a very positive advantage that we can emphasise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I get into that, I want to relate an experience I had in the last week.  I was at a function in Killarney, one of the centres of the tourist industry in Kerry.  I was talking to a woman whose son works in London and who had hoped to come home the previous weekend.  He hoped to fly from London to Farranfore airport. He did not come home.  The reason was simple.  He went to Berlin instead because he could get from London to Berlin cheaper than he could get from London to Farranfore.  Access is a critical part of the whole operation.  There was a difference of £100 for a weekend, the difference between £150 and £250.  There is a general view that we can get long term agreement on costs on Apex fares. <Col N="860" /> The reality is that a significant part of tourism spending is impulse spending. People in Dublin, the major population centre in Ireland, going away for a weekend tend to go along the east coast because it is closer.  If they go to the west coast they go to Galway.  The number of people who go to Dingle from Dublin are committed people, people who are going home.  People will not get into their cars and take a five-hour drive through the potholed roads of Ireland.</P>

      <P>It does not take from the need to have a fairly sound infrastructure. The need to have a regular ferry service into Cork is as important to the tourist industry in the west as anything else.  I was fully supportive of the Minister and his parliamentary and other political colleagues in the Cork and Kerry areas in trying to develop that service.  We need to look at investment in access in order to ensure that we get people to come here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we get people here what have we to offer them?  There is a growing problem developing at the moment, that any kind of development spoils the scenery. Over the last number of years I have been involved, peripherally, in a number of arguments about producing tourist resources and tourist back-up facilities.  I will give three examples along the west coast in terms of selling our cultural heritage, our natural heritage and the whole area of flora and fauna.  First, there was the proposal to carry out mining on Croagh Patrick.  That would have been a disaster.  It would have been a big loser in the long term.  It does not matter how we add on the tourist value, whether it is by developing the religious pilgrimage people, people coming to look at the scenery or people coming to enjoy nature.  Once the people come here they are part of the industry.  Similarly, there was the row in Clifden about an airport there.  I certainly took the view that it would be totally unsuitable to build an airport where it was proposed to build <Col N="861" /> it.  It would have been damaging to the environment.</P>
    <P>I find myself on the other side in the latest row in regard to the Burren area around Corofin and the proposal to build an interpretative centre there.  I would like to put firmly on the record that I am in support of what the local people are saying.  The proposal to build the centre and car park in an old quarry and in a bulldozed field is prefectly all right and people locally will benefit from it.  No damage will be done to the heritage, the flora and fauna, to the unique environment. In fact, it will be made more accessible and more available to a greater number of people and it will also be presented to people in a way they can understand.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of development we have to look at.  If we are to develop our tourist industry there are two ways we can do it.  We can look at the wool pullover and tweed brigade who do not want anybody to come in; we can look at the self-satisfied people who are on large salaries who do not want masses of tourists coming into the country.  These are the people who will object to it.  Then we have the crowd who will object every time someone puts a spade in the ground. Once we know we are going to take on people who are regressive in their views, we must at the same time be absolutely certain that we will protect our environment because our tourist industry is about selling our environment.  We will only sell an environment that we protect.</P>
    <P>I want to get on to aspects where we do not protect our environment.  What do people come here for?  What is magnificent about Ireland is its food and what is most suspect about Ireland at the moment is its food.  There we have an inherent contradiction immediately.  We have people who would come here to taste our food.  There is a huge potential there for the production and the development of additive free food, of hormone free meat and of clean and unadulterated fish.  We have everything going for us.  If we let silage spill into our waters, if we use our seas as dumping grounds, if we do not control the hormone additives, or <Col N="862" /> the angel dust then we lose that huge market.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in regard to our culture, it is purely cant to say we will sell it.  We need to present our culture, our cultural heritage, our cultural background and what has made us into what we are to our visitors.  Irish people are different, without being racist about it.  The Irish countryside is different.  Ireland is different. As far as the tourists are concerned <i>vive la différence</i>.  That is a difference we can sell.</P>
    <P>We are a popular people in European terms.  We are a popular people in world terms.  We are a country in which people are happy to be.  Therefore, we need to show them what we have.  The discovery in the United States of the culprits who were attempting to steal some of the great antiquities from the west of Ireland was a resounding success.  The people who discovered the culprits should be complimented. That is part of what we are, that is part of what people come to see. The American tourist comes from a country that has existed since roughly the 1500s, a country that is only 500 or so years old.  We are showing these people buildings which are over 1,000 years old, or even older still if you go to places like the Gallarus Oratory in west Kerry, which is perhaps 1,500 years old.  This is something which is beyond the concept of people from many of the new countries like Australia, the United States, etc., in terms of their particular heritage.</P>
    <P>When people come into this country what do we have to offer them?  I have mentioned food and culture.  Let us look at the environment.  One of the great developments over the last number of years has been the development of walks, the development of outdoor activity centres which is a growth area in many parts of the west particularly, I believe that is the future.  We have now accepted that the weather is wrong.  We will not attract people to come here to lie in the sun. Half of Europe are now worried about melanoma, skin cancer of various types, which is caused and exacerbated by the sun.  People particularly from the north European countries, no longer want to <Col N="863" /> lie in the sun.  They want to come to some place where they are safe from the sun. We have that to offer.  We need to have as our slogan clean seas, sweet water and clear air.  That is what it boils down to at the end of the day.  That is what will bring people here.</P>
    <P>People, particularly people with children, cannot expect to spend an outdoor holiday all the time.  We have to look at the development of leisure centres. I would put it to the Minister that an investment in that area is an investment that will reap benefit one hundredfold. We should make it our objective to attract tourists through our clean seas, sweet water, clear air, good food, no additives, clean meat and well-stocked lakes and rivers.</P>
    <P>In some cases we have gone backwards. One of the areas in which there has been a major regression in tourist terms has been sea angling.  I can recall 20 years ago when sea angling was a major area of tourism in the west.  That is not the case any more.  It has died with the fishing industry when one would imagine the reverse would have been the case.  As farmers have gone into the area of farmhouse holidays one would have imagined that in the fisheries area sea angling would have developed.  On any visit abroad one will always find waterway possibilities.  I will not indulge the Senator from Leitrim who has recently joined us but we now have that possibility. I spent last weekend boating at St. Mullens on the Barrow.  It struck me that it will be possible to go from there to Ballyshannon in the next 18 months or so, through the Barrow navigation, the Royal Canal, the Shannon Navigation, the Ballyconnell canal and the Erne Navigation. No place in Europe can provide a similar facility.  Even France, with its intricate system, cannot provide that possibility.  We are under-selling that area.</P>
    <P>The inland waterways is huge.  The reality is that one can travel all the way from Tullamore to Lowtown, or Tullamore to Robertstown &mdash; which in driving or cycling terms may not be a <Col N="864" /> huge distance, but in boating terms is a long distance &mdash; and perhaps not meet another boat.  Those waters are uncluttered, they are uncrowded, they are mainly clean and are becoming cleaner. That is an area we have not developed.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, with a major river running through, one cannot go on a boat trip. That is a classic example.  We have not developed those areas at all.  There are tourists walking up and down the quays during daylight hours and there is no possibility of having a boat trip.  For instance, in Paris you have got the <i>bateaux rouge</i> to take people on trips up and down the Seine.  We have failed to develop this tourist area just as we have failed to develop the sea angling area.</P>
    <P>Dingle is an example of a place where they have developed boat trips for tourists, through a process of serendipity, because they found a way to bring people out to see &ldquo;Fungi&rdquo;.  If &ldquo;Fungi&rdquo; were to leave Dingle tomorrow morning it would create problems as the reality is that hourbour trips have now become part of the tourist scene there.  I do not see why harbour trips should not be part of the tourist scene in every town in the west which has a large harbour.  Every harbour has a sufficient history to warrant this development.</P>
    <P>We need to maximise our resources, to give a resource audit of our tourist potential.  That, basically, is looking at our weather, our seas, our water, our air, our food, our vegetables and our fields so that people can come here and eat the best food, enjoy themselves in a safe location and get back-up and a support from people at all levels.  There should be a welcome for children and there should be access possibilities which will be relatively cheap to people from continental Europe and other places, whether they come by boat or by air.  We need to develop those areas.  We need to develop the access routes and we need to keep competition on the access routes to ensure that we can bring in our tourists and give them a welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  I agree <Col N="865" /> with the last part of what Senator O'Toole said.  It is now recognised that tourism is one of the major leading industries in the world economy.  Annual statistics which I read recently show that the annual turnover of worldwide tourism, travel and leisure is now in the order of £2 million billion.  It would be even difficult to write that down in figures.  It is an enormous amount.  The return on tourism is more than the gross national product of the Federal Republic of Germany and the UK combined.  We are talking here about an industry that is absolutely enormous.</P>
      <P>The tourism, travel and leisure industry is estimated to employ more than 100 million people right throughout the world.  Jobs are created at a higher rate in this industry than in any other sector. Over the last ten years, in virtually every OECD country, the number of people employed in tourism-related industries has risen more rapidly than in all other service industries and far faster in actual fact than the employed labour force as a whole.</P>
      <P>The scale of the industry can be gauged from the fact that in most of the industrialised countries it employs more people than agriculture, the motor industry, electronics, iron and steel and textiles put together.  A spectacular statistic is that in the US since 1976 15 per cent of all employment growth at 3.2 million jobs has been in the tourist-related sector.  In Europe, 10 per cent of total employment was in the tourism, travel and leisure sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we all know, the industry is now being restructured.  Senator O'Toole referred to this.  The whole emphasis is away from sun holidays because of the fear of melanoma, or skin cancer, which we were taking about.  The emphasis is now on health and health-related holidays and because of that the whole emphasis in relation to the attraction of tourism and tourist-related activities is being restructured.  This has enormous implications for this country &mdash; Senator O'Toole has referred to it &mdash; in terms of the benefit which can accrue from the <Col N="866" /> change in emphasis on holidays and tourism and also in terms of the need to be prepared to harness all the benefits that can accrue from the change in attitudes of people throughout the world.  There is this big trend away from the sun holidays where one is lying in the sun, because of all of the difficulties and rightly so.  It has been proven that too much exposure to the sun causes a lot of problems both in terms of skin cancer and other ailments.</P>
    <P>We all hope that the summer will not be too bad and that we will get our fair share of the sun but even if the sun does not shine every single day we have many attractions and advantages that they do not have in other countries.  Senator O'Toole emphasised one in relation to our food.  It is not just one factor.  We have other advantages also that we should exploit.  We have a beautiful rugged country, we have a culture and heritage.  Those are all very important factors that we must develop.  Tremendous strides have been made but it is only the tip of the iceberg as far as tapping the potential of our resources are concerned.</P>
    <P>May I be parochial for a moment and refer to the Shannon, and Lough Derg which is the lower of the three lakes on the River Shannon.  I come myself only four miles from that lake and we regard it as one of the finest lakes in Europe.  We are delighted with the brief of Shannon Development, the tourism promoters for the mid-west region and I want to acknowledge the outstanding work they are doing in the region in relation to tourism.  They have been given the responsibility for the development of the agri-tourism sector as well.  That, allied to the actual tourism sector, will be of tremendous benefit to the whole region. The enthusiasm and commitment with which Shannon Development have taken on this project allied to the other tourism promotional activities they are invovled in, are outstanding.  From the chairman, Jack Daly, and their chief executive, Tom Dunne, right down the line through all the staff in Shannon Development they deserve great praise.  The amazing degree of adaptation and flexibility and the will to achieve is an example of what can be <Col N="867" /> done by a public body when they set their mind to it.  They are certainly giving value for money and I would like to congratulate them on the tremendous strides they are making.</P>
    <P>We in the county council have set up an elected representatives group comprising members of North Tipperary, Clare and Galway in relation to the development of the whole Lough Derg lake.  It is under the chairmanship of Councillor John Sheehy and we meet regularly with a working group of State bodies who are interested in that region which is co-ordinated by Shannon Development.  There is a very close relationship between all of those bodies and the working groups.  The tremendous success those groups have shown with the working group of elected representatives in a very short time has been absolutely outstanding.  In view of the success in this case, perhaps at some stage it could be considered whether the brief of Shannon Development be extended to encompass a larger region for the development of the Shannon region.  The potential there is absolutely enormous.  We had the privilege of meeting members of the Shannon forum in Athlone on a few occasions.  It is through communication like that and the exchange of ideas that we can benefit one another rather than vying with one another.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the position of this area in relation to Shannon Airport, and the continuing controversy in relation to the status of Shannon.  Any intelligent person who sees the enormous funds being invested in the promotion of tourism and other areas in the Shannon region, allied to the Government policy of decentralisation, would have to conclude that it would be false economy on the one hand to seek to develop a region like that while at the same time, downgrading the international airport that is so vital to the whole mid-western and southern economy.  We have to recognise the realities.</P>
    <P>The city of Dublin is bursting at the seams.  It cannot cope with the existing traffic, let alone any increase in traffic. <Col N="868" /> Every day there is controversy about the traffic situation in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>There are many notable personalities who would see the downgrading of Shannon as an enormous mistake.  Conor McCarthy, who is chairman of the Ryan Hotels group, recently gave statistics which support the status of Shannon and he said that expenditure per tourist via Shannon is 36 per cent higher than expenditure per tourist via Dublin.  Another very important statistic is that of the tourists coming into Shannon, 72 per cent visit Dublin but of those who come into Dublin by alternative routes only 40 per cent visit the west and the south-west areas.  There is a strong body of opinion which would conclude that Dublin hotels would be the losers if the status at Shannon was changed.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note in all of this that it is the shop lobby that has advocated a change in status of Shannon.  It is not the hotels lobby or any other lobby.  It is also interesting that Mr. McCarthy, who has two hotels in Dublin, has advocated the status of Shannon should remain and that the whole of the country would lose by a change in that status.</P>
    <P>Other prominent people, including the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Daly, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, The Tánaiste, Deputy Wilson, the Labour Leader, Deputy Dick Spring and Mr. Derek Keogh, Chief Executive of Aer Rianta have all advocated that the Shannon status should not be changed.  They are people who have no vested interest in the Shannon development except that they see the reality.  The Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications is on record that he sees no reason why the status should be changed at present.  The public should not be fooled into thinking that all of this is about passenger traffic.  Local manufacturing industry would be considerable. A survey carried out by the Shannon status campaign shows that 47 <Col N="869" /> companies and seven western counties have indicated its importance.</P>
    <P>One should also remember that the airlines are not concerned with economic development.  Their duty is to serve their shareholders. Why should they be calling all of the shots?  They must have a vested interest in changing the status of Shannon. The whole emphasis should be on giving a service, not getting involved in development.  Shannon Airport is a strategic national asset which for more than 45 years has played a vital role in maintaining balanced economic and social development and it has proved to be a generator of jobs and job opportunities. While the current threat to Shannon Airport's gateway status and the level of service with North America jeopardise 2,300 airport and tourism related jobs, the real devastation is already taking place.  Investment in industry and tourism in areas where the investment accounts for more in job contributions, to personal income, is being deferred because of the uncertainty about the future level of services and will certainly have a serious impact on the appeal of west of Ireland location options for industry and tourism.</P>
    <P>Shannon pioneered the concepts and strategies geared to drawing tourists to the airport, techniques later copied by Amsterdam and in most recent times imitated by emergent Third World nations. Shannon was also keen on launching and testing the feasibility of overseas industrial investment in the country by being picked as a site for a duty free zone where overseas export firms were located so that they would not destabilise native industry in the late fifties and in the early sixties. Tourism and leisure facilities, the fastest growing industry in the world, are strongly influenced by the green factor. The West of Ireland with its pure environment, fresh water, air and food, is a unique attraction in Europe.  The EC recognises tourism as a key enterprise in its efforts to cushion and shelter rural and agricultural communities from the worst effects of the dismantling of agricultural supports.  Regional policy, and its supports, is being geared to aiding peripheral <Col N="870" /> areas of the EC, including Ireland, to beef up resources and infrastructure to help counterbalance the difficulties.</P>
    <P>Over the past year the message being driven home by the Dublin lobby has been that Shannon is all right, it can stand on its own feet with the support of the Atlantic gateway because of its Aeroflot and Aerospace.  Aerospace is a breakthrough project which will provide 1,000 jobs but there will be no revenue earning flights to the Shannon region other than landing charges for aircraft coming in for maintenance.  The Dublin lobby claim that direct flights to Dublin will add 70,000 to 100,000 US tourists to the Irish market.  This is a fallacy.  No one can sustain that claim.</P>
    <P>The Shannon pre-clearance emigration facility &mdash; the only one in Europe &mdash; means that a ten to 15 minute procedure there saves up to two hours in a queue at the US destination.  That does away with the idea that there is an hour's delay in relation to overflights to Europe.  In fact that facility provided at Shannon saves the traveller, in some cases, two to three hours.  The switching of Shannon's transatlantic services to Dublin would require investment of £60 million to £100 million in airport facilities to cater for the bulk movement of passengers through the terminal. No EC support is available for such investment which means that funds would have to come from the taxpayer to switch the landing place of tourists from one side of the country to the other.</P>
    <P>Only last week the new £12 million Castletroy Park Hotel was officially opened in Limerick.  It was built by EGB, the company owned by Mr. Chuck Feeney, an Irish-American who knows his business.  He is investing £12 million in the mid-west region.  This investment comes to top of £3.5 million invested in refurbishment of the Great Southern Hotel at Shannon Airport, an investment of £1 million in a new hotel in Shannon town and an expansion programme by the Fitzpatrick-owned Shannon Shamrock and the Green Isle Hotel in Limerick.</P>
    <P>I want to elaborate on the importance of Shannon Airport to the whole region. <Col N="871" /> Irish-Americans are arriving and putting their money where their mouth is.  Those people know where the American tourists want to go and what investment it takes to encourage them to come here. This has been described by a leading Dublin hotelier as a shop's lobby.  The Shannon status should remain.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue and I compliment the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications on the work he has been doing in the past and I wish him well in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion because tourism is an important industry with a great potential.  Our tourist industry is as large as our dairying industry but unlike the dairying industry it is not subject to a quota which restricts its growth.  Tourism can grow.  There is remarkable scope for growth particularly by extending the tourist season, by offering a greater range of products and by concentrating more on tourists from mainland Europe where, until recently, we lacked identity.</P>
      <P>Some years ago the citizen on the street in mainland Europe was likely to confuse Ireland with Iceland, England or Scotland. Fortunately that situation has improved, particularly in the past three years and principally through the good impression created by Jack Charlton and his army of supporters who were a credit to the country wherever they went.  They left a very good impression, particularly in Italy during the World Cup series. Indeed, it is interesting to note that after that World Cup series that was a huge increase in the number of tourists from Italy.  Bord Fáilte or, indeed, the Government budget could never afford to buy the kind of exposure they received through television which was beamed into millions of homes throughout Europe and beyond.  We should be grateful to them and we must now cash in on the good publicity which we received during those important games.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation which existed in Britain ten years ago is somewhat similar to that <Col N="872" /> in Ireland today.  The views expressed by the first Conservative Governments of that period are on record as saying that tourism would turn Britain into a candyfloss and Jeeves society.  Of course that has not happened but tourism has grown enormously in that country.  Today the British tourist industry is worth £24 billion sterling per annum and one-third of that comes from overseas.  This kind of growth creates employment and induces employment in other sectors such as food, transport, craft industries and retailing.  In Ireland tourism, directly and indirectly, is responsible for 7 per cent of total employment.  It is a growing industry far short of its potential but it is a seasonal industry and this detracts from the attractiveness for investment.  We have to decide what must be done and we must set about doing it.</P>
    <P>The first thing for Government to accept is that tourism is distinctly different from manufacturing industry. Employers and entrepreneurs in manufacturing have used the generous capital allowances to re-equip, modernise and regear. This is essential.  The downside, however, to this is that many jobs and job opportunities are being replaced by machines.  Tourism, on the other hand, is labour intensive so capital invested does not replace labour, it increases it. This difference should be recognised by Government and the capital allowance of 50 per cent should be retained during this time of development of our tourist industry, bearing in mind our enormous problem with unemployment.</P>
    <P>My party have put jobs first.  Without employment there is a very high fiscal price to be borne by the working community and the taxpayer but the cost does not end there.  There is a social cost, the cost to individuals and families affected, the haemorrhage of emigration, the waste of potential which the community cannot bear and the rising crime rate, vandalism, drug addiction and so on, partly attributable to the large scale unemployment which we have.  The Government have set high targets to double tourism in revenue and numbers and to create 25,000 new jobs.  This is <Col N="873" /> demand which has not been asked of any other sector.  It has, however, been achieved at the half-way stage and this proves conclusively that the potential exists.</P>
    <P>What about the tools to do the job and to reach the targets set out?  Let us look at the record which is not a healthy one. The capital allowance has been reduced from 50 per cent to 25 per cent in 1991. The business expansion scheme has been abolished for hotels and reduced to £0.5 million per scheme.  British Airways have pulled out of all three airports in the Republic.  The B &amp; I Line have a cloud hanging over them which should be resolved.  It cannot be resolved now as we enter the peak season but it should have been resolved before it got to this stage.  The Government grant to Bord Fáilte has remined at the same level for three years running.  How can this be reconciled with the target set and with the need for jobs and foreign earnings?</P>
    <P>Last week my party's committee on economic affairs met with Bord Fáilte to get their views.  It is fair to say that we met people who are totally committed and who seem to know what they are talking about.  Their job is to sell Ireland abroad and develop the industry at home. In terms of the first, we must remember that Ireland does not have a large network of support pushing our good news as other countries have.  We can be sure, however, that all the bad news gets out and that the only organisation with funds to build Ireland's image professionally are Bord Fáilte.  We are assisted greatly by the success of our athletes, music groups and our soccer team in raising consciousness of Ireland but this is not enough, it must be sold more effectively. To develop the industry we must look again at our investment and our investment climate should take the needs of tourism into account.  We have done this for agriculture and for industry.  Why not for tourism?</P>
    <P>I would like also to refer to agri-tourism. This is an area which is just about to take off.  It has great potential for the type of European &ldquo;green&rdquo; tourism which is emerging.  If it is to be successful it will <Col N="874" /> need careful planning and marketing.  It is in all our interests that this be got right as it can provide a balance in retaining the farming community in the country rather than going along with the trend towards urbinisation which has occurred in every other Community country and, in the United States in particular.</P>
    <P>There are, however, problems we have to address and some have been mentioned already this evening.  Senator O'Toole mentioned the cost of getting here and he is right.  However, there are other costs which are out of line when one gets here.  The cost of hiring a car is way out of line with that of our competitors. In fact, it is now so expensive that some people prefer to come to the Republic via Northern Ireland where they hire their car to do their touring in the Republic.</P>
    <P>It has also been mentioned that this is not a destination for those seeking sun, sea and sand and that is perfectly true. However, we all know millions of people want to get away from the stifling heat of the cities of central Europe and elsewhere and come to the cool, clean air we have in abundance in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We also need to address the problem of tourist mugging.  All of us should play a part in stopping that kind of gangsterism because it gives a very bad name to the country.  In addition to the excellent work of Bord Fáilte it is time we reminded those in the trade, such as hoteliers, restaurateurs and so on, that it is their duty also to go out and sell their services. The primary function of Bord Fáilte is to improve the image of the country and to create the right sort of image, but the hard sell for each individual component of the tourist industry must be undertaken by those who have invested in the industry.  Most of them have very little to do for many months of the year.  Why do they not get up off their backsides, go out and get the business?  That is what it is all about.  They are reluctant to do so.  They sit back and say that is the function of Bord Fáilte.  It is in part but it is also their function to ensure that their own business is successful.</P>
    <P>Much as been said about the efforts <Col N="875" /> being made in the area of tourism and about our wonderful food and, of course, it is good food.  I am always impressed by the fact that the first thing Americans say to me when they sit down to a meal is that they love our brown bread.  Why they cannot make brown bread in America beats me since 75 per cent of the wheat we use in our brown bread is American wheat.  However, that is beside the point.</P>

      <P>It may be an art, it may be that we are prepared to put the work into it but whatever it is, it certainly appeals to the Americans and to the Europeans.</P>
      <P>We must do more to satisfy the needs of tourists.  When tourists come to Ireland they may have a range of needs; they may want to go golfing, walking, shooting, fishing, cycling, hunting and so on.  We must put packages together to suit those various requirements.  I am aware of a move in Cork city, and in Cobh, in which I am participating, which is endeavouring to do this.  We are endeavouring to put together a package which will keep tourists in the Cork area for more than one night.  The Queenstown project, which is a most exciting project, aims to attract emigrants most of whom left this country from Queenstown, as it was then, or Cobh as it is now.  About £2.5 million will be spent on that project.  The distillery in Midleton is also building a museum which will be part of the attraction of the total area.</P>
      <P>The Fota project already attracts about 200,000 visitors each year and of course, Blarney also attracts very large numbers each year.  That is the kind of local initiative we must get going in every area in Ireland.  As somebody already said, it must be done properly; it must be done with the primary aim of satisfying the customer not just with the aim of making money.  If we do not satisfy the customers they will not return and will not tell their friends to come here.  We have the potential and the ability to do it.  It is up to us to have the commitment and the plan.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="876" /> I am happy to support this motion and I sincerely hope the Minister will be successful in his endeavours to promote tourism and to help the tourist industry in future.  However, I ask him to consider again the problem of funding for Bord Fáilte, the elimination of the BES scheme and the reduction from 50 per cent to 25 per cent in the capital investment allowance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do so in the knowledge that some of the things he said, particularly in relation to the BES do not appear to be on a par with what his colleagues said in the Dáil in relation to that scheme.  There were scathing in their remarks about BES and what it achieved for us.  I am glad that some logicality remains with Fine Gael in terms of Senator Raftery and, of course, he comes from Cork.  We are very logical in Cork and he can see the advantages that emanated particularly from the tourism industry as far as Cork is concerned.  I congratulate Senator Raftery for standing on his own and going against his colleagues in the Dáil and saying that the BES has been good for tourism because it has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to look back before we can go forward.  We have to look back to 1986 and 1987 and ask ourselves what this Government were faced with when they took office.  There was doom and gloom and one of the first things they pinpointed was the tourism industry.  For years we have been saying we cannot attract people in because we have not got the sun but suddenly there was a transformation and people began to realise, and the Fianna Fáil Government at that time realised, that we had something very special to offer.  We had something to offer people in the US, the UK and in Europe and now we are extending that into the eastern countries and indeed to Australia and New Zealand.  What did the Government do at that time?  They <Col N="877" /> set targets and I disagree with people who say that the targets they set in the first year were easy to achieve because of the percentage increase and that we were starting from a very low base.  However the Government set themselves the target that from 1988 to 1992 they would increase the 2.1 million visitors to this country to 4.2 million, a difficult target.</P>
    <P>It is pleasant to record also that the revenue doubled from £500 million to in excess of £1 billion.  Quite rightly, Senator Raftery mentioned the fact that tourism is labour intensive.  This has been pinpointed in other areas such as our industrial policy and what the IDA aim to achieve.  They pinpointed the chemical and electronic industries, pharmaceuticals in general and computers. Those are all hi-tech industries.  Hi-tech, unfortunately, means by and large that one needs graduate skills but is not very labour intensive.</P>
    <P>Here we have a natural resource from which the Government have said we can generate activity and create 25,000 new jobs.  What is pleasing about all this is that by 1990 all the targets set were achieved. There certainly have been difficulties in the current year with the Gulf War and the recession in the UK and the USA.  I suppose it is fair to say that the target we set ourselves, a 15 per cent increase, in those circumstances will be difficult to achieve.  Yet those targets will be achieved because, in fairness to Bord Fáilte, the diversification they are involved in and the markets they have targeted have come up trumps.  It is a pleasure to report that the number of tourists from Europe has increased by 90 per cent over the last three years.  Although there is a recession in the UK and the USA the European scene is a major growth area.</P>
    <P>We have often heard it said in the past that Bord Fáilte are inclined to up their numbers.  People have referred in the past to individuals and members of their own families right across the spectrum who have emigrated to the UK and the USA &mdash; the Jack Charltons &mdash; and who come back here seven times a year.  At the end of the day they must be regarded as tourists.  They come here by aeroplane <Col N="878" /> or ferry and, generally speaking, those individuals spend money within our economy. They spend it in our restaurants, hotels and guesthouses and create a mainstay within the tourist sector that each of us wants to encourage.  That is a major source of foreign revenue.</P>
    <P>Another factor which is not recognised is that the growth rate here is three times greater than the international growth rate.  We must be mindful of the fact that in a recent report, after a couple of years of this programme, the ESRI admit that 17,000 jobs have been created.  That is ahead of target.  We all must acknowledge that that is a major achievement. People like Martin Dully, the Minister and the previous Minister, must take credit for the initiatives they produced in 1987 and again in 1989 in bringing everybody in the tourist sector together and realising that there was potential for growth and job creation in the tourist industry.  As a result, tourism is a major contributor to the economy.</P>
    <P>Revenue from foreign tourists this year will break the barrier of £1.139 billion. When the value of the home market is added to that we are talking about a total of £1.5 billion.  That must be seen as a significant money spinner for this economy. In fact, I understand that tourism revenue will exceed revenue from the beef industry this year.  Everybody talks about the significance of agriculture and food but the tourist industry has potential for job creation and revenue generation which will exceed the beef industry.  This is worth cogitating on and we should certainly continue the programme that has been set in place.</P>
    <P>Senator Raftery referred to agri-tourism. It is incumbent on those of us with rural backgrounds to remember that the social fabric of society in rural areas is vitally important.  In many areas every one of us is concerned that the rural fabric of society is being diminished indeed destroyed, by the removal of various resources from those areas.  Tourism and rural agri-tourism are fundamental industries and play a vital role in keeping people and life in rural areas very much to the forefront.  I welcome the fact that <Col N="879" /> rural communities are now recognising the potential of agri-tourism.  I am glad that £5 million is being provided from the EC to promote this area and I encourage co-ops in rural Ireland to come together to promote their areas because tourism is an industry that will produce jobs and keep people at home.</P>
    <P>How was this possible?  What circumstances prevailed to make this growth in tourism such a phenomenal one?  One can never distance oneself from Government policy in relation to the achievements that have been made in tourism.  Let us not forget the initiatives that brought about air fare liberation and the fact that inflation within this country is the lowest for 20 years, at 2.75 per cent. Let us pay tribute to the trade unions, the workers and employers who, together with the Government, have played a major role in ensuring that cost competitiveness has been a vital factor within this country since 1987.  The achievements and the restraint of workers, the Government's economic policy and indeed the employers have fuelled and given impetus to a product that is vital to this country.  For too long we looked for good weather.  For too long we forgot about the attributes we had &mdash; the attribute of rain, the environment it created, the relaxation, the removal from stress, the friendliness, the ambience that is part and parcel of Irish nature.  At last we have recognised that we have something that other people like to seek, that they will pay for, that they will travel for.  We can provide that for them.  I am pleased that the Government, in recognising that, have made £118 million available for tourist development by way of structural funding.  They have provided, through basic incentives, through the BES scheme itself, and by keeping the economy very much in check to ensure that inflation and other areas are in line, that there is an attractiveness there.</P>
    <P>I would like also, coming from a southern county, to acknowledge the Border areas and in particular to acknowledge the role played by the International Fund for Ireland and what they have done for <Col N="880" /> this country.  It would be remiss of me, particularly with the Minister who is present, not to mention a number of things that have happened in the Cork area.  I want to pay a tribute to Minister Lyons because over the years he has taken a fair amount of stick about the Cork-Swansea and Swansea-Cork ferry. I am pleased that I have an opportunity this evening to say to the Minister that through his confidence in bringing people into Ringaskiddy through the Swansea-Cork ferry he has been exonerated and has been proved right.  For the first time we will have a situation where the Swansea-Cork ferry is going to prove profitable in the year ahead.  Not alone is that going to be good for Cork, it is going to be good for Cork city, it is going to be good for Cork county and it is going to be extremely good for Kerry.</P>
    <P>This motion is timely because we have succeeded in lifting something that has been dormant and bringing about a situation where we have major job creation potential in a labour intensive industry.  I say, &ldquo;Well done, Minister, keep it up&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are a number of avenues that I would suggest could be looked at.  We have the IDA, we have SFADCo, we have Aer Lingus and we have Aer Rianta, each of them with a marketing budget.  I ask, along with Bord Fáilte and Córas Tráchtála, could we at this stage bring all of these together and ask them if there is an opportunity for combining resources to bring more and more people, particularly from Australia, Japan, Taiwan, from the eastern Asian countries. There is a massive potential out there for growth in tourism that has yet remained untapped and is very expensive to tap.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at that to see if there is an opportunity of bringing all of these strands together, saving money and bringing a budget together that would perhaps orientate itself into those particular areas.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the success of the Irish regional airports.  Perhaps the integration of packages between the various airports in Ireland is something well worth looking at from the point <Col N="881" /> of view of tourist development.  I can never underestimate the essential value of the cheapness of playing golf here, its attractiveness, the attractiveness of fishing, of walking, of cycling and the other pursuits that are suitable to us.  I thank the Acting Chairman for his patience, but it was appropriate for me to pay due honour for a job that has been well done to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say first of all how very much I admire Senator O'Keeffe's skill and professional presentation of his brief.  I also admired his strong feeling for the dampness of Ireland as a tourist attraction.  I am not quite sure that I share his confidence that people will visit the country in droves to admire the rain, but perhaps they will.  I know, however, what he meant and that is that people are unlikely to visit this country for the weather, although this is a spectacularly beautiful evening here in Leinster House and is the kind of day on which the countryside of Ireland looks extraordinarly beautiful.  The freshness and greenness of the countryside is one four identifying trade marks.  I went to New York ten years ago for Bord Fáilte to do some broadcasting on radio and television across the United States.  I remember one of the things they mentioned to me, when they were giving me a briefing before I left, was the fact that Ireland was unusual because it had a particular kind of brand identification.  It is the only country which is immediately and automatically associated with a primary colour.  Ireland has appropriated to itself the identifying mark of the colour green, it is the Emerald Isle.  It is only when you have been abroad in some hotter climate and on the way home you fly over the country that you realise what an extraordinary impact the greenness has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I say flying over the country, that immediately raises the question of the stopover at Shannon.  I have only a few points I want to make this evening, but I would like to put on record my strong feeling that it is very important in terms of tourism that we take on board <Col N="882" /> this question, that we address the situation and that we understand once and for all that there must be direct flights into Dublin Airport.  I do not think I am breaching confidentiality here, but the previous American Ambassador made it perfectly clear to me that there were a number of American companies, American airlines and American tour operators, who did not go out of their way to promote Ireland simply because we are the only country in Europe that does not have a direct flight into the capital.  I believe this is something that has to be looked at.  Everybody in the country, including people who come from the west, who come from the Limerick area, realise that the days of this idea of stopping over in Shannon are inevitably numbered; history is against them.</P>
    <P>I say that despite the fact that I have the greatest regard for Shannon Airport and for people like Brendan O'Regan, who was an original and creative thinker in the early days at Shannon.  We can take some pride in the fact that it was Brendan O'Regan's initiative that the duty free shops, for example, were developed and which are now, although an Irish idea, an international feature of travel.  We can take great pleasure and pride in the fact that it was the Irish business initiative that was asked by a number of airlines, including in particular the Soviet authorities, to develop duty free facilities at some of the great Russian airports.  I believe Shannon will survive, but there is a serious distortion of the tourist trade because of the irritation imposed on travellers by forcing them to land at Shannon.</P>
    <P>I came back a few weeks ago from Chicago.  I was lecturing in Madison and in Chicago.  I drove from Madison, Wisconsin, to Chicago, got on the plane and had a marvellous flight.  We went first to Boston.  We stopped in Boston to take on extra passengers, food and so on.  Then across the Atlantic, again very comfortable. Then you have the tedium of Shannon and then, and only then after a broken journey, to Dublin.  I think you will find many people opting to overfly Ireland altogether if we do not get rid of <Col N="883" /> this nonsense.  I say this with no hostility to Shannon.  It is my experience as an Irish person coming home that it is irritating and, believe me, American tourists, or a lot of them, are not going to bother.  For people who want to go to Shannon it should be optional.  If they want direct flights, let us have direct flights to Shannon; but let us also have direct flights into Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not because it is not my parish.  Shannon is not my parish.  I am going to get a good deal more parochial, but I will stay for a while in the West.  I noticed a phrase of Senator O'Keeffe's, with which I agree, when he spoke about the removal of resources.  I would like to raise a question with the Minister, a very serious one, about a very beautiful part of the West that I know, not as well as I would like to, but I still know, that is Roundstone in Connemara. I would like to ask if the Minister has any views on the removal of sand for sale to some big State enterprise in Italy for the purposes of scientific experimentation, because it is such fine sand of such a consistent quality that it can be used in scientific experiments?  May I place on the record of the House my strong support for the people of Connemara, and particularly of Roundstone, in defending the beaches of the West?  As I am sure the Minister knows, despite the fact that we do not always have what would appeal to the international audience as bathing weather, the beautiful sandy beaches, which are not overcrowded, of the West are a joy to walk on, to picnic on and to bathe from.  If we co-operate with their despoliation then we are making a very serious mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Staying in the West of Ireland, I would like to raise another issue and that is this question of the interpretative centre at Mullaghmore.  I have already raised this and I got a very strong answer from I think it was Minister Calleary on this issue.  Since then a number of the people <Col N="884" /> involved came back in contact with me and they indicate, for example, they are still extremely dissatisfied with the siting of the interpretative centre at Mullaghmore, although they know it is in a quarry, they know that the field adjoining it was already bulldozed and the typical Burren stone removed from it.  Yet, they are dissatisfied, and not only they but also a list of international experts.  I have it here from Plantlife.  It was sent to me from the Natural History Museum in London.  It is from David Bellamy.  Richard Mabey, Andy Byfield, the whole list of these international experts, pleading that this should be reconsidered.  It is a very brief pleading:</P>
    <P>We, the undersigned, generally welcome any conservation work in the Burren.  We recognise the need to conserve and interpret this unique environment. But, the Mullaghmore area, in the quiet heartland of the Burren, is not the place for a large interpretative facility.  We stronly oppose the development of interpretative-tourist facilities at Mullaghmore.</P>
    <P>We ought to be aware of the fact that we have used the provisions of our relationship with the European Community, and the fact that we are a Government rather than a private agency or a business firm, to derogate from the requirement to conduct a proper environmental impact assessment in Mullaghmore.  Minister Calleary the last time said it is not going to have any impact at all.  If he is so confident, let us have the environmental impact assessment.  It is very bad leadership for our Government to derogate from the requirement simply because we are a Government and say &ldquo;We are not going to do an environmental impact assessment.  We are right.  It is not going to have any impact on this very sensitive ecological area&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would have to say that feelings are running high.  I know there was a meeting in Corofin.  It was widely quoted.  Of 500 people only nine voted against it.  The reason is that the people from the other areas did not bother going.  They believe it is a ploy by people in a small localised <Col N="885" /> area and I have to say, and I say it with regret, that they also see it as having elements of party politics in it.  I am not going to read the letter I received into the record of the House because the language in it is strongly abusive of Fianna Fáil and simply might raise people's hackles. I would like to place on the record of the House the fact that there is strong suspicion of what is going on there.  It may be unjustified.  May I say that there are other meetings to be held in which considerable majorities will vote, not against an interpretative centre but against its location at that point.</P>
    <P>However, I have raised this issue already and it would be foolish of me to over-emphasise this issue except to indicate to the Minister that it is a continuing one and if we only regard the immediate economic repercussions of the placement of such an interpretative centre then we may very well at the end of the day kill the goose that lays the golden egg, as we have very nearly done in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I would like to come back now to say a little bit about a really parochial issue and that is the issue of James Joyce and the Dublin of James Joyce &mdash; in other words, cultural tourism.  The reason Bord Fáilte sent me to America is because they regarded me as having some small authority in this area because of my love for Joyce and my understanding of his works and so on.  I am very glad to say we have received a promise of money from the European Community, from the European Structural Fund, and we are getting close to being on target with this. I would just say that the Gulf War, as has been noted in the terms of this motion, has had an impact.  It has had an impact not only on tourism but on corporate sponsorship, particularly in terms of airline leasing companies and various other big corporate sponsors.  It is not easy to get the kind of matching finance that we need.  We have got £300,000 waiting to be drawn down from the European Structural Fund.  People on my committee, my broad and myself, have got to create the matching funding.  We have gone a fair way towards it, but we are behind our <Col N="886" /> target partly, because of the impact of the war, as recognised in this motion.</P>
    <P>I will put the following proposition to the Minister.  We have been passed by Dublin Corporation for a grant of £50,000 from the lottery funding.  This money will enable us to draw down further funds in terms of an extra tranche which if we do not draw down by Christmas, will disappear into the European coffers.  May I suggest in the light of the impact that Joyce has clearly on tourism, the Minister might be prepared to use his good offices with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, to see if it would be possible for us to get at least some large portion of this allocation when the next slice of lottery funding becomes available.</P>
    <P>It is particularly appropriate for me to say this because just today I received a very interesting and moving letter from the press officer of Trocaire, who has just come back from the Kurdish refugee camps.  In the letter he said he was writing to me particularly because of my interest in Joyce, which was well known, that my name came up and so on.  He said: &ldquo;When I was in the Kurdish refugee camp I went to talk to this ragged man.  When I said I was from Ireland he said James Joyce.  I said &lsquo;what do you know about James Joyce?&rsquo; He said &lsquo;I have translated <i>A Portrait of the Artist</i> and <i>Ulysses</i>&rsquo;.&rdquo; that, to my mind, is an extraordinary indication of what I have always maintained: if anywhere across the world you mention Dublin, or even Ireland, the answer will be James Joyce, because he has identified this country.  Anywhere you go and you mention Joyce, people think Dublin; if you mention Dublin people think Joyce.</P>
    <P>We are approaching Bloomsday.  I remember when it was not the most popular festival in this country, when there was a certain view taken of the late James Joyce.  I suppose Patrick Kavanagh really pioneered Bloomsday in 1955, but it was a very small celebration.  We have now got to a stage where it has almost become a national celebration, where the tourist board are plugged into it.  I am going to several functions next Sunday <Col N="887" /> on Bloomsday which I helped to arrange. At one of them there are going to be three national television stations, which we directed from the James Joyce Cultural Centre to the Joyce breakfast out in Dún Laoghaire.  That indicates the kind of impact there is.</P>
    <P>I would like to make just two very brief further points.  The first is the necessity to protect what we have got, to create something.  Of course, coming from North Great Goerge's Street, I see that the possibility of an entire coherent area, not an architectural zoo, but a living place where people live, with something like 35, North Great George's Street involved in it, as a tourist draw, like Williamsburg in the United States.</P>
    <P>Could I point out that yesterday Dublin City Council passed a unanimous resolution looking for a law on listed buildings to protect them against the ravages of imprudent or malicious owners.  This would be a very useful thing for the Minister to take on board.  May I point out the kind of worry I have?  We have talked about resources.  We know people come because of culture and so on.  But our eighteenth century heartland is still withering away.  There have been some tax incentives, but they only work for business. What you need is an injection of cash.  What you need is to protect the buildings.  We have seen No. 7 Eccles Street demolished.  There will be a Street party hosted by the nuns in Eccles Street on Sunday but, there will be no building. That entire side of Eccles Street has been destroyed.  Mountjoy Square is in flitters. We need a degree of protection.</P>
    <P>May I sound one further little alarm? Just around the corner, a week or two ago, when I was coming down to Leinster House in the evening, I spotted a big fire, it was Merrion Hall.  We talk about the possibility of so many fires being around that maybe they are suspicious or malicious.  I do not know.  I would not want to make an accusation in that case. But we have to be very careful.  Just around the corner from Merrion Hall there is a very well known Joycean landmark, Swenys &mdash; spelt with one &ldquo;e&rdquo;&mdash;<Col N="888" /> a name that reverbrates throughout the Joycean world.  It is where Leopold Bloom buys his bar of Lemon's soap on 16 June 1904.  I have taken friends of the Joyce family there.  At present it is imperilled.  The upper windows are left wide open.  If we are serious about Joyce we have to preserve the remaining landmarks associated with his career.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>To conclude on this motion on tourism, I will try not to be parochial but that is very hard coming from a county like Kerry.  If the Minister was speaking he would find it very hard not to be parochial, coming as he does, from a county like Cork, because both counties enjoy something like 27 per cent of the tourists coming to Ireland.  As has been rightly pointed out by Senator O'Keeffe, in 1987 the Government decided that tourism would have to be concentrated on in a very big way.  We have all the natural ingredients to attract tourists here; all that is needed is to organise the industry properly and get the show on the road.  Over the past three years the Government and, indeed, Bord Fáilte and other agencies throughout the country, have done a tremendous job in attracting tourists here.</P>
      <P>We have a good, clean environment.  I suppose it is safe to say that our environment is probably the cleanest in Europe.  I remember on one occasion, when the Taoiseach was on television, the interviewer talked about pollution in our rivers and about fish kills and remarked, &ldquo;You never hear of fish kills in the rivers of Europe.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach was very fast to reply, &ldquo;There are no fish in the rivers of Europe.  They are gone.&rdquo; Angling throughout this country is a very big source of income.  It was gratifying the other day when the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill was concluded here in the Seanad because we can now go back again to promoting angling in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number to things bother me, and I have to be a bit parochial now.  We have a lovely lake in Dingle called Peddlers Lake.  The Central Fisheries Board decided last year that they would restock <Col N="889" /> this lake with rainbow trout.  It was an added amenity to our peninsula.  Over a three month period &mdash; the amount of money might seem small &mdash; £3,300 was paid by anglers to fish in that lake.  From memory, 148 of those anglers were foreign anglers.  The amount of money that would have been spent locally from 148 anglers would be in the region of £150,000.  That is a huge contribution to a peninsula like the Dingle peninsula. Unfortunately, An Taisce came along and objected to the restocking of this lake, because they said it was a particular type of lake and that it should remain the way it was.  I think An Taisce are sticking their noses into a lot of good developments when they should not be doing so. They are sticking their noses into the interpretative centre down in Clare when they should not be doing so.  It was quite clear on the news last night that Clare County Council were unanimous in their decision to allow an interpretative centre to go ahead there.</P>
    <P>We cannot have it both ways.  If we attract people into the country and show them what we have to give, places such as the Burren and many other places, we have to allow them to traverse those parts of the country.  If we bring them to the Ailwee Cave or Crag Cave down in Castleisland and if we advertise these places, then we have to allow them to go through. It is no good saying afterwards that there are too many people coming to these places and that they are going to do damage.  I would say, in regard to An Taisce and all their objections, that they have held up about two or three developments in Dingle at present.  If An Taisce had been around when the buldings on the Rock of Cashel were being constructed, I am sure they would have objected to it but today they are trying to preserve them.  They cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, all these magnificent places we have in Ireland should become alive in the same manner as Kilmainham Hospital has been renovated and brought back to be a living building.  In the same way Dublin Castle has been renovated and brought to life <Col N="890" /> again.  Dublin this year is enjoying possibly a bigger tourist boom than normal because it is the European city of culture and heritage for 1991.  It has some of the finest buildings in the country and the people of Europe and the world should come to Dublin and see them.</P>
    <P>I support this motion.  I congratulate the Minister for all he has done for tourism. I thank him and the Taoiseach for bringing Farranfore airport up to international standards.</P>

    <Title>University of Limerick (Dissolution of Thomond College) Bill, 1991: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be in the Seanad tonight moving this Bill.  I did not want to call it the dissolution Bill.  Nobody in my Department wanted to call it the dissolution Bill as we were all of the opinion that it was a negative word and did not take account of what was a very happy arrangement and one that will prove very fruitful in the future.  We went to the drafts people with it and to those who give us legal advice and we were told that that word &ldquo;dissolution&rdquo; had to be inserted.</P>
      <P>On 1 June 1989 I was present in this House to introduce a Bill conferring university status on the then NIHE Limerick.  The Bill now before the House represents another important step in the development of the university.  Its importance though, I should emphasise, lies in the fact that it deals with teacher training courses.  These courses, which up to now have been provided in Thomond College, will, when this Bill is passed, be provided in the University of Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality of the education we provide for our young people depends in the main on the quality of our teachers.  In this regard we have been quite fortunate but this quality does not simply happen, <Col N="891" /> it is planned for and aimed at in our teacher training colleges.</P>
    <P>In 1966 grave disquiet was expressed in the Investment in Education report regarding arrangements for the training of rural science, metalwork and woodwork teachers.  The report also noted the absence of any facility for the training of male physical education teachers.  This disquiet was echoed the following year by the Commission on Higher Education. At that time our male physical education teachers were either trained in England or were former military physical education instructors and our female physical education teachers were trained in two colleges in Dublin, Ling and St. Raphael's.  Trainee teachers for the other subjects I referred to pursued courses of varying standards at centres in Cork Galway, Dublin and Gorey.</P>
    <P>In early 1969, the newly established Higher Education Authority set up a working party to examine the position in relation to these courses.  In their findings which were published in September 1970, the Authority endorsed the earlier opinions that the courses were unnecessarily dispersed throughout the country and recommended that they be concentrated in a single institution.  They also recommended that any such new institution should be sited in Limerick.</P>
    <P>The first step towards regularising the situation was taken in January 1971 when a site adjoining the then National Institute for Higher Education was purchased and the new institution commenced operating as the National College of Physical Education in January 1973.  It may seem unusual that a third level institution should commence operations in the middle of the academic year but it had a readymade student body consisting of a group of male students who had commenced a teacher education course at Twickenham and two groups of female students who had commenced their courses at the two Dublin colleges I referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>In 1979 courses for metalwork, woodwork and rural science teachers commenced in the college and, the following <Col N="892" /> year, with the passing of the Thomond College of Education Act, 1980, it commenced operating as an institution with statutorily defined powers and functions.</P>
    <P>That the initiative in centralising these courses in one institution has been successful is attested to on a daily basis in our second level schools in that graduates of the college are held nationally and internationally in high regard as teachers. There is little doubt that the general ambience of a sense of purpose which prevails in the college contributes in no small way to this success.</P>
    <P>The importance of our teacher training courses, however, is emphasised by the fact that the demand/supply situation for teachers has to be continually monitored. During the eighties, for example, we began to experience a falling birth rate and this has had a major effect on the teacher training colleges.  Thomond College was built to accommodate 1,100 students but has a total enrolment of only 392 students.  There is an increasing demand across the board for all types of third level education.</P>
    <P>The fact that the college and the university share a common campus led to the ease with which the merger was considered and brought about.  I met with the authorities of the two institutions with a view to commencing a dialogue on the linking of the institutions.  Arising from these talks a committee were set up comprising of representatives of the Higher Education Authority, Thomond College, the University of Limerick and the Department of Education, to consider how the resources of the two institutions could best be utilised in view of the outlook for the requirement for teachers in the years ahead and the demand for higher education places in general.</P>
    <P>The committee were specifically asked in their terms of reference to consider how, within any proposed new institutional arrangement, the primary functions of Thomond &mdash; the training of teachers for service in schools and the provision of in-service training for teachers &mdash; could be discharged.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="893" /> The committee issued their recommendations in October 1990.  I pay tribute to that committee.  They met and very swiftly brought out a report in October 1990.  It is amazing that a report issued in 1990 is now being discussed in this House having passed through the Dáil.  So often, not just in education but in other Departments, reports gather dust.  Far from being tardy in this regard, we were in fact very swift and this was because there was such co-operation and determination from both groups.  There was great goodwill and a genuine meeting of minds on the issue.  Its main recommendation was that the college should be integrated with the university.  They recommended that the Thomond College of Education Act should be repealed and that the management and academic structures of the university should be reorganised to facilitate the integration.</P>
    <P>There is another consideration, however, which prompted the introduction of this Bill.  Earlier this year we agreed the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  It represents a commitment to co-operation between the Government and the principal economic and social interests in society.  In the introduction to it the Taoiseach pointed out that a small trading economy such as ours cannot prosper with divisive and competing interests.</P>
    <P>No such programme, however, would be complete without provisions relating to the development of education.  In paragraph 69(j) there is a specific commitment regarding the utilisation of spare capacity in the colleges of education, including Thomond.  This is the first one which has got off the ground and will be the easier of the colleges of education in which to do this because it was directly set up by the Department and was relatively modern, etc.  Talks are going on between the Department and the other institutions. I wish them well in that.</P>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, will give effect to the integration as agreed of the two institutions and will also be a step towards meeting the obligation in the programme to provide extra third level places.  What is proposed in this relatively simple Bill <Col N="894" /> is the legislation necessary to give effect to the integration of Thomond into the University of Limerick.  Consequently what we have to do is dissolve Thomond College as a legal entity, transfer the teaching training functions from the college to the university and transfer the staff, property, rights and liabilities of the college to the university.</P>
    <P>In the drafting of this Bill I was anxious that there would be a provision which would ensure the continuance of the present high status given to the Irish language and culture in the college.  I would direct attention, therefore, to section 10 of the Bill.  To give the background to that, I met with the various interests before they started their talks with the HEA and afterwards, and then a couple of weeks ago I met with the main union involved.</P>
    <P>Each group I met hoped there would be written into the Bill something quite specific regarding this matter and we were glad to do so.  I have letters which I subsequently got from University College, Galway but mainly from staff in Thomond College and the University of Limerick specifically remarking on that measure in the Bill.  They were appreciative that it was done.  I know that this House expresses, and has always done, the same degree of need for positive measure in the Bill.  They were appreciative that it was done.  I know that this House expresses, and has always done, the same degree of need for positive measures such as this.  When I was coming into the House I met with two of the Independent Senators who expressed the same view very positively to me.</P>
    <P>There is a four year degree course in Irish and students taking this course achieve standards comparable to university graduates in Irish.  This course is at present only available to physical education students as an &ldquo;elective&rdquo; or second subject.  However, a mandatory three year course is taught to all students in the college to enable them to acquire the Department of Education's Irish language qualification for teachers.  That came up in the debate in the Dáil.  The college is also involved in providing various in-service courses for teachers and the earlier course to which I referred <Col N="895" /> includes a mandatory three week Gaeltacht course for all students at the end of their first year.</P>
    <P>In relation to the standard of Irish in the college it was very gratifying for me in the Dáil to hear Deputies Kemmy and McGinley quoting the view expressed by the external examiner, Professor Breandan Ó Madagáin of UCG.  His view was &ldquo;that the teaching of Irish to B.A. level in Thomond College is very impressive and well up to university standard both as regards language teaching of the literature courses.  The teaching of the language itself, both oral and written deserves special commendation.  One is impressed also by the spirit and enthusiasm among both staff and students, and the excellent rapport between them&rdquo;.  I should add also that similar sentiments were expressed by his predecessor as external examiner, Professor Seán Ó Tuama of UCC.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil last Wednesday there was a very useful discussion on section 10.  The section as introduced in the Dáil read as follows:</P>
    <P>The University in relation to the performance of its functions shall have due regard to the preservation and promotion of the Irish language and culture.</P>
    <P>Two amendments were introduced and in deference to the sentiments expressed by Deputies J. Higgins and Tomás Mac Giolla I introduced a Ministerial amendment which encompassed, as far as possible, the views expressed</P>
    <P>Section 10, therefore, as it stands is as it was amended in the Dáil and will apply to all the functions of the university and not just the teacher training functions. That is actually what is quite significant in that measure.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the Bill which could escape attention.  Section 3 transfers the teacher training functions of the college to the university and states that they &ldquo;shall be performed by the University in accordance with such terms and <Col N="896" /> conditions as the Minister, after consultation with the Governing Body, directs&rdquo;.  This section would allow the Minister for Education of the day to ensure, for example, that the current level of Irish in the teacher training courses is maintained and developed.  It will also allow the Minister to ensure that the current Irish entry requirement for the teacher training courses is maintained. In the Second Stage debate that was a fear expressed by two or three of the speakers.  It was not put to a vote or anything like that because I was able to point out that if it was brought to my attention that the level of commitment was not maintained the Minister would have the right to see that it would be so done as laid down in the legislation. These things are necessary because if they are not copperfastened nobody then has the right to intervene because people point to the rule book which in this case would be the legislation.</P>
    <P>The success and prestige which Thomond College has achieved over the years is due in so small way to the dedication and guidance given by its director, Mr. Jim Christian, and the other senior members and indeed all members of his staff.  I pay them due tribute.  They have built up expertise in areas such as education, sport, science, leisure and recreation, biological science and metal and wood technology.  These areas have a particular potential to contribute to the excellence and relevance of Limerick University.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;dissolution&rdquo; is used in the Bill as a legal drafting requirement and, while it indicates a degree of finality, it does not fully reflect the true situation. The functions and objectives of Thomond College will continue to be pursued but within the wider remit of the University of Limerick.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill amends the National Council for Educational Awards Act, 1979.  In effect, this means that students who commenced their courses as students of the college will have their degrees awarded by the University of Limerick and not the NCEA. The basis for the legislation, therefore, is <Col N="897" /> an acknowledgement of the excellence and the endorsement of the quality and standing of the NCEA, its awards and processes.  The views of the external examiners bear out this point.</P>
    <P>The Thomond College Act, 1980 provided for a governing body consisting of chairman, director and 23 ordinary members.  Apart from the director all the other members acted in an unpaid capacity.  That these men and women gave freely of their time over the years to build up the success and prestige of the college cannot go without due and proper tribute being paid to them and I am pleased to record my acknowledgement of their contribution.</P>
    <P>It has often struck me that people who serve on education boards, be it their local school, university or whatever, are contributing to the smooth, proper and efficient running of the college.  They bring the expertise from whatever stratum of life by represent to bear upon the activities of the board.  So often people overlook that.  I pay tribute to the various boards of Thomond College and, in a wider sense, to all who serve on such boards around the country from the smallest primary school to the largest university. There is no real glory in it but there is a recognition that one is providing a valuable service and in that sense serving one's country.</P>
    <P>This Bill, like the quality of mercy, could be said to be twice blessed in that it provides for the fusion of two excellent institutions from which both will gain. The university has always seen its mission as the pursuit of excellence in teaching and research to the highest level, particularly in areas adjuged to be of strategic benefit to the economic and social development of the country.  The integration will provide an extra 600 to 700 places and will allow expansion in the areas where the university has built up a particular expertise such as science, engineering and business studies.</P>
    <P>There has always been a significant element of the arts and humanities present in the university and the further infusion of the courses being transferred will broaden and expand this element.  It <Col N="898" /> is worth recalling, too, that with typical foresightedness Ireland's first arts degree in European studies commenced in Limerick in 1972.  I was in Limerick on Monday at the laying of the cornerstone of the new Limerick University Foundation. A trust has been set up and a board established.  There is American Irish and State investment involved in a building project of the order of £13 million.</P>
    <P>Many tributes were paid to the excellence of the college, to its president and to the work done in it.  It is a state of the art college and the entrepreneurship and enterprise of its president is quite considerable. I took the occasion to point out that, of course, one pursues excellence and relevance and this is the true basis for education.  The thrust of education, while recognising its economic importance, should always be the development of the person, the development of his or her sense of confidence, the sense of at being one with oneself and with other people, the garnering of knowledge so that one is fulfilled in one's own right and to use whatever knowledge one gains to serve others.  Education would have no point if that were not so.</P>
    <P>The fusion of many of the courses, particularly those in the humanities, will be of benefit.  The University of Limerick will gain from this.  Given that the proposals in the Bill represent another important development in the third level education system of the country and Limerick in particular I am confident the House will welcome the Bill and, accordingly, I commend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Minister, I welcome the Bill.  I agree with her that the word &ldquo;dissolution&rdquo; has a terminal sound but I suppose for legal reasons it had to be used.  I met the Minister at the foundation the other day in Limerick. She has paid quite a number of visits to Limerick recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I might consider running there yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will be somebody else's seat she will run for.  It is a very vibrant element in the mid-west. The University of Limerick, Plassey Technological Park and Thomond College have been seen as the jewel in the crown of the mid-west region.  As the Minister mentioned, the foundation of Irish-American investment is a further element that is relatively new to Irish universities.  It is another first.  The laying of the cornerstone and the attendance of the American Ambassador shows the very strong links between the University of Limerick and America.  There are also links with Japan, Europe and major universities.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a rational approach to meeting numbers at third level specifically when there is such demand.  We note from the Minister's address that more places will be available. We would have liked it to happen last year.  Irish students were denied access to third level education because the management of Thomond may have been a little myopic in not moving faster. It would have helped enormously to have the students last year conferred with degrees.  However, I will not be churlish. It is better late than never.  The vast majority of the staff welcomed the reorganisation enthusiastically.  They believe the merger provides opportunities for all in Plassey to contribute more fully and constructively to the advancement of the University of Limerick and to meeting the need for third level places.</P>
      <P>The student body were particularly mature in their approach.  They acted extremely rationally and played a very constructive and imaginative role in advancing initiatives in this area.  We do not always get an opportunity to publicly affirm student initiative but this is one area where they were extremely constructive. I congratulate them on that.  I know there are many students this year who are very happy to get University of Limerick degrees.  It is an appropriate time as they celebrate Treaty 300 so it will be a significant year for all of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addressing the Bill I took a brief look at the history of the two institutions. <Col N="900" /> It seems only the other day but the University of Limerick was created in 1972. It achieved its status on 1 June 1989 as a University.  The pursuit of excellence in teaching and research have been the prime goals of the university.  The most telling factor in the University of Limerick is the tremendous emphasis on ensuring relevance to the needs of business, industry, the professions and the community.  That is the hallmark of the University of Limerick.  As new programmes of teaching and research are introduced particular attention is always given to areas judged to be of strategic benefit to the economic and social development of Ireland.  In any university pursuing its mission, it has to recognise that there needs to be an appropriate balance between the sciences and the humanities.  Inter-disciplinary programmes ovbiously would be of benefit here as would the modular credit system which I suppose some students will groan about.  That system is now widely acclaimed in Europe and the United States.</P>
    <P>Centres of academic concentration have been developed in areas of particular relevance to the mission of the university.  Recruitment of faculty members and developmental policies have always been balanced between academic and applied research.  Links with business, industry and the professions are fostered in various ways. Looking at the number of people who attended the ceremony on Monday one could see the fusion of business, commercial, industrial and professional links in the mid-west.  That is a significant element in the University of Limerick. Research is essential to the mission of the university.</P>
    <P>The one point seen locally is that the central philosophy of the University of Limerick will not change with the integration of Thomond College into its structure.  I suppose it will change to encompass the new and important areas of pedagogics and sports science but the university sees these two areas as great opportunities for the students.  The staff in the faculty of the enlarged university are looking forward to new and exciting <Col N="901" /> opportunities.  The range of new degree programmes being launched will enable the University of Limerick to attract a huge number of students.  It will not just serve the students of the mid-west but students from the four corners of the country.  A major problem which will be tackled under this in relation to Thomond College is the reduction of its unit cost. It is very important that pedagogics and sports science be afforded the same status as the other disciplines in the University of Limerick.</P>
    <P>As regards the structure of the university, operating under the University of Limerick Act, 1989, the Minister referred already to the governing body of 25 members appointed by the Government and to the academic council which is responsible to the governing body for academic affairs.  There are three colleges in the existing university, the College of Business, the College of Engineering and Science and the College of Humanities each having its own faculty board controlled by the college faculty board under the chairmanship of the dean.  Obviously with the integration of Thomond College the number of colleges will be increased to four and that will be as I have said already, business, engineering and science, humanities and the college of education. That is very welcome.  For any university to be fully fledged, a college of education is part and parcel of the structure.</P>
    <P>The academic council has statutory responsibility for the development, maintenance and continuous monitoring of academic standards and the granting of academic awards.  The council will be enlarged to include representation from the college of education.  Thomond College of Education offers business education, English, Gaeilge, general and rural science, geography, graduate and professional studies, mathematics, metal engineering, technology education, physics, chemistry, wood and building technology. When thinking of merging them into the bigger institution, we cannot disregard the tremendous scope and cross section there of education areas.  The new <Col N="902" /> college will be created within the University of Limerick and called the College of Education.  Into this college we will transfer the appropriate faculty of Thomond, two departments within the College of Education, one, as I mentioned already, the department of pedagogy and the other the department of sports, science and culture, very much in keeping with the spirit of the age.</P>
    <P>There will be some minor changes, obviously, in the organisational structure. It is good to see that the College of Education will be afforded the full privileges attached to all colleges within the University of Limerick structure, with its dean, a seat on the executive board and the two heads of departments members of the management co-ordinating group.  There will be no transition period following the integration of Thomond College into the University of Limerick.  There will be one management structure with one governing body, one president, one academic council, one executive board, one management coordinating group.</P>
    <P>As regards the capital funding sadly over the years the physical plant of Thomond College has not been maintained to the appropriate high level required; it has deteriorated.  It was an extraordinarily unusual design but it did not stand up to weather and deteriorated. At least £1 million will be needed to restore the facilities to national standards. Obviously the high unit cost of Thomond College will be addresed.  It will take a period of time to deal with that.</P>
    <P>Thomond College was established in 1973 with a great range of expertise and resources, and, as I mentioned already, physical education, I suppose most second level schools in the country now have Thomond College physical education graduates with obviously expertise in the other subjects I mentioned, maths, geography, Gaeilge, English or whatever and, of course, recreational leisure, technology, physical sciences, agriculture, horticulture and biological science, physical education, the humanities and the arts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="903" /> I have been most involved over the years in the tremendous number of summer courses for first and second level teachers.  The general public seem to think that life finishes when you get your summer holidays.  I am sure the Minister would agree that we do not have those three wonderful months and a soft job because, between supervising and correcting, there was always a course appropriate to the needs of, in my subjects at least, Geography, English and various others.</P>
    <P>This is the first year I have not been at Thomond College for a course.  I would like to pay tribute to the staff.  It is not just sitting back and listening, they are full, participative courses, in-service training, which is very much in demand. One certainly worked when at Thomond College.  It was not even a nine to three or nine to five day, it was sometimes right through until late in the evening.</P>
    <P>This is not a question of the big university swallowing up the smaller Thomond College.  The functions that will emerge and will be integrated within the university are the educational and professional preparation of teachers, in-service training, research and consultancy in areas related to the expertise of the college, particularly in the area of the environment and the development of designated and emergent programmes and inititives in areas related to the expertise of the college.  All of these reserve functions will be taken on board within the university structure.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the college motto is a fheabhas Thuamhumhan, which means the best in the world, idiomatically.  It was chosen to signify the college's intention of striving for excellence and, with the University of Limerick, excellence is mentioned over and over in relation to the endeavours of both.  It proclaims that the success of the college is inextricably linked with the success of the Thomond region.  The mid-west region has been heralded many times as one of the most progressive of the country's economic regions.</P>
    <P>You cannot ignore education when you <Col N="904" /> are thinking in terms of an integrated, cultural, economic and obviously educational aspect of expertise.  The college is flexible, it is adaptable, it is open to change.  This is very obvious in the negotiations that have been going on over the years in relation to this integration.  I know that the staff, management, students and everybody within the Thomond structure are looking forward very much to a further evolution of their functions in the context of this new institutional arrangement.</P>
    <P>I hope the merger will harness the expertise, experience and potential in a constructive fashion.  The whole issue of the humanities must be mentioned over and over again because I notice that the issue of the humanities was not highlighted too much in the working party report.  I feel that this is very important. This will further be developed when we get further developments in relation to the Mary Immaculate College of Education, which is something within its integration, which is being worked on at the moment and will be another asset to the University of Limerick.</P>
    <P>I was glad that the Minister saw fit to include section 10 in relation to culture. Over the last few months we had many requests from both sides of the House asking that the whole cultural aspect be emphasised.  I am glad to see that the promotion and use of the Irish language and the preservation and development of the national culture will be given due regard in the training of teachers.  That is to be welcomed.  It was essential that this be included.  I am glad the Minister took it on board.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 4, in relation to additional functions, I stress the new approach to teacher training which is at the bottom of the agreement, which would extend the remit of the University of Limerick out of the narrow specialist training and that it would extend the concurrency model to comprehend the sciences, the arts, technology and business teachers.  It is important when we are thinking in terms of teacher training. This is something I would like to see hammered out later.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> As regards the governing body representation, I know that there is a proposal that for the next year, until the governing body go out of existence, four staff governors from Thomond College of Education will be included on the governing body of university to facilitiate a smooth transfer and also to ease the concerns of staff.  If this is not acceptable, then the vacancies created on the governing body of the university, by virtue of the dissolution of Thomond College, should be filled by staff representatives.</P>
    <P>The reason I stress staff representatives is that at the moment the positions are filled by the chairman, the director and the registrar of Thomond College.  All these functions will have ceased when the Bill goes through.  I emphasise that it is the staff who are important here because all the others will have disappeared off the campus and the staff will remain.  The educational sector should be formally represented on the governing body of the university.  The business and commercial sectors are represented very well, but an institution that is now preparing to train teachers at both primary and post-primary level should have a formal recognition of the educational constituency.</P>
    <P>It is important that this be addressed. I ask the Minister to look into this.  I would not expect the Bill to be held up. I hope that in teacher training at primary and post-primary levels there will be formal recognition of the educational constituency there.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the Thomond College contribution to the University of Limerick again I have to emphasise the humanity element.  It is obvious that a university that does not possess a strong, vibrant humanities faculty is a contradiction in terms.  There is a need for a University of Limerick to build up in this area, not just exclusively for the benefit of the humanities but also for students in sciences, engineering and technology. American universities have turned right around now to saying there has to be &ldquo;a civilising influence&rdquo; on the graduates of engineering, technology and science.  The <Col N="906" /> full person, as the Minister always mentions in her addresses at educational fora, does not stop at first and second level. There is no reason why there should not be a rub-off of the humanities on both science, engineering and technology graduates at any particular time or in any particular college.</P>
    <P>The university's mission is the pursuit of excellence in teaching and research to the highest level.  It must be of strategic benefit to the economic and social development of the country.  I know within the merger that educational and professional preparation of teachers, in-service education and training, the extension of the academic activities and programmes using the expertise of Thomond College of Education will, obviously, bring tremendous benefit to the university.</P>
    <P>Teacher education is very important in relation to the OECD report.  In the University of Limerick we need an extension of the remit in respect of education from the specialist areas to include all types of second level teaching.  The training of specialist teachers in a university context is not just one aspect but it must be enlarged to take in everything.  The basic structure is in place to train teachers to cope with all needs in post-primary education.  The great strength, I suppose, in teacher education that the Thomond College brings to the university is concurrent teacher education, as opposed to consecutive, which we have, in the degree in the H.Dip.  I have experience of the expertise of Thomond College in the preparation of its graduates.  Management bodies have issued report after report, school principals have endorsed over and over again, the whole concept of concurrency in glowing terms.  It would be a retrograde step to undermine that principle in the only institution which prepares teachers in this way.  One could say that Thomond College is ahead of its time.  It was a new institution and obviously it took that aspect of teacher training into consideration.</P>
    <P>There is no way of providing good training cheaply.  Poor training of teachers, as we know, is the most expensive <Col N="907" /> measure of scarce resources because you have endless in-service needs, you have lack of leadership, of programme and curricular design and poor planning.  I suggest that the argument for continuing the concurrency element in the University of Limerick is supported by, as I mentioned already, Mary Immaculate Training College which will be working in close contact with the university.  It is not justifiable to have concurrency in one institution and not in the other.</P>
    <P>On integration, of course, the university will be expected to maximise the utilisation of its buildings and plants by increasing student numbers which is very welcome.  It is a very good day not just for education in Limerick, not just for education in the mid-west, but for education nationally.  This merger of the University of Limerick and Thomond College can only be a bonus for educational development in this country.  I am glad to welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to welcome the Bill, the purpose of which is to provide for the integration of Thomond College of Education and the University of Limerick.  Under the Bill, Thomond College will be dissolved and its functions in relation to the training of teachers will be transferred to the university. In order that the main purpose of the Bill may be achieved it is necessary to amend the National Institute for Higher Education (Limerick) Act, 1980 and the National Council for Educational Awards Act, 1979.  These amendments are provided for in the Bill, as is the transfer of the staff, property, rights and liabilities of Thomond College to the University of Limerick.  The Bill is, therefore, essentially a technical measure which is required to facilitate what could be described as a very welcome and beneficial development in the third level sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is just two years since the Minister for Education brought the University of Limerick Bill and the Dublin City University Bill before this House.  The establishment of these two new universities <Col N="908" /> was warmly welcomed by everybody with an interest in education.  The University of Limerick Bill conferred university status on a third level institution in that city, which had a short, but nonetheless, distinguished record in Irish third level education.  The successful economic and social development programmes adopted by the Government in the sixties led to a recognition of the importance of technical and business subjects in order to provide the skills needed for a country and an economy which was becoming increasingly industrialised.  The 1967 report of the steering committee on technical education formed the basis for the establishment of a network of regional colleges.</P>
    <P>The National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick was established in the early 1970s.  The institute soon became recognised as the leading third level teachnical institution in the country.  It provided a range of excellent technical subjects for its students while its programme also contained a very significant arts and humanities element.  Indeed, as the Minister mentioned, Ireland's first arts degree in European Studies commenced in Limerick in 1972.  The success of NIHE Limerick was evident in the large number of applications the college received each year and in the success of its gradutes in the workplace.</P>
    <P>For some years it was proposed that the institute should be conferred with university status and a distinguished group of international and national experts were invited to advise the Government on the matter.  In 1989 the Minister for Education introduced the Bill which gave full university status to Limerick and NIHE.  As I said at the outset, the initiative of the Minister was welcomed by all the interests involved in education.  Since the enactment of that legislation the benefits to the university and to the city of Limerick have already been very obvious and the Bill before the House this evening represents another milestone in the history of the university and in the development of the country's third level education sector.</P>
    <P>The other institution we are dealing <Col N="909" /> with in this Bill, Thomond College, has been involved in teacher training since the National College of Physical Education opened there in 1973.  At that time there was an acute shortage of physical education teachers in the country.  In 1979 courses were commemced in the college in the training of metalwork, woodwork and rural science teachers. Those teachers who have been trained in Thomond College are held in the highest regard everywhere they teach.  Metalwork, woodwork and rural science are subjects which are primarily available in our vocational schools.  In the vast majority of such schools these subjects are taught with energy and enthusiasm by graduates of Thomond College.</P>
    <P>Physical education has become an increasingly important part of the school curriculum and Thomond graduates in physical education have contributed in no small way to this development.  However, due to demographic trends the demand for teachers has fallen and Thomond College, which was built to accommodate 1,100 students, now has a total enrolment of only 392 students.  The college, of course, shares a common campus with the University of Limerick.  It was against this background that the Minister met the authorities of both colleges with a view to bringing about a merger of both institutions. As the Minister pointed out, a committee was set up to consider how the facilities and expertise of both could be used to the best advantage of all concerned. The committee recommended that Thomond should be integrated with the University of Limerick.</P>
    <P>One of the most beneficial consequences of the proposed integration will be the 700 additional university places which will become available as a result. This will mean a major improvement in access to third level education.  I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the Minister on all the progress that has been made during her term of office with regard to the provision of more third level places.</P>
    <P>As a result of her efforts there are two specific commitments in relation to third level education in the <i>Programme for <Col N="910" /> Economic and Social Progress</i> which I would like to welcome and to refer to specifically.  The first proposal is to increase the number of third level places by 8,800 during the term of the programme. The second proposal is the initiative in relation to the improvement of access to third level education for those from disadvantaged areas.  I also welcome the proposal for the increased participation in third level education of mature students.</P>
    <P>Another proposal in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is to re-examine the higher education grant scheme with a view to having a more equitable assessment criteria for applicants. That is something that most people would support very strongly, as they would the recognition in the programme that income eligibility limits for families with more than one child attending third level courses should be increased and also that mature students should be able to qualify for higher education grants.  I hope that these reforms can be brought to fruition very quickly.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done a great deal in the area of third level education.  She has taken steps to improve and reform radically the entry system and, of course, other initiatives such as the refined grading in the leaving certificate examination and the abolition of the accumulation of points in that examination; the removal of the matriculation by the National University of Ireland and the introduction of a single CAO-CAS application form.  All these will simplify matters very considerably for students and they will make access to third level education easier, cheaper and more equitable.  They are reforms which were very necessary and desirable.  Maidir leis an tagairt speisialta sa Bhille don Ghaeilge agus don chultúr Gaelach, déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire as ucht an t-alt sin a bheith sa Bhille.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte chomh maith roimh an mBille agus cuirim fáilte, ar ndóigh, roimh an Aire. Is oth liom nach raibh mé anseo cúpla seachtain ó shin nuair a dúradh ina taobh gurb í an tAire Oireachais is fearr dá <Col N="911" /> raibh againn, riamh agus, ar ndóigh, ní féidir liomsa dul i gcoinne na tuairime sin.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the Minister. As I have been saying, who am I to quarrel with the assessment of her as the best Minister for Education in the history of the State?  If her own supporters say that, then it must be so.  It is a very good Bill and I congratulate the Minister on a very successful piece of legislation.</P>
      <P>I am glad that Thomond is being integrated with the University of Limerick.  I was looking some time ago at something I said in Limerick several years ago when I was asked by the <i>Limerick Leader</i>, in the course of an election campaign, what my views were in regard to the relationship of the various third level institutions in Limerick.  I was gratified the other day to discover I had said that there should be one composite relationship of colleges within Limerick.  That was at a time when we in UCC had a close relationship, as we still have, with the Mary Immaculate College and at a time when we had had some part in the weaning of Thomond College itself in certain departments.  We never, I would claim in UCC wanted to exercise an imperial jurisdiction on a farflung colony.  That was not the spirit in which we tried to help the evolution of these institutions in Limerick.  I am glad about that.  It makes perfect sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Jackman has commented very comprehensively on the new arrangements in the Bill.  I am happy that the welfare of the staff of Thomond University will be safeguarded in the new arrangements.  Senator Jackman was very interested in the humanities dimension of the new enlarged University of Limerick. Piece by piece, if you like, the University of Limerick, when we established it here a couple of years ago, maybe was not a complete university.  We all knew for example, that the original title was to be the Technological University of Limerick. With the addition of Thomond and its strong education traditions, and even though I am not supposed to talk about it, with the almost certain addition of Mary Immaculate in the near future, we <Col N="912" /> will have the rounding off of the University of Limerick, hopefully, in this dimension of humanities in which there has been a certain deficiency up to now. I remember making the point when we were setting up the University of Limerick exactly two years ago that the prospectus of the National Institute of Higher Education, as it then was, the last prospectus of the NIHE before the University of Limerick was set up, relegated the humanities to the back page of the college prospectus.  That reflected a certain mentality, if you like, which needs to be reformed.</P>
    <P>I share the admiration, which was expressed in this House and in the other House, for the president of the University of Limerick, for Dr. Walsh's remarkable entrepreneurial flair and for the extraordinary initiatives he has taken. I am second to none in my admiration in that regard.  Let me tell you something between ourselves.</P>
    <P>He put the skids under the more traditional universities.  He frightened them into pulling up their socks in certain respects.  It is all very well for them to be condescending about Dr. Walsh, his pragmatism, his lack of a certain academic elegance.  A lot of that talk is sour grapes.  He has been a very good president and a very good stimulus to all the traditional universities.  That having been said, I find some of his philosophies as expressed are very peculiar.  He is on record as having said that really he does not think a great deal of Newman's idea of a university.  It will be interesting to find out &mdash; I hope to find it out in the first million years of eternity in my conversation with Newman to alleviate the boredom of eternity &mdash; what he thinks of Dr. Walsh.  It is true to say that not by chips alone does man live, or whatever the term now is for man, whether they be microchips, soggy chips or whatever. This new development is promising to flesh out the University of Limerick to what it really aspires to be in the course of time.</P>
    <P>My main interest in the Bill I must say is section 10.  It is exceptionally welcome in two respects.  It deals with the Irish <Col N="913" /> language and culture and promises to preserve the ethos of Thomond College, but it also inserts a new obligation and a new statutory obligation in respect of Irish on the University of Limerick which was not there before.  Sin é an rud is tábhachtaí, ar shlí, maidir le alt a 10 den Bhille seo, go bhfuil dualgas nua ar Ollscoil Luimnigh nach raibh ann cheana féin &mdash; agus Ollscoil Luimnigh ar fad atá i gceist, agus ní cuid amháin di.  Mar sin, ní ar ghuaillí beirte ná triúir a thuilleadh a bheidh dualgas na Gaeilge, mar is amhlaidh i láthair na huaire i gColáiste Thua-Mhumhan. Tá foireann bheag ann atá díograiseach i leith na Gaeilge ach, amach anseo, is ar an ollscoil ar fad a bheidh an dualgas sin má chuirtear an fhoráil i bhfeidhm.  Sin scéal eile.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to note, and a great compliment to the Minister, that not alone did she put in this section 10 on language and culture but that she was prepared to clarify and strengthen it as the Bill went through the Dáil, in response to a very good discussion there.  She is to be congratulated on this further amendment. It seems that the words &ldquo;promotion and use&rdquo; in the Bill is a very concrete advance.  There is something particularly compelling and specific about imposing a statutory obligation that there should be use of the language in the university. There is a new specific in the university in the training of teachers that will have due regard for the teaching of the Irish language.  That is something entirely new.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar a dúirt an Teachta Kemmy sa Dáil cúpla seachtain ó shin, tá an-chuid déanta ag Coláiste Thua-Mhumhan cheana féin i saol Luimnigh.  Tá muintir na Gaeilge sa choláiste tar éis spéis nua a chothú i measc mhuintir Luimnigh sa chultúr Gaelach.  Sin rud atá déanta acu, ní amháin laistigh den choláiste, ach freisin i saol na cathrach, agus is maith an rud é sin.  Mar a dúirt mé cheana féin, tá foireann an-bheag ann, ó thaobh na Gaeilge de, ach tá siad ar fheabhas, agus tá sé luaite anseo an tuairim a bhí ag ollúna áirithe i dtaobh an chaighdeáin aird atá tugtha chun críche anseo le roinnt <Col N="914" /> blianta anuas.  Má deirim féin arís é, tá ár gcion féin déanta ag Coláiste na hOllscoile sa mhéid sin.  Tá an-chuid déanta acu i saol Luimnigh lasmuigh den choláiste ar fad agus is féidir leo san ollscoil nua dul ar aghaidh níos faide leis na scileanna agus na rudaí speisialta atá ar siúl cheana féin acu i gColáiste Thua-Mhumhan.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a point about the role of the Thomond staff within the university and what they can do with regard to the Irish language and culture, in not simply repeating the work which is being done in the more traditional universities. Indeed, that is their intention and one of the points to be made about this is the enthusiasm of the Thomond College staff in general and the Irish department in particular to bring their skills into the University of Limerick. Their special contribution within that university will be in areas like language teaching, bilingualism, cultural studies, language planning, terminology development, and so on, areas of learning which are not necessarily covered by the existing universities.  They will bring their ethos with them and develop it in the new university.</P>
    <P>The university is lucky to receive that ready-made range of skills and they have been detailed already by the Minister. These include a wide range of activities in Irish over the years, extending outside the walls of the college to the Gaeltachtaí and so on.  It is hoped that all these areas will be appreciated in the new university and developed there.  In addition to all these practical areas of teaching a beginning has been made already in post-graduate studies by the small but dedicated staff in Thomond College and it is hoped that will be built upon as well.</P>
    <P>The Minister will forgive me if I express my own personal gratification in the context of section 10 because she may well recall that when we dealt with the original Bill here two years ago, on Committee Stage I put forward an amendment which, in fact, very closely resembled <Col N="915" /> section 10 as it now stands.  I am not suggesting a direct cause and effect there.</P>

Only a few weeks ago the Leader of the House took our point when we were looking ahead to this legislation and hoping it would have the Irish language dimension.</P>

      <P>There are times when one feels it is worth while being here, that one is listened to and that the Seanad is not entirely a rubber stamp. This is one of those occasions.  At that time the Minister felt unable to accept the amendment and suggested that the overall HEA supervision in the matter of Irish was adequate for the moment.  I will not go into that.  I am glad that it has now come to fruition.</P>
      <P>Sar i bhfad beidh an Bille i bhfeidhm ach is í an cheist anois conas is féidir an chuid seo den Bhille a chur i bhfeidhm? Tá sé ceart go leor a rá, the university shall do such-and-such, ach caithfear bheith ag machnamh ar mhodhanna chun an dualgas sin a chur i gcrích: cuirim i gcás, b'fhéidir, bord na Gaeilge a chur ar bun laistigh den ollscoil faoi mar atá againn i gColáiste na hOllscoile i gCorcaigh. Tá bord na Gaeilge againn san ollscoil mar fhochoiste den choiste riartha agus tá sé de dhualgas sollúnta ar an mbord sin an Ghaeilge a chur ar aghaidh laistigh den ollscoil in an-chuid slite agus i nGaeltacht Chorca Dhuibhne, agus mar sin de, agus déarfainn go bhfuil ag éirí go geal leis sin.  Ní miste bord nó coiste éigin mar sin a chur ar bun.  Cheana féin tá coiste Gaeilge laistigh de Choláiste Thua-Mhumhan, agus, mar sin, molaim go leanfaí leis an socrú sin laistigh den Ollscoil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="916" /> We must also wonder how the section on the Irish language and culture should be applied in terms of entry requirements. The least, I suggest, that should be expected here is that Irish should be retained as a mandatory entry requirement for trainee teachers because for one thing the ceard-teastas is involved here. As I said already, if the achievements of Thomond College are to be preserved and expanded it is essential that Irish should be retained as an entry requirement for teacher training.  It is not too unreasonable also to suggest &mdash; and here we are moving away from the Thomond College element into the university as a whole &mdash; that if, in future, in any case where the university will establish a second language requirement for entry to university courses Irish should be recognised to fulfil such a requirement.  That is the very least we should expect if we are not to be ashamed altogether.  If there is to be a second language requirement, the Irish language should be recognised in this way.</P>
    <P>There should be new degree courses considered and the post-graduate section developed.  This is all something for the staff to consider.  We might envisage new degree courses such as BA in bilingual communications, BA in Irish studies, evening BA and so on, so that this will also be a way of fulfiling and giving life to section 10 of the Bill.  As the Minister knows, status has a great deal to do with personal advancement, personal rank and title and so on.  Therefore, it might also be considered that a professorship should be established in the course of time to give academic leadership in the post-graduate area in particular.  In other words, Irish should have the same status and ranking in the university as any other major subject.  The university should have the same relationship with bodies like the national Bord na Gaeilge and the HEA and the Department where Irish activities are concerned, and should have parity with other universities in support of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to draw the attention of the House to a more general point in all this, that is the general position of <Col N="917" /> Irish in the universities.  I was looking quite recently again at Eoin MacNeill's famous tract &ldquo;Irish in the National University of Ireland &mdash; a plea for Irish Education&rdquo;, which, of course, was a main argument in the adoption of Irish as a compulsory subject for matriculation in NUI.  Even after the passage of all these years, and in entirely changed circumstances, it is a very powerfully argued and a very compelling piece of polemic. Who can take issue with his central statement that a distinctive national culture should be both inwardly fostered and outwardly displayed by the new national university?  That might well be taken as a headline for the University of Limerick and, indeed, for the Dublin City University as well, and why not for Trinity College?  What law of inferiority complex is there in this country that somehow one must never think of Trinity as having any obligations in respect of our national language and culture?  Why should Trinity be immune from what should be an honour and responsibility?  MacNeill's statement that the national university should both inwardly foster and outwardly display distinctive national culture would be a good headline for the new universities to follow.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister had a chance yesterday to read a very interesting, brief article in <i>The Irish Times</i> by the Registrar of University College, Cork, Professor Aidan Moran, a man who is very far from being a fanatic; he is not even a Gaelgeoir and yet it seems to him, as an educationalist, that we are at a very crucial time in respect of the status of Irish in our third level institutions. He feels that the matric obligation of Irish in the NUI is one of the things that is keeping Irish in the schools and he believes that if Irish disappeared altogether as a matriculation requirement for the NUI and for the new universities into which the NUI will break up there will be a knock-on effect throughout the whole educational system.</P>
    <P>Already in many schools Irish has now only a token presence and the students are no longer considering the NUI as long <Col N="918" /> as that requirement is there.  Up to now, it has to be said, the University of Limerick and the Dublin City University, in Professor Moran's words have offered very little support in their interest requirements to specifically Irish cultural values. This is why I particularly welcome section 10 of this Bill.  In fact, Professor Moran's statement is not too exaggerated when he says that within a very short number of years, if Irish loses its place in the educational system, summer school students coming in from the United States and elsewhere who will be given a course in Irish studies, such as we have had in UCC for the last decade or so, will know more about the culture of the country than many of our own students.  If they do not get a specifically Irish approach to the Irish language other areas of the curriculum offers them very little.  History is now very much a minority subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>His main point is right, that it is time for the State at this point to clarify and define its policy as regards the Irish language and culture and section 10 in this Bill could be the beginning of this.  It now unapologetically imposes the Irish culture requirement on the University of Limerick.  It is anomalous that Dublin City University does not have to have regard to the Irish dimension.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the fact that these universities were set up <i>pari passu</i>.  Even though, as I recall on that occasion, there was a much greater <Col N="919" /> Irish language content in the NIHE Dublin prospectus at that time than in Limerick, the anomaly is there as regards the Dublin City University.  As I have said already in relation to Trinity College &mdash; now coming up to its 400th anniversary &mdash; it is not too short a period of time for it to become absorbed into the nation in this way and to have regard to its Irish language obligations.  I hope that the potential and the logic of this section will give the Government pause, food for thought and will, perhaps, result in a more general policy.  Meanwhile I have great pleasure in supporting this Bill.  We should all promise it our help as well as congratulating the Minister.</P>

      <P>I welcome this progressive legislation and I compliment the Minister on bringing it forward.  I welcome the amalgamation of Thomond College with the new University of Limerick and the importance she attaches to the fact that the expertise that has been professionally built up over the years by Thomond in its various fields will be retained and developed in the new merged college.  I also welcome the fact that an extra 600 to 700 places will be available in the expansion of expertise in the areas of science, engineering and business studies. I am delighted that the Minister clarified the position in relation to the word &ldquo;dissolved&rdquo;, the legal connotations in relation to that and the fact that she would prefer to see the words &ldquo;amalgamation&rdquo; or &ldquo;merger&rdquo; being used, but for legal purposes that will not be the case.  Everyone understands exactly what <Col N="920" /> is meant by the definition.  As a teacher of business studies in relation to business organisation I always explained the difference between mergers and amalgamations as opposed to take-overs. Mergers and amalgamations are a type of a friendly understanding and coming together of interests, whereas a take-over is a type of oppression and there can be opposition to it in relation to any developments. I am glad the Minister sees this as a friendly amalgamation and merger.</P>
      <P>The Minister rightly paid tribute to the board of Thomond over the years and the service they have given to all the teachers who graduated from that college.  I am privileged, as a second level teacher, to have served with graduates of Thomond College over the years.  The professionalism, dedication and service those people have shown down through the years both in terms of their own subject and in relation to what Senator Murphy talked about, in regard to the Irish cultural heritage, has been second to none.  I am privileged to have known a number of the staff of Thomond College. In fact, in 1973 members of the present staff of Thomond were involved in the first remedial education programme that was set up.  I was one of the lucky people who did that remedial course and was amazed to see at first hand the type of professionalism and dedication people gave to the teaching arena.  I am glad the Minister paid tribute to both the board and the staff and this amalgamation can do nothing but good for the new University of Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom ag an bpointe seo mo bhuíochas a ghabháil agus comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire maidir le alt a 10, mar a luaigh an Seanadóir Murphy, i dtaobh áit na teanga, agus go bhfuil bunús dlí leis sa Bhille seo.  Bhí roinnt faitís ar dhaoine a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge agus i gcultúr na tíre go ndearnadh dearmad ar an teanga agus ar chultúr na tíre, cultúr a bhí mar chuid thábhachtach de shaothar Choláiste Thua-Mhumhan le blianta anuas.  Sílim go raibh faitíos ar dhaoine, b'fhéidir, nuair a thiocfadh an amalgamation sin go ndéanfaí dearmad den teanga in Ollscoil Luimnigh <Col N="921" /> féin.  Tá an-áthas ormsa go bhfuil an t-alt sin curtha isteach ag an Aire, mar, ó thaobh an teanga a choimeád, ní hiad na múinteoirí a bheidh ag teacht amach amháin a bheidh i gceist ach an ollscoil ar fad.  Tá sé de dhualgas ar gach éinne againn, go mórmhór sinne mar mhúinteoirí agus mar dhaoine a bhfuil suim againn sa teanga, í a chur chun cinn aon uair is féidir linn, rud atá iontach tábhachtach.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Murphy, is rud amháin alt a 10 a chur isteach sa Bhille ach is rud eile é an obair a dhéanamh ar chúrsaí Gaeilge.  Tá mise i mo bhall den ghrúpa stiúrtha a bhunaigh an tAire Comhshaoil roinnt blianta ó shin chun úsáid na Gaeilge a spreagadh go deonach, ar fud an chórais rialtais áitiúil, agus is é an tOllamh Máirtín Ó Murchú, atá ina Stiúrthóir ar Scoil an Léinn Cheiltigh, cathaoirleach an choiste sin.  Bhí sé de phribhléid agam tamall ó shin bheith in éineacht leis an Aire agus cuairt á tabhairt againn ar Scoil an Léinn Cheiltigh agus lucht na scoile sin, agus iad ag taispeáint dúinn an méid atá déanta acu le 50 bliain anuas agus an méid atá le déanamh fós.  Bhí a bhean chéile ann freisin, Helen Ó Murchú, atá mar iarchathaoirleach ar Bhord na Gaeilge.</P>

Is rud an-tábhachtach é sin maidir leis an Ghaeilge a choimeád beo.  Mar sin, ba mhaith liom arís, m'fhíorbhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire as ucht alt a 10 a chur isteach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tradition and history of Thomond and its excellent record in matters relating to the Irish language and culture can <Col N="922" /> do nothing but enhance the whole status of the new university.  The Minister has recognised that.  The Irish language will not be seen as a specific element in just one corner of the campus of the university but she has ensured by inserting section 10, that the whole ethos and development of the Irish language will become part of the university.  That is extremely important. We must ensure that this important legislation in relation to the Irish language becomes a reality and that the ethos that is Thomond will permeate throughout the new University of Limerick. We must also ensure that our heritage, culture and our language that we are so proud of will be given high priority in all sectors of the campus of the new university.</P>
    <P>We in the mid-west region are extremely proud of the new University of Limerick.  Great tributes have been paid to Dr. Walsh and all the staff there in the development of the university and the excellence that is attached to it.  I see the amalgamation as being, in economic parlance, a horizontal integration not a vertical intergration.  In time to come the Minister will be seen as being an enlightened Minister for Education and this legislation will be seen as extremely progressive and will enhance the third level area of our nation.  I welcome the Bill and I give it my 100 per cent support.</P>

      <P>This legislation represents a commonsense and rational approach to meeting the needs of third level education in the south and mid-west regions.  In merging those two third level institutions one is moving towards an even stronger, more vibrant and dynamic third level sector in that entire region. Limerick, due to its location will also serve as a university to other parts of the <Col N="923" /> country.  It will not just serve the mid-west or the south or any other specific area.</P>
      <P>There is the added dimension that in the new merged institution more third level places will be available.  This, in itself, is extremely welcome.  I do not want to be critical of the new development but it is unfortunate that this did not take place last year when more students could have been accommodated and enjoy third level education.  However, we welcome the new development and we are very proud of it.  I would like to make the point that Limerick campaigned long and hard for establishment of a university in the city or its environs.  It is appropriate that Limerick, being the third largest city, would have a university.  One is glad to see the various disciplines that can be studied and followed by students in the new university.  It would be my wish that, as time progresses, further disciplines could be included in the curriculum.</P>
      <P>Reference was made earlier to Dr. Ed Walsh.  I would like to be associated with the words of praise and support for him, a man of stature, calibre and entrepreneurship. The students in Limerick University are totally behind this initiative and they have played a very constructive and imaginative role in this venture.  These young people are to be congratulated, together with others, in this regard.  All of us realise that two major institutions are coming together and I, in common with other speakers, will avoid using the word &ldquo;dissolution&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The University of Limerick, formerly known as the NIHE, and Thomond College of Education were established by Acts of these Houses in 1980.  These Acts are almost the same.  Both institutions deserve to be congratulated for the manner in which they discharged their respective roles over the years.  They have proved their worth and significance in the development of third level education in the country generally but in the south-west and mid-west in particular. The effect of this development will be felt in Limerick city and the adjacent area.  I <Col N="924" /> live within a mile of the new university and I am very proud of that development.</P>
    <P>The 1980 Act gave a statutory base to Thomond College but the college was established in 1973.  Thomond College has developed a range of expertise and resources in the areas of education, particularly physical education, recreation and leisure, technology and physical science, agricultural and horticultural science, biographical science, business administration, business education, the humanities, arts and a number of other vital areas.  The functions of Thomond College were given legal effect with the passing of the Thomond College of Education Act, 1980.  That Act allocated certain functions to the college.</P>
    <P>One can say that Thomond College over the years has endeavoured to carry out these responsibilities and functions by providing undergraduate and post-graduate diploma and degree programmes, research and consultancy work.  The paramount importance of the college, however, and its area of greatest distinction has been in the fulfilment of its role of providing teacher education. Over the years since its inception, it has trained teachers in various disciplines to the highest possible standard.  The college has also developed in other ways, among which is the optimum utilisation of the knowledge basis required to service the teacher education function in a national and international context and the wider application of this as market-place demands increase.  This led to the development of courses outside teacher education.</P>
    <P>It is important that all aspects of the work carried out in Thomond College should now be transferred intact to the new institutional development.  It is particularly important that the new institutional arrangement caters for the education and professional preparation of teachers, in-service education and training, research and consultancy in areas related to the expertise of the college, development of designated and emerging programmes and initiatives in areas related to the expertise of the college.</P>
    <P>All due credit must go to the working <Col N="925" /> party comprised of Thomond College of Education, University of Limerick and the Higher Education Authority which provided the agreed framework for this legislation.  The working party identified the legislative requirement of repealing the Thomond College of Education Limerick Act, 1980 and the various reorganisational and management and academic structures which will be necessary to enable the integration to go ahead.  In identifying the university's mission, which is the pursuit of excellence in teaching and research to the highest level, particularly in areas adjudged to be of strategic benefit to the economic and social development of Ireland, the working group have also take cognisance of the guiding inspiration which was already referred to, the college motto of Thomond, &ldquo;ar fheabhas Thua-Mhumhan&rdquo;, meaning the best in the world.  This is something that cannot be overstated. That motto was chosen by Thomond College. Its track record justifies it.  The college has interpreted its ideal by implementing its functions in a way that has exploited the virtues of its size, flexibility and openness to change.  Thomond College looks forward to the expansion and further invigoration of its role in the new university structure.</P>
    <P>The arrival of Thomond College at the University of Limerick Plassey campus will mean that new institutional arrangements will have to be put in place.  This means that a fourth college will now be added to the university.  The working group recommended that the academic council of the university should be enlarged to allow the former college to have adequate and proportionate representation on the council.  They emphasised the need to ensure that the existing student body at Thomond College of Education be guaranteed that when they complete their course of studies they will receive the level of award to which their current recognised programme entitles them.</P>
    <P>The age old origins of universities and their ties with the humanities have given universities their special aura, ethos and distinctive qualities over the centuries.  I compliment the Minister for taking on <Col N="926" /> board proposals that were put forward in the other House with regard to section 10 which preserves what was described earlier as the Irish ethos.</P>
    <P>With regard to the composition of the governing body, it is vitally important particularly in the early days of rationalisation, amalgamation and assimilation that maximum participation in the governing body by the new constitutent college be provided for.  I propose that until the governing body goes out of existence next year members of the staff of Thomond College form part of that body.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the regional technical colleges, the growth of the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges and the emergence of the former NIHEs at Limerick and Glasnevin were all part of the massive expansion of the system.  This has given rise to a much better range of choice for the student emerging from second level and has brought about a very welcome element of competition among third level institutions themselves.  There is an acute consciousness of excellence and high standards being the final determinant. The new colleges have energised the whole system.  They have brought a new atmosphere of excitement and innovation to third level.  They have been good for the traditional third level institutions in that everybody has had to respond to the demands, competition and challenges of the era.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the leading role of the University of Limerick in this.  I also pay tribute to the Minister for Education for her part in putting this legislation together.  I look forward to further disciplines and areas of study being made available to students not alone in Limerick but in the whole catchment area that university serves.</P>

      <P>It was extremely well presented.  I was also taken by Senator Murphy's reference to the president of the University of Limerick's disapproval or disagreement of Newman's idea of a university.  I could not help thinking, in the Limerick context, that I was not sure which Newman he was talking about. There is another Newman in Limerick with a very different idea of a university.</P>
      <P>I am glad we are dealing with this Bill. The idea of a technological university is a bit shaky, not because there is anything wrong with third level technological education &mdash; it is the sector in which I have built whatever sort of an academic career I have &mdash; but because it is important to keep technology in perspective.  It is a servant of humanity, not a master.  It is something we use to make the quality of life better and not something that takes over our lives.  That is true of work, business, enterprise and education.  We must remember that the ultimate objective is a better quality of life for people, not more goods and services <i>per se</i> but more goods and services that give people a better quality of life.  That necessitates the perpetual maintenance of humanity at the centre of any system of education. My sector of education is somewhat deficient in that.  Because of a somewhat philosophically narrow view of the role of the RTCs in the past, the need for the underlying breadth of education is somewhat less than visible, in the range of subjects available in the RTCs and the virtual non-development of any area of the humanities, with occasional exceptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Changes in technology come out of a way of thinking which the humanities can often stimulate.  For instance, many of our technological universities have not been particularly good at looking at the increasing pressures on the environmental security of this planet.  Most of the feed-out about the environment has come from outside the mainstream of <Col N="928" /> academe and they respond to other people rather than create the thinking themselves.  The whole area of science and technology very often has to catch up with public opinion in the area of the environment.  This suggests that where people are training to be at the forefront of technology, there must be a requirement that they can think laterally and not just think in terms of their discipline and that they are stimulated by ideas from outside their specialisation and do not become ghettoised.  Ghettos are not always grim.  You can be ghettoised in a palace as much as in a slum.  You can be ghettoised in technological education as much as anywhere else.</P>
    <P>I am glad, therefore, that the injection of new people through the incorporation of the Mary Immaculate College, will provide different perspectives, values and ideas.  It would be good because the University of Limerick seems to have taken on the image of being a centre of somewhat eccentric ideas.  I am fascinated that a senior official believes the Government cannot create jobs while all the jobs in the same university are created by the Government and paid for by the taxpayer.  I am fascinated by the suggestion that taxation in this country is causing emigration to Germany where taxation is just as high, by the suggestion that our country has been ruined by a succession of pink Governments, all of which suggestions have emanated from senior officials of that university and, indeed, the suggestion that we should join NATO in order that we should have an arms industry.  I hope a broader vision of society and the world will result in some dilution of the expression of those ideas.</P>
    <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh alt a 10 den Bhille seo faoi mhúineadh na Gaeilge agus faoi áit na Gaeilge sa chóras oideachais.  Tá, mar a dúirt mo chara, an Seanadóir Murphy, deacrachtaí againn anois os rud é nach bhfuil an dualgas céanna ar an DCU, agus níl dualgas ar bith ar na coláistí réigiúnacha.  Ba chóir dúinn leathnú amach agus smaointe nua a chaitheamh timpeall faoi cheist na Gaeilge mar níl aon easpa dea-thola ann.</P>
    <P>In the question of the Irish language, we should not be intimidated by people. <Col N="929" /> riding certain hobby-horses.  There was, for instance, an <i>Irish Times</i> opinion poll about parents' views on second level education and <i>The Irish Times</i> misrepresented its own opinion poll.  They said that the opinion poll showed the majority of parents in favour of reducing the Irish content in second level education. It did not.  It showed that the single greatest group, which was 45 per cent, wanted a reduction.  The other two groups, about 30 per cent, wanted it to remain the same and 25 per cent wanted it increased.  Twenty five per cent and 30 per cent is 55 per cent.  That represents the majority of parents who want either the Irish language content of second level education to remain the same or to be increased.  Therefore, as regards the langauge, let us not be shanghaied in a way that is neither consistent with public opinion nor in the country's interest.</P>
    <P>Arís cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo agus roimh an Aire.  Ní fheadar an bhfuil sí chomh hiontach agus a deir daoine ar an taobh eile.  Ach tá jab maith déanta aici agus tá sí sásta glacadh le tuairimí agus fealsúnachtaí nua agus leanúint ar aghaidh le forbairt an oideachais.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators who spoke and committed themselves to the centre &mdash; Senators Jackman, Mullooly, Murphy, McKenna, Hourigan, Ryan and Ó Cuív.  There were seven remarkable contributions.  I do not know if this is a record but each contributor welcomed the Bill and welcomed me.  I am sure Senators are very hospitable anyway.  The hospitability usually wears away after about two lines but on this occasion it did not.  The Bill received a very positive welcome and I thank Senators for that. In return I will pay a compliment to some Senators.  I was here two years ago for the other Bill.  It was in the middle of a general election and I came up from Athlone.  The Bill had passed through the Dáil and we wanted it to pass through the Seanad because the students were to receive their degrees from the new universities.  Various Senators, particularly Senator Murphy and others, brought forward an amendment rather on the lines of what we have now arrived at in section 10, which has received universal approval.  At the time I was in a bit of a state because I would have liked to have accepted it but to do so would have meant that the Bill would have had to go back to the Dáil.  It would have been too late for what we wanted.  Subsequent events, as we all know, meant that it was quite a long time before the Dáil was formed.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy said that he felt that on some occasions at least the House is listened to.  That was certainly one occasion.  He remarked upon the similarity of the measure we have introduced. I replied, jocosely, but not really, that we had plagiarised what he had said.  The Leader of the House has reported to me that the House had expressed the sentiment that the Bill would contain a very positive section in relation to the Irish language.  So in a very positive way the wishes of this House have been enshrined in the Bill.  It was introduced and we were glad to have it amended in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general welcome for the Bill is gratifying.  Senator Jackman has a very comprehensive knowledge of the courses obtaining in each college and how the best of them could be retained.  She <Col N="931" /> praised the students and pointed out the need for a capital injection to be made. We will attend to that.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly gave us an interesting, historical narrative on the background to the colleges.  We welcomed the insertion of the section dealing with the Irish language.  Senator Murphy recalled what he said several years ago in Limerick, that there should be one college and that the two could form one.  He praised the president, Ed Walsh and added a <i>caveat</i> about technology, which was later repeated by Senator Ryan, that we should not be overcome by the wonders of technology.  He quoted the words of Eoin MacNeill that Irish and Irish language studies should be inwardly fostered and outwardly displayed.</P>
    <P>Senator McKenna welcomed the Bill. He was delighted with section 10 and spoke very strongly, as Gaeilge.  He asked that the ethos of Thomond be extended into the college.  Senator Hourigan gave an interesting account of the long campaign for a university in Limerick. Full credit to the working party. They will be very pleased.  They worked very diligently in a short period of time. I gave a commitment in the Dáil that the Minister of the day would have regard to the nominees of what had been Thomond College.  He would like to see further areas of study developed in the various third level institutions.  Senator Ryan said technology should be kept in perspective and that it is the quality of life rather than the increasing consumer services or goods which should always be kept to the fore. I could not have put it better myself. He welcomed the Bill and particularly section 10.  He spoke about the need for other colleges to look at this development. Senator Ó Cuív gave a very warm welcome to the Bill and is delighted with section 10.</P>
    <P>The welcome the Bill received in the Dáil was genuine but I am constantly refreshed by the breadth of experience and the level of understanding Senators have of Bills such as this when they come to this House.  It was very obvious that Members had studied the Bill.  I stayed in the House for the two hours to note <Col N="932" /> all that was said.  One thing which was said struck me.  It was in relation to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday by Professor Moran of UCC with regard to where are we going with the Irish language and teaching in schools.  His comments may have been stark perhaps but he had several very timely shots across our bows.  Senator Murphy said that perhaps this section was a very demanding and challenging way in which the Irish language and culture is now being enshrined in this legislation.  It is all very well to have grand language but this is the intent and purpose of this Bill.  It can serve as a pointer to the thinking of both Houses of the Oireachtas across party lines on this matter.  I would like that to be the guiding light.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank Thomond College, the staff and the governing bodies concerned.  They bring with them much benefit to their new college.  I would not like them to think they are going into an institution that will gobble them.  I see them as bringing with them great attributes, an ethos, experience and a wider view of many things which will be of great benefit to the admirable institution.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a tribute to Ed Walsh for the way he runs the college, the way he gathers the nicest people around and gets things moving.  There is a very good future ahead of this University of Limerick in its new status.  It is interesting as Limerick is celebrating the 300th anniversary of the Treaty of Limerick; Senator Jackman referred to this. Senator Fallon and I come from a town which is equally famed: I refer to 1691. They went to Limerick after various stops en route, at Aughrim and elsewhere.  It is an interesting year for Senator Jackman's city and our town, and is a year we are celebrating in our various ways.  We salute Limerick and wish it well, particularly the University of Limerick in its new status.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of state to the House and thank him for coming in to answer this short debate. The debate will be short but my motion was rather long and all encompassing in order that I might be able to convey to the Office of Public Works the feelings and attitudes of people in the immediate areas serviced by the Lough Allen canal and, in a wider sense, the north Roscommon-mid-Leitrim region which depends to such a great extent on tourism revenue.</P>
      <P>The origins of the Lough Allen canal are well known to the Office of Public Works and to the people of the locality from where I come.  It was operated in the 1830s onwards for commercial traffic. In 1935 it was finally blocked off by the Electricity Supply Board in order that Lough Allen would be used as a reservoir for the power generating station at Ardnacrusha. That was the case until 1975 when my late father, as a result of agitation and persistent lobbying, for which he was extremely well known, managed to convince the Government that the long term future of the area and indeed of the north Shannon region would be best served by reopening the Lough Allen canal.  Fortunately the engineering works involved were not as extensive as many parties who had resisted the idea testified, because the ESB had not filled in the canal.  They had simply dammed it at the Lough Allen end at Black Rock outside Drumshanbo in order to prevent navigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the reopening of the canal in 1975 the economic impact of cruiser traffic, an increasing source of tourist revenue not only in our part of the country but indeed throughout Ireland, has manifested itself to such an extent that businesses in the immediate <Col N="934" /> area of Drumshanbo, Leitrim, Cootehall and the smaller villages are now benefiting to a very significant degree from the number of people coming up the Lough Allen canal.</P>
    <P>It has certain limitations.  Its narrowness has meant that as cruisers have been built larger and larger only a particular type of cruiser has been able to access into the canal and through the lock at Battlebridge and Drumleague. Obviously, this limited access cannot be overcome but I feel that the Office of Public Works &mdash; I say this with the greatest of reluctance &mdash; have been dragged, kicking and screaming into making a decision, initially to reopen two-thirds of the canal and have, subsequently, through whatever means at their disposal, resisted rather than accepting with enthusiasm the concept that the remainder of the canal into Lough Allen should be reopened.  I am sure the Minister will rebut this allegation and will have plenty to tell us as to the contrary.  I feel I would be failing in my duty here in this House if I were not to reflect the views and attitudes not only of the people of the immediate area which is under discussion, but of my parliamentary colleagues in County Roscommon and County Leitrim who benefit to a considerable degree from the canal's availability to cruiser traffic.  It is in that context and that spirit that I hope the Minister will accept the motives behind this motion.  I am simply attempting to convey to the Office of Public Works that they have a great responsibility to ensure that not only is the canal kept navigable but that it is properly maintained.</P>
    <P>I had occasion in recent days to visit the area which I have brought to the attention of the Minister, from the lock at Drumleague-Battlebridge as far as Drumharbour bridge.  This is an area of unspoiled natural beauty.  It is rural and is only some three miles from the town of Drumshanbo.  It has a county road running alongside the canal.  I have, reluctantly, to testify in this House that it would be almost impossible if a boat was on the canal to see if there was one there and for those people who are on the canal it would be an impossibility for them to see beyond the bushes, trees and <Col N="935" /> the overgrown vegetation I encountered during my visit to that area.  I remember in 1975 and subsequent to it when the canal was reopened that there was a clear view, particularly in this portion that is under discussion, of the area surrounding the canal.</P>
    <P>All I ask is that the Office of Public Works would ensure that there is regular maintenance work done in that area.  My information &mdash; I wait with great interest to be enlightened by the Minister as to the contrary &mdash; is that it is over two years since any cuttings took place along the banks of the canal, that they are done in a two yearly cycle and that the next one is not due until later this year.  The Minister with us tonight, like myself, comes from a rural area and I am sure he will agree that in recent months due to the vagaries of the climate there has been an explosion of vegetation throughout rural Ireland, that there has been a growth far faster than anybody could have anticipated and that local authorities have been inundated with requests to try and reduce the amount of vegetation.  It has got to the stage in some towns and country lanes where it is like going into the Third World.  It would not be an exaggeration to suggest to the House in the presence of the Minister that my experience of the area under discussion was akin to going into a jungle.</P>
    <P>I know this view will be rebutted; I know the official view will be that the Office of Public Works are taking every step necessary to ensure that the canal is free of any hindrance and inhibition and that if anybody went down the canal they would have no difficulty in negotiating it. I will not argue with that.  In fact, I will agree with it totally, but I am arguing that we do not just have a canal which is, as it was originally, for taking commercial traffic, for barges going up and down, because the men and women who work the barges could not care less if they never saw what was beyond the banks. We are talking here about tourist traffic. We are talking about people who are taking the initiative and are going up into an area near my home for the first time. I have no doubt whatsoever that as these intrepid travellers wend their way up the <Col N="936" /> narrow canal, having come out at the Drumleague lock, they begin to wonder if they made the right decision considering some of the overgrowth, the bushes and the overhanging trees that will meet them as they go along this narrow stretch of canal.</P>
    <P>This portion of the canal needs more regular maintenance than it has been experiencing to date.  There is the environmental impact.  Obviously people who go up a canal in a boat are taking a leisurely trip, akin to a walk in the forest or a walk along a country lane.  They are not in a tremendous hurry to get from point A to point B and they are exploring. They want to see just what the countryside has to offer.  I hope the Minister, if he ever has the time, or somebody from the Office of Public Works, will take a trip up that canal because all one can see is very heavy vegetation.  I do not think, in the circumstances, that that is permissible.</P>
    <P>I touched briefly on the commitment of the Office of Public Works to the maintenance of this portion of the canal.  I have tremendous admiration for the Office of Public Works.  One has only got to look at some of the glorious manifestations of their skill and of their handiwork in various parts of the country. Indeed, in my own county within the last 12 months I was privileged to be present at the official opening of Parke Castle outside Dromahair, a magnificent example of the Office of Public Works at their very best.  Unfortunately, I believe that the Lough Allen canal from Leitrim to Drumshanbo is the Office of Public Works at their magnificent worst.</P>
    <P>In the context of the tourist impact on the area under question, I touched on the question of the opening of the remainder of the Lough Allen canal.  I want to put on record and I hope it will be conveyed to the powers that be, that there is great concern within my area that with the re-opening of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal the matter of re-opening of the Lough Allen canal will be put on an even longer finger than it has been on for the last 30 years.</P>
    <P>While saying that, I welcome enthusiastically and reflect the enthusiasm in my area for the re-opening of the canal.  We <Col N="937" /> welcome the Government's commitment to an ultimate expenditure of some £30 million on re-opening that stretch of the canal.  It can only benefit my own area as well as Leitrim town, Cashcarrigan and indeed right down to Cootehall, Lough Key and the Shannon waterway itself. The concern is that once the canal is up and running and that it is being marketed, as I am sure it will be, as somebody said at the official launch last year, which the Taoiseach attended, it will be marketed in a similar way to that of the Lakes of Killarney.  I hope that will be the case. There is concern that if the remainder of the Lough Allen canal is not re-opened and cruiser traffic does not have navigable access to the first lake on the Shannon, the towns and villages around Drumshanbo and its immediate environment will suffer economically.</P>
    <P>What are we talking about?  We are not talking about £30 million, we are not even talking about a fraction of £30 million.  I hope the Minister will be able to put some figure on it in his reply because I indicated that I am anxious to know what the up-to-date position is in relation to the survey carried out last year to indicate its viability, etc.  Figures have been put together by many excellent community groups in the area that would suggest that the re-opening of the canal would cost no more than £1 million or £1.5 million. Keeping in mind that 75 per cent of any cost could be recouped from the European Community and the remainder, a portion of which could be recouped by those who would be taken off the unemployment lines by paying PRSI income tax, and the subsequent reduction to the social welfare bill, the net cost to the Exchequer, I suggest, would be miniscule in the context of the massive economic impact it would have on my part of the country.  I hope the Minister will keep that in mind when dealing with costings in his reply.</P>
    <P>Two-thirds of the canal were reopened so we are talking only about the remainder, which is only about 300 meters.  In fact one could walk it in three minutes. I appreciate that there are engineering difficulties which perhaps the Minister may refer to in his reply.  I do not wish to diminish those engineering difficulties.  I <Col N="938" /> want to put on record that there is a complete, harmonious and unanimous view of not only tourist and business interests but of farming interests as well, that the remainder of the Lough Allen canal should be reopened.</P>
    <P>My late father, the former Senator Joseph Mooney, had the foresight, some three years before the reopening of part of the canal, to encourage the local authority, Leitrim County Council, to spend money on developing Acres Lake.  He hoped ultimately that boats would come up the Shannon through the reopened canal.  His foresight was to pay off and indeed has been paying off in spades, to use a card playing term.  We now have the most magnificent amenity area at Acres Lake, an open air heated swimming pool, childrens' playground, two hard tennis courts and a beautiful vista for anybody who wishes to visit, by boat or by car.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the Acres Lake development is ongoing, I know it is in keeping with the plans the Government have for developing onshore facilities right throughout the entire Shannon navigation system.  It is a priority of Bord Fáilte.  It is important that that be done. Obviously, in the context of the reopening of the remainder of the canal into Lough Allen, it is vital that there is ongoing development at Acres Lake.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that perhaps there might be some case to answer about having a national canals policy.  Perhaps there is already the germ of an idea in the Office of Public Works towards that end.  I know that the predecessor of the Minister of State in charge of the Office of Public Works, now Minister for Defence, had some ideas on that regard.  If there was a national policy for canals I might not have to stand up here on occasion trying to justify what is obvious, something that would benefit our area.</P>
    <P>Will there be a decision from the Office of Public Works and the Department of Finance on whether the Lough Allen canal will be reopened?  I know that this will not be an easy fight.  It was not an easy fight to convince the powers that be over 30 years that there was a future for the canal.  I am afraid as a result of what seems to be an apparent neglect of continuing and regular maintenance along <Col N="939" /> the canal, that it has allowed go into decline.  There seems to be an official view that, &ldquo;Well, we have it open after a long struggle.  We did not really want it open in the first place but now that it is open we have to let on that we are doing something about it.&rdquo;  I do not think that is good enough.</P>
    <P>It is something that needs to be addressed on a regular basis, I hope the Minister will give me some commitment that there will be a regular monitoring of the maintenance of the canal, that there will be an opportunity for people using the canal to see out beyond the bushes and the trees and that I will not have to come in here in six or 12 months time to put a similar motion before the House.</P>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that this is not a witch-hunt against the Office of Public Works nor any of their personnel. It is born of a frustration and a serious concern that there is less than wholehearted commitment to continuing tourist development in my part of the country and that the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal has now clouded the issue at official level to such an extent that that has been seen as Utopia, that now that Leitrim has got its £30 million it should not look for anything else.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that it will prove to be a marvellous advantage.  Already there are people preparing in the towns and villages along the route, buying premises, doing up their houses, building new houses.  There is a tremendous air of excitement around the route of the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal.  Surely it is not too much to ask the Government to help here.  They have shown their infinite capacity to help whenever help is needed. This was demonstrated by the courageous decision of the Taoiseach to push the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell project through.  This was done in the face of a lot of opposition.  However, the officials in the Office of Public Works are represented at Cabinet level in the fight for the reopening of the remainder of the Lough Allen Canal and at the same time to ensure that this area of beauty is a place people will want to visit and not leave, saying, &ldquo;Why should we go back <Col N="940" /> there again?  They do not even cut the hedges&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Lough Allen canal forms part of the River Shannon navigation and is situated in County Leitrim as outlined by the Senator.  It extends from Battlebridge on the River Shannon to Drumshanbo near the southern shores of Lough Allen.</P>
      <P>It was originally constructed during the years 1818 to 1822 by the Directors General of Inland Navigation who were responsible for the promotion, construction and maintenance of all public inland navigation in the early part of the last century and whose successors, with the exception of a period of about six years, have since been the Commissioners of Public Works.  The provision of this navigable link between the River Shannon and Lough Allen, which by-passed a stretch of the river beset with rapids, was for the purpose of transporting coal, clay and iron from the western shores of Lough Allen, near Arigna. The Lough Allen canal did not succeed in developing the coal or iron works to any extent nor did it generate any worthwhile volume of traffic.  The construction of the railway link from Dromod to Arigna towards the end of the last century provided a quicker and more convenient means of transport and commercial traffic on the canal ceased entirely about 1930.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The canal was maintained in a navigable condition until 1936 when, as a result of the development of the storage basin in Lough Allen by the Electricity Supply Board for power purposes, it was necessary to cut off the water supply from the lake to the canal.  Thus the navigation link between the River Shannon and Lough Allen was severed.  No objections were raised at the time and there was no traffic using the canal.  However, there was no formal closure or abandonment of the canal but maintenance was for many years confined to clearing parts of the canal bed of obstructions and keeping the back drains in a clean condition.  In all, there was a total of about six and a half miles of back drains running parallel <Col N="941" /> to the canal on both sides, for drainage purposes.</P>
    <P>The canal is some four and a quarter miles long and traverses Acres Lake, a small lake in its upper reaches near Drumshanbo.  Much of the canal is cut through bogland and the remainder is through soft clay and rock.  The canal rises from Battlebridge to Drumshanbo bridge by about 22 feet at summer level. The ascent is by way of a loch at Battlebridge which gives a 12 foot rise and by a further lock at Drumleague which gives a 10 foot rise.  The canal has a base width of about 12 feet and a top width at navigation level of about 30 feet.  The locks are capable of accommodating vessels up to 64 feet long and with a beam of 13 feet.</P>
    <P>In the mid-sixties interest in the canal was revitalised.  It is not coincidental that it is Senator Mooney who has raised this matter tonight as it was his late father, the highly respected Senator Joseph Mooney, who was among the first to make overtures to the then Taoiseach, Mr. Seán Lemass, and to the Office of Public Works, with a view to having the navigation restored at least from the Shannon as far as Acres Lake.  Many further representations in this matter were made in succeeding years. However, because of the many other commitments to the remainder of the navigation it was not until March 1975 that work finally got under way on this stretch.  The restoration project undertaken by the Commissioners of Public Works consisted of the dredging and removal of silt and debris from the canal bed, repairs to the embankments and locks, fabrication and fitting out of new lock gates, regrading of bank drains and the installation of pumping plant.</P>
    <P>The canal from the Shannon to Acres Lake was re-opened in 1978 and has been operational ever since.  Because of its nature, maintenance of the canal poses no great problems.  I am happy to say that it is still in good navigable condition and there is no reason why boats capable of passing through the locks, having regard to their size, should not use the navigation in this area.  I understand that since the season opened this year up to five cruisers a day have been travelling <Col N="942" /> through the canal to and from Acres Lake.  At weekends this number can be increased substantially.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to the overgrowth and the jungle that exists there. While there is an extensive growth of trees and bushes on both banks of the canal my information is that they do not impede the passage of boats.  The Senator suggested that people want to travel the canal to look at the countryside.  Obviously, I will draw attention to that.</P>
    <P>The first priority is to ensure that the canal is navigable and the second priority is to ensure that if people want to see more of County Leitrim, first and foremost they would use the canal and then, if they want to see the countryside that they would stay for a further period in County Leitrim.  I realise that there is a problem but we must look back to the 1960s when the late Senator Joseph Mooney made the first overtures and revitalised this in 1975 when work began. Fortunately during that period quite a lot was done.  I appreciate that the Senator referred more to the growth on both sides of the canal than to any difficulties which exist there.  He has readily admitted that there are no serious difficulties for boats about 30 feet long with a beam of some 12 to 13 feet.</P>
    <P>More recently, with the decline in the ESB's interest in the lake storage of Lough Allen, considerable pressure has been brought to bear on the Office of Public Works to re-open the remainder of the canal, thus completing the stretch between the Shannon and Lough Allen. I am happy to say that this proposal is currently the subject of full investigation by the commissioners.  Indeed, they have undertaken a preliminary survey of the final half mile between Acres Lake and Lough Allen and a hydrographic survey of Lough Allen which was required to enable the design and cost estimate of a scheme for the extension of the navigation to be finalised.  This has now been completed and is being examined.  Further progress will depend on the findings.</P>
    <P>I am confident that a suitable, viable scheme can be devised and I am hopeful that all being well the necessary resources can be made available to complete the project.  The Senator will appreciate that <Col N="943" /> at this time it is extremely difficult to give any commitment due to the fact that the results of the examination of the hydrographic survey, must be awaited.</P>
    <P>I need hardly say that the large scale investment required for any scheme of works, such as those now proposed, would be futile without the goodwill, support and the back-up of those for whom the works are designed.  I will suggest to my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, that he should visit the area with Senator Mooney and with the officials with responsibility in the Office of Public Works.  I have no doubt that Senator Mooney would make himself available to accompany the Minister.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank Senator Mooney for raising this matter which is vitally important not just for County Leitrim but for all the north-west, because anything that is good for Leitrim is good for another important county.  It is good for Donegal, it is good for Roscommon.  It is indeed good for Connacht and Ulster generally.  I would certainly like to have the opportunity some time of visiting the area.  The Senator can be assured that I shall use my good offices to impress upon the Minister the necessity to visit it at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his comments.  It is significant that here in this House tonight not only <Col N="944" /> is the Cathaoirleach intimately aware and knowledgeable of the motion before the House but that the Minister of State comes from the region and has always shown a personal interest in the tourist development of the area.  I would certainly welcome the Minister, and indeed his wife, to visit our area at any time convenient for them.  I cannot guarantee that we will have a mobile phone on the boat for the Minister in order to keep in touch with his constituents but I am sure he knows he will be as welcome in Leitrim as I have been in County Donegal.</P>
      <P>On a more general level I welcome the response from the Minister.  It was obviously well thought out, as I would have expected from the Office of Public Works.  I am particularly impressed and heartened by what I can only interpret as a very positive response from the commissioners in relation to the reopening of the remainder of the Lough Allen canal and particularly in relation to the fact that they have personally inspected not only the Lough Allen area but the canal itself.  I look forward to the day when the Minister, the Cathaoirleach and myself, with our respective families in tow, will be taking a boat up the remainder of the canal.</P>
