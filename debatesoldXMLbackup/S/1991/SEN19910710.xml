      <P>I have notice from Senator B. Ryan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to discontinue the requirement that all travellers not living in permanent housing must sign on at labour exchanges at 11.30 a.m. on Thursdays.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Ryan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed today to take Second Stage of Item No. 2 &mdash; the Competition Bill, 1991, until 4.30 p.m. There will be sos from 4.30 p.m. to 5 p.m. when we will take Item No. 2 &mdash; all Stages of the Trade and Marketing Promotion Bill, 1991.  Between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. it is proposed to take Item No. 4 &mdash; the Courts Bill, 1991, all Stages &mdash; and also Item No. 5, the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) <Col N="1438" /> (No. 2) Bill, 1990, which is dealing with amendments from the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, may I mention two matters.  First, I would like to welcome the decision by the IOC to readmit South Africa to the Olympic Games.  As one who believes that at times, unfortunately, sport was made an innocent victim, I hope this decision will be followed by further responses in developments and in progress in getting rid of apartheid in South Africa.</P>
      <P>Secondly, Senator Staunton mentioned yesterday Item No. 1 the Altamont (Amendment of Deed of Trust) Bill.  I am wondering if this will be taken next week.  It is important that it be taken before the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I asked on the Order of Business if there would be a debate on agriculture, especially on the CAP reform and I was disappointed when I was told by the Leader of the House that it was not intended to have a debate. Everyone knows that Ireland is very dependent on agriculture, more dependent than any other EC country, and it is in the national interest that we have a viable agricultural industry.  With suggested CAP reforms and other problems, the industry seems to be in a crisis.  Such is the awareness that there is a special debate in the Dáil and it definitely warrants a debate in this House also.  Therefore, I ask the Leader of the House to seriously consider giving time for a debate on agriculture, which is of vital importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to protest about the Order of Business and the inability of this House to debate matters that are really important.  We allocated about six hours yesterday to the Temple Bar Bill but the debate collapsed because there was nobody particularly interested in it.  It seems this House is much more interested in dealing with trivial matters.  Effectively, we have 300,000 unemployed.  Our agriculture is <Col N="1439" /> being decimated by an Irish Commissioner and we are likely to lose about 40,000 jobs as a result of the proposals from the Commissioner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Leader of the House: is he more interested in protecting the Government from being embarrassed than he is about the real issues in the economy?  There is a sense of apathy about what is going on, instead of outrage.  In another era, in another time, there would be a guillotine or a gallows outside and we would have heads rolling.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This may be a failure in communications on my part, but may I ask the Leader of the House to confirm that the absence of Private Members' time today is by agreement, or was it by the decision by the Leader of the House or by what?  There is no Private Members' time today and today is Wednesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the lead from Senator Cosgrave but not on the same issue, may I say, first, that people will not say apartheid is ended in South Africa until everybody <Col N="1440" /> has a vote, an equal vote in a free society. May I slip in congratulations to Kadar Asmal for his extraordinary achievement on his election to the executive committee of the African National Congress as a tribute to his work and indeed a tribute to this country?</P>
    <P>May I also support my colleagues who want to debate two issues which are related, unemployment and agriculture? We need to talk about those things.  I am sure that on the issue of agriculture I will be in a minority of about three in regard to my views on what should be done about it.  It is extremely important that we should confront the issue.  I ask the Leader of the House to confirm that there will be a debate before we adjourn on the collapsing economy of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House when he proposes to take Item No. 15 on the Order Paper?  There are many conventions relating to this order that it is very necessary for us to have signed and implemented here.  The fact that that order is on the Order Paper highlights the need for the establishment of a foreign affairs committee.  There are many items included in this order that would indeed be appropriate to discussion at a foreign affairs committee.  I ask the Leader of the House if he has any update on that point.</P>
      <P>Secondly, with regard to the latest announcements on agriculture, it is necessary that we have a debate on this subject.  Great fears have been raised in the country and there is much discussion on the matter.  There is a lot of mistaken apprehension in some areas with regard to it.  Nevertheless not just people directly concerned with agriculture, but many of the ancillary businesses and service industries related to that sector are very concerned and I think a debate is necessary.  In that regard we shall be giving a lead in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the return of South Africa back to the Olympic movement, supported by the ANC, the Government here should see that as a clear signal for continued urgency in regard to the matter of the rehabilitation of South Africa into <Col N="1441" /> the full international community.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to ask the Senator to put a question to the Leader of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting the question to the Leader of the House to ensure that at national and EC level we move to remove all sanctions against South Africa as quickly as possible to ensure the integration of that country into the international community.  I ask the Leader of the House to request the Minister for Foreign Affairs to ensure that he pursues that course of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two points to make.  First, I wish to support the call that has been made for time to be provided for a debate on agricultural issues.  I am sure the Leader of the House passed in the main gate and saw the spectacle of responsible farmers fasting and sleeping outside the gate.  I am sure he will recall that it is 25 years since we had a similar sit-down on the other side of Leinster House and in view of the events that followed on that occasion we should not have a repeat now.  For that reason I am issuing the strongest appeal to the Leader of the House to provide time for a debate on agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I want to raise with the Leader is in relation to the manner in which this House proposes to deal with the Competition Bill.  We are taking Second Stage today and my information, which is subject to confirmation by the Leader, is that Committee Stage of that Bill will be taken next week.  I want to point out a difficulty I now foresee.  The Minister has indicated that it is his wish to have this Bill through before the recess.  In view of the fact that the Dáil is rising on Friday, what is the point in this House attempting to amend that Bill on Committee Stage next week if there is no Dáil to receive amendments made in this House?  It is on the shoulders of the Leader of the House that the responsibility lies of ensuring that this <Col N="1442" /> House can fully act in discharging its legislative duty, which will be denied to it if it is not possible for it to amend this measure in view of the fact that the Dáil is rising at the weekend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have consistently raised the issue of the worsening income situation in agriculture since the beginning of this term.  I am pleased now that everybody seems to accept that income will drop by 30 per cent by the end of this year.  I have to say I am shocked that the level of reduction in incomes is meriting so little attention in this House because those farmers protesting outside this House and particularly those in agriculture look to us to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that everybody else in the country is now debating it except this House.  I am shocked that this should be the case.  I ask the Leader in the national interest to have a debate on agriculture before the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Raftery for supporting the point I made yesterday during the debate on the Temple Bar Bill that it was most inappropriate that that should be taking up the time of this House.  I would not join him in his comment that it is trivial; in so far as the capital city is concerned it is extremely important.  I ask the Leader of the House to urge the Government to leave matters that are properly the remit of the local authorities to them.  All sides of the House are pressing for debates on agriculture, on unemployment, the economic situation, all of which are extremely urgent, but we are bogged down dealing with matters such as the Temple Bar Bill, which should properly be dealt with by Dublin Corporation.  Will the Leader of the House ask the Government to leave those matters to the local authorities and introduce some local democracy in this country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a day when Telecom Éireann announced a profit of £92 million, I ask the Leader of the House to provide time for a debate.  on the rationalisation necessary to allow an equalisation in telephone charges where it will no longer cost five times more for a telephone charge in rural Ireland?  This is a small island and there is a serious disadvantage to people in business in rural areas who have to pay five times more for their telephone charges than those living in inner Dublin.  I ask the Leader of the House to view this matter with concern in the interests of business people in the rural community.  A debate is now timely in view of the announced profit by Telecom Éireann.</P>

Tá sé seo á lorg agam i gcomhthéacs muintir an iarthair mar is cinnte go mbeidh díthiú feirmeoirí beaga na tíre seo uilig agus nach mbeidh duine acu fanta san iarthar nuair a ghabhann moltaí an EC tríd.  Ba cheart go dtabharfaí am cinnte dúinn chun an cheist tábhachtach seo a phlé.  Iarraim ar an Cheannaire freisin am a chur ar fáil chun cúrsaí Ghaeltachta a phlé arís, mar táimid fágtha anois gan Údarás: níl aon chathaoirleach ná bord ná airgead againn.  Tá gá le cúrsaí na Gaeilge agus cúrsaí iarthair na tíre, agus go mór mhór cúrsaí feirmeoireachta, a phlé sa Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to add my voice, as I did yesterday, to the requests for a debate on the collapse of our main industry, the agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I want to make.  First, my understanding is &mdash; and I stand open to correction &mdash; that the Leader of the House did not make any reference to Item No. 1, the Altamont Bill.  Will he give us a categorical assurance that that matter, which is a very simple issue, can be dealt with next week because if it is not dealt with next <Col N="1444" /> week it will not be dealt with?  This is against the background of guarantees that it would be dealt with before Christmas, then between Christmas and Easter and between Easter and now.  It is only reasonable to ask that it be dealt with now.</P>
      <P>I join my voice also to those who have spoken about the necessity for a debate in this House on agriculture.  It is extremely pertinent at this time, given that the European Commission yesterday endorsed the proposals of the Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. MacSharry. It is an extremely heated issue.  It is very volatile.  There are pickets outside this House.  If the Seanad do not make unlimited time available to Senators to say what they want to say on that issue, it will hold up this institution to ridicule. If we cannot deal with what are the most pertinent and pressing issues of the day, then there is no real function for the Seanad.  I appeal to the Leader of the House to make time available for an open-ended debate on this extremely important issue.</P>
      <P>I take the point made by Senator Ryan that the issue of unemployment is absolutely crucial.  Of course, there are linkages, because there are huge employment and unemployment issues, both directly in agriculture and indirectly in the agricultural processing sector.  Perhaps the Leader might agree to the title of the debate being a debate on the question of the Irish economy, which would give Senators an open-ended opportunity to deal both with the agricultural question and the critical unemployment issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to that of my colleagues who have asked for an early debate on agriculture.  It is quite obvious that there is considerable concern throughout the country about the whole question.  I remember when the farming organisations were picketing this House many years ago.  I thought that since the introduction of the Common Agricultural Policy on our joining the European Community that that day was gone by.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since we have such provision in our <Col N="1445" /> Standing Orders, I ask the Leader of the House to seriously consider inviting the EC Commissioner for Agriculture to come and explain his proposals, because he said on the media last night they were of tremendous benefit to this country.  No one believes that except himself.  Why not have the Commissioner come in and explain the package to us?  We have the facility to do that here.  I ask the Leader to give the Members of this House an opportunity to deal with this issue which is extremely important to many people in this country.  The Commissioner said there would be compensatory measures through headage payments, but not one-tenth of the farmers of this country would qualify for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to repeat the question.  Will the Leader of the House extend an invitation to Commissioner MacSharry to come here and explain his new proposals, which he says are of benefit to the farmers, and indicate what sector or types of farmers are going to benefit?  There is no point in going to the bank manager and telling him that new facilities are of benefit to the country if we are down 35 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader be prepared to consider the suggestion made by Senator McDonald, which I think is a very good idea?  I very much share the sentiments expressed by Senator Raftery this morning in relation to the manner in which we order our business.  I think that extends to this whole agricultural debate, in which we now seem very anxious to get involved.  Most of the time we seem to be responding or reacting to what is happening in Europe rather than generating ideas in relation to what should happen there.  Much of what is happening in Europe now is going to have tremendous implications for us over the next four or five years and, as far as I can see, <Col N="1446" /> with the exception of a few academics, a few civil servants and perhaps a few people in the business and the farming communities, nobody in this country seems to be interested in it as we go on being preoccupied with the analysis of potholes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Howard and put the question to the Leader of the House, to the Seanad and to the Government: do we ever learn from experience about agriculture?  Do we want to see the tractors and the trailers again blocking the streets?  Is that the state we want it to get to?  If we do not want it to get to that state, the thing to do is to have an open debate here.  That can be a very necessary step in the direction of letting these people know that somebody has an interest in them.  I make an appeal that we have this debate; otherwise we will let a situation develop that we could avoid.</P>
      <P>I regret that, our Motion No. 52, on the viability plan for An Post, was not allowed to be discussed under Standing Order 42 when we might have had it taken in Private Members' time.  Unfortunately, it will be autumn now before our turn comes again.  I would like to put on the record, for the benefit of people from An Post who have been lobbying us to table the motion, that it is not our fault we did not get an opportunity to discuss the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Leader of the House going to be impervious to the pleas of almost everybody who has been asking for a debate on agriculture over the past few weeks, particularly when we see that people have had to leave their jobs, come to Dublin and stay up all night, as Senator Raftery has mentioned?  This is not something that can be dismissed.  We are here democratically to reflect the problems of the people of the country.  Unless we have a debate next week we will have to go to the farming community and say that as far as parliamentarians in this House are concerned they are not interested.  We are talking in the context of adding to the 300,000 already unemployed.  The fact is <Col N="1447" /> the economic cake is not large enough to be able to cope with the addition of a sector of the community who have not been on dole queues but will now be.  I am pleading with the Leader to have that debate next week; otherwise we will have dismissed the farming population as irrelevant. We will not be back again until the autumn and at that stage it will have had a devastating effect on the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Senators raised the question of the Altamont Bill. I have had discussions very recently with the Leas-Chathaoirleach and it seems clear that we should resume the debate on that.  Hopefully, that will be next Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers asked for a debate on agriculture.  I indicated yesterday that we would not have a debate on agriculture/economy this week.  We have had in the past many debates on agriculture in this House.  When we had Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, in this House for a wide-ranging debate on agriculture very few Senators offered to speak.  The complaint, as I can recall, that evening was that the Minister went overboard and spoke for too long.  This is true: he did speak for a long time. However, as I indicated previously, I accept that it is a changing situation and that there is a need for a debate on agriculture. I hope we will have a debate on agriculture/economy next week or whatever arrangement we think is best suited. I will have discussions with the Whips on the best format and we will certainly have a debate in some form next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Raftery's point also dealt with agriculture and with the ordering of business. The ordering of business is primarily done by the Whips.  I comply with the wishes of the Whips to a large extent, and certainly in so far as yesterday's business was concerned it was not my fault that speakers did not offer.  We gave plenty of time for what we thought was important legislation.  I have to say that we are primarily a legislation House.  I have said time and time again that my <Col N="1448" /> priority at all times is in the area of legislation and that will continue to be the way.  At the same time I accept that from time to time there is need for motions on agriculture, education, foreign affairs and matters like that.  Certainly, I am always open for debates of that kind at any time but I want to repeat that primarily my role and the role of this House is in regard to legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan referred to Private Members' time this week.  My understanding is that this was agreed with the Whips.  He also asked for a debate on agriculture/the national economy. Senator Cullen asked about Item No. 15.  That item will also be taken next Wednesday.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard asked about the Competition Bill.  I accept fully the point he made but it is not the first time, as Senator Howard knows, this happened.  When his party were in Government it happened also.  I accept that it is not the best way forward, but that is the way it is and the way this House operates.</P>
    <P>I have noted Senator Hederman's comments in relation to local government.  I have also noted what Senator McGowan said about Telecom Éireann charges.  I do not propose to have a debate on that. Senator Ó Foighil also referred to the agricultural question, as did Senator Neville.  Most of the other comments dealt with a debate on agriculture/ economy.  I will say to Senator McDonald that Commissioner MacSharry is not a Member of this House and it is not for me to invite him; obviously, it is for somebody else to do that.  Senator Harte asked about Motion No. 52.  I do not propose to take that matter.  We had a debate on An Post.  Senator Jackman asked for a debate on agriculture and I have replied to that.</P>

      <P>The Competition Bill, 1991 is a central instrument in the Government's programme to revitalise the economy and encourage growth.  The Bill embodies new concepts for many in business or in professional practice here and for many it will involve new thinking in the way business and commerce is carried out in this country.</P>
      <P>The Bill embodies a radically changed approach to competition law in Ireland. The old system, based on the Restrictive Practices Acts and Orders, was unsatisfactory, cumbersome and applied only to a limited extent of economic activity. It was based on a trade-by-trade approach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and, like many other European countries, our early <Col N="1450" /> experience of competition law was both tentative and cautious.  This approach is no longer appropriate to the needs of our economy today.  The scale and complexity of business has changed and there are new challenges and demands on our economy.</P>
      <P>We are changing our approach for a tried and tested system now used by many of our European partners and based on Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome. The new approach stems also from the long established anti-trust tradition in the US from which the founding principles of competition law have been drawn.</P>
      <P>The Competition Bill prohibits anti-competitive activity and the abuse of a dominant position in the market.  It is a straightforward system of prohibition providing direct recourse to the courts for anyone adversely affected by the anti-competitive activities of others.  The Bill will apply to the public and private sector alike and to all economic activity engaged in for gain in producing goods or in providing services.</P>
      <P>By introducing this legislation we recognise that a marketplace driven by competition is essential if Ireland is to achieve sustainable economic growth. We recognise also that the creation and maintenance of an institutional and legislative framework which promotes strong market rivalry and competition is one of the most positive things that Government can do to promote growth, foster development and generate prosperity.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to the introduction of legislation to give effect in domestic law to provisions similar to Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome after the Fair Trade Commission presented a report to Government.  This Bill delivers on that commitment.  The Bill is a significant part of the effort being made by the Government to prepare Irish companies for the increased competition which will follow on the completion of the Internal Market in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rules contained in Articles 85 and 86 already apply to those sectors of the economy which are engaged in trade at Community level, but there is no reason <Col N="1451" /> why any sector should be sheltered from the discipline imposed by these competition rules.  It is interesting to note that those sectors of the economy which have been exposed to competition are the most dynamic and have made a real contribution to economic growth.  With the Competition Bill it is proposed that all sectors of the economy be exposed to the cutting edge of competitive markets.</P>
    <P>In its study of competition law published at the same time as this Bill, the Fair Trade Commission in discussing the specific benefits which might be expected to flow to Ireland from introducing a more active competition policy stated, in Chapter 3:</P>
    <P>Much of domestic activity may have been insulated from competition up to now.  This is the case, in particular, with services.  The development of full competition in most sectors within the EC is very likely.  By acting quickly to bring about competition of domestic level, it is possible that Irish enterprises will improve their prospects of survival and development in the future; Because so much of economic activity has not been subject to competition law, it might be expected that the benefits of changing the law will be very significant in the early years and will give a substantial boost to the economy. The stimulus, and the experience of competition in the domestic market should better equip Irish enterprises, and particularly Irish management, to participate actively in world markets. One of the features of the successful exporting economies, Japan and Germany, is the intense competition in their home markets.</P>
    <P>I agree with this assessment.</P>
    <P>It is of significance that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> recognises that &ldquo;a modern efficient market economy requires a satisfactory legal framework in the area of...competition policy&rdquo;.  Specifically, the programme points out that the application of the same competition rules, as already apply to those engaged in trade at Community <Col N="1452" /> level, will stimulate competition in the remaining sectors of the economy so that the traded sectors will not have to bear the costs imposed by anti-competitive practices in more sheltered local businesses.</P>
    <P>Existing legislation is based on the concept of what is called a control of abuse system.  It does not ban any particular activity until it has been investigated. Such investigations have been undertaken on a sector-by-sector basis and have led to the making of Restrictive Practices Orders for particular sectors. However, large areas of the economy have never been subject to investigation, much less to action.  This type of fragmented and piecemeal approach needs to be radically changed.  Anti-competitive practices and agreements and abuse of dominant positions that operate in domestic business activity need to be outlawed as they are at Community level under the Treaty of Rome.  In order to provide a comprehensive, but not confusing, system the former Acts and Orders will be replaced.</P>
    <P>I will not detail here the numerous and time-consuming steps that are usually involved in taking action against anti-competitive practices under existing legislation.  I have done so on a number of occasions in the past and Senators, no doubt, will be familiar with them at this stage.  It is clear that the difficulties and delays are considerable.</P>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission has made clear its support for the application of the principles of Articles 85 and 86 to domestic business.  However, the commission's report took an approach to administration and implementation that was very closely based on the EC model. While the philosophy behind Articles 85 and 86 is fully acceptable to me, I consider that administration need not follow the EC model but should be adapted to our own circumstances.  Indeed, given the differences between the role assigned to the EC Commission under the treaties and to various organs by our Constitution, it would be impossible to replicate the treaty system exactly.</P>
    <P>Given that the central idea of the Bill is <Col N="1453" /> drawn from the Treaty of Rome I cannot describe what is proposed as totally novel.  Indeed, a number of proposals have been introduced in the Dáil which had the same objective as this Bill.  In the preparation of the Bill I have examined these earlier proposals including my own, and there is a necessity in legislating to ensure that any new system works and I have tried to take account of the comments made about earlier ideas.  To the extent that there is novelty in the Bill it relates to its approach to administration and implementation.  This can be seen as the detail of the Bill is examined.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill, comprising sections 4 to 9, is the heart of the Bill.  Section 4, in line with Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome, prohibits and makes void anti-competitive agreements, arrangements and practices.  A list of examples is given that includes price fixing, sharing markets and price discrimination.  This list is not exhaustive and, as with Article 85 of the Treaty, is intended as indicative examples of what is broadly prohibited. The section allows exemptions from this prohibition to be given by the Competition Authority.  A licence to exempt any particular arrangement can only be given if the benefits of the arrangement clearly outweigh the anti-competitive effects.  An essential feature is that consumers must have a fair share of the resulting benefit.  In no circumstances can an exemption be given if it would allow the possibility of the elimination of competition in respect of a substantial part of the products or services in question.</P>
    <P>This section was amended on Committee Stage in Dáil Éireann to bring the wording used as close as possible to that of the treaty.  The amendments to this effect did not come from one side only. There were suggestions also for more specific rules outlawing particular anti-competitive practices.  I argued against these as they would quickly become out of date and might lead the courts to give undue weight to the listed practices at the risk of ignoring others.</P>
    <P>Section 5, which is based on Article 86 of the treaty, prohibits the abuse of a dominant position in trade in the State or <Col N="1454" /> a substantial part of it.  Unlike section 4 there is no possibility of an exemption being granted against this prohibition. The Bill will not allow, under any circumstances, the abuse of a dominant position.</P>
    <P>I think I need to say something in detail here about what is meant by a dominant position.  The term &ldquo;dominant postition&rdquo; is not defined in the Treaty of Rome and no definition is offered in this Bill.  It is not possible, in advance, to set precise criteria such as percentage market share that would allow &ldquo;dominant position&rdquo; to be defined for all markets.  Very few markets are so static as to allow the sort of analysis.  Although not defined in the treaty, the concept is clear.</P>
    <P>In a number of cases the European Court of Justice has addressed this issue and defined a dominant position as an economic strength enjoyed by an undertaking which enables it to prevent effective competition being maintained in the relevant market by giving it the power to behave, to an appreciable extent, independently of its competitors, customers and, ultimately, of its consumers.  This description clearly brings out the point that it is the issue of relationships within a market that is central to determining whether there is dominance.</P>
    <P>I want it to be clear that it is the abuse of a dominant position, and not the existence of such a position that is prohibited here.  A dominant position can exist so long as it is not abused.  Behaviour in the market is the issue being addressed. There have been mischievous attempts to argue that this represents a policy aimed against the growth of companies in this country.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The Government recognise that the development of large firms with the advantage of economies of scale are vital for our economy particularly in the traded sector.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from this that there is no conflict between competition policy as expressed in the Bill and industrial development which the Government continue to promote.  Competition policy should not be seen as an isolated regulatory system.  It is an inherent part of a <Col N="1455" /> modern economic system and essential as an element of economic development.</P>
    <P>The enforcement mechanisms proposed in the Bill are designed to ensure effective action without imposing undue burdens in compliance or enforcement. The system will be transparent and objective. Section 6 allows any person who suffers loss in consequence of a breach of sections 4 or 5 a right to damages or an injunction to restrain further damage.  It offers an advantage over existing arrangements because it gives a direct remedy to those aggrieved and does not require action by any official authority. This section lays down that an action may be brought in the High Court or in the Circuit Court for cases brought under section 5.</P>
    <P>I have decided to give the Circuit Court jurisdiction for cases involving the abuse of a dominant position as early as possible. This is to ensure that the law is made accessible to all both from a financial and a logistical point of view.  At the same time we will have to allow for some certainties to be established in the case law. Let us remember here that we are talking about an entirely new body of domestic law.  There are concepts which will have to be applied to domestic, as distinct from Community trade, for the first time.  This may take some short time.  The case law of the European Court of Justice will be invaluable to our courts but they will have to build up experience of applying it in a domestic context.</P>
    <P>One of the core features of the Bill is its enforcement mechanism.  This was debated at length in the Dáil where there were many calls for giving an enforcement role on both the Competition Authority and to the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.  I firmly rejected those suggestions.  What I have proposed is a system of private enforcement which represents a balance safeguarding economic rights and liberties.  Damages can only be awarded if damage has been caused.  This is a very simple and basic premise.  It would not be consistent with the scheme of the Bill nor with the principles behind it to establish an elaborate <Col N="1456" /> and costly policing or enforcement agency.</P>
    <P>I believe that giving an enforcement role to the director would rapidly become a crutch on which business, in particular big business, would hang their cases and I suspect that even those who would be in a strong position to take a case would wait for the State to do the work for them.  The same arguments apply with respect to an enforcement role for the Authority.  Indeed, because the Authority carries out the role of adjudicating on applications and licences, it would be particularly inappropriate and unwise to give it the role of prosecutor also.  If there is a residual concern about enforcement and the readiness to take an action in certain cases, I would point out that section 6 (4) of the Bill gives the Minister power to take such action.</P>
    <P>The Competition Authority, which is dealt with in Part III and in the Schedule to the Bill will decide whether exemptions in respect of anti-competitive agreements should be granted.  The procedures to be followed are set out in sections 7 and 8.  In order to ensure transparency these sections provide that decisions made by the Authority to grant licences will be published.  These decisions will be open to review by the High Court as provided in section 9.</P>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission will be replaced by the new Competition Authority. Section 11 allows the Authority to carry out studies at the Minister's request.  Section 12 requires the Authority to report to the Minister for Industry and Commerce each year and that he publish these reports.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 6.3 of the Schedule permits the Authority to regulate its own procedure. Much of the detail relating to procedures and administration will, therefore, be decided on by the Authority itself and has been excluded from the main body of the Bill.  There are very good reasons for this.  It would not be appropriate to enshrine in primary legislation rigid rules and regulations for the new Authority.  A new system such as the Authority must have the flexibility to <Col N="1457" /> respond to and to adjust its own procedures to ensure optimal efficiency and fairness in its deliberations.  The Authority will be carrying out a quasi-judicial function in making its decisions.  We should not unduly rush the more important of these decisions.  If we were to make rules in advance setting strict and short deadlines for the Authority's decision-making, this could cause difficulties and uncertainty if the deadlines were not met</P>
    <P>I see no reason to clutter our primary legislation with this type of detail.  The only way it could be changed if it proved unsuitable would be through primary legislation.  I am confident that the new Authority will carry out its tasks with efficiency and speed and with regard to the needs of the business community.  It should also be noted that the procedures of the Authority can be regulated if necessary by the Minister under section 23 which also requires that these regulations be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The concept of control of monopolies, with mechanical and artificial criteria for determining when they exist, as provided in the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, will be replaced by a control on the abuse of a dominant position.  Section 14 sets out how this will be done if there is a fundamental structural problem arising.  This section permits the Minister, following receipt of a report from the Authority, to prohibit the continuance of or require the adjustment of the dominant position. This provision is supplementary to section 5 in Part II, which concentrates on behaviour, and I expect it to be used only in serious cases.  Abuses of a dominant position in the market constitute a grave threat to economic life and I expect that those affected will use their rights to take an action in the courts.  To ensure transparency in section 14 cases, the Minister will be required to publish reports received from the Authority.</P>
    <P>The introduction of these new concepts and straightforward mechanisms will make much of our previous restrictive practices legislation redundant.  These <Col N="1458" /> Acts and Orders can be repealed.  This is provided for in section 22.  This section, and section 2 which deals with commencement, were amended on Committee Stage in the Dáil to make certain that the repeals provided for can take place on a phased basis.  The amended sections enable the Minister to retain a particular restrictive practices order and enforcement provisions for as long as necessary.  I have had representations made to me particularly about the retention of the Restrictive Practices (Grocery) Order, 1987.  This order is being reviewed at the moment by the Fair Trade Commission.  I made it clear previously that I do not intend repealing that order before I have fully considered the commission's report on its review and taken its views into account.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also amend some of the provisions of the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978. Experience with its operation, particularly in recent years, has demonstrated the need for certain changes.  These changes are principally in the area of timing of notifications, the supply of information to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and enforceability.  Section 15 and 16 deal with these points.</P>
    <P>The criteria against which a merger is to be assessed by the Competition Authority are set out in a clearer fashion in section 17 than was the case in the Schedule to the 1978 Act.  In addition to examing the impact on competition, the Authority will be required to give views on concrete issues such as the impact of proposals on the level of employment.</P>
    <P>A change will also be made in respect of publication.  Under the 1978 Act reports of the Fair Trade Commission on merger cases have not been published. Reports on such cases by the Competition Authority will now be published, but confidential business information will not be disclosed.  This will ensure that assessment of significant merger proposals is carried out in a transparent way.  These changes were advocated by the Fair Trade Commission in the report of its study of competition law.</P>
    <P>The 1978 Act will be amended by <Col N="1459" /> section 19 to take account of the EC Regulation on the Control of Concentrations. This Regulation, No. 4064/89, which has been in force since 21 September 1990 gives the EC Commission exclusive jurisdiction, with some rare exceptions, over very large cross-Border mergers in the Community. Three criteria establish the scope of the regulation: (i) World wide turnover of all the undertakings concerned must total at least 5,000 million EC, about IR£3,800 million; (ii) At least two of the undertakings must each have a turnover of 250 million ECU, about IR£190 million; (iii) Community control does not apply if each undertaking has two-thirds of turnover in the same member state.</P>
    <P>Assessment of proposals is carried out by the EC Commission in consultation with the relevant authorities in each member state.  A proposal that creates or strengthens a dominant position will be prevented if effective competition is impeded to a significant extent, whether within the Common Market as a whole or in a substantial part of it.</P>
    <P>Parts I and V of the Bill contain standard provisions in relation to citation, commencement, repeals, expenses and deal with authorised officers.  Section 21 allows for &ldquo;dawn raids&rdquo; by authorised officers.  This is a power available to the EC Commission in carrying out its duties under Articles 85 and 86 and I think it is essential that authorised officers be similarly given every legal assistance in carrying out their duties under the Act.  The Schedule, as I mentioned earlier, sets out the details of the Competition Authority's composition, rules and powers.</P>
    <P>Overall, I believe this is a well balanced piece of legislation.  It seeks to enhance the climate of the marketplace by introducing into it a legally protected requirement for competition.  It is neither unduly intrusive nor constraining on business activity.  It allows those engaged in economic activity the freedom to do so but within a system that will require them to conduct their business with due regard to the rights of others.  The Bill provides a clear set of guideline rules and the means <Col N="1460" /> to be exempted from those rules in appropriate cases and its coverage should be universal as far as principles are concerned.</P>
    <P>Like the Constitution which protects the rights of citizens against the power of certain institutions of the State, particularly the Executive, I hope that the Competition Bill will act as a framework to prevent the abuse of economic power and, at the same time, protect the interests of the consumer.  Furthermore, I believe that in introducing this legislation we are putting in place an essential piece of the machinery necessary to achieve a properly competitive economy.  This will allow us to achieve real economic growth and allow the economy to perform to its full potential.</P>
    <P>There are always winners and losers when changes are made.  The only losers this Bill will produce are those who have in the past sheltered from competition and imposed the resulting costs on the rest of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>In responding to the Minister's speech on Second Stage there are a few points I want to make.  I share some of his enthusiasm for the Bill.  It is important legislation and it will have widespread implications for a wide range of commercial interests and indeed for consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not dispute that there are very worthwhile provisions in the Bill and indeed the objectives of the Bill itself are worthwhile.  There are, however, a number of criticisms and a number of reservations I wish to enter at this stage in the discussion.  The first relates to a point I made on the Order of Business today.  This Bill arrives to us in the Seanad very much on a &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; basis. It was published on 12 April last and the Dáil dealt with it between 30 April and 3 July.  As the Minister acknowledged, it was amended in the Dáil in a number of aspects.  He took account of some points that were raised there and well argued and he made some amendments also himself to the Bill.  By virtue of the fact that we are here today discussing Second Stage and, as I understand it, Committee <Col N="1461" /> Stage of the Bill will be taken in the Seanad next week, bearing in mind that the Dáil will rise next Friday for the summer recess and the Minister's statement made elsewhere that he wants the measure on the Statute Book before the summer it is very clear that the Minister does not intend to accept amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to ask the Senator to stay with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I must enter these reservations at this stage.  I believe the credibility and the standing of this House is at issue here.  Having made these points I will not be in further conflict with the Chair's feelings in the matter and I will move on to other points.</P>
      <P>There are a number of important bodies in the commercial and business life of the country who have made representations and submissions to all of us in relation to the impact of this measure. Many of them have complained that there has been a lack of consultation between the Minister and his Department and between the organisations, bodies and trade associations that will be affected by the terms of this measure. They have argued that they have felt that an input from them has not been allowed and they are concerned that some of the fears they have expressed have not been dealt with in a manner that would satisfy their concerns.  I will allude to some of these reservations and fears that have been expressed as I go along in the confident expectation that the Minister when replying will put at ease not only my fears but the fears of the organisations I will mention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has quite a number of positive aspects.  One thing that gives me satisfaction is the fact that it will apply to public and semi-State undertakings in so far as they provide a service as well as to the private sector and that the monopoly or dominant position, and perhaps the abuse of a dominant position where it arises by a State body in the supply of services, is covered in this measure.  I am concerned that the legislation should involve both the public and the private <Col N="1462" /> sectors.  I noted from the Official Report of the Dáil that the Minister felt that certain services provided by local authorities would come under the scope of the Bill but, as the debate developed, that did not appear to be the case.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify where services by local authorities are included and excluded and the reasons.</P>
    <P>I accept there is need to outlaw certain unacceptable practices which have emerged on the commercial and business scene in recent years.  It is not necessary for me to pinpoint these as they are well known. I accept in full the Minister's contention that in a market-orientated economy competition is necessary.  Very few business people will complain provided the pitch is level and there is a fair opportunity for everybody.  I accept the Minister's point that the domestic sectors which have been exposed to competition have proved to be the most dynamic and have contributed most to economic growth.</P>
    <P>Abuse of the dominant position comes under this measure.  It has caused major difficulties and will continue to do so unless it is contained and controlled in the economy.  The consumer's interest is best served by being supplied with a good product and a good service at a reasonable price.  The Minister should retain the right to investigate abuses.  I am not sure if that right is, to some extent, diluted by this measure but that is a matter that can best be teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Fair Trade Commission will become the new Competition Authority.  I noted with interest that in a recent public statement the Chairman of the Fair Trade Commission gave as his view that the primary functions of the new Competition Authority would be first, the licensing of exemptions and, secondly, the issue of certificates of negative clearance.  There is a good deal of uncertainty in the business community as to the effect this measure will have on business.  There is a widespread belief in business and among traders that the only safe way to operate will be either to have a licence of exemption or a certificate of negative clearance.  If <Col N="1463" /> there is validity in that point of view &mdash; and time alone will show &mdash; this new body will be deluged with applications either for a licence or a certificate.  The Minister should assure the House that the Competition Authority will have the necessary financial and other resources to discharge their functions in the event of that development.  If that proves to be the case, we are setting up a substantial bureaucratic machine and bureaucratic machinery has not always worked to the advantage of the business environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the restrictive practices order in relation to low cost selling in the grocery trade.  That is being reviewed by the Fair Trade Commission. He will decide whether to retain, amend or repeal it when the Fair Trade Commission's report is available to him.  There is widespread concern in the grocery trade that repeal of that order would lead to disastrous consequences for small stores and shopkeepers.  RGDATA have complained that their concerns and reservations in relation to this measure have not been given due weight and that they have not had sufficient opportunity to make their case.  I refer to their communication which I am sure most of us received dated 7 May, 1991.  There is no doubt that they are deeply and genuinely concerned about the future prospects of their members, small shopkeepers and family grocers in particular.  They are deeply apprehensive about the Minister's stated intention to remove in time the ban on below cost selling.  They outline their fears as to why the Bill will not work, their fears for the future of their members, for employment in the trade and the eventual effect on prices.</P>
    <P>The industry employs 43,000 people. It is a tough, competitive trade and long hours are worked to provide a service to the public.  They make the point that in recent years the retail environment has been made more competitive by the 1987 groceries order which introduced the ban on below cost selling.  They point to four positive results of that: 4,000 extra jobs have been created in the sector since 1988; greater investment, approximately <Col N="1464" /> £60 million, in the modernisation of shops over the past two to three years; a reduction in the dominance of the multiple chains which reduced the hostage-like dependence of suppliers.</P>
    <P>They go on to outline what they fear will happen should the ban be removed. They say that the removal of the ban would be catastrophic for their trade and for the public and that a new series of price wars with consequent job losses in the retail trade and among suppliers would result.  They say there will be less investment as instability increases; illusory prices misleading consumers; the elimination of competition and an increase in dominance of the major multiples and the closure of independent retailers with the consequent loss to the community.  They say not only are they concerned at the proposed abolition of the ban on below cost selling but they are also concerned at the Minister's proposal that the industry should police itself. They say that for any competition legislation to be effective there must be what they describe as an independent statutory referee and they refer to the recent milk voucher war as proof of this.</P>
    <P>They also express the view that the Competition Bill will not function successfully for a number of reasons.  They say that the food trade will be unable to police itself, that it is unrealistic to think suppliers will bring their customers to court and risk permanently delisting. They have emphasised this in many public statements in recent weeks.  They also say that small retailers cannot afford High Court costs if they are being deliberately put out of business.  However, the Minister moved to that by way of amendments made in the Dáil.  They made the following comment:</P>
    <P>The removal on the ban will result in job losses at both retail and supply level due to renewed aggression and subsequent bad debts.  The courts are already overburdened and ponderous. The legal process will be too slow for the speed/dynamics of the trade. Below cost selling can be initiated with an outlet with 5 per cent of the market, <Col N="1465" /> so &ldquo;abuse of a dominant position&rdquo; is not relevant.  What do we need?</P>
    <P>For new competition legislation to be effective it must continue the ban on below cost selling and provide for an ombudsman/referee to police the operation of the law or</P>
    <P>Maintain the present Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987 and appoint a &ldquo;watchdog&rdquo; within the new Competition Authority.  The latter is necessary as the Office of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade will be gone.</P>
    <P>This organisation represents an industry which employes 43,000.  They have expressed major reservations and are of the opinion that they did not get an opportunity to put their point of view across.  It is a matter of concern that RGDATA feel that due weight was not given to their points of view.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that below cost selling is not a struggle between equals.  It is the law of the jungle where the strongest &mdash; in this case multi-national chain stores &mdash; survive.  We know many small businesses which have gone to the wall.  The Minister informed us that he is considering the report of the Fair Trade Commission on the ban on below cost selling.  He will make a decision shortly in relation to that.  I understand that he gave a commitment that if he was amending the order he would come back to the Dáil and seek its approval for it.  I am not too clear what assurance he gave in relation to repealing the order in full.  What will be the position if he decides to repeal the order?  Will he bring it back to both Houses?</P>
    <P>There is another organisation with a very high standing in the business and commercial field, the Confederation of Irish Industry.  They circulated a newsletter on 28 May.  I feel obliged because of the importance of that body to put on the record of the House some of the reservations they expressed.</P>
    <P>CII welcomes the proposed abolition of the &ldquo;Control of Abuse&rdquo; system and its replacement by the &ldquo;Prohibition&rdquo; System in the belief that this will <Col N="1466" /> increase the efficacy of the Competition system and control abuses by those enterprises in a position to act independently of competition.  The CII recommends, however, a continuation of the Groceries Order alongside the new competition measures as recommended by the Fair Trade Commission in their recently published study on competition law.</P>
    <P>The CII are particularly concerned about the effects of the additional cost which this measure will put on the commercial sector as every company, firm, trader or private individual engaged for gain will be required to examine all agreements and practices to establish whether such agreements have either as their objective or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition and then if in any doubt to seek a licence or certificate from the Competition Authority.  That is very much in line with a point I made at the beginning of the deliberations that there is widespread belief within the business community that it will be necessary to have either a licence or a certificate of exemption.  The CII echo that point of view and emphasise the additional costs this will put on the industry.  I would point out that failure to notify the Competition Authority exposes the enterprise to liability for damages, and exemplary damages and agreements may be prohibited. I will deal with the question of guidelines later in the discussion.</P>
    <P>They state that the likely flood of notifications will result in a backlog of cases to the Competition Authority similar to the experience of the European Commission. There will be delays and, more importantly from the point of view of any businessman, uncertainty which may inhibit business activity, investment and so on.  Under the heading &ldquo;Enforcement&rdquo;, they state:</P>
    <P>Under European law, if a company feels that another company is abusing a dominant position it can complain to the European Commission.  The Commission may then undertake an investigation of the complaint.  This is a relatively cost-effective way for an <Col N="1467" /> enterprise to use the law to protect itself.</P>
    <P>The Minister has gone some way to meet this fear and I welcome that.  They go on to say:</P>
    <P>Complaints that do end up in court will be extremely costly for both parties... Requiring the Courts to implement policy will impose additional burdens on the administration of the Irish Court system, already the subject of comment and criticism.</P>
    <P>I read a statement by a prominent lawyer some weeks ago who made the interesting observation that the Judiciary are not trained to deal with the intricacies of commercial operations.  There is an absence of case law that the courts can refer to.  He said he was confident that, over time, they would acquire that expertise but in the meantime it would be a somewhat hit-and-miss affair.  The point the CII are making is that those who are caught in that hit-and-miss process will be in a most unfortunate situation. It is an interesting point and well worth raising.</P>
    <P>In dealing with section 6 the Minister referred to &ldquo;any person who suffers loss&rdquo; but later he reverted to the word used consistently throughout the Bill, that is, an &ldquo;aggrieved person&rdquo;.  I have no problem with a term that refers to a person who has suffered loss but I have every problem with the definition of &ldquo;aggrieved person&rdquo;.  The CII &mdash; and we are on common ground on this &mdash; referred to &ldquo;aggrieved person&rdquo; and said the provision permitting an aggrieved person to have recourse to the courts is too broad. They would seek to reduce the scope of the definition of &ldquo;aggrieved person&rdquo; to cover only the parties to a prohibited agreement or a person suffering damage as a result thereof.  I noted with particular interest that the Minister referred to a person who had suffered loss.  If that was considered as a replacement for the term &ldquo;aggrieved person&rdquo; in the Bill I would be happy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1468" /> The CII complained about the lack of consultation and said they do not feel there was adequate consultation with the industry about this important legislation. They are concerned about the undue haste with which the Bill is being pushed through the legislative process because it does not allow for adequate time in which to assess adequately the implications of the Bill and they have a number of other observations to make which are of interest.</P>
    <P>In relation to certificates they say: &ldquo;the distinction between a licence and a certificate is, therefore, that if an agreement infringes section 4 (1), it requires a licence; if it does not infringe section 4 (1) it may be granted a certificate&rdquo;.  That comes back to the point that there is widespread fear among the business community that they must have a certificate or a licence.  In view of the fact that there is likely to be a considerable number of applications for either a licence or a certificate, is the Minister prepared to put a time limit on the period within which an application for either will be adjudicated on by the Competition Authority?</P>
    <P>In relation to appeals the CII say: &ldquo;an aggrieved person may appeal to the High Court against the granting of a certificate&rdquo;. This temporary or uncertain status of a certificate leads to uncertainty. The authority should have the final word in relation to certification and there should be an appeal to the High Court on a point of law or procedure only.</P>
    <P>As regards the term &ldquo;aggrieved person&rdquo; they say it is drafted in very broad terms.  Any person who is &ldquo;aggrieved&rdquo; may initiate damages. However, it is too broad because such a person only needs to be aggrieved, not &ldquo;injured&rdquo; or &ldquo;suffered loss&rdquo;.  The right of action should be restricted to persons who are a party to agreements or who are subsequently injured as a result of a prohibited practice.  I look forward to the Minister's observations on that.</P>
    <P>We should examine how the Bill will work and anticipate problems that may arise in relation to it.  For example, what is meant by &ldquo;concerted practices&rdquo;?  It will <Col N="1469" /> be difficult to prove conclusively that concerted practices exist.  Is it sufficient for the Authority to be of the opinion that concerted practices exist?  Does it require something more than a person simply to be of the opinion that concerted practices exist?  Could we have some examples of concerted practices?</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;aggrieved person&rdquo; is far too general.  In making a complaint or initiating an action a person should be in a position to show they have suffered damages or loss.  Otherwise, it simply allows cranks to initiate actions against shops, stores, etc. without having to show that they have suffered loss or damage in any material way.  It may well be an imaginary action they are complaining about.</P>
    <P>Section 4, is really implementing Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome.  I am not aware that the right of action is in accordance with the terms of that treaty.  I am not aware that similar provisions exist in any other EC country.  I believe the Government, for some reason, have decided to introduce the type of action that is in the Bill and perhaps the Minister will indicate the reason.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the CII document and the absence of a yardstick by which the courts can determine what are described as damages or exemplary damages. How are they to be assessed?  In the absence of guidelines, plaintiffs in an action will be expected to produce very detailed particulars in relation to a claim for an injunction or damages under this section.  The cost of providing these detailed particulars, which involves the employment of accountants, solicitors, barristers and so on, can be extremely expensive for the companies involved particularly as these actions can be initiated by a person described as aggrived but who may in reality have suffered no loss.</P>
    <P>Section 9 does not permit a party refused a licence or a certficate by the Competition Authority to appeal that decision.  I know the Minister dealt with this at length in the Dáil but to deny that right of appeal is contrary to natural <Col N="1470" /> justice and procedure.  I find the position unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to deal with that part of the Bill concerned with takeovers, monopolies, mergers and so on, largely because I agree with it.  I want to deal at some length with the powers that have been given to the Competition Authority. We know that the Fair Trade Commission will be renamed the Competition Authority.  I am concerned in some cases, and not clear in others, about the precise powers this Authority will have in discharging their duties and in dealing with the public.</P>
    <P>The powers that can be given to authorised officers and to the Authority are wide-ranging.  These powers go deeper and beyond what the law in this country has attempted up to now.  On the position of members of the Authority and its authorised officers, what protection will exist for these members and officers as if in the discharge of their duties they are guilty of abuse or wrong-doing?  I am asking about the availability of protection for members of the Authority and authorised officers where necessary before I go on to a contrary situation that I fear might arise.</P>
    <P>Members of the Authority will be appointed by the Minister, and will include a chairman and not more than four and not less than two members. Among its function will be the summoning of witnesses to attend before them.  A summons must be signed by at least one member of the Competition Authority and they can examine an oath witnesses before them.  In this regard any member of the Authority is authorised to administer an oath and, in effect, to act as a commissioner for oaths.  To the best of my knowledge commissioners for oaths are generally solicitors and are appointed by the High Court.  What precise authority will the members of the Authority have in the administration of oaths, the summoning of witnesses and particularly on the examination of oath of witnesses attending before them?  What is the source of that authority?  Will they be appointed, as commissioners, for oaths are, by the President of the High Court? Will they be commissioners for oaths in <Col N="1471" /> the full sense or will they constitute some other category of law enforcers we have not had up to now?</P>
    <P>The Authority can require a witness to produce any documents under such person's power or control.  This undoubtedly may well be necessary in view of our experience in certain well-known cases in recent times.  Nonetheless it is an invasion of the confidentiality between clients and their professional advisers, whether solicitors, accountants or others.  What will be the position of solicitors and accountants in that situation?</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the provisions for non-compliance with the requirements of the Authority.  If a person fails to appear before the Authority having been duly summoned, if they refuse to take the oath, if they refuse to produce any document in their power or control which has been requested by the Authority or if they refuse to answer any questions, they can be found to be in contempt of court as if the Authority were a court and empowered to commit for contempt of court.  They will be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or imprisonment not exceeding six months or, at the discretion of the court, to both fine and imprisonment.  The powers to summon witnesses to be examined on oath and to require production of documents are the equivalent of powers conferred on a judge appointed by the Government and exercising his powers in the court of law.  The Competition Authority in these circumstances will be functioning as a court of law.  Lay people will be acting as judges without the knowledge and experience of a judge in a court of law.  We may be in danger here of breaching a long-standing constitutional separation of the judicial and executive functions of State and I do not believe Seanad Éireann should lightly acquiesce to such a fundamental change in the application of the law.</P>
    <P>A person who does not appear before the Authority or refuses to take an oath or to produce documents or answer questions will, in effect, be in contempt of <Col N="1472" /> court.  Who does the sentencing here?  Is it the Authority or is it a court of law?  In either case what appeal procedures are open to the individual concerned?  A penalty or term of imprisonment can only be imposed by a judge in a court of law in which case the member or duly authorised officer of the Competition Authority will have to give evidence against such persons to obtain a conviction.</P>
    <P>It appears the Competition Authority may only prove that a person was summoned as a witness and defaulted in attending but will not have to state why such person was summoned in the first instance.  I would like clarification on that point.  Am I correct in assuming that they do not have to give a reason for a summons? Is it sufficient for the Competition Authority to prove that the witness refused to take the oath required by the Authority without giving the grounds for requesting such an oath?  It appears that these offences become absolute offences in such a case, namely, that what was requested by the Competition Authority was not complied with and that there is no duty or obligation on the Authority to give its grounds for summoning in the first instance.  There appears to be no provision whereby a witness summoned to attend before the Competition Authority may attend with his legal adviser or may conduct such hearing through his legal adviser.  Again, I would like to know the precise position on that aspect.</P>
    <P>The Authority has almost the same powers of inquiry as a court of law dealing with a criminal offence.  There appears to be no provision for a witness to appeal against a summons to appear before the Competition Authority.  I would like the Minister to confirm if that is the case.  It is unjust not to make provision for a person to appeal against a summons to attend before the Competition Authority and provision should be made for it.  Our judicial system provides for such a situation and why then should an exception be made here?</P>
    <P>It appears from the way the legislation has been drafted that the Competition Authority can do no wrong.  It would <Col N="1473" /> appear to have absolute power of inquisition. If the Authority at some stage goes off the rails, how does the Minister bring it back on?  How does he restrain it? Perhaps amendments should be considered to provide against such a situation developing.  I would not expect it to go off the rails, bearing in mind the people who will constitute the first Authority but it is a possibility that should be borne in mind and provided for.  Accordingly, I hope that amendments can be introduced that would allow a person summoned to attend to speak through his legal adviser with proper legal representation and with a right of appeal against any decision made by the Competition Authority.</P>
    <P>With regard to authorised officers, both the Minister and the Authority can appoint such officers to carry out functions under the Bill.  An authorised officer may apply to the justice of the District Court to obtain a warrant authorising him for the purpose of obtaining information in the exercise of any of the functions of the Competition Authority or the Minister under the Bill as follows: enter and inspect premises at or vehicles in or by means of which any activity in connection with the business of supplying or distributing goods or providing a service, or in connection with the organisation or assistance of persons engaged in any such business, is carried on.  This is the equivalent of a warrant usually granted to a member of the Garda Siochána investigating an alleged criminal offence.  The warrant provides that the authorised officer can gain access to any premises where the business is being carried on or to offices in connection with the organisation or assistance of persons engaged in such business.  The Minister in his speech used the rather fancy term of &ldquo;dawn raids&rdquo; and that is the provision being made.</P>
    <P>Reference is made in section 21 (1) (a) to powers in connection with the organisation or assistance....  That appears to imply that banks, solicitors and accountants, etc. can merit major investigation with invasion and intrusion caused to one's business advisers and to parties assisting such business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1474" /> Section 21 (1) (b) has the following reference:</P>
    <P>requires the person who carries on such activity and any person employed in connection therewith to produce to the authorised officer any books, documents or records relating to such activity which are in that person's power or control, and to give to the authorised officer such information as he may reasonably require in regard to any entries in such books, documents and records.</P>
    <P>These powers constitute the powers of a court of law where witnesses are obliged to bring documents to the court and to be examined in relation to them.  In effect, officers appointed by the Minister or by the Authority will be acting like a judge in a court of law, compelling witnesses to provide this information.</P>
    <P>There are further powers for authorised officers under the same section. They can inspect, copy and take extracts from any book, document or record. They may require a person who carries out an activity in connection with the business of supplying and distributing goods or providing a service, or indeed any persons employed in connection therein, &ldquo;to give to the authorised officer any information he may require in regard to the persons carrying on such activities (including, in particular, in the case of an unincorporated body of persons, information in regard to the membership thereof and its committee of management or other controlling authority) or employed in connection therewith.&rdquo; The details of what is required here need clarification.  The Minister should explain the meaning of the words &ldquo;in connection with the organisation or assistance of persons engaged in such business&rdquo; as contained in section 21 (1) (a).</P>
    <P>I want to raise with the Minister the position of a person who becomes caught up in this situation and who is genuinely unable to assist the authorised officers.  If there is no information to impart but if the authorised officers refuse to accept this and maintain that the person concerned is being unco-operative, what <Col N="1475" /> recourse does an innocent person have under such circumstances?  What power of appeal does he have and how may he vindicate himself?</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to clarify what is meant by the words &ldquo;and any person employed in connection therewith to produce to the authorised officer any books, documents or records relating to such activity which are in that person's power and control&rdquo; as referred to in section 21 (1) (b).  References to persons employed in connection therewith could mean persons who provide services to the party carrying out the activity, namely solicitors, accountants and trade organisations. Will the Minister amend this to mean persons directly employed by the person who carries out such activity and excluding those who provide independent services?</P>
    <P>Any person who impedes the organised officer and does not comply with his requirement shall be guilty of an offence incurring a £1,000 fine or 12 months' imprisonment or both.  It appears that an absolute offence can be committed in that the authorised officer is given absolute power in such proceedings and may declare, without evidence, that he was obstructed or impeded.  He may contend that when questions were asked replies were not given or that when documents or books were requested they were not produced.  Similarly, he may claim that when an explanation of entries in books or documents was requested it was not provided.  In each case, on the word of the authorised officer the court is empowered to convict and impose a fine or imprisonment. The terms and provisions appear to have been drafted on the basis that a criminal offence is being investigated. Will the Minister respond to these points?</P>
    <P>I have raised a number of issues that were of concern to me and to others also.  It has been necessary to bring these matters to the attention of the House and the Minister to seek clarification that may well assuage genuine and perhaps well-founded fears.  The fact that I have raised questions on some aspects of the Bill does not mean I disagree with the parts of the <Col N="1476" /> Bill about which I have been silent.  I accept the need for a Competition Authority with the powers necessary to do its duty but I believe that in a few instances we are giving this Authority powers that are unprecedented in our judicial system. This departure from practice may be dangerous.</P>
    <P>I was anxious to establish the protection available to authorised officers and to members of the Authority who may act illegally or who abuse their position to the detriment of innocent members of the business community.  It is a two-way situation there.  Powers of extraordinary depth and range are being provided under this Bill to officers which may affect many people not involved in the matters being investigated.  If an officer believes, quite wrongly, that some person is obstructing him, since conviction appears to depend on the officers' opinion what protection is afforded the innocent party?  No protection appears in the Bill's provisions as far as I am aware and I stand open to correction on this. That is a serious matter.</P>
    <P>I regard this as a lengthy and complicated Bill, introducing complicated and far-reaching changes.  It will have major effects on trade and business, given the sweeping powers included in its provisions.  Judicial powers are being given to what will be a non-judicial body, namely, the new Competition Authority and its authorised officers under sections 4 and 8.</P>
    <P>I regard it as unbalanced that in the granting or refusing of licences or certificates a third party may appeal or object to the granting of a licence or certificate but in the case of a refusal the party directly affected has no right of appeal.  I am concerned also about possible abuse of the dominant position, and the investigation and actions open to the Minister.  Something occurred to me when I was reading about the abuse of a dominant position.  The GAA are having a bonanza with replays and so on and if I or a member of the public were to write to Croke Park wanting two tickets for the hurling or football final and if they wrote back saying I was not entitled to them, <Col N="1477" /> that they had their own system of allocating tickets then I think the GAA would be caught fairly and squarely under this legislation.  It would be an interesting development.</P>
    <P>In connection with the abuse of a dominant position I will mention a personal experience some time ago when importing a second-hand car.  I arrived to pay the duty on it and the Revenue Commissioners got on to the motor manufacturers or importers to ask the list price of a new car of that model and since this price is deliberately inflated I was caught for a rate of duty beyond what I pay in the normal course.  However, if I were to go to the people who supplied the Revenue Commissioners with that list and said: &ldquo;I want to buy that car, here is the cash,&rdquo; I would get it for thousands of pounds less than the list price.  That is a clear case of abuse of a dominant position and I would be delighted if such people were apprehended under this legislation.</P>
    <P>The investigation and actions open to the Minister under sections 5 and 14 regarding abuse of the dominant position require detailed debate and examination preferably at Committee Stage, and the same is true of many other parts of the Bill.  It would appear that the House will not have the opportunity to amend this Bill and I regret that.  The Minister has indicated that he wishes to have the Bill before the recess and the Dáil will not be in session after Friday to take any amendments that may be made here next week.  Despite the need for the Competition Bill and despite the many valuable aspects of the Bill which I fully acknowledge, in view of the disability that this House has been placed it may well be its duty to refuse the Bill a Second Reading but before coming to that conclusion I await the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and commend the Minister for bringing it before this House.  In this area of business, fair trade and company law, a virtual minefield of complexities, it is most satisfactory that this Bill is presented in relatively simple and uncomplicated sections, yet clearly addressing problems <Col N="1478" /> not previously addressed in this country. I thank the Minister and his officials, parliamentary draftsmen and in particular the Fair Trade Commission.</P>
      <P>On 9 December 1987 the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Albert Reynolds gave a commitment in the Dáil that a full and comprehensive investigation would be made of Irish competition regulations and that that investigation would be instituted.  The Fair Trade Commission undertook this commission and did it extremely well.  They embarked on comprehensive and detailed discussions with representatives of the European Commission, the United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading, the Spanish, Norwegian and US authorities, the competition authorities of Sweden, Greece, Portugal and France and further information was obtained from <i>The World Law on Competition</i> published by Matthew Bender in the annual report of the Committee on Competition Law and Policy of the OECD.  This shows the detail investigation conducted by the Fair Trade Commission before any legislation was put before the Houses of the Oireachtas and that this Bill has not been introduced in a hasty or ill judged reactionary attempt to improve existing legislation by introducing legislative change alone.  If that were so it might not necessarily achieve the objectives of the single purpose of this legislation which is to give Ireland a competition law comparable with other developed countries and which will I hope be as rewarding in economic benefits as similar legislation has been to the economies of many of our international competitors.  As the Minister said, competition is the lifeblood of any economy and to exclude, prevent, muzzle or bury it would cause long term stagnation in many sections of our economy. Irish companies who will have to face up to the highly competitive standards as a result of this legislation will benefit enormously in the long term and will ideally be more prepared to face up to the challenges that the Single Market will undoubtedly impose on all of us from 1992 onwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure it is quite correct in a broad <Col N="1479" /> sense to say that this Bill is modelled on Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome and that the implementation of these Articles in the EC context has benefited both suppliers and consumers.  Irish companies which had been subjected to the competitive effects of these Articles of the Treaty have generally grown and prospered. Taking that as a model it would surely be similarly beneficial for those companies who are orientated solely towards the domestic market to face the rigours and challenges of unrestricted competition from wherever that competition might come.  I am particularly glad that regulatory functions under the Bill will be taken into the Department of Industry and Commerce.  This is fair and independent practice although such regulations are perceived by some as a mechanism to stifle or muzzle the Authority. The caption on the front of one of our more prominent business journals is unbecoming to any responsible business journal, but the writer also suggested in an interview in that journal, that Members of this House and of the Dáil do not possess the intellectual capacity to tease out the intricacies of this particular Bill.  So much for the super-intellectualism of some journalists.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the principles embodied in Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome are incorported into this Bill providing an exemption procedure whereby certain types of agreements may be exempted or granted licences even if they appear to be anti-competitive, if in the totality of circumstances they would offer wider and larger benefits to the consumer.  There is a classic international example of this in the joint venture involvements at European level in the Channel Tunnel construction notwithstanding whatever other hiccups might have developed there.  This is a joint venture between ten major construction companies in the United Kingdom and France to construct a Eurotunnel which exemplified effective cooperation among many competitors to the overall good of the community which will benefit from the facilities provided by that tunnel.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1480" /> The development of competition law will probably have major effects.  It will bring about a new relationship between the legal people, the barristers and lawyers, and economists in the analysis of cases, which is something new here.  If one looks at the presentation of competition law in the European Community one finds that law is the servant of economic theories and philosophies.  This is what will happen here as a result of the implementation of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill, broadly, prohibits all anti-competitive arrangements.  I am glad that the abuse of dominant position in the market is being dealt with.  Within the Bill we have examples of what these abuses are.  They include price fixing, limiting or controlling markets, sharing markets and imposing unfair purchase or selling prices.  Also included, although not cited directly, are activities such as predatory pricing or any new forms of anti-competitive activity.  The Bill generally sticks to the tried and tested models of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome which have served the community well.</P>
    <P>The Bill will apply to every sector, individuals and companies alike, and equally to the private and public sectors. It will apply to every undertaking engaged, for gain, in the supply of goods and the provision of services.  The activity engaged in must be for what is normally considered commercial gain and must be able to affect trade in the State or in any part of the State.  That rule applies to banks, building societies, publicans, chemists, shops, supermarkets, lawyers, architects and all professions.  I am glad to see that the Bar Council have agreed to abolish their practices of fee fixing.</P>
    <P>By prohibiting anti-competitive activity the whole economy stands to benefit. Increased competition promotes growth, innovation and productivity.  The downstream effects of a competitive environment are very positive &mdash; we have only to look at the other countries with strong competition legislation, for example, Germany and the United States.  The Bill also confers new rights on individuals or undertakings to assert <Col N="1481" /> their liberty to engage in economic activity and to defend themselves against anti-competitive activities engaged in by others.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill provides for the taking of private actions in the Circuit or High Court and that action can be taken by an individual, a group or an organisation. This puts the power directly in the hands of those who are affected and they will not have to wait for the State to take a case for them.  This also allows not only for injunctive relief but also for damages, including exemplary damages. Giving such a power to the State would have been costly and against the fundamental principles of the Bill which recognises the economic rights of individuals. In any case, if the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade or any other agency had this power, it is likely that people would wait for him or her to take the action.  It is also important to note that the Minister has a right to take a representative or class action under section 6 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I believe this is very excellent legislation. There have been considerable changes in company law since the present Government came to office.  I compliment the Minister on, first, introducing the Companies Act which had been lying around for far too long and is now part of the legislative procedure.  Now we have this Competition Bill which will supersede many of the piecemeal regulations we have had over many years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I begin with one of a number of quotations from Professor J. K. Galbraith where he says:</P>
      <P>King Canute looks down on those who administer our anti trust laws with the utmost understanding and sympathy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have the least objection in principle to the principle of competition. However, I am profoundly sceptical about the significance of competition or, indeed, the idea as it is applied in practice. The whole idea of competition comes from Adam Smith who wrote a magnificent treatise on the <i>Wealth of <Col N="1482" /> Nations</i> some 200 years ago.  The problem with Adam Smith is that, like the Bible, you can quote what you wish from him and leave out what you do not like.  This is where this whole idea of competition and the unseen hand comes from.</P>
    <P>One of the more interesting letters that appeared in the columns of <i>The Irish Times</i> recently was one from ex-professor, or perhaps <i>emeritus</i> Professor Patrick Lynch about some recent economic commentaries.  He complimented not an economist but Fr. Seán Healy of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors for beginning to address some of the modern realities unlike, he said, most of the profession of economics in this country who were still operating on the basis of theories of 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>I think there is a little in this Bill of the theories of 20 year ago, and a good deal of the theories of 200 years ago.  The theory of the market economy is that the self-interests of individuals, operating within a free market, result in an optimum distribution of resources, expenditure, consumption and so on.  Adam Smith called it the &ldquo;invisible hand&rdquo;.  The regulatory mechanism for that system is, we are told, competition.  This view is not the monopoly of one sector of the economy or the other.  As Senator McCarthy quoted, some of those countries that are the models for social democracy in Europe are as keen on competition as many of those who would see themselves, like the United States, as being on the opposite extreme of the economic argument.  So we are not involved in a profound, nonsensical, ideological argument.</P>
    <P>I am quoting from J.K. Galbraith and Nicole Salinger, <i>Almost Everyone's Guide to Economics</i>.  When he says, &ldquo;almost everyone&rdquo; he is leaving out a large section of the profession of economics because they would not like what he has to say about that profession.  I suspect he was hoping they would not read it.  It says:</P>
    <P>Adam Smith detected a dismaying tendency for sellers to combine in <Col N="1483" /> order to raise prices and thus destroy this regulatory power of the market.</P>
    <P>I suppose if Adam Smith discovered that 200 years ago, when he first formulated his theory, we have reason to be grateful that we now have the legislation to try to counter-balance that tendency.  The interesting contradiction is that Adam Smith's theory also assumed that competition was, by defination, self-regulating. The final area of the basic theory of the sale of goods or of the economic system is that, since competition and the market bring the best possible results, you want as much of both as possible.  The greater the trading area, the more competition, then the stronger the market.  Also, the greater the opportunity for specialisation and division of labour, the greater the efficiency.  The corollary of this is profound commitment to extensive, if possible worldwide, free trade.  That is the theory.  At this stage one would counsel all Governments to be very wary of economists, particularly this Minister, for whom I have considerable respect for his intellectual independence and indeed his displays of political independence on occasions in the past.  A recent appointment by him of an economist to a body that should have a profound influence on our future industrial policy is one that suggests to me that he is not half as wary as he ought to be of economists.  In the same book Professor Galbraith has some very interesting things to say about economists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He is and, therefore, has an insider's perception of economics. One has to be extremely wary of the claims of economic theory.  I have a very interesting lecture in my possession by a Nobel Prize winner on the increasing absence of any reliance on empirical information by many economists.  Their models are exciting mathematical models.  This is, unlike the profession I am in or the profession Professor Raftery <Col N="1484" /> used to be in where, if you have a theory, you actually have to test it out with the facts to see whether it is a good theory or not.  However, an increasing volume &mdash; apparently &mdash; of economic writing is conveniently saying: &ldquo;Well, we do not have any sufficient empirical evidence to justify this theory but we still think it is a good idea and should be tried out.&rdquo;  If we did that in the area of the real sciences we would be in a state of considerable disaster very quickly.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, a large amount of what is put out as economic fact is no more profound than opinion and if we are looking at something like competition we would want to keep our eyes fairly wide open.  Some of us on the left &mdash; as always, I exempt myself from this criticism &mdash; could legitimately be accused of wearing ideological spectacles in terms of our adjudications on reality, but there is an increasing tendency now for those who would be on the other side of the economic divide to wear equally tunnel visioned ideological spectacles; one could even say, to find themselves in an ideological haze.  The problem about competition is that only economists are really in favour of it.  People who engage in economic activity will take every possible evasive action to avoid competition.  It is not just a tendency of some nasty people. I do not want to keep quoting Galbraith; I simply like the book because it is written by somebody with some authority.  It is an understandable tendency of any human being to try to liberate their own wealth or, indeed, the price they get for their labour from the marketplace.  That is an almost irreversible tendency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you look at what Adam Smith meant by competition it was that in the provision of any goods or service there were sufficient providers in the marketplace so that the absence of one would make no difference to the marketplace. That is what he meant by that scale of competition.  That theory was developed largely in relation to situations where businesses were owned by individuals, with small-scale agricultural and industrial production.  When you consider that Adam Smith has considerable <Col N="1485" /> hostility to the idea of a joint stock company or the precursor of the modern limited company because of what he saw as its instinctive predatory and self-preservationist nature, you realise that what we were being presented with as a model probably never existed, and rarely exists today.</P>
    <P>For instance, in the same book Galbraith says: &ldquo;Around half of all economics lectures begin with the statement, &lsquo;Let's assume competition.&rdquo;&rsquo; If we could assume competition the world would be very different.  The problem about competition is that it means different things to different people.  As the same Professor Galbraith has said, many senior American corporate executives are forever talking about how tough it is in the marketplace but most of them would not recognise the marketplace if they were in it because they are usually in a position to fix their own income.</P>
    <P>The whole theory of competition is that it is effectively self-regulating and that legislation of this kind, well-intentioned though it is, is simply to fine tune here and there in the odd place where an excess takes place.  If you were to accept that all the time in many areas, even in large areas of economic activity, competition either does not exist or is extremely imperfect, then the scale of work involved in this would be enormous. We have to assume that that is not the case.  The interesting thing is that Professor Galbraith assumes in the United States &mdash; and I use the United States because the Minister adverted to the American anti-trust legislation as being the bedrock of all of this &mdash; about 50 per cent of economic activity has moved into such market control or market dominance that it is no longer regulated by competition.</P>
    <P>I have referred to what he had to say about anti-trust legislation in the United States and its effectiveness or otherwise. The truth is that large corporations do not compete in the way the market wants them to compete.  They compete on the margins with glossy advertising and so on.  They do not compete on price because the natural self-interest not of <Col N="1486" /> the capitalist &mdash; and this is where the left is enormously deficient &mdash; but of the bureaucracy at the head of large corporations is far too cautious and wary. Also, the state that is meant to regulate them knows that the disappearance of one of them from the market would not be without effect on the market, because they are so big.  Once you have the regulatory authority, for example, the state, knowing that the large corporation has such a dominant market role that its disappearance would have a huge effect on the economy, you no longer can have competition in the way the theory suggests.</P>
    <P>There are later economic theories that deserve considerable scrutiny also.  The extension of this theory is the bedrock of the European Community.  As the Minister said, the basic principles of this legislation are taken from the Treaty of Rome.  They are the principles of competition and of not allowing a company to abuse a dominant position.  I cannot but say, slightly ironically, that it is hardly something to boast about, that we are putting into legislation a law which says that nobody should abuse the dominant position.  I take that as read.  The issue is whether we should allow people to enjoy or to achieve a dominant position.</P>
    <P>Because, like a number of things we have done in this country, it is clouded in a slightly ideologically simplistic view of competition I fear that the consequences of this legislation may be to inhibit development in some areas.  I am much more concerned about another effect.  In the competitive marketplace, not everybody competes as an equal.  Professor Galbraith, in the same book, specifically identifies one area, that is, those who sell their labour.  The point he makes as an illustration is that if somebody had a product to sell, the product would probably keep, he does not have to sell it today.  In a real competitive economy if you are selling your labour and you cannot get work, then you go hungary. As he said, that is an inconvenience that cannot get work, then you go hungry. an ideal market, if such existed, different people participating in the marketplace, <Col N="1487" /> particularly those who have to sell their labour, are at a disadvantage.  Which is why, he says, many even neo-classical economists have reluctantly accepted the idea that trade unions are a good thing.</P>
    <P>The trouble is that the competition we seem to be getting keen on here is as much based on a sense of having a grudge against trade unions as it is on the benefits to the consumer.  Whatever else one might say about the United States, it at least counterbalances its free market ideology with a legislative provision for a minimum wage.  This means you cannot simply use your capacity to extract cheap labour to improve or enhance your competitive position.  There is a plateau below which you may not lower your wages bill. We do not have such a provision in this country.  As a result, we have the much lauded private sector airline paying its airline pilots not much more than one and a half times the average male industrial wage.  Apparently this is a good thing.  It can also make demands from its workforce about when they work, the hours and their flexibility.  This must be enormously disruptive to family life and must cause strain and stress.</P>
    <P>In terms of what makes this country worth living in it is not in our long term interest to march off in an ideological pursuit of competition based on the exploitation of considerably cheaper labour.  As there are 250,000 unemployed people in the country you will inevitably get people to work for very low rates of pay.  If this were to extend through the community, you would simply end up with increasing numbers of poorly paid workers unable to be the consumers of those goods and services which were allegedly coming to them more cheaply. The corollary of a good active competitive market is good active labour legislation which protects workers. Otherwise there may be no protection for the workforce where there is competition between companies, to the extent that it can exist, in which large numbers of the goods and services are provided by what can only be described by that most awful word, an oligopoly; in other words, it is <Col N="1488" /> not a monopoly, but the numbers involved are so small that they actually dominate the marketplace.</P>
    <P>If somebody gets the idea of putting local authority services out to tender, for instance, that may well induce less than responsive trade unions to agree to intelligent work practice.  It may also, on the other hand, facilitate the provision of services by companies who do not feel obliged to pay people who are unskilled and poorly trained a reasonable wage.  If we are to have local authority services put out to tender, provided all those tendering are prepared to agree to pay the workforce of their tendering company the trade union rate for the job, that would be a very interesting idea.  But competition based on the easiest option in our society, cheap labour &mdash; which you will always get in a society with 250,000 unemployed people &mdash; is competition on the backs of the poorest, not competition between thrusting entrepreneurs.  It is a competition of exploiters.</P>
    <P>It is no surprise that the major supermarket chain which is most often identified as having the lowest prices for the standard basket of household purchase is the one which has been lambasted by the Labour Court for its attitude to part-time labour.  I do not believe that that is the sort of society we want.  Therefore, I do not believe that competition without protection of the labour force is a good thing.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly that economists should be treated with some scepticism, unless they can produce evidence to support their theories.  Evidence does not mean simply saying that two things happen at the same time, therefore one causes the other.  For instance, there is an economist abroad, towards whom the Minister seems to show some approval, who says that the increases in public sector pay are causing the decline in growth in our economy this year.  The fact that the two things happen together does not mean that one caused the other. The fact that ice-cream sales and drownings increased during the summer does not mean that eating ice-cream caused people to drown.  You have to prove <Col N="1489" /> cause and effect.  It is a quality that seems to be lost in many economists.</P>
    <P>If we are going to laud the idea of competition we must ask ourselves first whether we realise and accept that economic activity is meant to be for the benefit of human beings, not for their subjection. Any vigorous competition must be based on humane and proper protection for our workforce.  Second, we must believe that it is of some use to us.</P>
    <P>This country is denuded of virtually every major international airline, with the biggest British airline having pulled out of the country because price competition on the Dublin-London route had become too severe.  This is an airline which until this year was enormously profitable.  It is one which many people of a different ideological position from myself used to hold up as a model of successful privatisation and which did not have the constraints Aer Lingus would have in terms of being a State body. British Airways pulled out of the Dublin-London route and the Cork-London route because price competition had become so severe.  I am fascinated by the argument that the consumers are better off in this country because we do not have British Airways and have marginally reduced prices in some areas.  I thought the Minister of State had enough of this House to do her for the rest of her life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>She has my sympathies. She has spent more time in this House than I have.  The point I was making is that the introduction of Ryanair seemed a great idea to everybody, to sort out the public sector trade unions.  I am fascinated by the idea that the unions dominate Aer Lingus.  If you want to sort out some of the ageing bureaucrats at the top of the trade unions, I would be the first to support that campaign.  Most Members of the Oireachtas are quite happy to do business with them.  The trouble is that where there are well organised trade unions, members negotiate good conditions of work for themselves.  I am intrigued by the fact that a private sector <Col N="1490" /> competitor has been encouraged to reduce the profitability of Aer Lingus, perhaps quite legitimately, because Aer Lingus operated a price fixing arrangement with British Airways.  However, to do this to a company that has actually been more successful at creating employment than most other companies in the private sector in recent years, and to reduce its access to profits which could be used to extend its other profitable and non-travel activities, is carrying ideological obsession to the point of nonsense.</P>
      <P>I am also intrigued by the obsession with competition.  There is almost a correlation here; the more people are keen on competition, the more they want to defend the Common Agricultural Policy.  I would like to hear from some of my colleagues in this House, in Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, how they reconcile their belief that free market competition is good with the resolute defence for something that is the direct antithesis of free market competition, namely the Common Agricultural Policy, which penalises consumers with high prices, penalises taxpayers with huge surplus stocks and gives some farmers a good living.  Is it the case that competition is good for trade unions and bad for farmers? I would like to hear an explanation of the logical consistency of both positions because most Members in front of me are in favour of competition but not for farmers.  That confirms what Professor Galbraith said, that everybody thinks it is a good idea for everybody, except themselves.  As he said, the only people who believe strongly in real, free competition are economists in secure State-funded academic jobs who do not have to deal with it themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this legislation; nobody could argue with it in principle.  However, on a couple of occasions when I was thinking of buying a computer, I discovered that when you add up the question of currency variations, VAT etc., there was what was described by a friend of mine as &ldquo;the Paddy factor&rdquo;, the extra <Col N="1491" /> 25 per cent added to the price after everything else has been dealt with, which we are told is because of the extra transport costs.  When one then discovers that Belfast is 100 miles further from where the computer is being sent than Dublin and that it is still being sold 20 per cent cheaper in Belfast, one realises that there is a supplier who has a monopoly and who has an Irish agency and can, therefore, slip a convenient 25 per cent on to the price.  There are whole areas of Irish activity where there is a considerable need to open up the activities to proper scrutiny.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to competition, provided it is not at the expense of the most vulnerable in our society, like the cheap labour used in contract cleaning or in many of the late night stores and the extraordinary exploitation of part-time workers by Dunnes Stores.  I have no objection to competition as long as it is not at those people's expense.  If it involves efficiency, good management and organisation, it is a good thing.  We tend to perpetually identify the appalling quality of our management as one of our problems but then all our remedies deal with everybody else's problems, wages, the public sector and so on and the appalling quality of our management does not get us anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can raise the theory of the abuse of the dominant position and so on.  I am somewhat sceptical about the significance of saying in law that nobody will be allowed to abuse the dominant position. I actually took for granted that in no area of our society, in a democratic society, would we allow any group or individual to abuse their dominant position.  For example, many people beat a lot of drums about the trade unions and the fact that they should not be allowed to abuse their dominant position to the extent they do. Yet, we hear the two big Irish banks argue that their charges are reasonable because they are not as high as those in Germany, while at the same time, they <Col N="1492" /> charge the highest real interest rates in the entire OECD, according to the last report I read and nobody is prepared to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>I tend to believe that this legislation, like most legislation, is for the small man, the small company and that the large players, because of the fact that they have what Professor Galbraith would describe as &ldquo;market power&rdquo;, will not be subject to similar regulation.  I am convinced that the service in our banking sector for the individual customer has deteriorated disgracefully. I have had to queue more often in banks since they modernised their technology than ever I did.  That is a dominant position and they are using their dominant position to pay off the appalling investment decisions they made outside the country.  I am sceptical about legislation which says &ldquo;they shall not&rdquo; when that most regulated sector, banking, with the Central Bank keeping a watchful eye on them, apparently is allowed to abuse a dominant position to the extent that small businesses are squealing with pain because of the way they are treated.  I am wary of the background to this.  In regard to the licensed trade, I am sceptical about the dubious practices the major brewery here uses to persuade publicans to predominantly sell its products.  Will any Government say to a major capital investor that they are abusing their dominant position?</P>
    <P>This theory of competition, going back as far as Adam Smith, is logically driven towards a commitment to free trade and to competition in a larger and larger bloc. The Minister and some of my colleagues here have said that the introduction of competition in the home market may well improve the situation for Irish companies post-1992.  My problem with that is that the economic theory which was used to justify the creation of the Single Market is increasingly under attack from within the profession of economics although most Irish economists choose to ignore it.  I do not wish to quote Professor Galbraith again but he explains the way economics work.  There is a considerable amount of authoritative academic work on trade which suggests that one of the <Col N="1493" /> most sacred principles, the assumption that if there is free trade in the long term there will be equilibrium which will distribute the benefits evenly throughout the sector within which free trade takes place, is increasingly under challenge.</P>
    <P>During my adult life, having observed even at a superficial glance, the United States, it is perfectly obvious that in a large-scale free market economy with no boundaries to trade, there has not been an even distribution of the benefits of growth throughout that economy.  Therefore, one of the problems about the ideological commitment to competition, and the corollary of that, which is free trade, is that we are liable to sell ourselves down the tubes.  The NESC report entitled <i>Ireland in the European Community</i> gives a terrifying forecast of the future.  On page 348 of that report it states:</P>
    <P>In summary, the new theory of trade takes account of those very features of the modern economy &mdash; increasing returns, external economies, the advantages of experience, monopoly power and the barriers to entry created by high capital and R &amp; D requirements &mdash; which were originally used to explain regional inequality and divergence. Contrary to the impression created by the &lsquo;Cecchini Report&rsquo; it is those new theories which include the possibility of cumulative processes of growth and decline.  There is every justification for Cecchini's Committee drawing heavily on the new approach in identifying and estimating the aggregate benefits from completion of the internal market but, having done so, it behoved them to listen also to what the new theories say about the distribution of those gains.</P>
    <P>There may well be more trade within the European Community after 1992 because of the competitive forces.  There is no guarantee, in fact, there is considerable evidence to the contrary, that those aggregate benefits will result in any equalisation of economic performance within the Community.  That is what bothers me about those who would have us ride on the steed of competition and free trade <Col N="1494" /> into this apparently new dawn of great things in the future.  The economic evidence is to the contrary, that a small country on the periphery which does not have the right to offer various forms of protection to its internal markets, which is told that the limits of support for its own infrastructure will be defined elsewhere, is not in a position to compete in terms of scale.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would advise care in this area.  It is grand if one is dealing with buttons, white goods, television sets or the panoply of consumer goods but it is entirely different when dealing with an area which has a natural semi-monopoly and it is detrimental in areas where there is a commodity which cannot be priced, for example, health care.  There are what I can only describe as eccentric economists &mdash; and there are many of them in this country &mdash; who think we should privatise health care, that somehow if we introduce an element of competition into the health care system we will have a better system.  Much to my amazement they cite the United States as an example of a successful privatised health care system.  The fact is, of course, the United States health care system as a percentage of GNP is the most expensive in the developed world, heading towards 11 per cent of GNP in comparison, say, to Sweden and Ireland, at around 6 per cent and the United Kingdom at around 7 per cent.  In spite of that, a large section of the United State's population do not have medical insurance.  Approximately, 25 to 40 per cent of pregnant women in America do not go to a doctor until less than six weeks before their baby is born. Although they are a rich country, they have a very high mortality rate.</P>
    <P>This legislation would be useful if the theory worked but it will not except in areas where consumers are being ripped off.  However, if it is a prelude to a view of the future, this country will not benefit in the long term because it will not do the things the Minister wants it to do.  It will not create the climate in which large scale competitive internationally trading Irish companies will develop.  It says nothing about what I listed from the NESC report <Col N="1495" /> such as the high capital cost of research and development or market entry.  If we are to have only the same resources available to us as the rest of Europe, we will inevitably fall behind.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, the Bill contains one of those mechanisms which will make entry to the market difficult.  While everybody envisages the aggrieved person suing somebody who has indulged in anti-competitive practices, has anybody thought about the reverse, where the person who has a successful or dominant position in the market will use precisely the processes available in this legislation to undermine a potential competitor by suing them on the pretext that the new competitor is indulging in anti-competitive practices?  This is a well known trick in the United States.  I am acquainted with a businessman, in a totally and almost classically Adam Smith sort of business, making wire brushes and products like that.  As his business began to grow the dominant company in that region in the United States sued him for being in breach of anti-trust legislation, not because the dominant company believed that but because they knew they could tie him up in the courts for years and at great legal cost.  As my friend's company had been expanding and, therefore, were a capital consumer and the other company had developed and was not in need of capital, he effectively was forcing my friend to divert capital resources out of the company into the courts.</P>
    <P>The legitimately aggrieved citizen will not be the only person who will use the courts under this legislation.  The person who has a niche in the marketplace and who is rich because of previous success may well be able to use the judicial process outlined here to prevent somebody getting a similar foothold in the marketplace. That is the direct opposite to what is intended.  It is presumably for such reasons that Professor Galbraith drew the analogy between those who are enforcing anti-trust legislation and poor old King Canute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill to the Seanad.  This legislation is long overdue. I congratulate the Minister on steering this legislation through the Dáil and now in the Seanad.  The Minister by his actions, experiences and determination wants to see positive change in so many areas in this country, not least of which is the area of competition.  Indeed, his track record with regard to deregulation of the airline market and the creation of competition in that area have brought tremendous benefits to ordinary consumers, contrary to what other people might like to think.  There has been real and substantive change in that area &mdash; air travel has become far more available to the majority of people in this country.</P>
      <P>We have seen what competition can do.  Indeed, what pleases me in particular about this on a Government level is that the philosophy and the instruments needed for us as a people and for an economy to grow from strength to strength in the coming years are beginning to emanate from various Departments. That is long overdue and is an essential ingredient to ensuring that, say, Ireland Incorporated has a chance of survival within the EC, being a major player in that area as well as being capable of looking after its own interests in the greater international arena.</P>
      <P>It is often forgotten that Ireland is basically a trading nation and as such, this legislation can only assist our growth. Growth is a key element in the creation of jobs which is, as everybody knows, at the root of so many of our problems. While at times legislation like this may seem in some way distant, in fact, it is a very tangible and substantive way of making a direct contribution to broadening our ability to do things in a more positive way, thereby creating more employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the privilege of introducing a similar Bill in the Dáil on behalf of the Progressive Democrats in 1988 and I am delighted to see that the Minister has embodied all that philosophy in this Bill. Obviously, this is a more extensive Bill. The Bill I introduced in 1988 was supported by Fine Gael and I hope they will <Col N="1497" /> be in the same mood when this Bill is being passed here.</P>
    <P>Competition is the life blood of economic growth and I do not believe anybody would deny that.  From the day we are born we are involved in a competitive environment.  It is by a balanced and fair competitive environment that we grow and expand, and the same applies to economic life.  I was amazed to hear some other speakers, particularly the previous speaker, say that competition is only a theory, that it relates only to academics and that in reality nobody is practising competition.  That is the greatest load of bunkum that I have heard in this House for some time and it has no basis.  Competition exists in every facet of life.</P>
    <P>In relation to Senator Ryan's analogy that there should be competition where trade unions are involved and not in other areas, trade unions themselves embody competition in inter-trade union rivalry. It is ironic that such rivalry has unquestionably improved the ability and outlook of trade unions in recent years, particularly with the creation of SIPTU and the amalgamation of much smaller unions to give them a more focused drive in the marketplace and a clearer identity of what they are trying to achieve.  If there was no competition between them we would never have evolved to the stage where the trade union movement is taking a much more forceful and positive view trying to create jobs and new industry and in forging ahead.  That has been the core reason for competition in that area.</P>
    <P>Competition exists in all walks of life. What we have not had is a basis by which competition should occur, some simple rules and regulations to ensure that there is competition in a very fair and balanced way.  There should be some authority for the small individual, the individual who is trying to start a new business, to get on his feet, to create employment, to make a contribution to the market place and to provide a service for the consumer.  That type of competition has not been allowed to grow because of the dangers of anti-competitive practices which have existed, and do exist in our marketplace and <Col N="1498" /> because the abuse of a dominant position clearly reigns in many areas of activity.</P>
    <P>At last, because of the introduction of this Bill a new Competition Authority will be set up which will ensure, in particular, that the individual has the simple right of redress to ensure that this growth cannot be stunted by major players in the marketplace.  Surely that must be welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>A clear anomoly also existed in that Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome have only applied to companies that were involved in the export market.  It is ridiculous that over the last number of years those Articles applied only to companies that exported their products and not to companies concerned solely with the domestic market.  The Minister is right in saying that those companies which were subject to Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome showed greater growth and have been leaner and fitter in attacking the marketplace.  They have been conscious of competition, growth, employment and research and development, and that has created employment in the domestic market.  Because those companies had to be keener, fitter and more aware of the competition they faced on international markets they have had to put resources into their companies to take on foreign companies, and that has created more employment.  This has improved our technology base and all round ability to be successful.  If that is the case, then the application of a similar law to Irish companies which operate on the domestic market should be welcomed as it would benefit those companies.</P>
    <P>It is peculiar to the psyche of Irish people that when something new is introduced &mdash; whether it is good or bad, and more particularly when it is clearly good, their concentration seems to focus on the potential negative aspects that may or may not arise.  We fail to look at the opportunities such legislation will create for companies who wish to operate in the marketplace.  The benefits of this legislation greatly outweigh the very few potential negative aspects.</P>
    <P>As a young person who emigrated I find it consistently disappointing that we <Col N="1499" /> are still so negative about change.  We have no confidence in the ability of our people, our management, trade unions or workers.  We have been successful in many areas not alone on the domestic market but on the international market also.  We should not be afraid of this type of legislation.  We should welcome it, get involved in it and use it to our commercial advantage in the interest of creating and increasing employment.  That is what we must focus on and not on the so-called negative aspects that, by and large, do not exist.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Japan and Germany as being the two most successful exporting economies in the world and I agree with him.  I also agree with his assertion that it is because of the intensity of competition in those markets that they are successful, but that alone has not made them successful.  One of the greatest restraints on economic growth here is our banking system.  Germany and Japan have an equity based banking system whereas our banking system is based purely on secured lending.  That totally different philosophy has engendered competition.  While this Bill will make a substantial impact on our market, there is a need for other mechanisms in the marketplace if we are to be as successful as Japan and Germany.</P>
    <P>In the past ten years our banking system has failed in the area of job creation and economic growth.  It has consistently blocked new ideas, new companies struggling to get off the ground.  It has not sought to widen its base and thus become an integral part of employment creation and economic growth in this country.  I do not accept that the banks are in business solely to make a profit and that is their only concern. If the banks in other economies can take this approach, why can the Irish banking system not do likewise?  They have been operating in a cosy, comfortable environment and have had no real competition.  They have not had the concern or ability to expand into other areas of business and see their role in a totally different way.  I believe the banking <Col N="1500" /> system in this country will have to see its role differently.  It is going to have to see a fundamental change in its approach to the marketplace and the introduction of this type of competition legislation will, I hope, force them to see the type of change that is necessary.  Post-1992, which is now very close indeed, I want to see competition by other European banks on the marketplace in this country.</P>
    <P>Why we have such a high level of interest rate in this country is beyond my understanding.  I do not profess to be an academic or an economist, but for years we were told it was because inflation was rampant that we had the worst rate of inflation and we had all sorts of problems. As a people, we largely accepted that. Now we have practically the lowest inflation rate in Europe and we still have the highest interest rates prevailing.  This is unacceptable.  There is no defensible argument, in my view, against this kind of nonsense, because that is all it is.</P>
    <P>The banking system in this country is going to have to get up into the marketplace and take a leaf out of the economies of Germany, Japan and the United States of America, get involved in a more direct way on an equity based system to help companies expand and grow.  They have the resources to do it.  They have the expertise already working the banking system.  I am not saying the banks when they get involved on an equity base within a company should see their role as totally a financial one, but they should apply some of their resources in manpower and in skills to make them available to these companies on the basis that it would help these companies to grow.  This, in itself, would be a major step forward.  They do not have to stay there forever.  There always is a cut-off point where their role would be complete.  In some companies it might only take six months, some perhaps a little longer; but I am not suggesting that they become shareholders in every operation on a permanent basis. They should be able to move resources in, get growth, make a profit if necessary and withdraw from a company and reinvest elsewhere in other words, make the finances work in the marketplace but <Col N="1501" /> particularly make them work to help to create job creation, to use money to create jobs.</P>
    <P>If we could reduce unemployment, without question Ireland would be the finest country in Europe to live in.  Even with those difficulties, we still have some of the greatest assets, which many European countries envy but we are hamstrung in our ability because of our large number of unemployed and the drain on resources from the State and from all of us as individual taxpayers, particularly the PAYE taxpayer.  Yet, small, insignificant drops in unemployment levels make an enormous impact in other areas, even in confidence, in the confidence of all of us in our outlook and in our own economy.  These are the aspects that must be looked at.</P>
    <P>That type of philosophy, which this Bill sets down as a clear marker for the Irish economy, is the philosophy which we as a party have professed since our foundation. These are the type of mechanisms that are being put in place in the marketplace to allow greater freedom for economies to grow and to give people a greater ability to grow.  If we as a people &mdash; and that includes all of us &mdash; do not take up the opportunities this type of legislation is creating for us, then it is our failure; it is not somebody's else's failure.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with the anti-competitive agreements and practices that exists in a wide range of areas in the marketplace, and that is as it should be. The areas of anti-competitive practices are wide-ranging.  People have spoken about the legal profession for years and there has been a reference to the licensed trade but it is the principle that underlines anti-competitive practices that cause me the greatest concern.  The one thing I am pleased about in this Bill is that the Minister has had the courage to apply this legislation both to the public and the private sector.  For too long in many aspects of legislation introduced in this country we tend to block off secluded areas and give all sorts of ridiculous reasons why they cannot be under the same legislation as the rest of us.  This measure is a very positive step forward <Col N="1502" /> and I see great benefits for the public sector as well as the private sector in its application.</P>
    <P>With the introduction of this legislation, has the Minister the ability retrospectively to look at areas?  For instance, I am thinking of the size of two supermarket chains this country which clearly have a dominant position.  I am not saying they are abusing that position.  I think the subtlety with which the Minister stated the position here to day is correct: we are not trying to stop large companies existing but what we do want to ensure is that the potential abuse that may cause is avoided.  That is the correct way forward but I believe there is a serious question. We have seen it in the bread price war.  We have seen it with the milk problems in the supermarkets.  Indeed, the Director of the Fair Trade Commission has already expressed concern about this on numerous occasions over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>Is it time to limit the growth in that area?  Can this be done now under this legislation?  Can it be done retrospectively, actually to reduce companies' positioning the marketplace?  Is it possible under this legislation to go in that direction?  It may not be necessary to do so, but I am simply posing the question if it is possible to do so.  If it is, I think that general signal should be sent to the marketplace &mdash; that there are concerns with areas of activity and that if companies are going to abuse their position in the future then action will be taken, not just to prevent them doing so but to ensure they will actually have to reduce their dominant position to a satisfactory level in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>I accept that a dominant position is a very subjective thing.  You cannot say that because a company may have 10 per cet, 20 per cent, 40 or 50 per cent of the market that is the criterion alone which would give it a dominant position in the marketplace.  You could very well have quite a small company, but with an extremely talented workforce and an extremely talented management team who, because of their ability through the structures within their own company, <Col N="1503" /> have had the potential to grow to tremendous influence in the marketplace.  You cannot say that because they have been successful for those reasons and are a major player in the marketplace they should be reduced in size.  That is not what I am driving at.  What I am saying is that size in itself is not a criterion.  It is how they behave in the marketplace.  If that directly affects not just the consumer but affects the ability of other companies to compete and to maintain their employment and even to increase their employment, and if a large company's activity is actually reducing employment in other companies without necessarily affecting the consumer, then to my way of thinking that is an abuse of a dominant position. It may not necessarily affect the consumer but it directly affects employment in the marketplace and a company's ability to operate.  That should be emphasised in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I am concerned with the emphasis that has been laid here today on the licensing ability of the new Competition Authority. The impression being given here this morning is that every company in the country is going to be running to this Competition Authority to seek a licence to exclude them from the competition legislation.  That should not be the case. Indeed, I would see it as a mechanism of last resort to be used to influence the marketplace.  That message must be sent out into the marketplace quite clearly and I think any instructions to this new Competition Authority should make the Department's view quite clear.  I do not believe that the Competition Authority should have a hugely interpretative role. That is not to say that they should not have flexibility; but I think that the interpretation the Minister and the Department are putting on this legislation should be signalled more clearly in the marketplace because I fear that the emphasis is all on the one area which is a less significant aspect of what this competition legislation is trying to achieve. In regard to whoever would approach the Competition Authority to seek to put themselves in a position where they do <Col N="1504" /> not have to be subjected to this legislation, the criteria must be the strictest and it must be most seriously investigated to ensure that they are not simply using this legislation for their own self-interest without any real concern for either general competition or the consumer in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>I think there is a wrong emphasis in the marketplace.  Rightly or wrongly, small business in the marketplace has been overawed because of the emphasis on this aspect of the legislation.  I think there is a need for clarity and greater emphasis on the other side of what this legislation is trying to achieve.  I believe that the Authority's role in the marketplace is to ensure that the existing conditions allow for the fullest use of this legislation.  I shudder to think that it is there as some kind of a referee, or that it will get totally and utterly bogged down in one role, such as &ldquo;This is our boy to ensure that we can avoid everything else in the marketplace&rdquo;. Even that perception must be guarded against because, if it is to be used or abused in that way, it would be detrimental to the operation of this legislation.</P>
    <P>There is need for greater emphasis on the other side and a broader role for the actual Competition Authority itself.  I am not satisfied that there has been enough consideration &mdash; at least heretofore in print, at any rate &mdash; given to the greater role of the Competition Authority.  That could be looked at to give the Authority a much more expansive role in the marketplace. I know the Minister stated that it must be flexible enough to put its own structures, etc, in place.  I do not have any difficulty with that, but I think guidance from a Department is also very necessary. This Minister is well known in the marketplace for his views and I want to see that type of view implemented in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>I also agree that under the Mergers and Monopolies Act, for which the Competition Authority will be responsible, they should &mdash; quite correctly, in my view &mdash; have regard to the employment impact of any mergers.  That is an extremely important point and is a central element <Col N="1505" /> in regard to what role the Competition Authority should be carving out for itself in the marketplace.  Indeed, when many companies look at mergers the first thing that seems to be on the agenda is the shrinking of employment, because it is easy to save resources, but it is not always the case that it becomes a more efficient and more dynamic organisation.  There is a role for the Competition Authority to clearly point out that companies should have a greater regard for the employment area and a greater understanding of what exactly they are trying to achieve within the context of employment levels in terms of company growth, and I am talking about market share growth as well.  These two things at times seem to be unrelated when one sees mergers taking place. There is an automatic and foregone conclusion before anybody does anything that jobs are going to be shed, be it on the factory floor or in management, because nowadays everybody seems to be subject to this.  Again, I would emphasise the Competition Authority's role in having greater regard for the impact on employment levels, in particular where mergers occur.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the power in the legislation, if he feels there is a problem in the marketplace, to instruct the Competition Authority to act, or to act directly himself. The only thing that worries me about that is this: is it open to different Ministers to put different ideological interpretations on what he or she may like to see occur in the marketplace?  It always worries me, when powers are given to Ministers, that they could go in the opposite direction to the general thrust of the legislation.  I have a general concern in that area.  I am not quite sure how one overcomes it, but the possibility exists and I dislike it intensely.  The fact that we have an over-centralised bureaucracy, with a mania for power in so many departments, and a great unwillingness to relinquish or devolve power, has always concerned me.  I get particularly concerned when I see great latitude being allowed to Ministers.  I wonder if my interpretation is correct and what <Col N="1506" /> constraints may be on the Minister to act in that area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the signal the Minister has sent into the marketplace in regard to the strong but I think fair lobbying by RGDATA on a number of issues.  The ban on below cost selling has been the main concern in that area.  I congratulate the Minister on speaking with those people and listening to myself and many other TDs and Senators from both sides of the House expressing concern in that area.  The Minister's definite commitment to allow a phased implementation of the legislation to see how it will work in the marketplace is right.  It was clearly identified there was a danger that an overnight removal of the ban on below cost selling might allow large companies to get a grip on a situation before anybody had time to react.  I think that was a sensible approach.  I commend the Minister for listening and I also commend RGDATA for making a fair and balanced case in regard to that issue.</P>
    <P>We are heading into the Single Market. That will mean competition in many walks of life that have not been subjected to it before.  I see this legislation as very much part of that process.  I referred earlier to this legislation covering State monopolies. I do not have a problem with State involvement in many areas of public life, but what I do have a difficulty with is the notion that competition cannot exist where many State monopolies exist.  I firmly believe that that is just ridiculous nonsense.  I do not believe that it is in the interests of the taxpayers that monopolies should be allowed to exist in any area.  There should be and must be competition. I am thinking of areas like energy, which I know the Minister for Energy is looking at, transport, which I know the Minister for Tourism and Transport is looking at, and the postal services.  All these areas have an opportunity now, with the existence of this legislation, to face competitive competition &mdash; if that is the right way to put it &mdash; in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>There are resources within the State and the private sector but no one area has all the answers or all the resources. <Col N="1507" /> It is a combination of those resources in both areas that will get the best results for this country.  I want to see that type of competitive partnership between the State and the private sector.</P>
    <P>There is one area not addressed in the Bill.  The legislation will cover public State companies, but how do you draw the line where major State subsidies exist?  How do you decide there is fair and real competition if a company is getting substantive State subsidies and using those subsidies to create a dominant and, I can assure you, an abusive dominant position in the marketplace?  Where under this legislation will companies have the capacity to deal with that?  How does the existence of huge State subsidies to State Companies come in when one wants to create competition between private sector companies and State companies? I do not think that has been addressed in the context of this Bill. Where is the bottom line?  What are the criteria to be used in judgment?</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the situation has improved in the recent past, in too many areas it is very hard to break down the accounts of many State companies to see precisely where subsidies given in one area are being used to prop up activities of the company in other areas.  It is very difficult to break them down and thus it is difficult to apply strict and fair competition between aspects and activities of various State companies with genuine activities in the marketplace.  I would like to see that question addressed. I do not want to go into an area of activity in which, the House will know, I am involved myself, transport &mdash; that is for another day.  I am dealing with this Bill on the broadest canvas, but nevertheless these are fair questions which should be asked of State monopolies and how this competition legislation will ensure that real and fair competition can exist in the marketplace.  I will be particularly interested to hear the response in relation to where State subsidies exist.</P>
    <P>I am delighted this legislation has been introduced.  I was privileged to introduce a similar Bill in the other House on behalf <Col N="1508" /> of the Progressive Democrats but this Bill is obviously more extensive.  I am convinced it will be to the greater benefit of the market here and in particular to the small operator, the small shopkeeper, the small grocer.  I see this as the first acknowledgement of the need for the small entrepreneur, who does not want the State, who can open up a small business. It might not create huge employment, but enough of them can create considerable employment.  This legislation offers great encouragement.  It should instill confidence in the ability of the State to provide the correct environment for small companies to prosper, to grow and to create employment.  I look forward to the completion of the measure in this House and its passage into law. We will all be better off for its existence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank the Minister for coming to the House and spending so much time with us.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, I welcome competition and I welcome the commitment shown in the Minister's speech in that direction.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>We recognise also that the creation and maintenance of an institutional and legislative framework which promotes strong market rivalry and competition is one of the most positive things Government can do to promote growth, foster development and generate prosperity.</P>
      <P>I concur with that view.  I believe competition will bring out the best in people whether in sport or in business.  Of course, sometimes it can bring out the worst also.  That is why we have to have rules of the game and a referee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hardly surprising that, once again, I disagree with Senator Ryan, who I am sorry, is not in the House.  I am astonished to hear him say that only economists want competition.  I do not classify myself as an economist, but I recognise the value of competition.  Perhaps he should have stood outside Páirc Uí Caoimh last Sunday evening when there were 50,000 people coming out after a good, competitive game and tried to sell the theory <Col N="1509" /> to them that there should be no competition. I think he would need many people to protect him It is a crazy notion to say that we do not want competition. It can, of course, bring out the worst in people, too, as we saw with Boris Becker in tennis or as we see occasionally in football matches between Cork and Kerry.  In the case of this Bill I see this regulatory Authority as the referee and the Competition Bill as the guidelines by which we must operate.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that once again we are treated to blind, hard left-wing ideology, the sort of conventional wisdom of the hard left.  The trouble about conventional wisdom is that by the time it is conventional it is no longer wisdom. Have the hard left learned nothing from what has happened in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union?  The moderate left in Britain and across Europe have learned.  I wish our people would learn a little too.</P>
    <P>I agree with most of what Senator Cullen had to say.  He referred to lending and high interest rates and the fact that our banks lend only when matters are fairly secure.  That is true.  There is very little risk-taking in banking in this country and very little venture capital around. Somebody once described an Irish bank manager as being a person who would give you an umbrella on a fine day and want it back on a wet day.  That is an accurate description.  But, having said that, I say to Senator Cullen and the Government that foreign banks, too, like to get their money back.</P>
    <P>I was extremely disappointed our Government ensured that the foreign banks would get their money back in the arrangement that was arrived at in the Anglo-Irish Meats situation.  That means that foreign banks who gave unsecured loans of hundreds of millions of pounds to Anglo-Irish Meats, are now guaranteed their money back by forcing a situation where Anglo-Irish Meats will have to make £90 million profit per year, which can only be achieved by the dominant position which Anglo-Irish Meats enjoy, which in turn will enable them to depress the price of cattle to the producer.  In <Col N="1510" /> effect, the mistakes made by gambling on the Stock Exchange in London and in Dublin money got from international banks will not cost the bankers money, but the poor farmer will have to pay for it.  It was a particularly bad arrangement which will end in disaster for many people, but presumably not the banks and not Mr. Goodman.</P>
    <P>Given the commitment of the Minister to competition, the fact is that the biggest offenders with regard to monopoly situations in the country are the State-owned companies.  We have a monopoly as far as the supply of electricity is concerned, as we have with regard to gas. Until very recently the same situation applied to air transport, railroads, Bus Atha Cliath and so on.  If Senator Ryan tried to convince the air travellers that competition was a bad thing.  I believe he would get his answer very quickly.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example where a little competition would do a lot of good.  It costs virtually as much to get a return ticket from Cork to Dublin as it does from Cork to London, because there is no competition allowed on the Cork/Dublin route.  Let me give a better example. There is very limited competition allowed on the Irish-Brussels route &mdash; in fact there is virtually none.  It costs roughly £500 to get a return ticket.  In the last two years on two occasions I got a return ticket with an 11 hour flight programme to parts of the United States for considerably less than £500, because there is competition on the North Atlantic route.  Aer Lingus &mdash; and more power to them &mdash; rose to the challenge when competition was allowed on that route and it did them good, and Aer Rianta benefited enormously.  They made huge profits as a result of competition and the number of travellers using that airline increased also.  Of course, the travellers benefited too.  It is nonsense to say that competition is not good for the consumer or that only economists are in favour of it.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the situation with regard to the State monopolies tackled. There are very good reasons for this.  We have only to look at what happened a <Col N="1511" /> few weeks ago when a relatively small number of people in the ESB &mdash; not poorly paid people I would remind Senators but very well paid compared with national average wage rates &mdash; caused a national strike, caused the supply of our energy to be cut off, caused pandemonium in factories, homes, transport, etc.  That should never happen again and one of the most effect ways to ensure that is to have alternative supplies.  My proposal would be to split the generation side of the ESB into several different units, allowing the transmission grid, which would be separated from generation, to buy from a number of different sources.  In addition it is imperative, not only for security of supply at a competitive price, and that we connect to the British grid, which in turn is connected to the mainline European grid.  That is the kind of security we can get from alternative supplies, and that is the only means we have of getting competitively priced energy.</P>
    <P>In that respect also may I refer to the other source of energy, another State monopoly, An Bord Gáis.  As a nation we have a duty to ensure that we have an alternative source of gas.  That means connecting to mainland Britain which in turn is connected to the European grid, which in turn is connected to Siberia.  Let us get a really secure and competitive energy source.</P>
    <P>Let us look at communications.  It cost exactly twice as much to make a telephone call from Dublin to Luxembourg as it does from Luxembourg to Dublin, but no matter what way you twist the map it is the same distance both ways.  I know An Bord Telecom are making fine profits at present and part of the reason for those fine profits is the fact that our telephone charges are uncompetitive. The United States have the best telephone service in the world and this service is provided at a very competitive price.  They have a very large market which is something that the left will not like, and they have achieved that position by competing with a number of different telephone companies.  Senators will recall <Col N="1512" /> that the United States Government broke up what used to be affectionately referred to in America as &ldquo;Ma Bell&rdquo;, the Bell Telephone Company.</P>
    <P>In the United States today if you pick up the telephone in your hotel and ask for an international call the first question you are asked by the operator is &ldquo;which company sir?&rdquo; I remember the first time I was asked this question I wondered what the operator was talking about.  I had to ask her and she asked me which telephone company I wanted to use because there are different rates of charge.  Being ignorant of these facts I mentioned the only one I knew since I did not know anything about the difference in price.  That competition is what keeps them efficient and on their toes.</P>
    <P>If you move into a flat or as they prefer to call it, a condiminium and you ask for a telephone they will ask if you want it now or in one hour's time, what colour and many of other questions.  Within the time it takes to write and post a letter to An Bord Telecom they would have arrived with the telephone, installed it and gone again.  That is the kind of service this country needs if we are to compete on an equal basis with companies which operate in the grid, in the US, Japan and Germany.  We badly need to bring competition into the State monopolies.</P>
    <P>How would Senator Ryan convince all those young people who work in Dublin and like to go home at the weekends to meet their girlfriends, boyfriends, play football or hurling matches or whatever, now that they have a taste of very cheap transport from private bus operators from Dublin to Leitrim or Mayo or wherever, that that is bad for them?  I would like to see him try.  Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann, are trying to compete and they have brought their prices down.  Do you think they would have brought them down if there were not private operators? No more than Aer Lingus would have brought down their prices if Ryanair had not been set up.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that we need competition but we need to do something urgently about State monopolies.  Let me give one final example where a State <Col N="1513" /> monopoly is just as likely to abuse its position as a private monopoly.  I refer to afforestation.  Great efforts are made by the Community and by the Government to encourage private planting because by a very significant margin, we had the lowest level of private ownership of forests in the Community somewhere between 5 to 8 per cent.  It is changing substantially now because there has been a considerable increase in private planting. Before the rush of private planters into the marketplace we had about 5 per cent private ownership, the rest was State ownership.  In Germany, by contrast, 85 per cent of the forests are privately owned, and the average for the Community as a whole is in excess of 50 per cent.  It is a very good idea to encourage private entrepreneurs, individuals, privately owned companies, insurance companies, pension funds, banks or whatever, to get involved in this area. Immediately this happened they found themselves up against what I would call unfair competition from the semi-State body, Coillte Teoranta.  Coillte Teoranta enjoyed a privileged position in that their staff were already very familiar with grant approvals and had the inside information they had gained from experience.  In addition, they were already harvesting so they had a cash flow to work on.  They had already got, as we know, a State asset at a seriously discounted price.  That put them in a very unfair competitive position and suddenly the prices people were paying for land for planting shot through the roof, putting many of the private planters out of business or deterring them from doing any more planting.  In general, I am in favour of competition but we should forget one that the State itself is probably the greatest culprit in the marketplace as far as abusing a monopoly situation is concerned.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to concern about below cost selling and I share that concern.  I am glad to hear the Minister has decided to have a second look at that situation and that he will be prepared to phase in the legislation rather than have it implemented in one fell swoop as far as below cost selling is concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> I would like to protest at the speed with which this Bill is being rushed through.  It is a very important Bill and for that reason it is not right that this House is put in a position that it cannot table amendments since the Dáil will not be sitting after this week.  Senators can conclude from that the matter was brought to a conclusion too quickly.  There has not been adequate consultation with industry about such important legislation.  I believe it would have been preferable if we had waited until the report of the Fair Trade Commission on competition law had been published.  It is also regrettable, as I see in the CII document, that none of the recommendations about the grocery trade by the Fair Trade Commission was taken up and incorporated into the Competition Bill.  I am concerned about the undue haste with which the Bill is being pushed through the legislative process.  It does not allow adequate time in which to assess adequately the implications of the Bill, either for the legislators or for people who will be bearing the brunt of this, namely, industry.</P>
    <P>In regard to enforcement of the provisions, there is an easier way of doing it. Under European law, for instance, if a company feels that another company is abusing a dominant position it can complain to the Commission and the Commission may then undertake an investigation of the complaint.  This is a relatively cost effective way for an enterprise to use the law to protect itself.  Companies in Ireland who are trading internationally already know that.  What we are proposing now for the national situation will not allow for this initial procedure.  The only option a so-called aggrieved person will have is to go to court.  The person cannot complain to the Authority, cannot ask the Authority to carry out such an investigation.  The Competition Authority cannot carry out an investigation on its own initiative. There is no summary procedure for dealing through the courts with complaints of anti-competitive behaviour.  It is unclear why the Bill has not given the Competition Authority power to hear complaints or carry out investigations on its <Col N="1515" /> own initiative.  Such an approach would promote more actively the principles contained in the Bill which I fully support.  It is not clear why there is such a radical departure from European Community practice and the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission report.  I urge the Minister to consider expanding the powers of the Competition Authority for that reason to accommodate a speedy and cost effective administrative system for dealing with anti-competitive behaviour.</P>
    <P>Of course, it will cost money to implement the Bill.  It is imperative for that reason for the business community in particular and for the proper implementation of the compliance procedures of this legislation that resources are made available to the Competition Authority and to the courts to ensure that they can adequately discharge their responsibilities.  Anybody who has experience of dealing with the courts, the delays that occur and so on, will readily appreciate the concerns of industry about these kinds of delays where their business is concerned.  I urge that adequate resources he put in place to ensure that matters are dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed to find that the Competition Bill does not repeal all existing legislation and consolidate the law in one measure.  That would simplify the matter and help us all to understand what is going on, not to have to cross-reference from one Act to another.</P>
    <P>The Bill is likely to create some uncertainty for business given that the concepts are expressed in broad principles, leaving interpretation to the courts and we all know how courts can differ in their interpretation of legislation.  The business people have real reason for concern in that respect.  There are no definitions and licences and certificates are open to attack in any event in the High Court.</P>
    <P>Agreements and practices which predate the Bill will have to be looked at, reviewed and held up against the Bill whose provisions are, as yet, vague and imprecise.  The ability of an aggrieved or <Col N="1516" /> so-called aggrieved person or any undertaking to appeal to the courts to question the decision of the Authority in relation to licences and certificates caused increased uncertainty for business particularly given the possibility of the imposition of exemplary damages.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard dealt at length with the term &ldquo;aggrieved person&rdquo; and I agree with him.  It is a very inexact science to work on.  The scope of that definition of &ldquo;aggrieved person&rdquo; should be more precise and it will present many difficulties in the future.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of the Bill that are worth commenting on.  I congratulate the Minister in taking the initiative in this area.  I would have preferred, however, if the Bill had been delayed until we had the report of the Fair Trade Commission.  I would have preferred if this House had been shown a little more respect and the Bill had came to us in a manner in which we could have had time to have our amendments tabled and considered.  I would have preferred, having consulted with industry, if there had been more discussion with industry, not for the sake of delaying the Bill but to allay the genuine concern among industry, and they have every right to be concerned.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out my own particular concern about something Senator Cullen also mentioned, that is, the growing power of the multiples.  They are now in a very powerful situation to put excessive leverage on the suppliers.  They get small suppliers totally locked into dependence on them.  They can then force prices down until the supplier is virtually out of business.  They can extend the credit time they were getting free of charge so that the consumer is paying on the nail going through the check-out while the supplier is paid three, four or five months later.  There are abuses there.</P>
    <P>If we want to think of one specific example we had the milk dispute recently in which the bottlers I thought, behaved particularly stupidly when, for once in his life, Ben Dunne was trying to be generous.  What happened was that with <Col N="1517" /> their dominant position in the marketplace and so few of them in it, they were able to force the bottlers to give them a 35 per cent discount over what they would give the milk man who gets up at 5 a.m. and starts delivering milk to the door.  Just think about it.  In addition to that, the bottlers had to pay &ldquo;hello money&rdquo; a big sum to get inside the door to supply the product to Ben Dunne's and the other multiples and load the cold cabinets for them.  The consumer then unloaded it, paid for it on the way out and Ben Dunne and the other multiples paid for the milk several months later. That is, in my view, abuse of their power in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>Of course, the bottlers handled it very badly, they should have stood together against this kind of extortion but to try to resolve the problem by forcing Ben Dunne to continue making an excessive profit on the milk was equally stupid. There are many cases out there to be looked at, particularly where so much of the trade is now going through so few hands because this represents a real danger to the producers and, in the longer term, to the consumers.</P>

      <P>There is general welcome for this legislation.  I would like to thank the Minister for putting this important Bill before the Seanad today.  However, like my colleagues, Senator Howard and Senator Raftery, I am concerned that this House has been asked to pass this legislation with such haste.  I have been a member of the Seanad since 1977 and I believe it is wrong that we are not even given the chance to put down an amendment that may be accepted after discussion. I am a firm believer that when Bills have gone through the Seanad having been fully debated and amended we got better legislation.  I see this Bill as important as the Companies Bill with the same effects for the nation.  That is another reason we should have been given enough time to fully debate this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill prohibits all anti-competitive arrangements and the abuse of dominant positions in the marketplace.  This has <Col N="1518" /> been said by some of my colleagues already this morning.  David Kingston, chief executive of Irish Life, said the other day that any competition should worry you or you are not doing your job properly.  With the greatest respect to David Kingston, he is right.  Nobody knows what competition is better than elected representatives.  Those of us who intend to stay here for another term, and those who have survived, know all about competition.  It is nice to read his quotation but we are well aware of what competition is.</P>
    <P>We are here to pass legislation that will benefit our people.  I would like to have seen more consultation with interested parties before this legislation went to the Dáil.  I may be incorrect in saying that there was not sufficient discussion with people directly interested to see that this Competition Bill was properly put in place, but I am sure the Minister had consultation with various bodies and groups, such as CII and other industrial units, but that is not what we have been told.  I am sure the Minister will defend himself in his reply and tell us at length how much consultation he had with the people who are now saying there was not enough discussion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the substantive amendments made in the Dáil.  I understand that on Committee Stage the Minister, put in place the retention, for the time being, of the groceries order and on Report Stage he permitted some cases to be brought to the Circuit Court where appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have taken more note of what is done in Europe in the area of competition law rather than in America.  Sections 4 and 5, I understand, follow Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome and section 6 is a mirrored version of US legislation.</P>
    <P>Who will this Bill affect?  It will affect every individual.  It will affect companies equally in the private and public sectors. I understand my good friends and supporters, the local authorities, are not covered by this Bill.  I would like the Minister to tell me if that is to their benefit or loss.  I am horrified when I see <Col N="1519" /> Ministers excluding local authorities from legislation.  This legislation applies to banks, building societies, publicans, chemists, shops, supermarkets, lawyers, architects and all professionals.  Here we have lawyers whole heartedly approving this legislation.  I am worried when I see solicitors and lawyers totally supporting a Bill.  There is no better man than the Minister for Industry and Commerce to be worried about things.  When I see lawyers and the legal profession in total support of this Bill, that is a good reason for me to take a harder look at it.</P>
    <P>I worry deeply about the role of the banks, I ask the Minister and the Government to take them head-on.  For some weeks we have been asking for a discussion in this House on the role of the banks.  The banks do not seem to have to account to anybody.  As one of my colleagues said this morning, they are even less civil to us than they were years ago.  There was a time, whether you had a bank draft or a few quid in the bank, the bank official was civil to you.  Now we have managers and their hierarchy above them and whether you have money in the bank or owe them money, they are not civil any more.  The banks will have to be taken on.  Small firms need money to create jobs.  We see the extraordinary profits the banks make at the end of the year.  There is no better man than the Minister to take somebody on if he decides to do so and I appeal to him to take them on.  They have a dominant position.</P>
    <P>I am very happy to support the Bill which deals with competition and protecting the small trader but let us also look at the people who are dominant in the marketplace.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Bill, who stands to benefit from this legislation prohibiting anti-competitive activities?  The whole economy stands to benefit. Increasing competition promotes growth and productivity and the downstream effects of a competitive environment are positive.  Senator Cullen said the benefits from this legislation should have been highlighted and I am quite sure that in his reply the Minister will quite clearly specify for us the benefits of this legislation.</P>
      <P>I understand that a section of the Bill may impose costs on business.  We must be careful not to do so.  We cannot be seen to put more tax on any size of business.  It is stated in the Bill that any failure to notify the Competition Authority exposes the enterprise to liability for damage and agreements may be prohibited. In the absence of special guidelines, undertakings will require costly legal advice which will impose extra costs on industry.  I worry about imposing extra costs on industry particularly in this time of high unemployment.  Job creation should be our main concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The view is held that this Bill will introduce another layer of bureaucracy.  I thought this was a most open Bill.  I rarely compliment anyone and the Minister knows that but his address was clear and I understood it.  The sections of the Bill are quite clear, as are the intentions of the Minister in the context of this legislation. However, that charge of another layer of bureaucracy has been made.  I do not think, any Government should put extra <Col N="1521" /> costs on industry and I understand that the Bill is seen to impose new costs on industry.  I do not want any extra costs imposed.  We must protect the small business person.</P>
    <P>In Senator Raftery's closing address he referred to the big boys grabbing everything at the end of the day and said that while they had competition from small traders they would keep their prices down but once they got rid of the competition they would have it all to themselves.  I am a long time in public life and as a family we have served in public life for a very considerable time.  I would not like to see small firms disappear.  Small industries, businesses and hotels were able to survive up to now and compete with their larger competitors and I am quite confident that the Minister will see to it that that remains the case.  I realise that a person will shop in a big supermarket because of the prices but we must be careful to protect the small family grocer.  They are not pricing themselves out of the marketplace. As legislators, we must be careful not to end up with a nation of big groups in all areas.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that any person who is aggrieved in consequences of any agreement etc. has a right of action in the High Court or Circuit Court.  The phraseology is too broadly drafted.  It would be preferable if injured parties had a right to action.  It was mentioned that the Bill may be one sided.  Uncertainties would be reduced for business and those with legitimate interests could sue.  Competition law would not be used by some companies as a means of evading contractual obligations by alleging that the contract was anti-competitive.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the provisions in section 6.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that any person or undertaking aggrieved by a licence or a certificate of the Authority may appear to the High Court against a decision of the Competition Authority.  However, there is no provision in the Bill to permit a company to appeal to the High Court against a decision of the Competition Authority.  This is how I read it.  It seems extraordinary that a company is not <Col N="1522" /> allowed appeal against a decision of the Authority when other parties are.  It is of vital importance that this imbalance is put right.  A company's right to appeal against a decision of the Authority is based on the constitutional right to fairness. The Competition Authority can make mistakes.  Senator Howard went so far as to ask if it was because the Competition Authority would never make a mistake.  Other bodies allow both sides to appeal.</P>
    <P>We must be careful that competition policy and Government industrial policy do not clash.  The Minister said that they did not clash but in this Bill competition policy and Government industrial policy come very close to each other.  We must be always careful not to do anything that would hinder the development of Irish business, job creation and so on.</P>
    <P>A new Authority will be established to replace the Fair Trade Commission.  This Authority will have three members for the moment but the number can be increased to five.  It will have power to grant licences to an undertaking engaged in activities which would otherwise be prohibited. They will only be granted if the benefits outweigh the cost and if the consumer stands to benefit.  The Authority can also decide whether a particular agreement does or does not offend against section 4 of the Bill.  Perhaps in his reply the Minister might elaborate on the composition of the Authority.  It is important, as Senator Cullen said, that this be given support now.  It is important, therefore, that the composition of the Authority be correct from day one.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the taking of private action in the Circuit Court or High Court.  Action can also be taken by an individual, group or organisation.  This puts power directly in the hands of those who are affected and they will not have to wait for the State to take the case for them.  It also allows not only for relief but also for damages, including exemplary damages.  Giving such a power to the State would have been costly and against the fundamental principles of this Bill which recognises the economic rights of <Col N="1523" /> individuals.  I thank the Minister and am grateful for that part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I was reading part of the Fair Trade Commission's study on competition law. In their summary and conclusions they stated:</P>
    <P>It has been decided to recommend that the national importance of competition in ensuring lower prices, the optimum allocation of resources, better consumer choice and a national economic growth, should be recognised in legislation. this recognition involves a prohibition on persons or enterprises from engaging in anti-competitive conduct.  It is recommended, therefore, that a law be introduced to prohibit anti-competitive conduct.</P>
    <P>It is believed that all decisions of the commission on competition issues should be appealable to the High Court including any decisions to impose fines. This feature and the laying down of strict procedures should provide adequate safeguards to balance the new powers which would be conferred upon the Commission.</P>
    <P>It has been decided to recommend that the introduction of a prohibition system should be brought about by a new Competition Act which would incorporate the new prohibitions, most of the features of 1972-89 Acts and the 1978 Act.  There would, then, be contained in one Act all of these measures dealing with competition.</P>
    <P>The Commission's responsibility in ensuring competition markets should include those of examining and commenting on proposals for all new legislation and for new regulations from a competition viewpoint.  In addition, the Commission should endeavour to publicise the benefits of competition.</P>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister has tried to do.  Legislation now is nearly always European led.  I welcome the Minister's attitude and the fact that he does not always wait for directives from Europe to initiate legislation.  However, the legislation must benefit everyone and would <Col N="1524" /> only be part of a Government that would be seen to protect the small traders and the big chief.</P>
    <P>In his address to the House this morning the Minister said the Fair Trade Commission will be replaced by the new Competition Authority.  Section 11 allows the Authority to carry out studies at the Minister's request.  Section 12 requires the Authority to report to the Minister for Industry and Commerce each year and requires that he publishes the reports.  I welcome that.  The Minister also said there was no reason to clutter our primary legislation with this type of detail.  The only way it could be changed if it proved unsuitable would be through primary legislation.  I am confident that the new Authority will carry out its task with efficiency and speed and will have regard to the needs of the business community. It should also be noted that the procedures of the Authority can be regulated, if necessary, by the Minister under section 23 which also requires that these regulations be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  I thank the Minister for that.  It should be remembered if there are still worries and reservations about it that an annual report will be published.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation and thank the Government for it.  It was a long time in coming.  In my address I voiced worries and concerns I have about different parts of it and I am quite sure the Minister will alleviate them.  We should never allow the big chiefs in business, whether in industry or trade, take over the business community.  I appeal to the Minister to look at the banks.  I never had finance but bank officials were both civil and uncivil to me.  The people are worried about job creation.  We see the massive profits the banks make, yet they charge enormous interest rates if a person wants to borrow even a few pounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are familiar with the adage competition is the life of trade. This concept has been around for a long time but never has its significance been more underscored than at present.  Competition will be central to the new trading environment being moulded by the Single <Col N="1525" /> Market.  The deadline of 1992 has caught the imagination of the citizens of Europe and is widely seen as a milestone in the process of European integration and closer union among the peoples of member states.</P>
      <P>A growing economy has to focus sharply on the stimulus of competition in order to ensure the efficient allocation of resources and avoid the stagnating effects of under-performance.  A well structured competitive economy is a long term solution to chronic unemployment.  Competition challenges effectively the position of dominant market players and monopolies that can abuse their position and, through restrictive practice, undermine successful companies.  For that reason, I welcome the adoption of the EC Treaty rules on competition as the basis of competition law in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House will fundamentally change and significantly improve competition law in Ireland by giving effect in domestic law to provisions similar to Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty.  As chairman of the Legal Affairs Subcommittee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities I am familiar with the effects of the competition rules in inter-Community trade.  The evidence is that those sectors of the economy exposed to competition are the most dynamic and indeed, make a real contribution to economic growth.  The discipline of the EC competition rules are now to be applied to all sectors and I am confident that they too will gear themselves to making a sustainable contribution to economic growth.</P>
      <P>There is no longer any justifiable economic argument to shield domestic activity from competition.  While the Competition Bill presents a real challenge to all market operators, whether in production or distribution, the only ones to fear it are the inefficient and those who would conspire to force the consumer into a regime of artifically high prices. We must be ever vigilant about Adam Smith's admonition about conspiracies against the public and contrivances to raise prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1526" /> Under a monopoly, price is higher and output is lower than in a competitive market.  This leads to the inefficient allocation of resources and under this heading we must have particular regard to human resources.  It can also be argued that monopoly tends to lead to inequity in income distribution.  Innovation also suffers under monopoly and price fixing systems.</P>
    <P>The main beneficial effects of competition were stated in the Fourteenth Report on Competition Policy as follows:</P>
    <P>When it operates satisfactorily, competition can be expected to perform three functions that help towards a harmonious development of economic activity throughout the community; a resource allocation function by encouraging better use of available factors of production, so that firms' technical efficiency is increased and consumers' wants better satisfied; an incentive function by stimulating firms to better their performance relative to their competitors and an innovative function by encouraging the introduction of new products in markets and the development of new production processes and distribution techniques.</P>
    <P>It is claimed that, in addition to lower prices competition leads to wider choice, better service, faster economic growth and the elimination of inefficient firms.</P>
    <P>The case for a balanced competition policy has been made but I would like to sound a note of warning.  The Bill has a potential for litigation.  I would not like to see the benefits of a Single Market under the stimulus of competition being eroded by litigation.  The Bill offers a challenge to the legal profession so that they can advise the clients on how best to avoid costly and time consuming litigation.</P>
    <P>The Bill when it becomes law will be a success if it is made known to the public but also if it is perceived as being administered in an open, fair and yet rigorous manner.  If this is the case from the beginning it will create a healthy respect for this law, together with a mentality in the <Col N="1527" /> business community which recognises the moral and legal obligation to comply with the law and also the realisation that it is normally in the interest of a well-run company to compete as best it can rather than to rely on restrictive arrangements. I welcome the Bill and the Minister who has presented it here this morning and hope it will have a speedy passage through this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Senators who have spoken and for their welcome for the Bill.  I will try to deal with the points raised in broad terms at least.  Many detailed questions were asked and it would be more appropriate perhaps to deal with them on Committee Stage which I understand will be next week.</P>
      <P>Many of the points raised are a repetition of what was said in the Dáil, one of them being a complaint or an accusation of lack of consultation.  Obviously with a Bill of this nature one does not consult large numbers of people about it before publication because that would not be appropriate.</P>
      <P>The Fair Trade Commission were asked to study the matter and to make their recommendations which they did in some depth and they invited and received full submissions from a large number of organisations.  It was known that the Bill was under preparation and its general nature was known from a considerable number of speeches I made.  People were free to comment and to express the view that a Bill of some other kind might be brought forward.  Most comments made over the last year and a half were complaints not about the proposed content of the Bill but about the delay in bringing it forward.  The delay was caused by the necessity to balance some of the delicate and conflicting views and interests which inevitably have to form part of legislation of this kind especially when we have not had anything on these lines before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Bill was published on 12 April last, almost three months ago to the day, <Col N="1528" /> we have had a large number of consultations with all interested parties. Compared with some Bills it did not provoke any rush of observations because I think the majority of people are happy and satisfied with it as were Members of the Dáil and I think the majority in this House are also happy with it.</P>
    <P>Consultations were held either by me personally or by officials of my Department on 3 May with the Food, Drink and Tobacco Federation and with the CII; on 6 May with ICTU; on 13 May with RGDATA; on 14 May with the Newspaper Retailers' Association; on 22 May with the Law Society; on 28 May with the ESB and also with the CII and early in June with the Licensed Vintners' Association. I attended and addressed four seminars on the topic which were organised since the Bill was published.  On 11 May I addressed the Irish Centre for European Law at Trinity College; on 16 May the Irish Centre for Commercial Law Studies at UCD; on 6 June an Irish business seminar at Jury's Hotel, Dublin; and on 18 June the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, Dublin.  As well as expressing my views at those various seminars I or my officials had the opportunity of hearing the views of many European and Irish experts on competition law and we received a useful input of differing views.</P>
    <P>The remarkable thing is that for a Bill of such importance relatively few views were put forward which can only be because people in general are quite satisfied with it and are happy that something that has worked well in the European context over a period of 30 years is likely to work in the Irish context.  If anything, we have been somewhat remiss in not initiating something of this kind before. I attempted when in Opposition to introduce a Private Members' Bill on the lines of this Bill in the Dáil in 1987 but it was defeated then which was a pity. However, it gave us the opportunity to think more fully about what was involved and to avail of the opportunity to polish and hane the different concepts and to consider how they might be applied.</P>
    <P>The principal specific concern relates to the grocery order and I dealt with <Col N="1529" /> that this morning.  I have no intention of repealing it until I have the views of the Fair Trade Commission and have had a full opportunity to consider them to see where the balance of public interest lies in the matter.  In connection with, for example, the supermarket trade or the grocery trade Senator Cullen asked whether the Minister would look at past situations.  I think he instanced the supermarket question and asked whether the size of companies could be reduced.  If there is abuse of a dominant position an investigation can be carried out under section 14 and this could lead to an order being made by the Minister which would require either the prohibition of the continuance of the dominant position or, more likely, require the adjustment of the dominant position, if necessary by a sale of assets.  In other words, those whose trading activity constitutes, or is found after an inquiry to constitute, an abuse of dominant position could be required here as they are in other countries to dispose of part of their assets in that business compulsorily if they want to continue in it and so would no longer be in a dominant position.</P>
    <P>The inquiry was made whether the Authority will have sufficient resources. The position there is that the secretariat which is currently available to the Fair Trade Commission will be augmented in numbers and in expertise and that will then form the expanded secretariat for the new Authority.  I am satisfied in so far as one can be in these days of unremitting pressure to reduce public service numbers that it will be adequate.  I hope we will not have a repetition with this body of the annual complaints about inadequate numbers made regarding at least one other body.  If my Department or sections within my Department were allowed by law to produce annual reports of their own activities, top of the agenda for many of them with every justification would be lack of numbers.  Some of these external organisations have the right to say whatever they want in public and they tend, as is the wont of human nature, to latch on to the perceived shortage of officials. <Col N="1530" /> I hope that will not arise here and I recognise that the need for extensive secretarial and expert back-up will be greatest in the early years and that numbers could be allowed to decline somewhat after that because pressure will be greatest when initial applications for exemption and negative clearance come in.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard questioned the adequacy of the Judiciary to deal with these matters which are essentially European rather than Irish in character.  I feel confident in assuring him that the Judiciary will not have any great difficulty. They already deal with Articles 85 and 86 as far as Community-wide activities are concerned and I do not think they will have any problem applying those principles to the domestic situation. It is not all that new to them.  European case law has been a guide to Irish courts in appropriate circumstances since we joined the Community on 1 January 1973.  It is applied to the Irish courts and to Irish law by Statutory Instrument 341 of 1972 which I discover I made on 29 December 1972 applying European case law from the date of our entry.  While many people would not be conscious of it the courts, and particularly the Superior Courts, are certainly conscious of it and decisions are made regularly on that basis.</P>
    <P>I did consider, as Senators will know, having the Circuit Court deal with such matters until such time as a further body of law was built up in Ireland.  As a result of the discussions particularly on Committee Stage in the Dáil I thought it reasonable to bring the Circuit Court into it where actions for abuse of a dominant position are concerned which are fairly straightforward, even though the Circuit Court up to now would not have been dealing with matters of European law.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan asked about the composition of the Authority.  As I said before, I envisage &mdash; although I am not bound by it and could change my mind &mdash; that the existing members of the Fair Trade Commission would constitute the membership of the Competition Authority. The Fair Trade Commission will be <Col N="1531" /> going out of existence on the day the Competition Authority comes into existence and it makes sense to transpose one body into the other rather than have parallel quangos or whatever operating which we cannot afford.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the present membership is appropriate to the duties of the Authority.  The policy role is one for the Minister and the Fair Trade Commission in its report on competition law saw a role for itself akin to that of the European Commission.  Senator Honan quoted a number of the recommendations or conclusions of the Fair Trade Commission in their report on competition law and she will find on a full examination of it that their recommendations were very much in accord with the operation of the system in the European Community.  They envisaged themselves having the same functions as the Commission which is a very complicated system because of the size of the Community and the complexity of intra-Community commercial relations and the original development of a Common Market which has now become a Single Market.  It seemed to me on reading the report of the Fair Trade Commission that their proposal was unnecessarily complicated and that we could have the good features of the European system without the complexity by simplifying it to apply to Irish circumstances and the Bill has been drafted on that basis.</P>
    <P>The Commission have not issued a formal comment or report on the Bill but have informally indicated to me that their own recommendations were somewhat complicated and that the system now proposed in this Bill is perfectly satisfactory. To that extent it is not apposite to quote some of the things they said in the belief that a precise parallel to the European Community situation would be brought in here.  The Senator read one of their recommendations about the power of the Commission and what they saw as their power here to impose fines.  As Senators will know, fines imposed in the Community by the Commission can be very high; fines in excess of 50 million ECUs were imposed recently on two or three <Col N="1532" /> companies which is a very substantial amount of money.  If we were to establish a body here other than the courts and allow them to impose fines that ran into tens of millions of pounds, any such exercise or proposal would be declared unconstitutional.  That was the view of the Attorney General and that was why he agreed with the necessity for a less complicated structure that reflects the principles rather than the exact administrative aspects of the European system.</P>
    <P>Senator B. Ryan felt that anti-trust law has to be worked at and that the model we are using is not necessarily ideal but it is based on the best that is available. The Senator felt that what we were doing was not strong enough and he instanced some of the problems that the authorities in the United States, for example, have run into.  The Bill is not a cure for all our economic ills and it was never suggested that it should be but it is an essential element in enabling this country to remove a significant impediment to economic development.  I have instanced other countries where I feel the level of competition encouraged by law has had an enormously beneficial effect on their economy.</P>
    <P>This morning when introducing the Bill on this Stage, I said that this country was put at a significant disadvantage by the fact that many aspects of business here have had to bear unnecessary additional costs arising from restrictive practices which are endemic in certain parts of business and administration, not least in the provision of services.  It is a little frightening to realise the degree of restrictive practice on the services side, especially as this side is most removed from the ordinary marketplace and from normal rules of competition.</P>
    <P>Those having to adjust to the modern situation are finding it painful.  There is a headline on page 3 of today's <i>Irish Independent</i> where I am the subject of attack.  I want to remind those who are adjusting, however slowly, to the realities of the modern world that what they are now doing and for which they certainly deserve credit is what they said a year or two ago did not need to be done and <Col N="1533" /> would never be done.  Respectfully and rather diffidently I say that they have made a good start but there is still quite a way to go.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will continue to encourage those changes because it is not in our economic interests in whatever field of endeavour we are operating that additional costs be imposed unnecessarily. The joy of the European Community is that if the Irish providers of certain services or goods are not prepared to provide them at a competitive rate others within the Community will have the right under the Community's rules to come here and provide them or to provide them from another member state without establishing here.  When that reality sinks in as the Single Market comes closer it will have a beneficial effect.</P>
    <P>The question of the definition of an &ldquo;aggrieved person&rdquo; and the comparison with that with a person who suffers loss was raised by Senator Howard and a number of other Senators.  It was thought that the phrase &ldquo;aggrieved person&rdquo; is too broad but the contention was made in the Dáil that the phrase &ldquo;aggrieved person&rdquo; was too narrow.  It depends on which way one looks at it.  It is better not to define some of these matters too precisely.  You find in practice that justice is more likely to be done if the court in the last resort has discretion, given all the circumstances of the case, to apply directives in a way that seems to it to do justice to the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>I have had the experience myself in this field of trying for the sake of certainty to lay down precise definitions of things. In the 1978 Act to which I referred at some length this morning which I brought through the Oireachtas.  I sought to define a monopoly in percentage terms and looking back on it after 13 years experience of the working of the Mergers Act of 1978, I was wrong.  There was one obvious monopoly operating in recent years and because its market share was just below 50 per cent legally it was not a monopoly and I could not therefore, do many things I would have wished to do in the public interest.  There were other <Col N="1534" /> problems like that which I think will not arise now.</P>
    <P>Some will say the terms are too vague, but if one goes back to the Treaty of Rome of 1957, there are many phrases not defined in the treaty or in any of the directives or regulations supporting it but which have become accepted concepts in the European Community with widely-known implications.  It is not necessary, and often it is not appropriate, in producing good law to define everything so precisely that you remove from the effect of the legislation those things that require control.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard dwelt at length with the powers of the Authority to summon witnesses and require delivery of papers etc. and he seemed to imply that all these powers are new.  If the Senator looks at the legislation relating to the present Fair Trade Commission he will find that the commission at present has all those powers.  The kind of powers which he instanced and which were set out in the Schedule to this Bill and in other parts of it are the type of powers that apply generally to this type of body.  Decisions by the Authority in respect of these matters are always open to judicial review if there is any question of the abuse of those powers.  The power to raid a premises for papers can only be exercised if a warrant is obtained by authorised officers from a district justice where the district justice is &ldquo;satisfied by information on oath that it is proper for him to issue such a warrant&rdquo;. For that reason it is not going to be issued lightly but will be akin to applying to a district justice for a warrant to search premises where the police suspect some major fraud is being carried out and proof depends on the possession of documents or records that only the company itself would have.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard asked whether time limits will be laid down for the granting of licences or certificates.  I dealt with that this morning.  The Bill itself will not have such time limits but the Authority can lay them down or they can, if necessary, be prescribed by the Minister.  To lay them down in primary legislation would be too inflexible because while many of these <Col N="1535" /> applications can probably be decided in the matter of a week or two there will be some complex ones that will take several months at least to decide and it would be wrong for something to go through because the decision could not be made within a period of two or three months or, alternatively, that an application be refused because the decision could not be made within that period.  It is better to have some flexibility on that.  If it has to be changed from time to time let it be changed by the Authority with the experience gained from the working of the legislation rather than having to come back to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan raised the question under section 9 of whether an undertaking or an aggrieved person may appeal the grant of a licence or a certificate.  The position is that an aggrieved party may appeal against the granting of a licence or certificate but there is no automatic right to appeal against the refusal of a licence or a certificate.  This is deliberately done and I explained the reason at some length in the Dáil.  Where a licence or certificate which is, in effect, an exemption from the normal application of the law is granted, third parties may well be prejudicially affected.  Some probably will be prejudicially affected because someone is being licensed to continue some practice that is inherently anti-competitive and which but for the granting of the licence would be prohibited and unlawful.  When in the opinion of the Authority the public benefit is greater by continuing a practice rather than disallowing it and when people possibly will be detrimentally affected it is only right that they should have a right of appeal to the court.  On the other hand if the Authority refuses one of these applications, then no third party has been put at a disadvantage and the ordinary law prohibiting anti-competitive actions continues in force as far as that trade or business is concerned. Because it is a matter of commercial policy and commercial judgment rather than a matter of law, it seems inappropriate that the applicant for the <Col N="1536" /> exemption, having failed to get it from the Authority, having failed to persuade them that he should be allowed to continue in anti-competitive practice, should then go to the court, which is primarily seized of the power or duty of interpreting the law rather than of deciding on public commercial policy.</P>
    <P>I hope I have covered most of the main points that were raised today.  If there are other points of detail, we will have the opportunity next week, on Committee Stage, to go into them in more detail and I can answer more detailed questions that may arise if Senators wish.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that the importance of this Bill is not in the detailed control or regulation of particular businesses, trades or sectors, but that, hopefully, it will make a fundamental change to the outlook in this country on restrictive practices generally. By bringing in a general prohibition, subject to the right to apply for exemptions, lincences and so on, we will get rid of many things that are of no benefit to our economy and to our country, these are things which add to the costs of doing business and of living here.  They make businesses carried on here less competitive than those in states where there is a more advanced form of competition law and where similar legislation has been in force for perhaps 20, 30 and in the case of the United States even more years.</P>
    <P>From a macro-economic point of view, and not just from a narrow regulatory point of view, this Bill will have a profound effect, even if it takes a few years for its effect to be noticed.  That is why people who realise how business and the regulation of business operates in other countries, and why it operates in that way, have welcomed this Bill and see good coming from it.</P>
    <P>If amendments prove necessary, in practice, in a number of years time, they can be made.  One of the advantages of the way this Bill is drafted is that a number of the detailed changes which might be necessary as a result of the experience of two or three years can be made without coming back to change the primary or fundamental legislation.  They <Col N="1537" /> can be changed by way of regulation made by the Authority.  For that reason I look forward with some confidence to the operation of this Bill.  It will be a major plank in the economic rejuvenation of this country and in bringing about a healthier and more competitive atmosphere in which a greater and more vigorous form of economic activity can be carried on.  This can only be beneficial to all of us, whatever the short term problems may be for some of those who are affected and who find it painful to adjust after many decades, if not centuries, to operating in a slightly protected environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>The creation of a favourable economic climate for industrial development has been a major achievement of the Government since 1987.  We have arrived at a situation in this country where we have a stable currency, low inflation and a positive balance of trade.</P>
      <P>A further economic priority for this Government has been to provide the best possible institutional structures to assist industry to increase production, sales and, very importantly, employment.  If any lesson can be drawn from recent history, it is that the State cannot do everything, but what it does, it must do well. The best guarantee of such efficiency is to create institutions that precisely fill the needs of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to merge Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council was announced by the Minister for Industry <Col N="1538" /> and Commerce in his preface to the Review of Industrial Performance published in December 1990.  Institutional arrangements for industrial policy must be determined by the requirements of the economy and of industry.  This merger is a response to the changing trading environment in which small and medium sized industry now finds itself. The Single Market calls totally into question the distinction we have traditionally made between the Irish market and the markets outside.  Between home sales and export sales, between being an exporter and not being an exporter, the Single Market places every firm in the same boat &mdash; a boat in which the prerequisite for survival is the ability to be internationally competitive.</P>
    <P>Up to now, we could operate a two-tier system.  The home market was one thing, export markets quite something else.  What you needed to succeed on the home market was not necessarily the same as you needed abroad and for many companies who would never graduate to exporting, the need to be internationally competitive did not arise.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, we had two agencies &mdash; one agency serving firms that were developing in the home market &mdash; the Irish Goods Council &mdash; and one agency serving firms that were developing in export markets &mdash; Córas Tráchtála. There is considerable support for functional rationalisation on the part of the &ldquo;clients&rdquo; of the agencies.  Indeed, the agencies themselves &mdash; both their boards of management and staff &mdash; have acknowledged the inherent sense of what is now proposed.  They have fully supported and co-operated with myself and my Department in the merger process.</P>
    <P>Before going into some detail on what the Bill contains I want to set out some of the benefits which will derive from the merger.  First, companies which graduate to exporting will no longer have to start an entirely new relationship with another agency: until now their early development was with the Irish Goods Council, and then when they moved to exporting they had to start all over again with Córas <Col N="1539" /> Tráchtála.  Those Senators who have experience in business will know that the success of company development through agencies depends to a very important extent on the nature of the relationship that is built up on both sides, and that building this relationship is a time consuming process and one that involves personal commitment in both company and agency.  To ask growing companies, whose resources are always stretched, to develop two relationships, where one could serve the need, is placing an unnecessary burden on companies, and one which it is now time to remove.</P>
    <P>The second main reason we need one agency is that we want more companies to make the transition to exporting, and we want them to make it sooner.  Because of the small size of our home market, Irish companies must move to exporting much earlier than companies of the same size would in, say, Britain or France. Companies there have a large familiar home market that they grow quite large in, but if Irish companies are to grow significantly, they must move outside this market at an early stage.  By that I do not necessarily mean that they should export straightaway.  What I mean is that their strategic focus should from the start be on a wider market than Ireland.</P>
    <P>We do not want companies to grow with their sights fixed only on the Irish market, companies who start thinking about the outside world only when they need to look outside for growth.  That approach means that their initial strategies will be moulded exclusively in terms of the Irish market.  This increases the likelihood that they will approach exporting on the basis of trying to sell outside the country what they have done well with here.  That is not the way.  We want companies to be thinking about being internationally competitive from the very start.  If they do so, then what they do in the Irish market will be a suitable basis on which to expand abroad when the time comes.  There will not be any need to develop a new philosophy, a new approach.</P>
    <P>The mechanism being proposed to <Col N="1540" /> effect the merger is as follows.  Section 5 provides that the name of Córas Tráchtála will be changed to An Bord Tráchtála &mdash; The Irish Trade Board.  Section 22 proposes that the new board will come into operation on 1 September 1991.</P>
    <P>Section 6 conveys on the new board functions which combine the current functions of both Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council.  The primary function of the new board will be to promote, assist and develop the marketing of Irish goods and services.  Subsection (1) of this section, in many ways, is the key to the Bill.  Although the drafting of the section follows the pattern of the 1959 Act which established Córas Tráchtála, there is an essential difference.  This essential difference between the functions of the board established under this Bill and the functions given to Córas Tráchtála under the Export Promotion Acts is that, in the case of Córas Tráchtála, the functions were restricted to the exportation of goods and services.  This Bill charges the new board with promoting the marketing of Irish goods and services and this will be done on both the domestic and overseas markets, which will be one market in the post-1992 period.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear to this House that the Bill will not result in any reduction in, or dilution of, the services which the Irish Goods Council has been providing over recent years.  This point was raised in the debate on this Bill in the Dáil and, as I did in that House, I want to stress strongly that this Bill is not about closing down the Irish Goods Council and terminating its programmes.</P>
    <P>The merger of the two organisations provides the opportunity for co-ordinating and enhancing the marketing support measures provided by both organisations to industry throughout the country.  For example, CTT's network of regional offices will provide the new board with a facility for delivering a more regionalised service to firms selling exclusively on the home market.</P>
    <P>A further factor which ensures the continuity of the programmes operated by the Irish Goods Council and, indeed, by <Col N="1541" /> Córas Tráchtála is the support they receive from EC Structural Funds.  All their programmes are being supported in the <i>Programme for Industrial Development 1989-1993</i>, under the Community Support Framework.  Since the commencement of the programme, the existing services of the agencies have been copperfastened and each has, with the assistance of additional funding, been able to expand into new programme areas.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at some length on this issue because I want to leave no doubt about the health of the Irish Goods Council's operations.  While I am still apeaking on section 6, I want to state at this point that a good deal of thought went into seeking a description of what the new board will be about.  We have sought to give the new board a clear mandate, without getting bogged down in lengthy debates about the meanings of particular words.</P>
    <P>For example, I know that Senators will be aware that the word &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; can be defined in a variety of ways by practitioners and academics.  I would like to take a very straightforward stance on this matter.  Marketing in the broadest sense is the link between society's material requirements and its economic pattern of response.</P>
    <P>The task of the new board will be to assist companies in identifying markets, and in the development of their marketing skills to enable them to meet society's material requirements, so far as is possible, with Irish products.  That is what the Government envisage the board will be promoting, assisting and developing.</P>
    <P>If you look at what makes a company excellent, you will find that an excellent company knows how to adapt and respond to a continuously changing marketplace. The excellent company and its employees are committed to creating customers and to satisfying customers.  An Bord Tráchtála will be charged with assisting companies to attain this level of excellence.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 to 15 deal with the dissolution of the Irish Goods Council and <Col N="1542" /> the transfer of its staff, property, rights and liabilities to the new board.  I want to make it clear that there will be no job losses on foot of the merger.  The Government recognise that there is a major job of work to be done in improving the marketing capability of Irish industry and all the staff of the combined agencies have a key role in that work.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill proposes that the aggregate amount of the sums which may be paid to the board for the purpose of enabling it to perform its functions will be increased to £400 million.  The current statutory limit, as set in the Export Promotion (Amendment) Act, 1987, is £260 million and that figure will be reached in late August or early September this year. For this reason it is highly desirable that this Bill be passed in this session.  If we cannot meet this deadline, arrangements will have to be made for Córas Tráchtála to undertake short term borrowings to maintain its operations until the Bill is enacted.  I am quite confident of the full co-operation of this House to ensure that this Bill is passed today.</P>
    <P>I should also add that it is estimated that, based on the spending projections contained in the programme for industrial development, the new limit of £400 million will cover Exchequer funding of the board until the end of 1994.</P>
    <P>I would like to take just a few moments to describe, in general terms, the kinds of services which are supplied with this funding.  Córas Tráchtála operates seven distinct marketing programmes and within each there is a range of related activities.  These can, however, be summarised into three broad categories, first CTT provides detailed market information. Its network of 21 overseas offices provides essential on the ground assistance to exporters.  Its market information centre in Dublin hosts the largest collection of market information in Ireland. Secondly, CTT operates a range of market development activities.  These would include, for example, research activity which would identify potential markets for Irish firms or explore the best market entry strategies for particular sectors.  The organisation of promotional <Col N="1543" /> activities like trade fairs, trade missions and inward buyers missions is also an integral part of its operations.  Finally, CTT provides financial assistance to exporters through a range of schemes.</P>
    <P>Since 1988, CTT has been operating its sales performance incentive scheme which provides modest amounts of financial support for marketing activities on a performance related repayable basis.  A good example of a success story under this scheme is a firm in the West manufacturing car security systems.  In 1989 the company was approved assistance under the sales performance incentive scheme towards the development of the UK market with excellent results. The company has recently become the approved supplier to Mazda in the UK and cumulative sales of £1.7 million in the UK have been achieved since the project commenced.  During 1991 the company was approved for support under the targeted marketing consultancy programme to expand further its market development overseas.</P>
    <P>The targeted marketing consultancy programme is the most significant grant scheme now operated by Córas Tráchtála. The scheme is a direct result of Structural Funds support and makes substantial grants available for major marketing projects.  Although it only commenced last year, this programme has already approved 47 projects which could generate up to £600 million in additional exports.</P>
    <P>For its part the Irish Goods Council provides general marketing advice for very small manufacturers who are totally reliant on the domestic market.  In particular, it advises firms on opportunities in business-to-business sales and in undertaking sectoral marketing initiatives since 1989, the Irish Goods Council has been operating, again as a direct result of Structural Funds support, a programme of assigning marketing consultants to small firms which cannot afford inhouse marketing personnel.</P>
    <P>One typical success story of a firm working with the Irish Goods Council is the case of two tool-makers who set up <Col N="1544" /> their own business in 1980.  They visited a Goods Council organised subcontract opportunities exhibition which featured a wide range of imported pressed steel components.  These exhibitions are designed to show small Irish firms the enormous opportunities that exist for manufacturing and supplying the industrial sector in this country with products which are currently being imported.</P>
    <P>Working closely with the Irish Goods Council staff, the two business people decided to concentrate on component manufacturing rather than tool-making. They have been very successful in converting sub-supply opportunities identified by the Irish Goods Council into new business.  Today some 60 people are employed and the company is Ireland's largest manufacturer of pressed metal parts to the demanding standards of the electronics and allied industry sections.</P>
    <P>This Bill is also being availed of to bring some of the statutory provisions relating to the board in line with other Agencies.  Section 7 provides that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will have power to give the board general policy directives.  Section 10 contains a standard provision covering restrictions on the disclosure of information by staff or advisers to the board.  Section 11 extends the provisions of the 1959 Act, relating to the nomination and/or election of board members and staff to the Houses of the Oireachtas, to cover elections to the European Parliament.  Section 9 increases the number of board members from the present maximum of seven to eight, thus allowing the Minister scope to increase the spread of expertise on the new board to reflect its wider responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I referred at the beginning of my speech to the Government's role in getting the institutional framework for its support for industrial development right. This Bill and the decision which it implements is the latest in a series of significant developments which have taken place since 1987 in the restructuring of State Agencies involved in industrial development and promotion. Among the most notable developments <Col N="1545" /> were: the establishment of FÁS to take over the functions previously undertaken by AnCO, YEA and the National Manpower Service; the merger of the National Board for Science and Technology and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to form EOLAS, a single agency with responsibility for the development, application, co-ordination and promotion of science and technology in Irish industry; and legislation is currently being prepared to provide for the amalgamation of the activities of NADCORP with those of the IDA.</P>
    <P>In relation to the development of science and technology I note that the former Minister for Science and Technology is a Member of this House and I look forward to his contribution on this Bill.</P>
    <P>I know some will say that this is an <i>ad hoc</i> approach to rationalisation of industrial agencies.  I acknowledge that in a perfect world there might be some merit in that view.  However, given the nature of a rapidly changing domestic and international environment and given the new challenges and threats posed by the Single European Market, Senators will agree that it is essential to have the freedom to review and, when necessary, change policy on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>This Bill is just such a response to the changing marketing demands on our firms.  The logic and good sense of merging two agencies providing marketing support to Irish firms is clear quite apart from any general review of industrial policy.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I want to deal with the focus of the new board.  I see it as having four main strands.  First, it will have a clear client group in mind.  Its services will be overwhelmingly provided to and sought by indigenous companies. We are talking here mainly, but nor exclusively, of Irish-owned companies and mainly, but not exclusively, of small and medium-sized companies.  Essentially what we mean by indigenous companies are those firms that have a significant amount of their strategic functions based here in Ireland, companies <Col N="1546" /> that have their marketing centred here, companies that are firmly rooted in the Irish economy.  This includes, I am glad to say, a growing number of foreign owned companies.</P>
    <P>CTT at the moment serves some 1200 exporting companies on a regular basis. The Irish Goods Council has a core client base of some 800 companies, most of whom do not export as yet.  The aim of the new organisation will be to accelerate the sales growth of all these companies, wherever the opportunities present themselves.</P>
    <P>CTT has, and the new organisation will continue to have, trade board functions which include the promotion of Ireland's trade in general.  The new board will continue to have advisory functions to the Department of Industry and Commerce in relation to all trade and marketing matters, but in terms of its development thrust, the concentration will be on indigenous companies, most of which are Irish owned, and most of which are small and medium sized.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the new agency will concentrate initially on one central task: helping Irish industry to take full advantage of the Single Market.  Again, that is not the whole task.  The new organisation will, as before, have a vital role to play in the development of export markets around the world, particularly in such important areas as North America, Japan and Australia.  However, the concentration will be, as it must, on Europe. For those companies who do not export &mdash; to prepare them for competition from within the EC and for those companies who do export, to help them develop markets in what will be the world's biggest trading entity, something in the region of 340 million people.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the new organisation will provide financial support for marketing by firms.  Both CTT and the Irish Goods Council have begun to benefit from major increases in their resources via European Structural Funds.  These resources will be available to the new board to help firms develop their markets, and to help them make whatever changes are needed to <Col N="1547" /> compete effectively in the new international conditions.  They offer Irish companies a once-off opportunity to restructure themselves for the new world we are moving into.  They will be available only to assist those companies who demonstrate that they are in earnest about the achievement of new markets and growth in market share.</P>
    <P>Finally, this agency will be the eyes and ears of many emerging Irish companies in the marketplace, not replacing but supplementing and enriching the company's own presence.  Through this new agency, a company will be able to get initial access to markets across the EC and to the main markets around the world.  One of the great strengths of the organisation will be the combination of the deep knowledge of the marketplace available to CTT and the hands-on development skills of the Irish Goods Council.</P>
    <P>The success of the new agency depends, more than anything else, on the commitment of its management and staff to the challenging task which they face. I take this opportunity to put on the record of this House my appreciation for the work which the staff in both organisations have done over the years and to express my full support for them in their future efforts.  In my two years as Minister of State with responsibility for Trade and Marketing I have been constantly struck by the commitment, skill and energy of the employees of the agencies and I am very confident they will carry these qualities onto the new board to the great benefit of Irish industry.  I am very impressed by all levels of both organisations, the Irish Goods Council and Córas Tráchtála.  I feel that the discussions to date have been very fruitful in relation to both boards of management and both staff organisations.  I am very confident this House will support the decision of the Government to bring the Bill before the House and to create this new board.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no difficulty in agreeing with the proposals of the <Col N="1548" /> Government in relation to the Trade and Marketing Promotion Bill, 1991.  It is a very simple matter of rationalisation and does not require a great deal of time or analysis.  One of these groups, Córas Tráchtála Teoranta was dealing with the promotion of Irish exports whereas the Irish Goods Council had the function of assisting Irish industrial companies on the home market in what might largely be described as import substitution.  In this age, compartmentalisation of what is fundamentally the same service is quite unnecessary.  There has been rationalisation through membership of the EC in relation to tax incentives to manufacturing industry which, when we were our own masters, we were giving to manufacturing companies solely involved in exports.  Under European Community pressure, rationalisation meant that we had to offer the same types of facilities to manufacturing companies at large, whether or not those companies were manufacturing for sales on the export market or the home market.  This is an entirely rational and parallel development in so far as these two bodies are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sales on the home market which the Irish Goods Council have been looking at are not as glamorous sounding as export sales but they are just as crucial because you can see the devastation in the old industrial sector over the past 20 years, especially in the rag trade.  You can see the massive display of foreign goods on the shelves of Irish supermarkets and drapery stores and so on. Obviously Irish companies manufacturing for sale in this are replacing imported goods and effectively, that is import substitution.  It has the same merit to the Irish economy as the export of commodities and if you regard import substitution sales in Ireland as identical to export sales then obviously there is duplication here.  If you are seeking specialisation of support in specific sectors then, obviously, a single board established by the amalgamation of the two bodies can perform this task much more rationally and more cost-effectively as a single unit than as two separate units.  For <Col N="1549" /> all of these reasons this simple Bill is rational, vital and necessary.</P>
    <P>I have had recent personal experience of CTT people and I am full of admiration for the work they have been doing and are continuing to do.  They have a fairly lonely life abroad.  Sometimes a CTT executive is the only Irish executive working in an office abroad.  He has a multi-faceted function and, in my experience, has been excellent.  I have had recent personal contacts with CTT executives in Tokyo, Stockholm and Copenhagen. In two of these instances because of pressure of events I was going through at weekends and these people were prepared to come to meet me at my hotel, in two cases out of three on a Sunday, and got many things moving on a Monday morning.  They were certainly acting beyond the bounds of duty and they are doing a very good job.</P>
    <P>Their service is crucial as well for another reason.  If one reflects not just on the success of Irish industrial development but on the failures as well, and this is an appropriate time to look at them, the single area for greatest disquiet in the entire history of Irish industrial development since the State was founded has been the huge extent to which successful industry in Ireland is foreign-owned and the very minimal extent to which industry operating here is Irish-owned.  This leads to major grounds for disquiet.  As the Minister pointed out, if you look at the major industrial developments by many of the multinationals, in a number of cases these companies are merely fabricating and manufacturing in this country and the core of the marketing thrust is in the corporate headquarters.  If there is a pinch in their internal corporate economy, in the world economy or in the European economy, they tend to lessen the level of activity in some of the foreign countries of which this would be one and to do more and more from their own base.</P>
    <P>We have a level of exports of Irish manufactured goods and it is a little annoying when, from time to time, CTT claim credit for that level of exports because a huge proportion of it would <Col N="1550" /> be going out through the multinational companies.  They have huge inhouse marketing strengths and, in many cases, they do not use the facilities of CTT to a fraction of the extent as would a smaller Irish company.  If the State is to develop, more fruitfully, a strong indigenous Irish-owned industrial base, an integral part of that plan has to be an input by CTT.  The industrial revolution bypassed us.  We have limited skills in this particular sector and strong support by an organisation such as this is of vital importance.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister in his speech said this specific rationalisation, which is happening against the background of the speech by the Minister last December in the context of the review of industrial performance, is merely a part of an overall rationalisation in the sector.  He referred to three or four other linkages such as the amalgamation of the National Board for Science and Technology and the other science organisation in Eolas, which seemed rational.  He referred to the merging of NADCORP into the IDA.</P>
    <P>If I might digress for a minute I will mention there is an anomaly creeping in here which the Minister should address. NADCORP was established as an Irish State owned company in the venture capital sector to take equity in companies rather than give free grants.  While it might superficially seem a good idea to amalgamate NADCORP with the IDA so that the IDA perform both functions, the functions are entirely dissimilar and they must be viewed as organisations wearing different hats.</P>
    <P>There is one obvious administrative anomaly &mdash; the IDA are only responsible for industrial development in the areas of the State outside of the Gaeltacht.  The Minister is proposing that the Industrial Development Authority will be in a position to grant aid to those involved in industrial development outside the Gaeltacht areas and NADCORP will take equity in industrial projects.  However, in the Gaeltacht areas, there is only Údarás na Gaeltachta, a grant aiding body with an extremely limited budget.  If NADCORP is only allowed to operate within <Col N="1551" /> the areas given to the IDA, it means that while, theoretically, the State has this philosophical commitment to strong development and support in Gaeltacht areas, it is likely that companies in the Gaeltacht areas will not have access to the benefits of State venture capital investment which will be available elsewhere. This is an anomaly which the Minister should address.</P>
    <P>Industrial development has been only relatively successful.  Rationalisation in the industrial sector in the last 30 years has seen the decimation of Irish owned companies, expecially in the rag trade, where there has been a massive development of foreign owned companies.  We have to ask ourselves, in the most critical sense, if the Minister is assessing Irish industrial performance at present.  It is not good enough to look at Irish standards and compare them with past standards or other statistics.  In my experience a serious analysis of what is happening in this country can only be a most critical analysis of what is happening here in comparison with countries in the developed world.</P>
    <P>Look at what is happening here at present.  We have a catastrophic level of unemployment and a massive dominance of foreign owned industry whereas the economies of parts of western Europe, specifically the northern European countries of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark, are very successful.  Finland, for example, was decimated in the Second World War.  They fought both the Germans and the Russians yet, against that climate they built up their economy and have virtually full employment.  Why is there virtually full employment in a country like that, which started from a nil base in 1945 and a catastrophic level of unemployment here?  Why in terms of ownership of industry have we been hugely unsuccessful in not building an indigenous base?  Looking at the issue critically we can see that in countries such as Finland they developed a very strong indigenous Finnish-owned base with the development of technical institutions a generation before we did and, if we had <Col N="1552" /> the will, we could have done it as well. They have built in restrictive legislation which prohibits the ownership of a majority investment in industry in their countries.  They will only allow foreign investment if it takes the shape of minority investment.  We should aspire to what they have achieved.  What we have today in the context of ownership of industry is the lesser of two evils.  You have to grab investment when you can get it but when you see what other countries, from a weaker base, have achieved, there is scope for a very critical analysis.  This is our single greatest weakness.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in the context of his review of industrial performance, commission a study on comparative analyses between the lack of achievements in this country and the huge success elsewhere.  He will know from reading OECD reports that some of them have been extremely critical of the relative failure that has obtained in this country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because I see at the heart of it the development of an indigenous structure.  I know CTT have done this in the past as have the Irish Goods Council.  I congratulate them on their success in the past and wish them well for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and his officials on this Bill.  It is timely and appropriate to the present economic circumstances.  There is no doubt that the old system served us well in the economic climate that prevailed at the time.  The two-tiered system worked quite well during those years.  Córas Tráchtála played away games and the Irish Goods Council played at home. However, we are now dealing in a totally different environment with the imminent arrival of the Single Market.  For that reason it is vital that we have one agency marketing Irish goods on behalf of Irish companies, be it at home or abroad. Competition will be severe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the Competition Bill before the House earlier today.  This will add to the competitiveness of Irish companies particularly those who have been dealing <Col N="1553" /> solely on the domestic market.  Those who have been dealing on the European market have been subject to Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome and are well used to performing in an open, competitive climate whereas those performing at home have not been subjected to those rigours.  It is timely that we should have one agency to market our industry and our goods at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>The policy of rationalisation and amalgamation that has been in operation since 1987 &mdash; it was not purely for fiscal reasons &mdash; was for the purpose of unity.  I was personally involved in the amalgamation of the National Board of Science and Technology with the IIRS to form the new State agency, Eolas, to take charge of science and technology interests for the Government.  It worked well and I believe this will work well too.  There will obviously be teething problems in any process of rationalisation where two distinct bodies have been operating, even though they might have been operating with the same principles but in different areas.  There will be some degree of cultural shock, personnel differences, but in my experience, they are temporary disarrangements that can be ovecome.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton adverted to the absorption of NADCORP into the IDA but that is not relevant to what we are discussing here.  Of course, NADCORP has been one of the great tragedies.  It was a socialistic, unrealistic, uneconomical dream in that dark period of Irish Government history from 1982-1987 when the tail wagged the dog and the Labour Party decided that NADCORP was going to be a great institution, would bring equity into Irish companies and would make them bigger and better but it failed.  It is obvious that the IDA will swallow up NADCORP and that that will be the end of the socialist dream.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council have been extraordinarily successful in their separate roles over the last number of years.  I need not remind the House that Córas Tráchtála was established by the late Seán Lemass at a time when political policy initiatives were <Col N="1554" /> considered totally unpropitious.  Then, as now, the economic commentators cried that all policy objectives should be sacrificed for the instant achievement of financial stability.  Economic development would have to be treated as a secondary priority by Government.  Then, as now, the economists got it wrong.  Under the leadership of the late Séan Lemass, even periods of financial stringency witnessed continuing departmental and governmental initiatives to encourage investment and employment.  Córas Tráchtála Teoranta was established by Seán Lemass when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1951.  His objective was to use the new agency to encourage Irish export sales to the United States of America.</P>
    <P>The establishment of CTT at that time had its critics.  These were the same people who had derided Seán Lemass's other initiatives &mdash; the establishment of Shannon Airport, Bord na Móna, Irish Life, ICC, Aer Lingus and Bord Fáilte. Dare I say it, the spiritual descendants of those same critics who derided Seán Lemass are now more numerous than ever.  To quote the Latin phrase &ldquo;<i>Si Monumentem Requiris Circumspice</i>&rdquo;&mdash; if you seek for a monument, gaze around.  The legacy of Seán Lemass is very evident in the commercial life of the Ireland of 1991. The legislation before us like the partial privatisation of Irish Life last week, will help to ensure that the Lemass inheritence grows and endures to the benefit of new generations in the increasingly competitive trading environment which will come about through the Single European Market.</P>
    <P>To move from the general to the particular, I would like to cite one example of the success of CTT, and some of the successes of the Irish Goods Council.  If I tend to be slightly parochial please do not feel aggrieved because it is relevant to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. McKenna) Acting Chairman (Mr. McKenna)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. McKenna)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would never feel aggrieved by anything the Senator says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>This concerns the <Col N="1555" /> extraordinary overseas development of the services offered by CTT to M.F. Kent and Company based in Clonmel, County Tipperary, employing 4,500 people worldwide and operating in 17 different countries.  I will quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 7 December 1990 and for once, what is written in the papers is absolutely correct.  I tend to be cynical about what I read but I can confirm that what they wrote in that issue is correct. It states that the M.F. Kent Company had won a major contract to build a multimillion pound hotel leisure complex in Barcelona for the 1992 Olympics.  The contract is worth £17.5 million to the company and it was CTT who played a major role in the organisation of this contract.  CTT were actively involved in negotiating a giant venture between the Kent company and a local electrical engineering concern, Cobra Group.  A hotel complex is being built for an American development company, Travelstate, and will be operated by the Ritz-Carlton group.</P>
      <P>That is an example of what CTT achieved for an Irish company operating internationally.  If I tend to be parochial it is because I have deep affinity with my own county of south Tipperary.  I also have great respect for north Tipperary, particularly at times like last Sunday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Goods Council played an active role in the development of a number of food companies in the south Tippeary region, including the participation at trade exhibitions of Dawn Fresh Foods; in in-store promotions and Roadshow '91 for Avonmore and Compsey; the provision of specific marketing and distribution advice coupled with the introduction to the trade of Nujuice and the launch of a new cheese range for Tipperary Co-op.  In the clothing area the Irish Goods Council has worked with retailers, J. Clinton and Company, La Femme, Sheils and Showcase in Clonmel, Kingstons and Mister Mister in Tipperary and Twiba in Carrick-on-Suir during 1990 as part of the continuing &ldquo;Look to our own Campaign&rdquo;. There were also a number of <Col N="1556" /> other retailers in Carrick-on-Suir, Clonmel and Tipperary town who took part in a national Christmas gifts campaign. The Irish Goods Council staff have developed and maintained close contact with purchasing staff in many companies in the south Tipperary region.  It is appropriate that the Irish Goods Council should have close affinity with Tipperary since their former chief executive, Vivian Murray, was from Clonmel and they have maintained that contact.</P>
    <P>In 1990 new sub-supply business of almost £750,000 was placed by firms in the region with other Irish manufacturers. Very recently a consultancy assignment with a company in the region was completed successfully.  The company concerned in south Tipperary were very pleased with the work.  A number of commercially sensitive issues are in the process of resolution before the benefits of the work come to fruition.  When implemented, the plan should have a turnover in the region of £500,000.</P>
    <P>The two organisations should be complimented on their achievements, they have served this country well, and their personnel deserve to be congratulated. The amalgamation of those two bodies will result in a single focus on marketing Ireland abroad.  An Bord Tráchtála will be the name of the new agency.  I urge their board and staff to always keep before them the dictum of Seán Lemass that patriotism has no higher or more urgent aim to serve than to ensure that the country will be able to keep its people.  That was an excerpt from the <i>Sunday Press</i> interview in January 1957. I am sure the new agency will play its part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with some reluctance that I follow the very stimulating contributions of Senator Staunton and Senator McCarthy and, indeed, the Minister's presentation has also been very worthwhile.  I support the Bill, as Senator Staunton has already indicated.  Its purpose is to amalgamate Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council.  I wish to pay tribute to the work done by both <Col N="1557" /> bodies and, in particular, to Córas Tráchtála who dealt with the overseas export market.  Over the 40 years or so of their existence that body developed an expertise that was put to good use on behalf of many manufacturing companies involved in export.  I understand &mdash; indeed the Minister has confirmed these figures &mdash; Córas Tráchtála have been serving something like 1,200 companies.  They have achieved commendable success and much of that success in the early years was in North America.  I have reason to be conscious of that success in relation to certain products which are very much of an Irish character and of excellent quality.</P>
      <P>Tributes were paid in the Dáil to another organisation involved in the export field some time ago, An Bord Bainne, and I would like to add to those tributes.  During the 1960s and 1970s they showed what aggressive marketing and product development could achieve for the food industry here.  It is relevant at this stage to cast our minds back to that body and encourage the people who will be part of this new body to consider what was achieved in the marketing, development and export of Irish dairy products in that period.  It is relevant that today the producers of the raw materials used in those products are protesting outside the House about the constraints being put on their production and the perceived tax on their income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1967 and 1968 Bord Bainne were calling on the milk producers to expand production because of the pressure to meet forward marketing commitments. It was an era of new products and diversification into new milk products was the order of the day.  It is surprising when we look back to note that new technology in relation to many of those new products was being tried out in Ireland for the first time.  In 1967 I attended a dairy conference in Munich.  There was a machine on display there &mdash; that is the best term I can think of at the moment &mdash; experimenting on the production of long life cream produced by a company in Denmark.  We inquired if it was the only machine or prototype in action and <Col N="1558" /> we were told there was another, and that it was in Killeshandra.  That is an example of what initiative and enterprise could achieve.  Long life cream became a well-known product and we were leaders in the market in the early days.  New cheeses came on the market, casein, chocolate crumb and a number of other dairy products. Much credit is due to the calibre of the men who were in charge of the board at that time, people like Tony O'Reilly and Joe McGough.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, Bord Bainne being a State-sponsored body was obliged under the rules of the EC to change and become a co-operative and because of that certain constraints were placed on their capacity to export.  Of course, that was not the only difficulty.  This, again, is a feature that is unique to Ireland and to the character of the Irish people.  They found they had to compete and were at a disadvantage because of the action of cooperatives back home undermining and undercutting their prices and what was a pioneering and enterprising spirit died at a cost to the farming community and resulted in job losses in the industry. Intervention became the safety valve and the dumping ground for dairy products. What was a once proud industry and leader in marketing and product development was reduced to the status of beggar at the European table.  However, something was proved in that period about the capacity of this country where food production and development were concerned. I am sure the base is still there if the motivation can be recovered to achieve and emulate what was done during that period.</P>
    <P>I recommend to the new board to recall that remarkable era of success.  Many, people comment on the unique capacity of Ireland to produce quality food particularly in a green environment, yet, we seem to be hopelessly inept at harvesting the obvious potential and benefits in that area.</P>
    <P>The Irish Goods Council have provided valuable service to many manufacturers and companies in the home market.  At present they are working on behalf of some 800 companies.  Both <Col N="1559" /> bodies referred to in the context of this Bill have provided a valuable service to Irish companies at home and overseas. They will now cease to exist and a new body will emerge.  Regeneration is a good thing and a shake-up can have a very good effect.  The staff and leadership of both bodies will amalgamate to form one agency.  I hope this will provide an opportunity for a new beginning, that the new agency will have the enthusiasm to meet the challenges they will be faced with and to deliver to the economy much needed opportunities.  I am confident the undertaking will be a success.  I welcome the Bill and assure the Minister of our support on this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill and wish the new board well.  I would also like to congratulate Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council for all the work they have done over the years.  One has only to look at the success of Irish exports in relation to the size of the country to realise they have done an excellent job and have been successful.  I am delighted these two bodies have been amalgamated and that there will now be one board which will have specific responsibility for increasing our exports overseas.  It is a timely move considering the imminence of the Single Market. There is huge potential for Irish companies to export worldwide.  I have no doubt that because of this new board there will be new enthusiasm and initiative to seek new markets.</P>
      <P>The objective of the board is &ldquo;to promote, assist and develop in any manner which the board considers necessary or desirable the marketing of Irish goods and such services as is specified by order&rdquo;. A number of joint initiatives have already been undertaken by the two agencies and have proved very successful.  Perhaps I may be allowed to give the House an example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I was asked, as was Deputy David Andrews, to go to Syria by an Irish company called Tullow Oil to see if we could help them get a licence to drill for <Col N="1560" /> oil.  I have to say that I was absolutely amazed at the groundwork that Tullow Oil had done in Syria.  We were brought to see the Prime Minister and the Minister for Energy.  We also saw the person who is closest to the President of Syria and who will probably be the next President.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt there was a huge commitment by that company to other Irish companies in trying to help them. When they originally got the licence to drill in Syria &mdash; they now have a very successful gas drilling operation there &mdash; they brought in, for example, Campbell Catering, an Irish company, to supply all the catering for the company while they were drilling there and they also got them new markets in other countries through other oil companies.  They now have a very successful and expanding catering operation to oil companies and companies who are drilling offshore and onshore around the world.  That was done with the help of another Irish company.</P>
    <P>They also brought into that part of the world a company that is often given as a great example, Ballygowan Water.  They told me a very good story.  When they brought some people from the media over to Syria to show them the operation one small boy came up the road dragging behind him an empty bottle of Ballygowan. All the media people thought it was some kind of set-up, but it was not. They had asked Ballygowan to export to Senegal and they now have a fairly good market there for Irish mineral water.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that I believe there is great potential for Irish companies working abroad to help other Irish companies to develop there.  I discussed this at length with Tullow Oil.  I would like to think that perhaps this new board would talk to companies like that and see how they could help to obtain orders and improve the exports of other companies. I have no doubt that there are many companies who have a huge commitment to Ireland who would help in this way and perhaps the Minister could ask the board to look at how this could be developed.  Undoubtedly there is a lot of goodwill on the part of companies like <Col N="1561" /> Tullow Oil to help other Irish companies who are not exporting.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly we could export very much more, but because we are an island nation on the western edge of Europe we have a certain problem with expanding into the mainland of Europe and the rest of the world.  We believe we are cut off and sometimes it is hard for us to get free of that mental block.  We should be confident of our ability to tap into all these markets and to believe that our goods are as good as those of anybody else.  This is something the new board could do.  In fact, I think that Irish companies are beginning to realise that if they want to expand they must expand abroad because the Irish market is so small.  We have only 3.5 million or four million people and to expand to any large size you must go abroad.  Any help this new board can give in that area would be very beneficial.</P>
    <P>There has been great success by Irish companies.  After I left school I worked for a company called Urney Chocolates which, unfortunately, is no longer there. It was taken over by HB &mdash; the Grace Group at the time.  When I left it was up and running and it was doing very well. I went to the United States and after I worked in the United States I went down to Central America and I always remember this.  I was in a very small town in Central America, I went into a shop and there was a bar of Urney chocolate, so I decided that we were not so bad in getting our goods to overseas markets and that our goods are as good as those of anybody else.</P>
    <P>I would like to wish the board well.  I hope they will listen to the points I have made, because I know that there is a lot of goodwill in Irish companies to help other Irish companies to expand.  I have no doubt they will be successful.  I welcome the Bill.  I think it is very timely and is necessary in the present economic circumstances and the way the world is changing economically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my thanks to <Col N="1562" /> Senators Staunton, McCarthy, Howard and Eoin Ryan for their very worthwhile contributions to this legislation.  There have been a number of questions raised to which I would like to respond.</P>
      <P>First, I will refer to some general issues that concern all of us.  There has been some reference to the job crisis but the new body, An Bord Tráchtála, will contribute in this respect.  The connection is fairly simple.  Sales create jobs.  If a company can increase its sales it will inevitably have to increase its production, distribution, invoicing departments, etc. Even with highly mechanised modern production techniques a company which is expanding its production will need more machines and more people to man those machines.  The task of An Bord Tráchtála will be assist Irish companies increase their sales and hence increase their jobs.</P>
      <P>This does not mean that An Bord Tráchtála will be going out doing the sales work for the companies.  That is something the companies must do for themselves but to achieve sales a company must first of all identify that there is a market for its products.  There is no point in producing goods and then belatedly, creating a demand for them.  That is putting the cart before the horse.  The market must first be identified and then the goods produced to fit the existing demand but that is not the whole story.  When the market is identified and the right goods produced they must be got into the marketplace. That, in itself, is no easy task in this highly competitive age when the costs of creating brand names are so enormous and the costs of market entry are prohibitive to the small suppliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new agency, An Bord Tráchtála, will be charged with assisting companies with all aspects of the twin tasks of identifying markets and selling into those markets.  Of course, it has the advantage of the tremendous record of achievement of both the Irish Goods Council and Córas Tráchtála.  We have at the moment in the region of 5,000 manufacturing companies in Ireland and only 2,500 of those companies are in the exporting field.  There are enormous opportunities <Col N="1563" /> for the other companies, who are small but who will have an opportunity to expand, to develop into overseas markets. As Senator Ryan said, there are just over 3.5 million people in the home market plus the North of Ireland, which is a very important home market as well as far as Irish products are concerned.</P>
    <P>One of the first areas for companies to expand into would be the United Kingdom which has quite a good market of over 50 million.  It has the advantage of having Córas Tráchtála offices and now An Bord Tráchtála offices located in London, Manchester and Glasgow.  The services that are available to companies are enormous and I would encourage all companies to avail of the services which An Bord Tráchtála will be providing. When the board is established I will request them to contact all the manufacturing companies in Ireland and to bring to their attention the enormous opportunities that are available abroad and the services which will be provided by An Bord Tráchtála at 21 overseas offices.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton made a point about the effect of overseas competition on the rag trade, as it is known &mdash; the clothing industry.  I think the Senator made a valid point.  I am glad to say that the Irish fashion industry is fighting back.  With the valuable assistance of Ballygowan, the Irish Goods Council have organised a major promotional campaign with the Irish fashion industry called &ldquo;Look to Your Own&rdquo;.  This is not a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign; such a campaign could not be supported by a State agency under EC law.  It is an example of a sector of Irish industry fighting back and saying: &ldquo;Look at us, look at what we are doing.  If you like what you see then, and only then, buy our products.&rdquo;  This is a good example of the combination of the skills of the Irish Goods Council and Córas Tráchtála who will now be in the position to bring a small company right through to the exporting stage without changing the personnel who have been dealing with those companies.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton also praised the <Col N="1564" /> executives of the existing organisation Córas Tráchtála abroad.  He commented on their very lonely life, that often they are the only Irish representative in that country.  It is right and proper that the Senator should comment on the services which were made available to him above and beyond the call of duty at weekends and so on.  Indeed, I have also found, dealing with staff of Córas Tráchtála abroad in different locations, that they have been extremely efficient, know-ledgable about the country to which they are assigned arranging major contacts and contracts for Irish companies and being available seven days a week to assist Irish exporters to avail of the opportunities which exist abroad.  I would like to thank Senator Staunton for his kind words, which will be conveyed to the Córas Tráchtála staff who are present here today.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton also referred to full employment in Finland and other Nordic countries and asked why Ireland could not do that too.  One of the reasons Ireland has not been so quick off the mark in this respect is that in the past we did not invest sufficiently in marketing and in science and technology, two key areas, to encourage economic growth. The new investments being made in these areas with the support available under EC Structural Funds are steps in the right direction.  It is right and necessary that we invest more in technology and innovation to get new products on the market and that we invest in the marketing of these products.</P>
    <P>Deputy Staunton also spoke about concentrating support for indigenous industry. That is primarily what this Bill is all about.  The reality of foreign owned industry is that most, though not all, have their marketing functions outside this country.  That is a feature of our industrial policy which must be and is being addressed. But the role of An Bord Tráchtála would be to concentrate on the small and medium sized Irish firms which lack the marketing capability to compete effectively. If the Senator looks, for example, at recent CTT annual reports he will see that Córas Tráchtála has focused on some <Col N="1565" /> 1,200 native firms and it is increasingly tracking the performance of these companies on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>Senator McCarthy mentioned some of the achievements of the agencies in his region.  Indeed, he also had the opportunity, when Minister for Science and Technology, to bring about the amalgamation and creation of Eolas.  I can assure the Senator that the good work of the agencies is not confined to the south Tipperary area; indeed they have a nationwide activity.</P>
    <P>I would also like to place on record my admiration of the company mentioned by Senator McCarthy, M.F. Kent of Clonmel.  I worked with Gus Kearney and his team on many occasions and I have been to the project in Barcelona mentioned by Senator McCarthy.  This company points the way in which we would like to see all Irish companies progressing. They are enormously successful, employing, as Senators stated already, 4,500 people worldwide.  I have been to their plants and outlets in different locations and I must say that they are providing tremendous opportunities for young Irish people both at home and abroad &mdash; indeed, the company is going from strength to strength.</P>
    <P>The role of Córas Tráchtála and of the new Bord Tráchtála was mentioned by Senator Howard.  It is different from that of Bord Bainne, as the Senator has acknowledged but of course, Córas Tráchtála have done a great deal of promotional work in the food area.  They successfully organised the Irish stands at major food shows like the Berlin Green Week and the SIAL show in Paris.  Córas Tráchtála have also developed a general logo, &ldquo;Food Ireland&rdquo;, which seeks to highlight the environmental advantages which Irish food products particularly enjoy.  I must say that Bord Bainne are continuing their tremendous work for the export of dairy products.  I have had an opportunity of working abroad with the marketing people in Bord Bainne, particularly in Japan and other markets which they are developing.  They have created the Kerrygold range of products which are marketed worldwide and have had <Col N="1566" /> tremendous success, particularly in Germany.</P>
    <P>I am always very anxious to have the co-operation which exists between our State agencies dealing with overseas promotion and exporting: CBF, Bord Bainne, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and, of course, Córas Tráchtála.  I found that Córas Tráchtála in a sense have had a co-ordinating role, particularly in their expertise at shows throughout the world where they have been in the position to provide back-up services.  They have gained great knowledge and experience in designing the stands at different shows like the Book Fair in Frankfurt and the Green Week in Berlin.  That expertise, the in-house design capability of the new Bord Tráchtála will be available from the Bord Tráchtála staff.</P>
    <P>Those are the items Senator Howard mentioned, which I think are very important. They are matters which may be taken for granted at times, but, coming from the background of the design industry, I have been impressed by the innovation of the design provided by Córas Tráchtála.  This was shown recently at the television industry show in Cannes.  The stand &mdash; provided at relatively economical rates &mdash; was well located and well designed to show the best Irish products in the area of the television and entertainment industry.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála have a very wide brief and that brief will be continued by An Bord Tráchtála.  They have an enormous remit.  I am delighted at the response of Senators McCarthy, Howard, Staunton and Eoin Ryan, who has also pointed out the success of Irish indigenous companies. The support of both Houses of the Oireachtas for An Bord Tráchtála is particularly satisfactory for the staff, who were present at debates both in the Dáil and the Seanad.  It is very encouraging because it takes great teamwork, and that is the kernel of this new organisation. Both organisations being amalgamated, the Irish Goods Council and Córas Tráchtála, have excellent track records; and it is a reflection of their success that the Government have decided as policy to <Col N="1567" /> establish one organisation amalgamating both staff and personnel.</P>
    <P>I want again to reassure the Seanad that there will be no staff losses as far as we are concerned.  We need all the staff of both organisations working together in this new organisation.  It is a logical step as far as I and the Government are concerned. The Irish Goods Council have tremendous expertise in the Irish market, serving over 800 indigenous small companies. They will now be in a position, with the expertise gained by Córas Tráchtála to work with those companies towards the exporting scene.  That is why I am delighted to commend this Bill to the House and to thank Senators again for their contributions, for their co-operation and for their generous comments, which will be well received by both organisations.</P>
    <P>We face enormous competition abroad and the opening up of 1992 presents us with great opportunities but also major challenges both at home and abroad.  We are very conscious of the challenges which face us in the future but with the abilities we have as a nation in the selling and marketing fields we can overcome our peripheral location in Europe, we can overcome the handicaps we have, and build on the strengths which are undoubtedly available to us.  At the moment there is another debate in the Dáil in relation to the agriculture situation and the CAP reforms.  We must intensify our marketing of all Irish products, particularly in the food area.  We must sell the quality products which we produce here at home.  We have the opportunities which must be exploited and exploited now, not in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 6, I require clarification of subsection (6) but before I address my question to the Minister, may I very briefly thank him for the very comprehensive response he gave to the Second Stage discussion?  May I also say how confident and pleased I am about the command and understanding the Minister has displayed in relation to this whole area.</P>
      <P>Section 6 (6) states:</P>
      <P>The Board shall, in respect of the promotion, assistance or development by the Board of the marketing of any goods or services in relation to which a Minister exercises any function, act in consultation with that Minister.</P>
      <P>I hope it will be a simple question for the Minister to clarify, but what exactly are we talking about and what type of functions would he envisage would require the board to consult with the Minister?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>This provision is taken from 1959 Act, amended slightly to take account of the expanded functions of the board.  This section provides that the new board would consult with the relevant Minister responsible for any sector which the board may be considering assisting.  This will ensure that there is no unnecessary duplication or conflict of activities between different agencies of the State in their activities aimed at developing any particular sector.  For instance, I feel it is vital from a policy point of view that any Government in the future would be aware of what activities the board would be undertaking at a particular time and that we would have no duplication of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  Would the Minister have an example?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, Bord na Móna consult with the Department of Energy in relation to their remit and, in <Col N="1569" /> relation to the food industry, the Minister for Agriculture and Food would be involved in that area.  But I think it is very important that the Government and the Minister responsible would be made aware by this board of any changes or any areas where it is assisting.  We also keep very closely in touch with the board in relation to its representives.  At the moment a senior executive of my Department is on the board of Córas Tráchtála. That ensures a co-ordinated approach between the work of the board and particularly the work of my Department in relation to trade and marketing.  There is a co-ordinated approach between the new board and the Department so that we would be aware of any departure from the standard procedure.  We do not consult on every particular issue.  These would be major new departures in relation to the remit of the board of which the Department would be made aware and which would be carried out in consultation with the Department.</P>
      <P>That primarily is the purpose of this section, which is included in the 1959 Act, although amended slightly to take account of the expanded functions of the board.  This has been the practice by the present Córas Tráchtála who are also an advisory body to my Department and that role will be continued in the future.</P>
      <P>There is another very important aspect.  The purpose is to avoid double funding the same activity by two Departments. It is very important that we would be kept informed of departures and developments so that we could ensure that other Departments or other areas would not be double funding particular projects.  For instance, the IDA had a major role and responsibility in the amalgamation of NADCORP.  It is important that both organisations would not be funding the same type of project.  I hope I have explained to Senator Howard the reason for this subsection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>By and large, I accept what the Minister has said.  However, I am not totally satisfied on it.  I have a theory that if you give an organisation responsibility and a job to do, you give <Col N="1570" /> them the maximum freedom to do it, but a strict interpretation of this could mean there is no function they would actually be expected to perform but that some Minister had an interest in it.  Therefore, you could find a situation in which they were going to be continually restrained in their activities because they have to continually look over their shoulders in case they are stepping on dangerous ground.  I believe there is no function they would be performing but that some Minister would have an interest in it. However, I understand from the Minister's reply that it would be used only in a very general way and that the Minister anticipates &mdash; I am sure he will confirm this to me &mdash; that the need for ministerial intervention or ministerial consultation would only be on a rare occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I am delighted Senator Howard has teased this issue out, because it is a very important section in the Bill.  It is very important that this is placed on record at this time and that I have this opportunity in the Seanad, as opposed to the Dáil, to make this point. The real purpose of this section is to ensure that where the new board would be considering an application for assistance from another semi-State organisation &mdash; I give the example of Bord na Móna &mdash; it would be very important that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would inform his colleague in Government that such an application was before his Department.  That would ensure there would not be duplication of assistance from Energy and Industry and Commerce for the same project at a particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Really, it is a matter of co-ordination more than anything else.  That would apply, for instance, to the Electricity Supply Board or a food agency that might be involved.  We would consult with and inform the relevant Minister with responsibility for that agency or organisation in order to avoid the possibility of duplication of grant assistance or aid in the particular area.  That is the whole purpose of the provision and it has not created any difficulty to date.  It is not <Col N="1571" /> included for the purpose of delaying any worthwhile project.  It would be a very speedy consultation which would be dealt with immediately by our senior staff in consultation with the staff of the other Department involved.  I think it is a good provision and I thank the Senator for raising the point.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a query on similar lines to the earlier amendment.  Section 7 (1) says:</P>
      <P>The Minister may give the Board such general policy directives as he considers appropriate having regard to the provisions of the Act.</P>
      <P>In relation to the earlier section I suggested that problems could arise here. With regard to the Minister giving general policy directives as he considers appropriate, I am trying to ensure that An Bord Tráchtála will have the maximum freedom to go into the marketplace and that the minimum restraints will be imposed.  Whether it involves a change of Minister, a change of Government or anything like that, the general policy directives of a Minister can change from time to time.  I want an assurance from the Minister that my fears are not well founded.  If I can get such an assurance I will be quite happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the views expressed by Senator Howard. Effectively, he is trying to suggest that this board should be autonomous, that it should have its own direction and its own policy distinct and separate from the Government of the day and the Department of Industry and Commerce of the day.  That would be totally out of line with the function of the body.  This body has to be answerable.  As structured it will have to be answerable to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  There <Col N="1572" /> is no question in my mind but that this body should not be an autonomous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>This section enables the Minister for Industry and Commerce to give general policy directives to the new board.  Senators will notice that the provision is in relation to general policy directives.  It is not intended that the Minister should have powers in relation to the day to day undertakings of the board.  This is similar to provisions in other Acts, for example, the Science and Technology Act, 1987.  Senator Howard and Senator McCarthy raised these points.  In relation to policy in 1987 the Government, through the Minister decided that there should be concentration on indigenous companies. Also at that time the Government gave a policy directive that Córas Tráchtála should raise more funds for the sale of their services.  That again was a general policy directive.  The Government can decide, for instance, to react to international situations for example in relation to Iraq, the Gulf, Kuwait and the opportunities which exist there at the moment, the Government would request the new board to act in relation to that particular area of development.  Regarding the democratic position in eastern Europe the Government, through the Minister, would indicate to the board of Córas Tráchtála that there should be a particular concentration in that area with a view possibly to opening new offices.  The decision to open a particular office would be a matter for the board but the overall policy directive would come from the Minister and the board would act in accordance with the policy of the Minister of the day and the Government of the day.  This would then be the responsibility of the new board to implement through the policy directive set out by the Minister.  However, this would only arise on particular issues, but certainly not on day to day issues.  That would not be the policy of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is co-ordination of activities between my Department and Córas Tráchtála in their schedules and in their programmes for particular years, which are <Col N="1573" /> put before the board in the early part of a year, or at the end of a particular year. The Government would be aware of the general outline of activities being proposed by the new board and that is the policy which will be pursued by the Government for the foreseeable future.</P>

It is important to mention again &mdash; it has already been mentioned by Members here &mdash; that the staff of both organisations will come together and there will be no lessening of their opportunities for this board.

    <Title>Courts Bill, 1991: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a short Bill which will extend the time provided in the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, for the issue by justices of the District Court of warrants committing persons to <Col N="1575" /> prison who fail to pay fines or perform conditions ordered by the District Court.</P>
      <P>Orders of the District Court imposing a fine or a condition will usually provide for imprisonment in the event of failure to comply with a court order.  In such a case it is necessary for the court to issue a warrant, for execution by the Garda, committing a person in default to prison.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act 1851, warrants for imprisonment for the non-payment of fines or for the non-performance of conditions must be issued directly on the expiration of the time for payment of a fine or performance of a condition ordered by the District Court or, at the latest, on the next court day.  Due to the strict limits set in the 1851 Act it is impossible to issue warrants in the normal course in the time specified.</P>
      <P>The District Court Rules have accordingly provided since 1948 that warrants may be issued at any time after default of payment or after a justice of the District Court is satisfied that a condition has not been performed.  This rule has been generally followed in practice and it replaced a rule on similar lines which was made in 1926.  The practice is, therefore, of long standing and has not been challenged.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that, under the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, the District Court Rules Committee established by the 1924 Act are empowered in carrying out their functions to make rules for the adaptation or modification of any statute that may be necessary, doubts have recently been expressed over the question of whether or not it was within the power of the Rules Committee to provide for a time for the issue of warrants different from that provided by the statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is unsatisfactory and the Bill proposes to deal with it by extending the time prescribed in the 1851 Act to allow a realistic period &mdash; six months &mdash; during which warrants may be issued. When the Bill is enacted the District Court Rules Committee will be asked to bring the rules into conformity with the <Col N="1576" /> provisions of the Bill so that similar doubts will not arise in the future in this area.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (1) (a) of the Bill provides that a warrant of committal to prison may be issued not later than six months from the expiration of the time fixed by a court order for the payment of a fine or the performance of a condition.  Accordingly, this provision will apply in the case of an order made by a justice of the District Court after the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>It will also apply to orders made before the passing of the Bill where the time for complying with an order expires after the Bill is passed.  I am satisfied that six months is a reasonable period of time to allow for issuing warrants and that it will be possible for the District Court to operate within this time limit in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (1) (b) provides that a warrant may be issued not later than six months after the Bill is passed, where the time for payment or performance expired on or after 1 July 1989 and the day before the Bill is passed.  This provision is necessary in order to ensure that existing orders of the District Court are complied with.  It is also necessary to avoid financial loss to the Exchequer which would otherwise occur if a doubt existed as to whether warrants could be executed.</P>
    <P>While, on one view, there may be a doubt under the present law as to whether warrants can now issue in respect of fines which fell due for payment in this period, there is of course no doubt but that these fines are legally payable on foot of proper District Court orders.  The date, 1 July 1989, will catch virtually all outstanding fines so that it is not strictly necessary to go back further than that and it might appear unreasonable to go too far back.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Bill provides a reasonable time for the issue of warrants in future and it also removes any doubts about the powers of the District Court to ensure enforcement of its orders.</P>
    <P>I commend this important Bill to the House.</P>

Over the past year the Minister has been very active in this area and I congratulate him on that.  It is the aim of the Department to continue in this vein.</P>

      <P>Tá an-áthas orm bheith anseo arís chun deileáil leis an dara Bille seo.</P>
      <P>The Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1990 which was initiated in the Seanad and passed by it on 14 March last has since been passed by Dáil Éireann with some amendments. I would now like to explain these amendments to this House.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 is purely a drafting amendment.  It is desirable because of the frequency with which reference is made in the Bill to the Courts of Justice Act, 1936.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are consequential on amendment No. 1.  Amendments Nos. 4 and 12 are connected.  The purpose of amendment No. 4 is to extend the range of persons in respect of whom the Minister for Finance under section 4 of this Act may provide, by regulations, for the grant of a contributory spouses' and children's pension in order to include a person who dies while serving as a temporary judge of the Circuit Court or as a temporary justice of the District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 would enable payment of a death gratuity to be made in respect of a deceased temporary judge or justice, thereby alleviating to some degree at least the hardship which occurs where a person appointed to act as a temporary Circuit Court judge or as a temporary justice of the District Court under section 14 and 51, respectively, of <Col N="1579" /> the Courts of Justice Act, 1936 dies before receiving a permanent appointment.</P>
    <P>As the Minister mentioned in his Second Stage speech in Dáil Éireann, within the last year or so two justices of the District Court died in such circumstances and their spouses and children are left without entitlement to any benefit in respect of their judicial service. Had their appointments been of a permanent nature their spouses would receive a death gratuity under section 2 of the Courts of Justice and Court Officers Superannuation Act, 1961, as amended by section 8 of this Act.  Also under section 4 of this Act, they would become eligible for a grant of pension under the contributory spouses' and children's pension scheme and their spouses and children would benefit accordingly.  These two were the only deaths of temporary judges or justices which occurred in the period covered by this Act and the Minister for Justice considered it appropriate to make legislative provision for them and for similar cases in the future to give their next-of-kin the same benefits they would have received had the appointments been of a permanent nature.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are connected and are consequential on amendment No. 4.  They provide the means whereby the appropriate contributions can be made to the spouses' and children's pension schemes in respect of all the temporary service given by a deceased temporary judge or justice. This would be done by way of a reduction in the amount of the death gratuity which, as a result of amendment No. 12, would become payable in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Amendments No. 7 and 8 are connected and are also consequential on amendments No. 4.  They extend the provision which would enable retrospective effect to be given to regulations made under section 4 of the Act to include temporary judges or justices. Without these amendments, no benefit under the contributory spouses' and children's pensions scheme would accrue to <Col N="1580" /> the widows and children of the deceased justices to whom I have already referred.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendments Nos. 9 and 10 is to enable transfer payments to be made to the European Community institutions in respect of members of the Judiciary or court officers who leave office with entitlement to preserved superannuation benefits and take up European Community appointments in the interests of Ireland.  Under these arrangements, which would be optional for the persons affected, the amount of transfer payment would be equivalent to the estimated cost to the Exchequer of the preserved benefits.  The European Community institution would award extra service credits under its own pension scheme to the person concerned based on the amount of the payment. Once a transfer payment is made, the person concerned would forfeit all entitlement to preserved benefits under this Act.</P>
    <P>The introduction of transfer payment arrangements would not be incompatible with the purpose of the Bill as it would simply extend to judges and court officers a facility which has been available for some years to other public servants who take up European Community appointments. It would not involve an extra charge on public funds as the value of the transfer payments would match the value of the preserved benefits which would be surrendered.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 11 is consequential on amendment No. 4 which I have already explained.  This amendment provides the mechanism for the laying of regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas in respect of the grant of pension to the spouse or any child of a temporary judge or justice who dies in office.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 refers to payment of death gratuities in respect of temporary judges or justices.  I have already dealt with this in conjunction with amendment No. 4.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 13, 14 and 15 are consequential on amendment No. 9 and provide that a transfer payment which would be made to European Community <Col N="1581" /> institution in respect of members of the Judiciary would be a charge on the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>I trust that these new detailed explanations on the amendments which have been made by the Dáil are to the satisfaction of the House.  I am sure the House will agree to these very important provisions.</P>

Perhaps we could have a review of all the little anomalies that do not involve much cost to the State but often cause considerable hardship to the dependants of those caught in the gaps in various provisions in the public sector.  For example, the widow of a former Member of the Oireachtas, through a combination of unforeseen circumstances, ended up with neither a pension nor anything else.  We need a general review, but I am glad that the problem has been dealt with in this case.</P>

      <P>I thank the House for its warm welcome for this Bill. I concur with what Senators Fallon and Ryan have said.  I agree with Senator Ryan that there are certain anomalies which do not cost the State much money but which create dreadful hardship for the victims.  I know that there may be some anomalies right across the pensions area, particularly in the social welfare area.  The Department of Social Welfare are to be commended in that where certain Acts confer certain benefits on <Col N="1582" /> people, particularly on spouses where payments would be made to the spouse and a family for their partner and where some of the benefits conferred would be of less advantage to those spouses, the Department take the view at all times that the maximum payment should be made and recommend that no change should be made unless the spouse themselves wish to have that change made.</P>
      <P>As far as the Department of Justice is concerned, we want to remove any anomalies that are there and this is part of that process.  I thank the House sincerely for their support for this Bill.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire.  Tá brón orm nach é an tAire Leasa Shóisialaigh atá in ár dteannta anocht mar tá ceisteanna faoi leith le freagairt agus in ainneoin dea-thola an Aire atá in ár láthair, níl an taithí aige as an Roinn <Col N="1583" /> nó an t-údarás aige i gceannas ar an Roinn chun, b'fhéidir, ina ceisteanna nó an fhealsúnacht atá taobh thiar de chuid de na moltaí atá agam a phlé.  Ach tá súil agam go mbeidh freagra de shaghas aige agus gur freagra ar a bhfuil á rá agam a thabharfaidh sé in ionad freagra ar a bhfuil an Roinn ag súil a déarfaidh mé. Ní thógfaidh mé morán ama an cheist seo a phlé ach tá sé tábhachtach.</P>
      <P>Ten years ago a most unfortunate decision was taken by the then Minister for Social Welfare.  In order to dispose of a few red herrings to coin a phrase, that have been dragged across this issue, I know it was a member of the Labour Party who was Minister for Social Welfare in 1981 when the decision was taken. Successive Ministers for Social Welfare in Governments in which the Labour Party were not a part &mdash; I am not a member of the Labour Party &mdash; seem to feel that it is important to point this out to me whenever the issue comes up.  I also know why it was said the regulations were introduced. I also know the procedures and requirements for signing on.  The last occasion on which the extraordinary requirement that members of the travelling community must sign on at labour exchanges all round the country at 11.30 a.m. on Thursday mornings was raised, I was given a long account of the obligations under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 1981 that people must meet in order to qualify for unemployment assistance.  About six lines in the Minister's reply were devoted to the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1981 the travelling community's perception of itself has changed out of all recognition.  There are within the travelling community a considerable number of people who are very assertive and proud of their existence as an ethnic minority with their own culture, lifestyle and, to a considerable degree, their own language. They are not just a raggle taggle collection of unfortunates who happen to be outside society.  They are a most <Col N="1584" /> significant ethnic minority perhaps 20,000 people.  That minority has increasingly sought not charity but rights for itself.  It has sought the right not to be discriminated against, in particular, the right not to be stigmatised in any discriminatory way.  In 1981 when this extraordinary requirement was introduced neither the travelling community nor those who attempted to look after their welfare had this sense of ethnic identity. I quote from column 791 of the Official Report of the Seanad, 22 October 1986. The then Minister of State, Deputy Pattison said:</P>
    <P>Following a review within my Department of the position it became apparent that there was a need for special signing arrangements for all claimants of no fixed abode which, of course, includes members of the travelling community in order to close off the possibility of such claimants signing on and receiving payments under two different names at two or more local offices in one week.</P>
    <P>Nobody ever produced evidence to support this.  Nobody ever attempted to show the travelling community the basis on which they were being stigmatised as chronic dole fiddlers.  A review was carried out in secret.  Statistics were looked at in secret.  Proposals and decisions were made in secret and at the end of the process, the result was made public.</P>
    <P>The situation now is that in every village, town and city where there is a labour exchange you can stand at 11.30 a.m. on Thursday and point out the travellers. This was done because somebody decided there was widespread abuse, even though there was no evidence to support that claim.  A significant number of people have not been prosecuted.  We do not know the basis for doing this, perhaps it was hearsay or prejudice, we do not know.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Social Welfare attempted to defend the position as late as December.  He said in what I can <Col N="1585" /> only describe as the wondrous style all Ministers have, and I quote from the debate of that day:</P>
    <P>There is no question of discrimination in having all people of no fixed abode sign at one time.</P>
    <P>I love that.  Because he says there is no discrimination, therefore there is no discrimination. The Stormont regime of past years said there was no question of discrimination against Catholics because of their religion, it was because of their politics, lack of loyalty or whatever else. They said because we do not call it discrimination, it is not discrimination.  That was not a monopoly of the Stormont Parliament; it happens in many places.  The Minister took us away from the misnomer &ldquo;persons of no fixed abode&rdquo; because in 1990 he went on to say:</P>
    <P>Following a meeting between officials of my Department and the monitoring committee for travelling people, a review of the arrangements was carried out at two Dublin exchanges.  The purpose was to identify settled travellers with permanent addresses with a view to integrating them into the normal signing arrangements. Following the examination of approximately 500 applications at the two exchanges, 67 people were identified as being settled travellers.</P>
    <P>It intrigues me that two different Ministers from two different Governments insisted that this was not discriminating against travellers.  How did they suddenly identify 67 people as being of no fixed abode when they were living in settled accommodation?  Clearly they did not qualify as being of no fixed abode.  They identified them because they were culturally, racially and in terms of their family names and family associations members of the travelling community. They were made to sign on at 11.30 a.m. on Thursdays not because they were of no fixed abode, because manifestly they were not, but because they were <Col N="1586" /> members of an ethnic minority and that is nothing short of racist discrimination against an ethnic minority in this State. What we got out of that was that after ten years a Minister finally conceded by implication if not fact that this discrimination was directed against the travelling community.  It was always obvious because the Department of Social Welfare will not give social welfare payments to one without an address.  How can you be of no fixed abode and at the same time qualify for social welfare?  If one has an address one cannot be of no fixed abode.</P>
    <P>We all know from dealing with homeless people that they were not subjected to this requirement.  There was a flutter of words to cover up the fact that this was directed exclusively at the travelling community.  The Minister unfortunately having showed a small moment of enlightenment in recognising the absurdity of settled travellers being treated as persons of no fixed abode, said that the Senator &mdash; that was me he was talking about &mdash; would be interested to hear that some of the travellers deemed as settled did not wish to change their signing arrangements as they regarded the Thursday morning gathering as something of a social occasion.  I said, when the Minister said that and he got very cross with me, that it reminded me of statements made in South Africa by white South Africans to the effect that their black servants would not really like liberation but would prefer the old system in which they felt secure.  Neither statement is right and both statements about different people of different cultural backgrounds are profoundly offensive. The Minister may think that it was a nice thing to say but it was profoundly patronising to the travelling community.</P>
    <P>Since then there has been a change. The rhetoric about travellers is now very different.  As far as I recall, the Taoiseach was very eloquent about the rights of the travelling community during his address to the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis.  On his vision of the new and caring Ireland he <Col N="1587" /> was hoping to lead us into he elaborated at some length on the rights of travellers. He opened the new centre for the Dublin Travellers' Education and Development Group with some panache and I compliment him for it because those gestures are extremely important for the assertion of the right of this cultural minority to its own identity.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has also given considerable stature, support and financial assistance to the Dublin Travellers' Education and Development Group.  I am aware of all that and for what has been done I have no reason to be other than complimentary, but little gestures like that, however significant, are no substitute for a deliberate policy of abolishing stigma and the knowledge that every community can pick out the travellers on a Thursday at 11.30 a.m. demolishes all the other good work.  It puts travellers in a sub-group and places them under suspicion, when they are pointed out as a suspect group incapable of behaving like the rest of us and needing to be tied down and visibly profiled as a suspect group.  How can you expect communities to accept as full participants people of whom the State says: &ldquo;Look at them.  They are the people we have to watch every week, otherwise they would fiddle the system&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I have said often, if we did this to people who were black, or members of the Jewish or the gay community this country would rise in outrage and the liberal media in Dublin would fulminate. If the Government of the United Kingdom said that because of the large influx of unemployed Irish people, many of whom are not in permanent accommodation, were going to require every Irish person in Britain to sign on at a labour exchange at 11.30 a.m. on a Thursday, who would be the quickest to rightly scream discrimination?  The Irish Government would scream loud and long about discrimination against the Irish and stigmatisation of the Irish.  I could write <Col N="1588" /> the script.  They would say &ldquo;We do not know the evidence, we have not seen the case, we do not know any of those things, but it is wrong&rdquo;.  We do not know the evidence on which this measure was introduced, nor have we seen the case on which it was introduced.  We only see the consequence, which is, a group of people paraded in front of the rest of the community en bloc at the same time all over the country while signing on.  One could not stigmatise people more effectively by forcing them to wear a yellow star which would say &ldquo;These are the outcasts, they are outside our society, you must be wary of them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When one considers the enormous prejudice prevailing already against the travelling community and their difficulty getting children into schools how can people accept travellers as neighbours when the State says they cannot be trusted?  The implication is that they are up to fiddling and to theft.  What will this measure do but compound the prejudice against them?</P>
    <P>We have had ten years of racist experiment drafted by a Minister of the Government other than this one.  Therefore, the present Minister has no obligation to a measure which has been operated cruelly and dressed up for a long time in language that covered up its racist basis by talking about persons of no fixed abode, as a result of which travellers living in houses were told that, for the purposes of the Department of Social Welfare, they were persons of no fixed abode until, as the Minister said, some time in 1990 when they finally caught up on that particularly extreme form of discrimination.  For the rest of the travelling community not in settled accommodation the situation continues.  I put it to this Minister that it is time it ended.  It is nothing less than institutionalised racial discrimination, stereotyping and stigmatisation; it is wrong and it should end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is provided in the social welfare legislation that to be entitled to unemployment payments a person must be unemployed, available for and genuinely seeking work.  Until recently the rules govening signing were related to the distance a person lived from the local office and could require attendance several times a week.  The Minister has made significant improvements for clients in the signing arrangements. He has reduced signing frequency.  Most claimants now only sign once a week and are paid in cash at the same time.  The Department are currently examining, in conjunction with the development of alternative payment methods, the possibility of further reductions in signing frequency.</P>
      <P>The payment arrangements for those who do not have a fixed address as the Senator pointed out were introduced in 1981.  There was clear evidence at that time that the practice of a sizeable number of claimants signing on and receiving payments under different names at two or more local offices in the one week was a significant and growing problem.  It was decided to introduce special arrangements for claimants with no fixed address.  The same arrangements apply in Northern Ireland where similar problems occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare would be failing in their responsibilities if they did not ensure that measures were in operation to meet the special situation of claimants with no fixed address. Members of the travelling community who are settled have the same signing <Col N="1590" /> arrangements as other members of the settled community.</P>

      <P>Last year, following a meeting between officials of the Department and the Monitoring Committee for Travelling People, a review of the arrangements was carried out at two Dublin exchanges.  The purpose of the review was to identify settled travellers with permanent addresses with a view to extending the usual signing arrangements to them.  Arising from this review new signing arrangements were introduced for, as Senator Ryan mentioned, some 67 settled travellers.  Some members of the travelling community who had settled did not wish to change their signing on arrangements; others did not wish to change as they had arrangements made for the payment of bills, such as rent to coincide with their unemployment payment day.</P>
      <P>I can assure Senator Ryan who has a very special interest in this debate that there is no question of the Minister for Social Welfare or the Government trying to discriminate against or stigmatise the travelling people as the ethnic minority he referred to.  I want to assure the Senator on behalf of the Minister for Social Welfare that the Minister is reviewing signing on arrangements generally and will give particular consideration to the requirements of members of the travelling community.  I will bring to the attention of the Minister the various points raised by the Senator and, again, I want to assure him that there is no question but that the Minister would want to be, and I would not want to be, a party to discrimination or stigmatisation against an ethnic minority, and every effort will be made to try to ensure that there is integration but the practical problems that arise from time to time must be taken into consideration.</P>
