      <P>I have notice from Senator Cosgrave that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide emergency temporary accommodation for juvenile offenders; and to review the overall situation particularly in the light of repeated remarks by members of the Judiciary.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Cosgrave as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The House this morning may be an indication of things to come, that we are going to a two-party system in Irish politics.  It may also be a sign of what is going to happen in the local elections.  I certainly hope so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Order of Business, may I ask the Acting Leader of the House if he can tell me whether there are any proposals <Col N="946" /> for item No. 1?  It has been on the Order Paper for a long time now.  Secondly, with respect to the promise in the Programme for Government that there would be a comprehensive programme for Oireachtas reform by the middle of last year, can he indicate whether the Government have any proposals on this matter?</P>

      <P>May I ask the Acting Leader of the House to indicate whether it is intended, as reported, to bring in legislation amending the Broadcasting Act, particularly in light of recent revelations regarding TV3, etc?  Would he consider, at some stage, making time available for an up-to-date debate in relation to the whole communications area?  Perhaps he could indicate whether this legislation will be coming before the House before the summer recess.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Cosgrave in his comments.  Those of us who vigorously opposed the Bill when it was going through the Dáil have been vindicated by recent events.  I support his call for a discussion on the issue.  I would also like to ask the Acting Leader if he can report what the present position is about the proposal of the Government to establish the foreign affairs committee.</P>

      <P>In reply to Senator Manning, perhaps between now and the end of the session we might find some time to discuss the Altamont Bill, in agreement with the Whips.  As for reforms of the House, it is ongoing situation but we will try to give him the up-to-date situation. When the Leader of the House returns I will ask him to communicate with Senator Manning.  Senators Cosgrave and Staunton know there are no plans to have a debate on communications between now and the end of this session.  Senator Staunton mentioned a foreign affairs committee.  I have nothing further to add to what the Leader said yesterday.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991 (Social Welfare Regulations) Order, 1991,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Seanad Éireann on 23rd May, 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 6 April 1991, the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991, came into force in respect of rights under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973 and 1984, the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977 and 1988, and the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973.  The Act is also designed to extend rights under the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1970, the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Acts, 1984 and 1990 and the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981, to regular part-time workers.  These provisions have not yet come into force due to the fact that the scope of these three Acts is partly defined by reference to employment which is insurable for benefits under social welfare legislation.  The social welfare regulations specified in section 1(1), a(i), f(i) and (g) of the 1991 Act have been rendered out-of-date by the Social Welfare (Subsidiary Employments) Regulations, 1991 (S.I. No. 73 of 1991) and the Social Welfare (Employment of Inconsiderable Extended (No.2) Regulations, 1991 (S.I. No. 72) of 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft order before the House will allow the remaining provisions of the Act <Col N="948" /> to come into force by prescribing the updated social welfare regulations for the purposes of these paragraphs.</P>
    <P>A copy of the draft order was laid before Dáil and Seanad Éireann on 23 May 1991.  The draft order requires the prior approval of each House of the Oireachtas by way of affirmative resolution and I request Seanad Éireann to express such approval.  It is a simple order updating the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991, to take it into line with the changes that were made subsequently in the social insurance legislation.  We agreed in this House that whenever there were changes like this they would be done by affirmative resolution. It is just a technical matter to bring the Worker Protection Act of 1991 into force in respect of rights not yet brought in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no problem in relation to the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991. As the Minister stated, it is simply a regulating business having to do with the rights of part-time workers under unfair dismissals and to extend these rights in the redundancy sector.  The draft order requires that it be sent to the Oireachtas. It is effectively ensuring that social welfare provisions are made available for part-time workers, and I support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to welcome the Minister again to the House.  The order before the House is an indication of the very progressive attitude the Minister has adopted to industrial relations in general. The order relates to workers who are normally expected to work for at least eight hours a week and complete 13 weeks continuous service with an employer.  It will ensure that those employees will enjoy the same protection as full-time workers.  It is evidence of the excellence and whole attitude of the Minister for Labour.  It is about the fourth or fifth time we have discussed part-time <Col N="949" /> employees in this House, apart altogether from all the other labour legislation that we have dealt with over the past couple of years.</P>
      <P>It is no harm to refresh our minds in relation to part-time workers and the fact that for the first time they will be entitled to claim weekly payments from the Department of Social Welfare because of illness, unemployment or for maternity purposes.  Part-time work, for a variety of reasons, is a fact of life in the present day situation.  As has been mentioned, in 1989 the number of registered part-time workers was in the region of 82,000. Many of those people would have been working out of necessity.  Many would be working part-time because it suited them. Housewives, for instance, may only be available for work in the evenings.</P>
      <P>A very important sector that we are inclined to overlook are women who have fulfilled the very important function of rearing a family.  They would have been in full-time employment at one time but gave up that employment in order to rear the family.  Now that the nest is empty and all the family reared, they find themselves with a tremendous amount of time on their hands.  For one reason or another they feel isolated and they feel lonely.  It is time we paid a very special tribute to those people and afforded them the opportunity to get back into the work-force. Those of us who have full schedules and who are on the go every day do not fully appreciate the trauma and feeling of being no longer needed that many of those people have.  They are excellent and they have enormous contributions to make to society and to the workplace for the benefit of all.  They must be given the opportunity to return to the workplace and one very important factor in encouraging them back into the workplace is the availability of part-time work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The excellent return to work schemes that are on offer through FÁS afford many of them the opportunity to refresh their talents and come back into the workplace.  Part-time employees should <Col N="950" /> not be expected to work for a pittance. They are entitled to a fair day's wages for a fair day's work.  As the Minister once said there are employers who know that people need money badly for different reasons and are inclined to be unscrupulous in their attitude towards those people.  The new order will overcome all those difficulties and protect all part-time workers.  That is an excellent development. Employers from here on will have to be very careful in relation to the type of money they offer people.  I do not think they can intimidate people any longer into working all hours.  It was said that you could have a part-time worker who was working for 15 years and then at the whim of an employer, for whatever reason, that person could be dismissed. That cannot happen any longer.</P>
    <P>I appeal to all part-time employees to register and to realise that they have this protection and that they are now covered by exactly the same protection as full-time employees and they should use the mechanisms that are there.  They have the facility of all the tribunals that are there for the benefit of full-time employees and that is right.  Many employers work through the black economy and there is a type of intimidation of people to discourage them from reporting grievances.</P>
    <P>There are certain industries, and I do not want to be specific, who operate with a kind of slave labour as far as wages are concerned.  The work their employees are required to do is unbelievable.  There are instances of people being paid 80p an hour or something like that.  That is absolutely ridiculous in this day and age.  I appeal to all part-time employees to realise this.  It is very important that it is brought home to them that they have rights.  The Minister has set about regularising all the mechanisms so that part-time workers can have the protection of the law.  The law is there and if an employer breaks it then he is liable under the law.  It is very important that we outline the position in relation to that. <Col N="951" /> Under the new legislation part-time employees will now have the benefit of the Redundancy Payments Act.  They will have the benefit of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, the Unfair Dismissals Act, Maternity Protection of Employees Act, the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Acts, and the new order before us is in relation to social welfare.  It is a welcome development and I congratulate the Minister on bringing it before the House.  I compliment him on his attitude in the whole area of industrial relations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation before the House today.  I congratulate the Minister.  Over the last number of years, the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, has put through many pieces of good legislation with regard to the protection of workers.  The Order before us today is a further piece of legislation that will be most welcome. As Senator McKenna said, part-time workers had no protection whatsoever for many years.  This has now been remedied by the Minister and it is welcomed throughout the country.  I hope that further legislation will be forthcoming from the Minister in the future.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Leader of the House and Senators Staunton and McKenna for their contributions.  It is just a minor technical change but it will be beneficial to a number of part-time workers who now have the full benefits under the Acts, as I outlined.  The affirmative order process is slightly cumbersome but it is important that we do it because there are a number of people who are entitled to these benefits and who cannot be facilitated until we have passed the order.  I want to thank the House for its co-operation in getting this order passed so that we can go ahead with the administrative process.</P>

I want to put it <Col N="953" /> on the record of the House that I, and my Department, had precisely one minute's notice.</P>

      <P>The House would like to thank you, Minister, for being here at all in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>Senator Cosgrave on the motion on the need for the Minister for Education to provide emergency temporary accommodation for juvenile offenders and to review the overall situation particularly in the light of repeated remarks by members of the Judiciary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to thank the Minister for coming here even at the short notice.  I accept that such short notice was unfortunate.  It is unusual that proceedings in the Seanad should finish so quickly, but I suppose we must take elections, etc., into account.</P>
      <P>The matter I am raising is one which has been continually coming up in recent days, in particular the whole question of detention of and responsibility for juvenile offenders.  It is a matter which the Minister here present has some responsibility for, but probably also the Minister for Justice and perhaps other Departments as well.  I ask that what I say would be taken on board by the present Minister and perhaps matters not directly her responsibility would be handled by her colleagues.  In recent times we have had remarks by members of the Judiciary, and particularly those of District Justice Wine, who is a most distinguished and long serving member of the bench.  He has been requesting facilities.  He has been requesting various Departments to respond to him in relation to the whole question of the detention of juvenile offenders but the way his comments and his appeals have been attended to is a disgrace.  I will just quote briefly from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Friday, 31 May 1991, where, after a juvenile who was remanded on 36 charges tried to escape from the courthouse, District Justice Wine said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> Last week in this court I made an appeal to the Minister involved, which I thought was constructive because of my belief that the authorities have absolutely no idea of the magnitude of what is involved in this shocking problem of juvenile delinquency.  I have received not one word &mdash; silence. All I asked was very simple, to draft one letter to every court to ascertain the magnitude of what is involved. Obviously they have just left the matter unheeded and without care.  I am not going to leave this.  It is too important for the future of our children.</P>
    <P>I am not going to leave it either, because this is a problem which is not new, it is a problem which has been going on and it is one that has to be tackled by this Government.  Being fair to the Minister present, I do not think it is her Department who have not responded to Justice Wine but I will certainly ask the Minister to inquire from her colleagues if it is the case that a district justice writing to a Department with a basic simple appeal was not answered.  It is a very serious situation and it has to be investigated.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of a spiralling crime wave.  We have seen it and we are hearing about it nightly on the doorsteps, in particular the problem of juvenile offenders who drift eventually into serious difficulties in relation to drugs, etc.  There is also the growing problem of stealing cars, that is what it should be known as, stealing cars, and not at times glorified as joy riding, trying to make it out to be some sort of a half respectable pastime.  That should be rejected by all Members of this House.  I am sure the Minister shares my concern on this.  While it is more a problem for the Dublin area and other urban areas, I am sure the Minister would acknowledge that it is a problem even in parts of her own constituency.</P>
    <P>We have to deal with the question of how juvenile offenders are treated, how they are educated and, above all, how best we can try to rehabilitate them. <Col N="955" /> Under the heading &ldquo;Principles for dealing with juvenile offenders&rdquo; the Whitaker report of 1985 stated in paragraph 9.6:</P>
    <P>The Committee considers that the following principles should be observed in responding to juvenile crime:</P>
    <P>...juvenile offenders should be kept out of the criminal justice system as far as possible.</P>
    <P>I am sure we would all agree with that. We should have special courts and we should not have a juvenile charged, followed by somebody on a very serious offence such as assault or robbery.  As far as possible juveniles should be protected. If we can deal with prevention and have matters sorted out initially, juveniles can be put on the straight and narrow.</P>
    <P>The second point from the Whitaker report is:</P>
    <P>Intervention in the life of the juvenile offender should, in the first place, be on a voluntary basis and with his co-operation. This would involve either the Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers (where the juvenile is not being prosecuted) or the Probation and Welfare Service (where the juvenile is being prosecuted)....</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister here and to her other colleagues to put as much resources as possible into the juvenile liaison system and to try to allocate extra juvenile liaison officers and extra community gardaí.  If an extra few pounds are spent in this area it will be cheaper in relation to insurance claims, in relation to the unauthorised taking of cars and, above all, it will be cheaper in relation to possible loss of life.  The Whitaker report also states:</P>
    <P>Detention of juveniles should be considered only when:</P>
    <P>(a) they are a danger to society or to themselves (as distinct from being a nuisance, even perhaps a considerable nuisance) ...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="956" /> There are many juveniles out there who could be helped with the right approach, with an educational programme in place, with meetings taking place between them and juvenile liaison officers and social welfare workers.  There also has to be a greater role played by parents.  Parents cannot just put this matter aside and say it is not their responsibility.  They have to be made more responsible and more aware of where their juvenile and teenage sons and daughters are at any time. They should know exactly what they are doing.  This should be part of the education process as well.</P>
    <P>This whole question has to be addressed. It is a problem that is not new, but if it is not tackled soon it is going to grow to gigantic proportions.  I am sure the Minister does not want to see that happening. I would be looking for a special task force, probably consisting of the Ministers for Labour, Education and, obviously, Justice and Social Welfare, to examine the problem and to report back.</P>
    <P>Many of these people may come from socially deprived backgrounds but they can be put on the straight and narrow and kept on the straight and narrow if the right approach is made, if the matter is dealt with initially in a correct way, but there has to be intervention.  I would say to the Minister present that I accept that some of the matters I have mentioned would not be the responsibility of the Minister for Education.  However, in relation to the whole question of Cabinet co-responsibility, I am sure the Minister is well aware from various areas of her work in the Department of Education that a certain educational response has to be given.  One area I would draw to the Minister's attention is in relation to extra funding for remedial teaching for people who, if they are not given that extra assistance at that stage, are going to drift off the straight and narrow and get into petty thievery, muggings, car taking and so on.  It is a problem the Minister and her colleagues have to address now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="957" /> I look forward to the Minister's positive response to the matters I have mentioned. I repeat that it is necessary for district justices to be dealt with in a more forthright way by Departments.  I do not think it is necessarily the responsibility of the Minister's Department but I would ask that she would pass it on to her colleague and find out why a simple request from a district justice was not responded to.  It is a scandal that such a situation should have arisen.</P>

I think that any debate in the Seanad is worthy of serious consideration; it is not worthy of the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements which were made for such a debate this morning.  It is not fair to the person who puts down the motion; it is not fair to a Department and it is not fair to somebody who must come in to answer.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an extremely odd way to do one's business.  I am very glad to be here.  I have never refused an invitation to this House.  I am a former Member of it, I treat it with great respect and with great decorum and that is the <Col N="959" /> reason I am making my complaint.  It is for no other reason but that.  The matter raised by Senator Cosgrave is a serious matter which warrants very serious consideration. It is a matter to which I am glad to respond on behalf of myself and my colleagues in Government.  It did not deserve such <i>ad hoc</i> treatment.</P>
      <P>There are at present four centres for juvenile offenders committed by the courts.  Trinity House in Lusk provides secure accommodation for up to 30 boys. Finglas Children's Centre comprises St. Michael's Assessment Centre for about 20 boys on remand and St. Lawrences's Special School for approximately 55 long-stay boys, most of whom are committed by the courts, St. Joseph's Special School in Clonmel has accommodation for 75 boys, about 60 per cent of whom would be committed through the courts.  There is one centre for girls, Oberstown Remand and Assessment Centre in Lusk, which has eight places for girls under 17 years of age.</P>
      <P>The increasing frequency with which young offenders are appearing before our courts &mdash; and I agree with many of the sentiments the Senator has expressed &mdash; on serious charges and attracting custodial sentences is of course a matter of serious concern.  Indeed, it was in response to this development and the resultant need to provide adequate and suitable places to acommodate such cases that the Government decided to establish an interdepartmental group to consider ways of addressing this problem.  It certainly is a growing one and one which attracts concern across all strata of political thought and the wider community. One of the recommendations to come from that group was that additional permanent accommodation be provided for both boys and girls to supplement existing facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have taken urgent action is following up this recommendation and arrangements are currently being made to bring new facilities <Col N="960" /> on stream.  The focus is on providing extra places for both boys and girls dealt with by the courts.  Arrangements are already well advanced for the refurbishment of a major part of the former Scoil Ard Mhuire in Lusk.  Indeed, might I say that Scoil Ard Mhuire was closed in 1985 and I remember being in Opposition in Education at the time and protesting most vigorously at its closure.  As I said, it is being refurbished with a view to providing an additional eight places for girls on an interim basis and 36 places for boys. The necessary site work is well advanced and steps have now been taken to recruit staff, both educational and custodial, for this centre.  The additional accommodation will be available from September of this year.  The Senator might have noticed that the advertisements for the educational staff were inserted in the papers by County Dublin VEC on last Sunday week.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the reason why the accommodation for girls is on an interim basis is that a new purpose-built school for 20 girls is being planned and should be completed by 1993, to be located adjacent to the existing Finglas Children's Centre.  Eight of the 20 places to be provided will be for girls on remand for assessment and the remaining 12 places will provide long term accommodation. Consultants have been appointed for the project and the preparation of detailed plans is proceeding as a matter of urgency.  It will be appreciated that the nature and the purpose of this new school will be such that it must be very carefully planned.  There are 36 places being provided for boys and these will be further supplemented when the new centre for girls at Finglas becomes available and the girls' units in Ard Mhuire become vacant as a result.  That will allow for more young boys.</P>
    <P>In regard to the security aspects of all of the institutions at Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin, a detailed assessment of existing and future custodial features and requirements is being carried out at <Col N="961" /> present under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Justice.  I am satisfied that satisfactory security arrangements will be in place when it opens in September. The number of offenders referred to by the courts from time to time for secure detention varies considerably and may at times exceed the institutional capacity available.  I am satisfied that the 44 additional places to be provided at Lusk in September will make a significant contribution to relieving the existing pressure for places for young offenders.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that the development of a more effective system of caring for youngsters who require secure containment is high on the list of Government priorities.  The extra accommodation being provided and the recent assignment to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Chris Flood, of the task of co-ordinating the efforts of the Departments most involved in this area &mdash; Education, Health and Justice &mdash; are clear indications of the Government's commitments to tackling this problem.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave said that Justice Wine had written to the Department of Education and had received no reply, a rather serious statement.  I have just sent out somebody to telephone the Department and the word I got back &mdash; it may not be fully researched because all this had to be done very speedily &mdash; is that there is no record in the Department of Education of a recent letter received from Justice Wine.  They had started their search fo it.  Of course, we will be ringing Justice Wine and asking for a copy of the letter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>For the record, I did not say it was definitely the Minister's Department; I said it was one of the Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no record in the Department of Education of a letter received from Justice Wine, but we will <Col N="962" /> carry out an exhaustive search to see if it has arrived.  Certainly, anybody who writes to me receives a reply.  It may not be the reply they wish to get of course.  I take it Senator Cosgrave is not exactly precise on the point.</P>
      <P>Senator Cosgrave raised other timely matters with regard to a remedial curative approach prior to young people getting into trouble and which were of particular relevance to my Department. He spoke about the junior liaison officers.  I will pass that on to my colleague, the Minister for Justice.  He then touched on the matter of remedial teachers and asked for extra funding in that regard.  I can say that this year, beginning in September, there will be 80 extra teachers, which in one fell swoop is more than what had been allocated in the previous five years.  It is not enough, but it is a great start.  Secondly, I instituted last year by psychological service for primary schools in two pilot areas, in the Clondalkin area and an area in south Tipperary. The service will be in operation in these areas for three years and then nationwide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, there is home school liaison link scheme and this might be the one that would be of most benefit to young people and to their parents.  Last year we started a very successful home school liaison link scheme whereby teachers are appointed to a school or a group of schools but they do not teach in the classrooms; they do home visitations, talk to parents, talk to pupils, get parents interested in what is going on at school, get pupils interested.  That scheme extends at the moment to 55 schools and this September it will be extended to 80 schools.  The scheme is proving to be very successful and fruitful but, again, as in all these matters, the road is long and hard. I am strongly of the opinion that it is steps such as these, prior to young people &ldquo;going wrong&rdquo;, that are the steps that need to be taken.  Of course, they have to be taken for young people who get <Col N="963" /> into trouble and they are the steps I have outlined here.</P>
    <P>Justice Wine is a very caring person.  I have read all of his comments and always follow what he says in the papers.  He has the good of the country at heart in what he is saying.  There is no doubt about that.  He is at the coalface, where it is happening every day.  Custodial-educational measures must be put in place. I have insisted that the greater number of places must be accompanied by a proper educational programme.  Then there are the other early intervention processes <Col N="964" /> whereby young people who through no fault of their own &mdash; perhaps through the environment in which they are being brought up &mdash; are not going to get as good a chance in life as other people and they will have extra help available for themselves and their parents.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Cosgrave for raising this matter.  I again put it on the record that I am very glad at any time to come to this House.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 11.25 a.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 19 June 1991.</P>
