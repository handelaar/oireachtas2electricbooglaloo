      <P>I have notice from Senator Naughten that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance, to make moneys available for the cleaning of the Shannon from Shannonbridge to Melick Weir, in view of the very severe flooding in the Shannon Valley catchment area.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to include the coast road between Limerick and Tarbert, the N69, for investment under the Operational Programme for Peripherality.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Naughten and Neville as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Naughten's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Neville may give notice another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, I am astonished that for the third week in a row there will be no Private Member's Business.  As I understand it, the Labour Party motion has been ruled out of order by the Cathaoirleach on the grounds that it already appeared in the last six months.  It strikes me as very strange that, in relation to a matter of great public importance and concern, some way cannot be found to have this debated.  I am sure there will be a row today if it is not accepted.  I am astonished that it has not been possible to find some way of re-wording the motion, putting it in a different way, so that the substance could be debated here today.  In anticipation of what will be said, I ask the Leader of the House to reconsider the ordering of Private Member's time &mdash; the Labour Party's hour and a half this evening &mdash; and that attempts be made to find a way in which this matter of great public importance can be debated, to find a form of words which makes it possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make precisely the same point.  It is disgraceful that for a third week in a row Private Members' time has been ruled out by the Standing Order on repetition.  I understand that you work on the basis of the Standing Order, a Chathaoirligh, but would it not be true to say that this is a specific set of proposals on a matter which was discussed before?  We are going to discuss beef this afternoon.  That matter has been discussed here regularly before, although not in the specific terms.  If we take this question of repetition to its ultimate, any matter that has been referred to, even in a passing way, within a period of six months is suddenly ruled out for discussion.  We had a debate on education last week.  We have a commitment from the Leader of the House that there would be discussion on education in each session <Col N="347" /> of the House.  That could well be within six months; yet nobody would consider it to be repetition as such, nor would the Leader of the House himself.</P>
      <P>I put it to the House that this is a Private Members' matter, a very certain set of proposals, a very detailed and direct motion, and I appeal to the Leader to find a way of allowing this matter to be discussed.  I will not go into its content but it is of concern to all of us on all sides of the House.  I am not saying there is any monopoly of concern on this side, but I am concerned that this Standing Order has been interpreted in order to deprive the House of Private Members' Time on three weeks in a row.  It is not good enough and it is no way to order business.  I particularly put it to the Leader of the House that, in the context of the very full co-operation that has been available to the Government side all through this session, this is not much to ask.  We discussed our own business here in a very tight atmosphere&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, Senator, I have been very fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just put it through you, a Chathaoirligh, to the Leader of the House that in the context of the very full co-operation that has been always available this is a motion which should be discussed as a matter of grave concern to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it totally inexplicable that this motion is not acceptable. I know the general tone of the matter is being repetitious, but it is a number of months since this matter was discussed.  We have had debates on education and on agriculture in the meantime, and certainly the rigid rule on repetition has not been strictly implemented in that respect over a six-month period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter of national importance and the Leader of the House should consider that.  It is a matter that concerns both town and country.  It concerns the loss of approximately 1,500 jobs; 550 post <Col N="348" /> offices are threatened with closure.  The entire sorting office in Sheriff Street is to be closed down and overall it has implications for the entire country.  It will not be possible, certainly for the Labour Party, to put forward a motion of this nature until well into the autumn &mdash; we are talking about ten to 11 months &mdash; so that is away beyond the rule of the six-month period.  I appeal to the Leader of the House to consider the issues that are expressed here in general terms and the issues that are expressed in specific terms of sufficient national importance that he would reconsider allowing this Private Members' motion to be debated at the appropriate time.  It would be very bad for the status of the House if we were to go three weeks in a row and find that motions of considerable moment were ruled out of order simply on the basis that there might be an element of repetition in them.  I appeal to the Leader of the House to reconsider the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I would like to raise with the Leader of the House the increased bank charges which were announced yesterday, which we can describe as scandalous and brutal. One of our colleagues in the other House referred last week to a certain bird of prey.  The Allied Irish Banks released the vultures yesterday.  All of us here would support the request by the Minister for Finance to the Central Bank.  If that does not bring us a certain result I would ask him to call for an inquiry into charges by the banking groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me first of all thank the Leader of the House for his courtesy in making available to me copies of the relevant sections of the Criminal Justice Act, which I have made available to my colleagues, to facilitate discussion this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me also say that I understand that of course the Cathaoirleach's ruling is quite correct within the guidelines of the House, but it does underline to my mind the fact that the very rules themselves seriously need attention.  One cannot <Col N="349" /> blame the Cathaoirleach but the rules are incorrect.</P>
    <P>Could I finally ask whether there is any significance in the fact that an item that was on the Order Paper yesterday, and has not been discussed, has disappeared &mdash; the regulations under the Control of Dogs Act?  Does this have something to do with the erroneous inclusion of bulldogs?</P>
    <P>I have been contacted by a constituent who tells me that bulldogs by their nature are very gentle, placid and docile, eminently suitable for families with children because of their utter reliability, even though their physical appearance belies this.  They are affectionate and absolutely useless as watchdogs because of their affectionate nature.  Finally, my correspondent hopes that this error will be brought to the attention of the Department of the Environment especially as, she says, she will not even be able to comply with the law given that bulldogs have no snout and therefore cannot physically be muzzled.  Perhaps the Leader would be able to tell me whether or not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not a snoutless muzzle, I am afraid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleagues that we will have to sort out this question of repetition; otherwise Private Members' Time is going to become a lottery where we do not even know the precedent under which the word &ldquo;repetition&rdquo; is interpreted.  We will have to sort it out so that first of all, we can discuss things that are urgent and, secondly, so that we can be reasonably certain one week that in the following week we will be able to discuss them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say too, that I agree fully with Senator Cosgrave &mdash; and it is not often I say that &mdash; on the question of the banks.  I have to agree with my colleague, Senator O'Toole, that there are obviously people, however well influenced in Fine Gael, who have not forgotten the background from which they came.  They are directing them towards the high pinnacles of the <Col N="350" /> financial market.  It is a matter of concern. I think Eoin Harris's influence can be seen in this new concession to the banks.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House could we discuss the question of the banks?  I have an increasingly large file from industry, in particular, about the appalling nature of the banks.  The fact is that they are a virtual duopoly which rips off small business and small consumers and need to be dealt with.  They behave in a disgraceful fashion.  They put charges on people's bills without so much as a bill.  They do things that other people could not do.  I think we should have a serious debate on the operation of the banking system, not in any ideological fashion &mdash; I am not interested in that &mdash; but simply to put on the record of this House with the relevant Government Minister the appalling way in which the dice is loaded by the banks against their customers.  I would ask the Leader to do that as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the request that has been made by a number of Senators concerning item No. 52.  I appeal to the Leader of the House to ensure that some discussions take place, the result of which will enable a debate to take place within the terms of what has been referred to here.  I do that for a number of reasons, one of them being that there is a widespread belief that the fears being expressed here, or the options being threatened, are simply being postponed until the local elections are over. Therefore it is important, if only to give the lie to that, that the opportunity be provided for a discussion on the issues.  I join in the appeal to the Leader of the House to endeavour to make whatever arrangements are necessary to enable the House to discuss this matter in Private Members' Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also support the request by Senator Cosgrave, supported by a number of other Senators, to the Leader of the House to endeavour to ensure that time will be made available for a discussion on the recent increase in bank charges by the AIB Group and on banking in general <Col N="351" /> in so far as attitude, terms, restrictions and charges apply to the business community and, indeed, to private borrowers as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the signatories to item No. 52 I would like to support my colleagues, Senator Costello, and the other Senators who have asked the Leader of the House to reconsider the question of having this Private Members' motion on the agenda for today.  It is a matter of grave concern throughout the country, especially in rural Ireland.  Like Senator Howard, as a rural Senator I would be concerned that there may be a delayed action aspect in this and that we may be in a position to have it on the first Wednesday in July, which could be possibly too late for many people.</P>

      <P>I want to point out to the House &mdash; and I have been particularly fair in relation to allowing comment to be made on item No. 52 &mdash; that my decision has been taken and I will not allow further debate on this matter. Everybody has made his point sufficiently. It is not the Leader of the House who decides on whether this motion is allowed or not.  I have adhered to Standing Order No. 42.  I am quite satisfied that the decision I made is correct, that this matter has been sufficiently discussed when the motion was down earlier this year and what is proposed to be discussed now is being placed on the Order Paper within six months.  That is in contravention of Standing Order No. 42.  It is my decision and not the decision of the Leader of the House.</P>

Standing Order No. 27 states that a motion may be amended by the Cathaoirleach with the consent of the Senator.  Standing Order No. 25 mentions a shorter period for the acceptance of notice of motion.  We, as a party, are not afraid of the Private Members' motion from the Labour Party.</P>

    <Title>Tribunal of Inquiry into Beef Processing Industry: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that a Tribunal be established for&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  Inquiring into the following definite matters of urgent public importance:</P>
      <P>(i)  allegations regarding illegal activities, fraud and malpractice in and in connection with the beef processing industry made or referred to</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> (a)  in Dáil Éirann, and</P>
    <P>(b)  on a television programme transmitted by ITV on 13 May, 1991;</P>
    <P>(ii)  any matters connected with or relevant to the matters aforesaid which the tribunal considers it neccessary to investigate in connection with its inquiries into the matters mentioned at (i) above;</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>2.  making such recommendations (if any) as the tribunal having regard to its findings, think proper.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore the importance of the beef sector to the food and agriculture industry in this country.  Thousands of people, farmers, factory workers and many others make their livelihood from this industry.  The allegations made by the ITV television programme and in Dáil Éireann by some of the Opposition parties were very serious and could cause major damage to the beef industry. Whatever about the intentions of the television programme, the allegations made by the Opposition Deputies were more about attempting to discredit the Government over the affairs of the Goodman companies.  I am certain that was the case.</P>
    <P>The whole basis of the attack by Opposition parties was by innuendo and association to give the electorate the impression that Mr. Goodman and his companies enjoyed almost a unique relationship with the Fianna Fáil Government of 1987 to 1989 and therefore to throw, as it were, a smoke screen over or to hide a close relationship with the Coalition partners of Labour and Fine Gael from 1982 to 1987 which was protected. This is what the exercise was about.  After last week's Dáil debate, we all know that nothing could be further from the truth.  The Official Report of the Dáil shows this, and we all know it now.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil debate among a number of issues pointed out by the Taoiseach was the fact that one of the first decisions <Col N="368" /> made by the Fine Gael-Labour Government of 1982 to 1987, in December 1982 was to grant export credit insurance to Anglo-Irish Meats Limited and six months later a general scheme was introduced for export credit insurance in respect of trade to Iraq.  The main, or possibly the only, beneficiaries of that exercise was Mr. Goodman's exporting companies.  In February 1984, the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, went to Iran with Mr. Goodman to secure an £80 million contract and in the following year he went to Egypt to secure a contract.  In 1986 the Fine Gael-Labour Government doubled export credit insurance to Iraq and we know of luncheons and of meetings and trips across the world between the then Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, his Ministers and Mr. Goodman.  The list is endless.</P>
    <P>I make these points to demonstrate that it was not the Fianna Fáil Government but the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government who gave Mr. Goodman and his company the very favoured position they now hold.  What I found striking in the Dáil debate last Friday and since then is that there has been no attempt by any of the parties in the Dáil to disprove the facts outlined so positively by the Taoiseach in the Dáil debate.  While it was rightly acknowledged that a Government act in the national interest, the depth and the extent of the relationship between Mr. Goodman and the Coalition Fine Gael-Labour Government of 1982 to 1987 was well and truly recorded.  The Taoiseach set the record straight once and for all.  We will have a judicial inquiry into allegations about Goodman and other meat industry issues and the chairman will be Mr. Justice Hamilton who deserves full support.  I wish the tribunal well in its work and those who have made allegations have a duty to come forward now as witnesses.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the Goodman debate in the Dáil must have astounded many people.  We pride ourselves in this country on the tradition of integrity and loyalty to the State, that has always been a hallmark of the Irish Civil Service.  That sense of layalty and professional trust <Col N="369" /> prevailed right through the history of the State and was maintained even in the bitter and highly partisan atmosphere that prevailed in the decades following the Civil War.  It has always been a point of honour with civil servants that they loyally serve the Administration chosen by the people.  Judging by the Goodman debate it would seem that some few individuals, and I want to make it clear that they are very few indeed, in some areas of the Civil Service have demeaned themselves by abandoning that tradition. Opposition Deputies have apparently been provided with confidential information by officials which should properly be given through normal channels to their superior officers whose duty it would be to judge its accuracy and what appropriate action might be required.</P>
    <P>Let me spell out the rules under which civil servants have operated since the establishment of the State. The obligations on civil servants, and retired civil servants in relation to official secrecy, are provided for in section 4 of the Official Secrets Act, 1963.  Under the Act each civil servant is prohibited from communicating any official information unless he is authorised to do so in the course of and in accordance with his official duties as the holder of a public office.  The duties of civil servants in this regard are set out in a circular which is drawn to the specific attention of all new recruits to the Civil Service and which, because of its importance to the proper functioning of public bodies, they are required to confirm in writing that they have read.  The requirement on civil servants not to divulge matters which come to their knowledge in the course of their official duties applies to all items, regardless of whether they are under current consideration or discussion or whether decisions have already been taken.</P>
    <P>Disclosure of official secrets is totally incompatible with the high standards of integrity demanded of civil servants.  The seriousness of this matter is reflected by the fact that any person who contravenes the Official Secrets Act is deemed to be guilty of an offence under that Act and <Col N="370" /> anyone convicted of such an offence is liable to a fine and or imprisonment.  Civil servants by virtue of their position come into possession of information which may be commercially valuable or which individuals are compelled to communicate to Departments on the basis that it will not be disclosed to other parties.</P>
    <P>The requirement of secrecy imposed on civil servants is fundamental for the protection of citizens' rights but instead of abiding by these rules these individuals seem to have established a tell-tattle telegraph to The Labour Party and The Workers' Party.  I do not know which is the more reprehensible; these tale bearers who disregard the obligation of their office or the politicians who encourage them to do so.  Deputy Spring has been a member of Government; he was Tánaiste from 1982 to 1987.  Does he endorse this code of conduct for public servants?  How would he react if, as a member of Government, he found an official in a position of trust, reporting regularly to the Opposition and providing it with information he did not have?  As far as The Workers' Party Deputies are concerned, I suppose we have to give some little credit; the legacy of the Marxist tradition of subversion, endemic treachery and institutionalised betrayal of colleagues still colours their judgment on matters like this.</P>
    <P>Deputies who tried to use confidential information in the Dáil in an attempt to smear the Government now have an opportunity to get these people to come forward and substantiate their information before the tribunal.  This is more than an opportunity; in my opinion it is a clear obligation.  If those who sneaked around to meet Opposition Deputies in the dead of night are not willing to stand up in the light of day, we can then judge the value of their information and the motives of those who broadcast it under the privilege of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the behaviour of this House.  I have only had experience of one other House where 518 Members transacted business in nine different languages and we were <Col N="371" /> able to set the Order of Business for the day in less than ten minutes each morning.  This House should either be reformed or abolished.  The last hour and a half spent on the Order of Business was a waste of both Members' time and taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>The motion before us is important because the beef sector is exceedingly important to our economy.  Agricultural exports contribute no less than 40 to 42 per cent of net exports and beef is the largest single item in that.  It is important not only that we do our business properly but that we are seen to do it properly and that we are seen to maintain the good name of Irish produce and of Irish traders. This inquiry hinges around alleged fraud and other unacceptable acts by a particular company built up largely by one person.  Members of my family have been very friendly with Larry Goodman and his wife, Kitty, for many years but that is not going to deter me from saying what I want to say.  The researcher for the programme, Miss O'Keeffe, is a past student of mine, a graduate in food science from UCC, whom I believe, did the job honestly.  She was a competent and hard working girl when I knew her.</P>
      <P>What is the inquiry going to achieve? I hope it will get to the truth but an inquiry is only as good as the integrity of the people giving evidence.  We know from past experience that a judge of the High Court commented to two Ministers giving conflicting evidence: &ldquo;One of you is perjuring yourself&rdquo;.  All the truth may not emerge due to lack of integrity on the part of people giving evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a number of questions to ask about this business which grew from nothing to become the largest processor of beef in the European Community in a relatively short period of time.  Most of the growth occured by acquiring plants at a knock down price.  It has to be said of Mr. Goodman that he performed miracles in getting some of these plants back into action, getting rid of restricted practices imposed by trade unions and improving efficiency and output.  It should also be said that promises he gave <Col N="372" /> to build new plants, particularly in Ardee, in 1977 and subsequently in Tuam, were not fulfilled.  I see he is at it again, in this case acquiring the Ballybay meat plant, a new plant which cost between £5 million and £6 million to build.  Most of the money was contributed by European and Irish taxpayers and he is reported to have got it for the knock down price of £1 million.  The events that led up to that sale for £1 million, involving disturbances and picketing which prevented serious buyers from going in to the plant, were very disturbing.</P>
    <P>I was concerned about the monopoly situation which had arisen in the beef sector and I raised it in the European Parliament in the spring of 1988, towards the end of Commissioner Sutherland's period as Commissioner.  The Commissioner was responsible for competition. I raised the question of the dominant position of Goodman in the beef processing sector in Ireland to which Commissioner Sutherland replied, &ldquo;If I get a complaint about this position from the Government, or from the producers, I will take action&rdquo;.  But, alas, no complaint arrived.  The farmers were made fully aware of Mr. Sutherland's answer and I suggest, with all due respect to farm leaders, that they were reluctant to take on Mr. Goodman because he collected for them the levies which kept their organisation going.</P>
    <P>I am not going to suggest why the Government did not take action but the State was left in a very vulnerable position with so much of our most important export in the hands of one individual.  I ask what all the fanfare was about when Mr. Goodman's famous plan of £250 million expansion in the beef processing sector was brought before the press by no less a body than the Taoiseach?  We had 60 per cent surplus capacity already in the beef industry so why did we want an extra £250 million expansion?  At the time I suggested that the exercise had more to do with politics for the Taoiseach and with building up Mr. Goodman's credibility with the international bankers than with the good of the beef industry. Subsequent events suggest that he and <Col N="373" /> the country would have been better off if his credibility had not been built up and if he had not secured hundreds of millions of pounds which he then gambled on the stock market.  I know that the IDA were very concerned and attended that particular launch very reluctantly.  I am informed that the entire board at one stage threatened to resign over this grant to expand an industry that already had a surplus processing capacity.</P>
    <P>Why did we have to save the Goodman organisation from the liquidator?  What did that achieve?  The plant would still be there as there were plenty of buyers around willing to buy sections of it.  It had processing capacity in plenty.  There was no obligation on us to save Anglo-Irish beef processors in order to save the beef industry.  We have now landed ourselves in a situation where the beef industry will be paying the banks, and Goodman will have to make £90 million profit per year in order to ensure that the banks get back the money they gave in unsecured loans.</P>
    <P>This is a travesty of justice &mdash; that a man could go and gamble the money he got on unsecured loans on the Stock Exchange and that beef producers who were making little or no money in recent years should have to foot the bill.  Effectively, the only way Mr. Goodman can make £90 million profit per year is to pay less to the beef farmers than the cattle are worth and his dominant position allows him to dictate the price.</P>
    <P>Why did Mr. Goodman get such special concessions in regard to tax from the Government?  If I owed tax I would not only have to pay every shilling of it but pay interest on it as well.  Mr. Goodman got a concession of £4 million from the Revenue Commissioners. Forget about interest on back payments &mdash; just let the man off with 50 per cent of the tax bill he owed.  That must surely make the ordinary citizen, strapped with PAYE bill, bitter and cynical about politics and cynical about the way in which this country does its business.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon catalogued the relationship between the Fine Gael-Labour Government and Mr. Goodman and I have no doubt they were doing business <Col N="374" /> in the normal way.  It is well known that middle eastern countries such as Iran, Iraq and Egypt, particularly Iran and Iraq, only do business Government to Government and not with individuals.  If Deputy Deasy, on behalf of the Government, accompanied Mr. Goodman to Iran to get £80 million worth of business then that is fine with me if there was no other way we could sell it.  But I understood that the export credits were removed before the Coalition Government left office and restored as soon as Deputy Haughey's minority Government went into office.  They were removed again as soon as Deputy Haughey had to go into Government with the Progressive Democrats.  It is not quite accurate on Senator Fallon's part to say that Mr. Goodman got equal treatment from the Coalition Government before 1977 and from the Fianna Fáil Government after the election in 1977.</P>
    <P>Mr. Goodman is a very capable, able, ambitious and ruthless businessman who has been known to use threats, blackmail and bribes to get what he wants.  I know one person whom he threatened that he would reveal aspects of his private life if he did not drop a charge of dishonest dealing that he was taking against Mr. Goodman.  That person is a man of outstanding integrity and has told me his story more than once and I am prepared to believe him.  It is disturbing also to hear stories of presents to officials.  I cannot prove it in Dublin but I can prove that in Brussels presents were brought, unashamedly, to officials and in some cases were returned on the spot.  It is reported that certain officials from Brussels had the use of Mr. Goodman's helicopter when going on business trips. These matters are disturbing and it is also rather disturbing that a former Secretary of the Department of Agriculture is now on Mr. Goodman's payroll.  In the United States they have a law which prohibits a member of the Cabinet from taking up jobs in certain sectors of the economy for a number of years after they leave their job in the administration.  There is probably a necessity for a similar law here.</P>
    <P>If we are really serious about this <Col N="375" /> inquiry and want to get at the truth, then we should do what is done in other countries. At the moment the decision is made to have the inquiry, the police should move in and seal all documents, records and so on.  As so much time has now elapsed all the records could have been shredded, altered or replaced.  I do not believe we are serious about getting at the truth, if we were we would take that course of action.</P>
    <P>In relation to fraud in general, and getting away from Mr. Goodman's performance, it is my belief that fraud is now endemic in the European Community, and particularly in the CAP.  I have an article from two academics, Ann Sherlock a lecturer in law in Aberystwyth and Christopher Harding, a senior lecturer in law, also in Aberystwyth.  It is a very revealing article, about controlling fraud within the European Community.  As it is a long article I cannot go through it all but I would like to read some parts of it. In relation to beef it states:</P>
    <P>In the beef sector, for example, the world is divided into 11 different zones, with different rates of refund for each zone.  Different kinds of beef attract different rates of refund (for instance, a higher rate for chilled than for frozen beef).  Thus, by false declarations as to the class of meat being exported or as to its country of destination, an exporter may obtain higher refunds than he is entitled to.  Combining this practice with false declarations as regards imports may be especially profitable.  One example of this involved the situation in which a trader over a period of two years imported prime beef from South America, described as offal in order to evade import levies, and then exported offal under the description of prime beef so as to collect refunds.  These irregular transactions amounted to something in the region of 16 million ECU.</P>
    <P>That was according to the Court of Auditors. I contracted the Court of Auditors but they would not release the name of the person, the factory or business <Col N="376" /> involved.  They never do, it is not their way of doing business but that is not the best way of stopping fraud either.  It is perhaps stretching things to say it might be Mr. Goodman who was involved but he did have a business in South America at the time.  The article goes on:</P>
    <P>A Court of Auditors investigation into public intervention storage in six Member States discovered inadequate independent physical stocktaking and quality control arrangements.  MCA frauds have also occured &mdash; through evasion of MCA charges or wrongful recipt of subsidies...</P>
    <P>It goes on to say that the MCA matter was rather small by comparison with the export refunds, reclassification and reboxing of meat and so on.  This article goes on to deal with the obstacles to legal control and it states:</P>
    <P>At a general level there would appear to be one overriding factor which accounts for the more specific deficiencies in legal control, which have now been identified by a number of inquiries, such as those regularly carried out by the Court of Auditors. That factor is the basic division between policy and administration which devolves virtually all responsibility for implementing policy in this area to Member State agencies.  Customs and agricultural levies are collected, and export refunds are paid out, by national customs authorities, such as H.M. Customs and Excise in the United Kingdom.  Intervention payments are the responsibility of national bodies, such as the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce within the United Kingdom. This system is established by the Community, amounts are set by the Community, but then the whole is put into effect by the authorities of the various Member States.  Clearly this is the only sensible and practicable method at the present stage of integration, yet this dichotomy of function contains the seeds of the problem under discussion here.  The Member State agencies do not necessarily possess the same <Col N="377" /> interest in enforcement of Community rules and achievement of Community policy as the Community institutions (indeed they may be receptive to opposing interests.</P>
    <P>It lists the problems about control of fraud and the different factors which make it difficult to control fraud, (a) a lack of information; (b) inadequate surveillance; (c) insufficient co-operation and lack of political will; (d) procedural complexities and (e) division of responsibility for enforcement.  Ireland has not been specifically named but some countries have and certainly in relation to resources put into it, Greece comes out very badly.  For instance, at another point in the report it states:</P>
    <P>It can be seen from these reports, for instance, that as regards allocation of staff the numbers ranged widely from one controller per every three million ECU of expenditure (in Denmark) to one controller per every 140 million ECU (in Greece).  Then again, in some Member States staff received formal training (Germany, the United Kingdom) but not in others (Greece).</P>
    <P>It is a disturbing scenario, it is rife with abuse and fraud.  There is fraud throughout the Community.  We have to be careful that we are not now lumped in with countries from southern Europe who seem to have a total disregard for implementing the rules drawn up in Brussels and that they themselves have signed.  In Italy according to a survey carried out by a respectable international consultancy company there, and published in <i>The Economist</i> three years ago, roughly 70 per cent, or in excess of 70 per cent, of all animal drugs on the market are now off the black market.  Indeed, it is reckoned by some people that the Mafia now have a bigger income from the illegal market in growth promoters than they have from cocaine.</P>
    <P>There is much to be concerned about in the whole operation of the CAP but, be that as it may, we must clear our name; we must not only be clean as far as our dealings are concerned but we must be <Col N="378" /> seen to be clean.  I welcome this inquiry. I hope it will come up with the facts.  I hope that things are not as bad as they are portrayed but I am afraid there is no smoke without fire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House this morning.  I apologise to him for the amount of time which was wasted and the way he was held up.  The events reflected very badly on us but they are not the subject of this debate and I will not dwell on them.</P>
      <P>I welcome the motion before us and the establishment of the tribunal of inquiry into these very serious matters.  I also welcome the terms of the motion, the remit which is being given to the tribunal and I welcome the appointment of Mr. Justice Hamilton who will conduct the inquiry.  I wish him well in his endeavours to get at the truth in what will be a very complex and convoluted trial.</P>
      <P>It is important to put this matter into context and the context is that 40 pence in every pound of our net exports derives from food.  A third of the people employed here are either in the food sector, in farming or in activities related to those sectors.  That is the national significance of the matter and that is why it is imperative to move to protect the good name of Irish food of the processing industry and of Irish farming.</P>
      <P>I am confident that at the end of the trial which the judge will have to investigate, the credibility of the industry on which so many people depend, will have been established.  I do not subscribe to the view that damage has not been done by what was contained in the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme or by the allegations made in the Dáil.  Damage was done and now there is an onus on us all, in this House, in Government and in the country to ensure that the credibility of our food industry is restored because on that credibility lies the future welfare of the industry; indeed the welfare of the country will increasingly depend on it as Common Agricultural Policy reform proceeds and as intervention accounts for less of the market that is available for agricultural produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="379" /> In relation to the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme and the allegations contained in it, I certainly found the tone of the programme distasteful.  The portrayal was lurid, it was tabloid in form. However, that does not take from the substance of the allegations made in that programme and their seriousness.  What added most significantly to the seriousness with which the allegations were made was that, to my knowledge, it was the first time a former employee of the Goodman organisation had been so specific and so detailed in relation to allegations about malpractice within the company.  That was why the programme was so damaging.  Certainly efforts were made to discredit the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme but those efforts to discredit it do not stand up, particularly in an Irish context, given that that telvision programme, more than any other, was responsible for the freeing of the Birmingham Six.  ITV and &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; had no need to establish their credentials in this matter, even though I agree that the manner in which some of the matters were presented were certainly distasteful.</P>
    <P>Other very serious allegations were made in the Dáil and that is the reason we needed an inquiry.  Questions arise as to whether other vehicles could have been used to establish the truth.  In my view, and in the view of my party, there was no other vehicle and the reason I say that is that I do not know of any other procedure which would compel people to appear, to give evidence and to produce documents.  That was at the heart of the matter and that was the reason a tribunal of this nature had to be established.  I do not believe there are any other options and it was the only satisfactory way to attempt to uncover the truth.</P>
    <P>The scope of the inquiry should not be so wide as to drag it on interminably and not to arrive at any firm conclusions.  The scope is wide enough to allow the chairman of the inquiry to investigate matters which he feels are relevant; it is a matter for him as to how he conducts the inquiry and I have no problem with that.  It needs <Col N="380" /> to be wide enough to give him that scope but if it goes off in every direction there is every possibility that nothing will be achieved in the end, apart from being extremely costly.  There is an onus to act speedily in the matter but, having said that, not so speedily as not to be able to attempt to establish the truth.  The simple objective of the inquiry is to establish to the degree that is possible the truth in relation to those matters.  That is what is involved in restoring credibility to the industry and in rectifying whatever damage was done.</P>
    <P>It is important to say &mdash; and it is something I have not heard &mdash; that the person who goes into the supermarket or who buys meat over the butcher's counter here or in Britain is buying beef of the very highest quality.  It is not beef that is contaminated by illegal growth promoters; it is by and large heifer beef, not the sort of beef we were shown on the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme which was reboxed or was in cold storage for 13 years or whatever.  It is fresh, good, wholesome beef and it is not the same beef that is the subject of this inquiry. That is something that needs to be said because there is a certain amount of confusion about the matter.  People are buying beef in the belief that it has been in intervention cold stores for years and years and years; of course it has not.</P>
    <P>There have been reservations expressed as to the cost to the taxpayer of establishing an inquiry of this nature and that it could cost several million pounds.  My reply to that would be that we have an industry that is worth many millions of pounds to establish the industry as a credible and wholesome one, I regard that as money very well spent.  It would be just like spending money on marketing and it would be money well spent.  The very fact of establishing the inquiry, irespective of its outcome, will help to restore the confidence of the buyers of Irish beef in Britain and elsewhere.  It was quite significant that on the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme recently one of the executives of a large British supermarket chain buying Irish beef made the point <Col N="381" /> that it was helpful to them in their relationship with the Irish people from whom they were buying the beef, they could tell their customers the matter is being taken very seriously in Ireland and that the Government are serious about re-establishing the credibility of the industry.</P>
    <P>It is also regrettable that over the past few years people at many levels in this country, some of them at very senior levels, have been saying we should stay quiet.  I have been on platforms from Cork to Donegal and I have heard prominent people in the agricultural sector saying we should not talk about illegal growth hormones, about angel dust, or about defrauding the EC, that we should keep quiet about these things.  I have even heard people say that it is anti-national to discuss those matters, that is a very curious and perverted sort of logic. I cannot understand that sort of logic because as we proceed with the CAP reform &mdash; and as we have seen even in the price package, which was arrived at in Brussels &mdash; intervention will no longer be the market.</P>
    <P>We will have to go out and sell our products on the international marketplace in Europe and elsewhere.  The prize for Irish food, for agriculture and for Irish farming is enormous.  We are dealing with a market of 350 million people and any multinational company going into that market would be very disappointed if it could not increase its market share by 1 or 2 per cent.  If we, as a country, were to increase our market share of that lucrative European market by 1 or 2 per cent there would be immense national benefits.  That is the significance of the matter we are dealing with.  That is why it is so important for us as a country which lives on its exports to be able to stand over them and say they are exports of the highest quality.  People who say it is not in the national interest to discuss these matters are themselves not acting in the national interest.  Because we export to survive we have to be open in what we say.</P>
    <P>There was also an attitude that these matters were acceptable because so many <Col N="382" /> jobs were at stake.  What about the companies who try to operate their business ethically and who try to operate within the law?  What about the people who worked for those companies and no longer have jobs?  What do we say to them?  Could it be that the failure of the co-operative beef factories to survive was because they were playing by the rules while those around them were not playing by any rules?  Is that possible?  Let us not be deceived by the fact that Larry Goodman created so many jobs.  He did, and fair play to him, but did jobs in other areas survive because of malpractice? Those questions must be addressed.</P>
    <P>In relation to the price package and CAP reform, it is unquestionable that intervention will become less and less available to us.  The European taxpayer or consumer will not continue to tolerate the large quantities of food being placed in intervention.  The world at large will not tolerate people in Africa, and elsewhere, starving when there are stores, and now boats, bulging with food.  Certain moral questions need to be asked in that regard but they are for another day.</P>
    <P>What was the role of the Irish media in this matter?  Why did it take a British television programme to bring those matters to public attention and to lead us to the point where it was deemed necessary to have a public inquiry?  The reason is simple.  I know people in the Irish media who were intimidated by writs slapped on them by the Goodman organisation. Those people knew the truth and were prepared to publish it but were not allowed to do so because of intimidation, legal intimidation, to stop them from telling the truth.  That is another question we must ask ourselves in relation to our attitudes.  Were the farming organisations as active as they might have been in bringing matters of this nature to public attention?  I do not know whether the farming organisations were prepared to go along tacitly with impropriety; if that was the case then it is a very serious matter.</P>
    <P>In regard to the relationship between Government and the beef industry as a whole, it is quite proper for Government <Col N="383" /> to be involved with the industry.  There is a partnership between Government and the industry and if we are serious about creating jobs that partnership must exist. It is the nature of the relationship which gives cause for worry.  Could it be that the nature of the relationship was to confer a competitive advantage on one single company at the expense of others?  If that were the case it is extremely distasteful and is something that we could not tolerate. Of course, Government, industry, the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of Industry and Commerce must co-operate in a national effort to create jobs and economic growth but if the playing pitch is not level, that is something that cannot be tolerated.</P>
    <P>I have always held the view that if, in a free competitive environment, a company the size of the Goodman organisation became so large and were not paying the proper price for beef that there would be somebody, somewhere, who would start a business in a hole in the wall and replace Larry Goodman as the largest player in the beef industry. However, I was wrong in that perception because the person who started business in the hole in the wall would never get to the point of it being anything bigger than the hole in the wall; the business would have been bought out or shut down.  What do we think of when we think of olive oil?  We probably think of the Mafia in Italy.  That is the vision it conjures up. We cannot allow a situation where if people talk about Irish beef they talk about some type of a green Mafia.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to hear a senior Goodman executive &mdash; and Mr. Goodman himself &mdash; say they would co-operate fully with this inquiry.  That has to be applauded and I hope they will deliver on that commitment.  I also heard a senior Goodman official say on radio that if some of the allegations were true, the company would be awash with money.  The company were awash with money, it was the way they invested their money on speculative investment in the Stock Exchange in Britain that caused the problems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> Senator Raftery raised the question of the Companies Bill and suggested at that time that it would not have mattered very much if the Goodman organisation and Anglo-Irish beef producers had been allowed to go under.  I do not subscribe to that view.  At that time of the year, if those factories had closed there would have been incalculable difficulties for Irish beef farmers and for the Irish beef industry.  The slaughtering capacity would not have been able to deal with the very large numbers of cattle coming on the market.</P>
    <P>I hope the inquiry will also deal with export credit and how that was used. Again, was it a question of the playing pitch not being level and giving undue advantage to one company at the expense of others?  Apart from the positive effect we hope the inquiry will have in establishing the credibility of the Irish food industry, it will relate to broader issues in terms of our capacity to negotiate effectively as a country in the whole area of Common Agricultural Policy reform and in other matters which are decided in Brussels.  It is obvious there is a very difficult time ahead in terms of protecting the Irish position within CAP reform.  We will be in the same position we were in regard to 1992, having to argue certain national concessions because of the importance of agriculture within our economy.  We argued very successfully in relation to 1992.  That because of our peripherality we had to have certain compensatory measures which were granted. We will have to do something similar in relation to CAP reform.  There is a common thrust involved and we have to be able to establish our credentials.</P>
    <P>My fundamental hope is that this inquiry will establish the truth behind the allegations.  I share Senator Raftery's reservations in that I hope the shredders and the incinerators were not working overtime after this inquiry was announced.  I hope we will get to the bottom of it, that we will get to the truth, that the food industry, on which so many jobs depend and on which the economic welfare of the country depends, will come out of it with credit and that we can go <Col N="385" /> back to the international markets showing Irish food to be the quality product it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally support the motion proposed by Senator Fallon.  In putting this motion forward today within a very short time after undertaking to do so and at the first available opportunity after the Dáil has approved the same motion, the Government are taking decisive and rapid action.</P>
      <P>The tribunal is being established under the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 and 1977.  The President of the High Court, the Honourable Mr. Justice Hamilton, has agreed to preside over this inquiry and the Government are extremely pleased that he is to undertake this highly significant assignment.  The relevant order under the Acts will be made as soon as the motion setting up the tribunal has been approved by the Seanad and the work of the tribunal will then begin immediately.  The costs of the inquiry will be borne by the Department of Agriculture and Food and will involve a Supplementary Estimate coming before the Dáil in due course.</P>
      <P>Other matters of practical organisation will be a matter for Mr. Justice Hamilton but I want to repeat here the Taoiseach's undertaking given in the Dáil that all Government Departments and services will co-operate to the fullest extent possible in the work of this tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tribunal will be dealing with a subject of major national importance.  The beef industry is one of the largest and fastest developing processing industries in this country.  For several years now it has been the subject of a good deal of public optimism.  There has been what might be described as a campaign of allegations on matters in and connected with the beef industry by political figures and by the media, very often without any attempt whatsoever to after verifiable proof.  A climate of rumour has developed and it would not be desirable or correct to let such a situation continue further, especially when it affects one of the country's biggest industries.  This has <Col N="386" /> been referred to by a number of other speakers.</P>
    <P>The fact is that we export over £1 billion worth of beef and we are the largest beef export nation in the Community. We can even do better than that with the correct perception and image of the Irish beef industry, as has been referred to by Senator Dardis earlier.  It is vitally important that the image of the Irish beef industry be one of total and absolute integrity.  The Government have taken the view that it is time to clear the air, time to have the various allegations examined fully and either proved or disproved conclusively.  People making allegations of any kind now have the opportunity to go before a tribunal and support the allegations with facts.  We need to ensure consumer confidence and overall confidence in the Irish food industry. We need confidence in our product and we need producer confidence in the processing industry.  I believe the setting up of the tribunal is a necessary step in this.</P>
    <P>It would not be appropriate for me to list here all the allegations made against the beef industry.  As is clear from the wording of the motion the tribunal's terms of reference are very comprehensive. While they centre on the two most extensive groups of allegations made &mdash; those in Dáil Éireann and those in the television programme of 15 May &mdash; the tribunal, as Senators can see from the wording, is quite free to go further.</P>
    <P>The motion establishes the tribunal as the single most authoritative and independent vehicle for getting to the truth or otherwise of the allegations made.  Both specific allegations and more general ones come within the terms of reference and will fall to be examined.  This is a no holds barred inquiry; but if the real truth of the alleged occurrences is to be revealed, it can be done only on the basis of hard evidence of fact in the same way as the law of the country operates from the District Courts to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Those who subscribe to the rule of law must be prepared to defend that law and to support the full administration of justice by coming forward with evidence <Col N="387" /> needed to sustain any allegations made. It is disconcerting to find some of the people who have been making persistent allegations tending to run away from the situation now with one excuse or another. This is the time for the truth and those who are concerned about the truth and the good name of the Irish beef and food industry have little option but to come before the tribunal and tell the story as it is, with back-up and supporting evidence. In line with time-honoured principles of justice, no one should accept any allegation as true until and unless it can be proved by established facts and evidence.</P>
    <P>The tribunal's terms of reference are very extensive.  It has wide-ranging powers to examine matters which it may, in its discretion, decide are relevant to specific allegations.  This wide-ranging scope will, in my view, be conducive to a thorough investigation being undertaken and should lead to clear and decisive results &mdash; and, I would hope, at the end of the day not alone results but recommendations as well.</P>
    <P>No more than the Taoiseach did in the Dáil last week, I do not think it proper to go into great detail on any of the allegations made at this time.  I believe, however, that one matter should be mentioned because the comments made, both in the Dáil last week and on the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme are factually incorrect and cannot be left without immediate correction.  I want to say also that I found the programme quite distasteful.  Not alone were many items factually incorrect but the whole tone of the programme left a lot to be desired, from the initiation of the programme, where it started by saying &ldquo;This man makes his money by killing&rdquo; to &mdash; apart from some gory scenes &mdash; the scene where they had the Taoiseach, the Prime Minister of this country, on a meat hook.  This gives some indication of the sensational way this programme was presented.  Certainly, in my view the presentation and the tone left a great deal to be desired.</P>
    <P>I want to get back to the factually incorrect nature of one allegation.  I refer to <Col N="388" /> the comment in regard to the investigation of Allied Irish Beef Processers operation in Waterford and Ballymun in 1986 and in 1987 under the then operating aids to private storage scheme.  It is not true to say that the Department of Agriculture and Food did not co-operate with the Garda in this matter.  I will now outline the sequence of events in this case.</P>
    <P>Suspicions regarding certain operations relating to beef stored at Waterford cold store first arose in December 1986 and a customs investigation was initiated.  The customs investigation was extended during 1987 to all AIBP production plants and the final report of the investigation was received by the Department of Agriculture and Food on 5 October 1987.  Following analysis of these detailled findings, which necessitated further contact between the customs and the Department, the Department informed the EC Commission in January 1988 that, in the view of the Irish authorities, an irregularity had occurred.  This initial notification to the Commission was followed on 3 February 1988 by a detailed memorandum on the matter.  On 4 February 1988 the Garda Commissioner was asked to investigate the matter as, in the view of the Department, the practices at Waterford and Ballymun were fraudulent. The Garda Commissioner on the same day was furnished with a memorandum setting out a summary of the irregular practices uncovered at Waterford and Ballymun together with a summary of the EC rules which were breached.  The Garda did not at any stage ask the Department of Agriculture and Food for a copy of the customs report. However, the Garda in late April 1989 asked for a more detailed statement by the Department on the EC rules and this was furnished on 4 May 1989.  This record clearly shows that at no stage whatsoever was there any delay in officially bringing the matter to the attention of the Garda, nor was there any lack of co-operation with them.</P>
    <P>On a more general level, I think it would be wrong of us in considering the role of the tribunal not to stand back and reflect on the real importance of the <Col N="389" /> industry we are discussing.  Beef processing has grown from small beginnings some 30 years ago, a time when most Irish cattle were exported live, to the large industry we see today.  It has begun to move and badly needs to move more, away from commodity trade in sides and quarters and closer to consumer products. Similarly, it has to become less dependent on Community support systems which cannot be relied upon to provide current levels of market support in the long run.  We are all only too well aware of the proposed modifications in the CAP and the present GATT rounds. These are major challenges.  Not only are they challenges for the beef processing industry itself but challenges also to the wellbeing of our national economy.  With over 5,000 employees depending on the industry for their livelihood and over 50,000 farmers entitled to expect an efficient, well run processing industry, there can be no room for complacency or anything other than the highest levels of professionalism and integrity.</P>
    <P>Many adaptations will need to be made by the beef processing sector, as well as by other sectors of the food industry. These relate not only to the form of product, to marketing and to promotion but also, for instance, to packaging techniques, meeting of environmental requirements and providing reassurances regarding quality and, indeed, animal welfare factors.  If the beef processing industry is to be able to provide those assurances it must itself be strong and confident and respected as such by all coming in contact with it.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Irish food industry is more and more assuring and certifying its customers with quality assurance schemes, not alone Irish quality assurance schemes like the Irish quality mark but also internationally recognised ISO quality assurance.  We have to go further, of course, and we have not alone to have the good image and perception which we have of Irish food and Irish beef but certify that and have the customers under no illusion but that this product, which is seen in a <Col N="390" /> favourable light and has favourable reputation in Europe, is a quality grass-based product produced in a natural environment.</P>
    <P>I want to applaud particularly CBF, the Irish Meat Export Board, for their quality assurance schemes and the standard of excellence in the industry which they are promoting.  They are promoting a beef product of quality and integrity. That is the road we have to go.  That is an important matter which will come out of this tribunal.  When we get various allegations out of the way we can again &mdash; as I do regularly &mdash; attend international promotions and exhibits of Irish food and Irish beef and we can and will be able to stand behind the products we are promoting as products of quite outstanding integrity.  It is my belief that this inquiry will do the country a fundamental service by clearing the air so that the industry can move forward with renewed vigour and self-respect.  I repeat this is not a matter simply for the particular sector itself but is one of national importance, affecting as it does our reputation as an efficient and successful trading nation.</P>
    <P>I want to refer very briefly to some of the comments made by Senator Raftery I agree with Senator Dardis in relation to the need for the provision of an examiner last August.  As everybody knows, we have a seasonal beef industry in Ireland. There was no way, without total chaos in the industry, that we could have avoided setting up this examinership and introducing legislation in the Oireachtas to allow that to happen.  The Goodman Group are and were a major player and in August last it would have caused tremendous disruption not to have done that.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the level of disallowance in Europe of Irish applications for subsidy under various EC regulations and directives.  The fact is that Ireland has the lowest level of disallowance. From the official records up-to-date &mdash; that is, 1986, 1987 and 1988 &mdash; Ireland was by far the lowest country in the European Community for allowances in the beef and food industry.  We have, as I said, a good reputation.  We want to <Col N="391" /> make absolutely certain that that reputation is maintained.</P>
    <P>I wish the inquiry success in their complicated and detailed assignment.  I can promise again the full co-operation and welcome of the Irish CAP control authorities in regard to these inquiries and look forward to the findings and recommendations as a watershed in the further expansion of our single most important industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  All of us here welcome the setting up of this tribunal.  We all want to ensure that this long-standing, very important multi-million pound and great employer industry is protected.  That should be the main thing all of us want to see coming out of this inquiry.  There have been various allegations made in the Dáil, in the ITV programme and there has been a climate of rumour over recent months and years.  As a result, question marks are hanging over the beef industry in this country.  If we are to be represented abroad by people like the Minister who can hold their heads up high, we have to get to the bottom of the various allegations, rumours, questions of fraud and malpractice in relation to the whole industry.  We have to look further than what has come out in the television programme. There are possibly aspects and angles to this affair other than the Goodman angle.  All aspects have to be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the inquiry produces definite answers.  It is important that it produces a report which contains answers and recommendations because there is a danger, as has happened with previous inquiries, that reports are published but one wonders if they were read by anyone afterwards.  In passing I mention reports such as the Stardust report and that of the Kerry Babies.  These inquiries cost a great deal of money, went on at length and, looking back on them now, one wonders what exactly they achieved. There are still many question marks hanging over our fire safety and fire prevention regulations with regard <Col N="392" /> to public buildings and local authority supervision.  One wonders if another Stardust is a possibility.  In the case of the Kerry Babies Tribunal there was almost a witchhunt against members of the Garda Síochána.  We do not want to see this happen with regard to this inquiry.  I do not think we could have a better chairman of this tribunal than Mr. Justice Hamilton. I am sure that if it is within his ability this inquiry will be brought to as speedy a conclusion as possible and a report produced.</P>
    <P>There has to be co-operation and I am glad the Minister's Department will co-operate wherever possible with the tribunal. With the greatest of respect to the Minister present, there must be some question marks over some aspects of how the Department have been run in recent years, perhaps with practices there which are totally unknown to the Minister, because it is unreal in this day and age to expect a Minister to know everything that is going on right down the line.  But certainly the chain of command has to be investigated.  I am sure that if there are question marks the Minister will be one of the first to say that he will take note of them and if changes are recommended that he will respond positively.</P>
    <P>It is important that people who have made allegations in various areas, particularly under the privilege of the other House, are now in a position to come forward and tell what they know, because if we do not remove the cloud which hangs over this industry the consequences for this country are extremely dangerous since so many people throughout the country are dependent on this industry. The consequences will be services if people do not come forward, if there is an attempt to whitewash, or if this inquiry does not turn up hard evidence or clear up some of the rumours of malpractice and fraud and the question marks that hang over both the Goodman operation and apparently other practices within the trade.  It is important to investigate how, over the years, a monopoly was allowed to develop, how, apparently, tax bills were written off, how various packages seem to have been announced and <Col N="393" /> reannounced, how a company basically involved in beef suddenly find their way into all sorts of non-related activities and how the country had to bail them out. All these questions have to be looked at, because it was not overnight that these things happened.  The reaction of the farmers' organisation was also mentioned, that perhaps they were a bit tardy and sluggish and was there a nod and wink approach?  All these matters must be addressed by this inquiry.  All the various bodies must come forward and give evidence.</P>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister said in relation to his Department co-operating fully with the inquiry because it is important that the Department of Agriculture and Food be seen to have clean hands in relation to this matter.  It is also important that Ireland's good name and the good name of Irish meat abroad be maintained. It should be our main concern that Ireland's name as a good exporter of beef and beef products is protected.  If we were to fail in relation to this the knock-on effect would be far too serious to be even contemplated.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of this inquiry.  It is important that it be given all the necessary resources and I hope it will not drag on and on and come up with nothing at the end.  It is important that it will publish its report and that recommendations will be made and eventually acted on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that this motion to establish a judicial tribunal to inquire into the beef processing industry has been brought before this House.  I fully support the motion.  Over the last few months many serious allegations have been made about the operation of our beef trade, allegations that if left unanswered could have an adverse effect on public confidence in one of our most important economic sectors.  It is therefore time to clear the air and the establishment of this inquiry offers us the best opportunity of doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other speakers, I welcome the fact that the Government have moved rapidly to establish this inquiry.  It is vital <Col N="394" /> that the work of the tribunal commences at the earliest possible date and addresses itself fully to the allegations made.  The Government are right to have set very wide terms of reference for the tribunal. It is not simply a matter of examining specific allegations made in recent days. The tribunal will have the power to examine any matters which it may at its own discretion decide are relevant.  The broad terms of reference and very great scope provided to the tribunal will obviously be conducive to a thorough investigation being undertaken and each of the allegations raised fully inquired into.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to comment specifically on any of the allegations made.  That in my view would be inappropriate because I consider that it is for the tribunal to go through the allegations in detail and make its own assessment of them.  But there is one thing that everybody, both inside this House and the public at large, must do.  Anybody who has relevant information should make it available to the tribunal.  In particular those people who have been making allegations over the past few months, and indeed recently in the Dáil, and also those people who have made allegations on the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme must now come forward and disclose full details of their claims.  If they fail to do this for any reason, they will do a grave disservice to both the beef industry and to the country. In general terms I agree with the Minister that it would be a mistake for us in this House to get so tied up in detail as to lose sight of the real importance of the industry we are discussing.  I think we all know the importance of this industry to the economy.</P>
    <P>Beef processing has grown from small beginnings some 30 years ago, a time when most Irish cattle were exported live, to the large industry we see today. It has begun to move away and diversify, and this has been mooted for a number of years by successive Governments.  We will try to create more employment within the industry.  Similarly it has become less dependent on Community support systems which cannot be relied upon to provide current levels of market <Col N="395" /> support in the long run.  Many adaptations will need to be made by the beef processing sector as by any other sectors of the food industry.  These relate not only to form of product and to marketing proportion but also, for instance, to packaging techniques, meeting environmental requirements and providing the various forms of assurance that customers require, whether such assurances relate to quality, to environmental friendliness or to animal welfare factors.</P>
    <P>If the beef processing industry is to do all of that it has to be strong and confident. It is my belief that the industry will in fact emerge strengthened from the inquiry process.  That process should indeed help the development of an industry well adapted to gain and hold the confidence of all its clients.  That is in the national interest and I think it is what all the parties here would seek.</P>
    <P>I hope the inquiry will proceed as rapidly as possible and that all these people who made very serious allegations will come forward and co-operate fully with the tribunal.  Indeed, it is very important &mdash; Senator Cosgrave referred to this &mdash; that the findings of the inquiry will be acted upon.  If they are not acted upon all we will have done is disburse huge amounts of money to the legal profession, and the beef industry will not have gained one iota from it.</P>
    <P>I hope when the tribunal's work is completed, that it will not be left lying on some shelf but that it will be acted upon for all our sakes because we all know, as the Minister has rightly pointed out, the importance of this industry to our economy. We have 5,000 people employed directly in the industry; we have 50,000 farmer suppliers and it is very important that their livelihood is protected.</P>
    <P>I will say one thing about Larry Goodman. In spite of the fact that serious allegations have been made against him the one thing that can be said truthfully is that he paid for whatever cattle he bought.  Any farmer who ever supplied him with cattle got paid for them.  That is very important.  I wish the inquiry every <Col N="396" /> success.  I hope it will be a full and thorough inquiry into all aspects of the industry, not just to the allegations made in the programme that is the subject of this inquiry.  If that is done we will clear the air on a lot of the issues that have been talked about over the last few weeks and it will be better for the whole industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire agus roimh an fiosrúcháin seo. There are a number of aspects of this that deserve to be adverted to.  The first one is the fact that we have a deficiency in our investigative procedures.  Whatever the final outcome of this investigation is those allegations were very serious because of the form in which they were made, and the publicity they were given and because they were made by a television programme which has a reputation for rarely going wrong.</P>
      <P>This television programme has done wonderful work on behalf of Irish prisoners, for instance, improperly imprisoned in Britain.  This was not cheap, British tabloid journalism, it was a very serious current affairs programme.  We have a failing apparently in our law which means that we could not have the Department of Industry or the Department of Agriculture and Food move in and freeze the records of these companies instantenously in the public interest.  It appears to me that that leaves anybody involved in sharp practice with a quite significant interval of time in which to dispose of unsavoury records.  I do not like that.  I am not saying that in this particular case that was done, I have no evidence of that. I am saying that if allegations of this scale are made which have the possibility to do so much harm to what is potentially, I emphasise &ldquo;potentially&rdquo; a very important industry in this country that is a regrettable situation.  It is also a regrettable situation that much of the debate, in the other House at least, descended into the realm of personalities.  I believe our, perhaps, potentially most valuable and most lucrative industry deserves to be looked at in a little less partisan fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to give the House a lecture about party political favouritism <Col N="397" /> because before it was announced in the other House I was aware, perhaps not in detail, that at least two Governments identified the Goodman Group and Mr. Larry Goodman as the personage to achieve certain national objectives in terms of developing the beef industry.  The approach under which that was taken was, to say the least, somewhat flawed.</P>
    <P>The beef industry has a problem which goes deeper than Larry Goodman.  The question is, is the beef industry going to be market driven or intervention driven? Will it be essentially producing products that can sell because of their quality, their price and their imagination?  Is that how it will develop or will it develop in an entirely different way by relying on the fact that you can always fall back on intervention?</P>
    <P>I would not say that the Minister was wrong during the recent price discussion to insist on some sort of a safety net provision but I believe that, whatever my views are on it, economics can contribute something.  If you allow unregulated guarantees about a fixed price for a product you will produce a limitless supply. That is not an argument about intervention, price fixing or anything like that <i>per se</i> but the mixture of market place economics, intervention and guaranteed prices that constitute the way the Common Agricultural Policy gives us the worst of both worlds.  It gives us complacent procedures, crucified consumers and large volumes of unsaleable products. It seems to me that successive Irish Governments did not recognise the way the world was moving.</P>
    <P>In 1972, when we had the referendum on membership of the EC, I happily expressed scepticism about the long term future of the Common Agricultural Policy.  I never believed it was sustainable; I gave up believing in Santa Claus when I was about nine years old and with the end of my belief in Santa Claus I ended my belief that there was a benevolent Europe out there that would hand over large sums of money indefinitely to enable us to keep on producing as much as we wanted whenever we wanted at prices that were acceptable to <Col N="398" /> the producer.  I never thought that would last.  I am not in any sense gloating now, but I never believed it.  I am bothered that a large section of our beef industry appears to have believed it.</P>
    <P>There was and is a profound need for change in Irish agriculture generally and in the beef industry in particular.  It hardly needs to be said that it should be based, first of all, on producing quality products that will sell in the market place.  I will not give people, who are experts in that specific area, a lecture on how to do that. There are certain aspects in this area that I would have identified where any developing economy is concerned.  One of those is a substantial and increasing investment in product research, market research, research and development, all the research and development being based on the existing and perceived future needs of the consumer and the capacity to anticipate new needs or new wants and to package products accordingly.</P>
    <P>Of course, we have enormous assets.  I heard the Minister for Agriculture and Food here in the last six months discuss the matter of agriculture at considerable length and with considerable eloquence and vehemence.  He explained his view of us as the producers of the guaranteed green agricultural foodstuffs of Europe. It is a worthwhile vision but that requires an enormous investment in market research, market development, product development, etc., to develop products that are both made from green, as in environmentally friendly, raw materials and that are also packaged, produced and transported, etc. by methods that are environmentally acceptable.  That involves huge amounts of money.  I have a suspicion that the beef industry in particular, to a large extent expects the Government to do the research, while it cleans up the product.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go off on too much of a sideline but the point is that what is needed is recognition of the primacy of the consumer.  Anybody who has to deal with Irish agricultural products on a daily basis in our shops would not really come home with an idea that the primacy of <Col N="399" /> the consumer was at the focal point of the thoughts of the producers of Irish potatoes when plenty of elbow grease and a scrubbing brush is still a necessary prerequisite for boiling a pot of potatoes because they are so filthy and dirty.  That is not any sort of advertisement for a sense of the primacy of the consumer.  I hope it is not equally true of more health sensitive products.  To develop an industry like that needs creativity, imagination, research, ingenuity and, of course, it also needs scale.  It was a perfectly right decision by successive Governments to move towards the rationalisation of the Irish beef industry.  The mistake the Government made is an over-reliance on one particular producer or individual. There are certain characteristics of the Goodman group of companies that seem to make them &mdash; and this may well be hindsight &mdash; not suitable for the job successive Governments wanted them to do.</P>
    <P>We want, as I said, a market-orientated, consumer-orientated body with a willingness to identify new products, not just new markets for old products or temporary markets in third World countries or in developing countries, but new products. We need new products that will sell where we can get the highest price for the best added-value for good quality products that would be within the EC not finding interesting new markets with State guarantees about risks given by a succession of Governments.  That is not the way.  It may guarantee markets in the short term but it is not the long term future of an industry which could well become a major industry here.</P>
    <P>The problem is that the basic philosophy that seemed to drive that large organisation was not the philosophy that could do those things.  It was a philosophy based on a particularly macho view of the bottom line being all.  Nobody would deny the centrality of the bottom line. Businesses cannot be run if they do not operate profitably but it is what you do with the profits and what you do in order to achieve what is perceived to be a desirable level of profits that determines the ethos of a company.  Our problem is that <Col N="400" /> our beef industry was dominated by an organisation and an extraordinary complex network of companies which seemed to have, secrecy as their number one objective.  That is, secrecy not just from prying television programmes or the media but secrecy from Government and, indeed, secrecy because shareholders did not exist or were a minority and an extraordinary network of companies meant that nobody with an involvement in that industry could really be sure what was being done anywhere else.</P>
    <P>Enormous pressures were put on middle line managers to produce results out of which came the ethos in which the sort of things that were produced on the television programme were perceived to be possible.  My understanding is that, for instance, when EC rules on disclosure by public limited companies were changed, a considerable number of the companies were converted into private companies to circumvent EC rules about disclosure. That is not the way to create the business ethos in which a large-scale industry, capable of trading within the EC, can operate. The EC is a well regulated marketplace based on public accountability, based on very strong, well developed employee rights, based on very strong consumer rights.  The sort of obsessive secrecy that characterised the Goodman group guarantees that they will not develop or be able to identify with the social market ethos that characterises the European Community.  It is based on an old-fashioned macho idea of business which does not fit in with the way successful countries in the EC, or indeed, in northern Europe have been successful.  It seems that that is the bedrock of the problems.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, while the inquiry will, I hope, identify all of the truth and may well identify many sorded practices &mdash; I will comment on a couple of matters in a moment &mdash; the position now is, as I have said, shareholders in any of the Goodman companies that are public limited companies are given limited information because of the complex nature of the company.  The employees in many cases <Col N="401" /> do not exist because vast numbers of those who are perceived to be employees of the Goodman group are, in fact, service contractors on individual contracts. Perhaps the only other group who could have known are the Department of Agriculture and Food and we still do not know how much they knew, what they knew or whether they were happy about the situation.  I am not talking about illegal practices, I am talking about the business ethos and the viability or otherwise of the company.</P>
    <P>The only other group that could have known are the banks but, unfortunately, Irish banks have shown a capacity only to be equated with that of the lemming, in their chase after a fast buck.  The list of their disasters is becoming endless, from ICI some years ago, to banks in New Hampshire and Maryland, on to their escapades in Britain, all of which resulted in enormous losses which ultimately will be paid for by the customers of the banks in Ireland.  The Irish banks walked into this, they say somebody whom successive Government had, if you like, anointed and they did not, apparently, bother to be critical either.  The mess blew up in their faces last summer and they were exposed as being as poorly informed as anybody else.</P>
    <P>It is that ethos and the disingenuous sort of denials of the Goodman group that make all of us suspicious.  When we are told an individual who is on the television programme is not an employee of the Goodman group it sounds very convincing.  He is not an employee because the Goodman group have many people working for them exclusively who are not employees at all.  Many of them are on service contracts because this is what happens in many of the companies the Goodman group take over.  A whole shake-out follows in which people who are let go and re-employed on individual contracts are no longer employees. Therefore, you can make this beautiful statement that this person is not an employee.  It sounds like a simple categorical statement.  He is not an employee because they do not have employees in many of these areas, they <Col N="402" /> have people on service contracts.  They are just as much employees as anybody else except that the nature of the contractual relationship is changed.  That is not the way to convince, however sympathetic an observer, that Goodman is a company that deals in simple straightforward, truthfulness.</P>
    <P>There was a denial that the company actively encouraged the use of fraudulent stamps.  I expect more from a major company. I expect the company to be able to say, &ldquo;We did not know it was being done&rdquo;, or &ldquo;It happened, we discovered it and we stamped it out.&rdquo;  To suggest that it is an adequate denial to say &ldquo;we did not actively encourage something&rdquo; is to invite the suspicion that you did not actively encourage it but you kind of blinked, nodded, presumed and hoped nobody would find out.  I am not saying that is what happened.  I am simply saying that what seems to characterise this large part of the Irish beef industry is an inability for someone to precisely say what he or she wants to say either because the truth is less palatable or because they have got involved in this convoluted language which leaves everybody believing something different.  That is what happened.</P>
    <P>The other issue, of course, that does not make public perception easier or the average citizen easy in his mind is, for instance, the Classic Meats case, in which we had denials from the company of any involvement and then the Minister for Industry and Commerce concludes they are not telling the truth.  There is the reported fact &mdash; perhaps I am wrong on this one &mdash; that the Goodman group having denied all connections with Classic Meats, were listed as an asset when they tried to make an arrangement with the bankers last summer.  If that is not true I am happy to have it corrected.  That was the reported situation at the time.  It does not help the public view of how a company should operate if you have a denial on one hand, followed by a member of the Government saying the opposite, and a suggestion made that it was true all along.  We have this current dispute in which we do not know if the <Col N="403" /> company are being sold to people who claim to have broken all links with the Goodman group.  The whole thing suggests a perception of business which is incorrect.  This point needs to be made again and again, that the perception of business that the Goodman group create with their business practices &mdash; I am not talking about their alleged illegal practices &mdash; the secrecy, the manner in which they treat employees, the misuse of language, the obfuscating kind of language they use is precisely the way in which you will fail to build an industry that will succeed within the social market mechanism that is the European Community.</P>
    <P>Whatever I may think about the European Community, it is not the United States and it is not the Third World.  It is a very sophisticated marketplace with a considerable network of regulation, consumer protection, shareholder protection and employee protection.  You cannot build a major player in that marketplace by ignoring those realities, by pretending that kind of slightly dubious nod and wink business practices, not necessarily the ones that are mentioned in the programme, but the general value system, the keep on squeezing them until the pips squeak philosophy that seems to be at the centre of the Goodman group in which everybody at a lower level was squeezed and in which corner-cutting was encouraged, will succeed.</P>
    <P>It is not just the Goodman group.  Certain dairy co-operatives have a certain reputation in the environmental area, for instance, of doing similar things.  It is that ethos which seems so cute and so clever and, in the short term, seems so good, which will guarantee their failure because it does not direct the whole thrust of a company like that where it should be directed, which is at the consumer in the European marketplace, the only place in which we will succeed in developing and building successful industry.  That is why this inquiry is so important.  It is so important because it is necessary in order to clear the air, to identify a wrongdoing if necessary and, above all, to enable us to <Col N="404" /> make a fresh start hopefully with companies that will accept public accountability and the rights of the consumers as the central drive of a large company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like my colleagues, welcome the tribunal.  I am glad that the Honourable Mr. Justice Hamilton is to preside over the inquiry.  We have to be careful today because the inquiry is about to begin.  I hope no elected people will set out with only one ideal, to damage any company or the Government at this extraordinary delicate time in our nation when jobs are so needed.  I do not mind what Minister, or representative of past Governments or of the present Government goes to Iraq, Egypt or to any other place, if he or she goes there with the best of intentions to negotiate and bring back orders which would, down the road, give us a scale situation which would benefit our farmers.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of worry and confusion outside this House, and the other House, about this debate.  Indeed, there is a lot more commonsense shown by some of our people outside than is contained in some of the statements that have been elsewhere.  I thought we had gone beyond the begrudging stage in regard to anybody making the grade, whether it be ourselves politically, somebody like Larry Goodman, or any industrialist who is only doing good for the people.  I thought we had gone beyond that as individuals and as elected representatives. What is wrong with being a success if long hours, hard work, dedication and commitment bring that about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to put on the record today that &mdash; unlike other companies in the beef industry which do not give all the year round employment due to the seasonal nature of the industry &mdash; the Goodman Group employ 1,600 people all the year round; the number employed in the high season would be greater.  The people who criticise should remember what we are talking about.  I am quite sure that the people in Ballybay today, where a factory was sold yesterday, do not mind too much who bought it if it creates jobs on the ground for the families <Col N="405" /> of that town.  They are glad that somebody bought it, if it is correctly and properly run.</P>
    <P>I spoke the other day to a mother in south Tipperary where Larry Goodman has factories.  She was quite honest and open.  She said her sons went into work at 5.30 a.m.  He was a good employer and she has no crib.  She was an ordinary woman, not one of the bigshots with big cars and so on.  Her sons had good employment from him and she was happy.</P>
    <P>I hold no brief for Larry Goodman, I do not even know the man, but I am sick of the bashing that has gone on in recent times.  I would say this if it was some other industrialist or employer who was creating jobs at a time when our nation needs jobs like never before.  It is important to put on the record that 65 per cent of his produce went to EC markets, particularly the UK, Ireland, France, Germany and Italy with, consequently, a lesser degree of dependence on intervention.</P>
    <P>The Goodman Group were responsible for opening up Third World markets to the Irish beef industry.  In addition, Goodman was the first person to export meat to supermarkets in the UK thus developing a high value-added industry. The fact that these supermarkets are still dealing with the company surely must be an indication of the confidence the customers have had in the Irish beef which he supplied.</P>
    <P>I understand there was a relationship between the Goodman Group and the Labour and Fine Gael Government.  It was much closer than with my party, which seems to be the cause of the hype and the worry.  I have no trouble with that.  I have no trouble with a former Government doing what they were supposed to do and being friendly with industrialists who do their right and create employment for our people.  I do not believe politicians who made certain statements under the protection of the Dáil would have made them in a forum outside.  That worries me deeply.  It is wrong for elected people to go down the road of saying: &ldquo;I am more honest than <Col N="406" /> you.&rdquo;  I await with great interest to see what they will produce for the inquiry when they will not have the protection of the Dáil.  We have not heard that kind of address here this morning, I am glad to say, due to the commonsense of my colleagues here.</P>
    <P>We should stop knocking our own world, the world of industry, or anywhere else where people create jobs.  For the next month everybody will be talking about job creation.  Yet, here is someone who employs 1,600 people all year round, and up to 2,500 seasonally.  I talked to farmers at the mart when the Larry Goodman bashing started.  I do not know what some of my colleagues in the other House are doing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the inquiry.  I sincerely hope it is not just another exercise that will line the pockets of the lawyers, as was the case in other inquiries.  We heard no more about them afterwards.  Damage has been done to Irish industry and to our meat industry abroad and I only hope we will be able to correct it.</P>
    <P>I know tributes have been paid to ITV but I think they should have looked at their own industry.  Disallowances by the UK were 23 times greater than in Ireland for each of the past two years for which records are available.  ITV should look at English industry before coming over to make a programme that could damage our industry.  This Government, past Governments and members of all the parties have tried in absolute sincerity to ensure success for Irish food on the European scene.</P>
    <P>Until I get a document from the top legal people showing that a person is guilty, I will stand up anywhere and defend them.  At the end of the inquiry, when I hear the findings of Mr. Justice Hamilton then, and only then, will I criticise Larry Goodman.  I do not know the man but I admire anyone who looks after the farmers and gives employment to our people.  I hope we will be able to undo the damage that has been done and I hope every person connected with this inquiry will act with commonsense.  I wait with great interest to see what information will <Col N="407" /> be given and what statements will be made outside the protection of these Houses.</P>
    <P>Because I have been associated with public life for many years, I find it sad that fingers are pointed at senior officials in any Department.  That is tragic.  If what is alleged is true, it is wrong, but if the allegations are proved to be false it is tragic that senior officials of any Department may be blamed.  I know I should not refer to officials but senior officials in all Departments have the highest level of code and ethics and I will defend them again.  We should get back to the commonsense approach we had a few years ago, of working together, rather than niggling at each other as members of different parties.</P>
    <P>I welcome this inquiry and I wish it well.  I hope it will satisfy the people who were responsible for having it set up in the first place, and to industrialists like Larry Goodman, people who create jobs, I wish them well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this inquiry. There is a great deal at stake here.  The reputation of our beef industry, which is the cornerstone of our agricultural industry, itself a major part of our economy, is at issue.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to learn from the Minister that the tribunal will be examining a number of issues in a short time and will not take a long drawn-out period to carry out its work.  I sincerely hope this inquiry will come up with negative results; in other words, results which will show that nothing wrong is being or has been done. This would be my earnest and sincere wish and it would be the best and most palatable result.  Even though this inquiry will cost a certain amount of money, it will be money well spent if we can establish clearly to all concerned, in the country and outside it, that we have nothing whatsoever to hide, nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to be guilty of by way of malpractice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made clear in his remarks that the tribunal will address itself to the allegations made in the ITV programme <Col N="408" /> on 15 May, to the allegations made in Dáil Éireann with regard to the happenings within the Goodman meat empire and to matters related directly and indirectly to these areas.  It is also clear to us from the Minister's remarks that the tribunal can extend its terms of reference to a wider field.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that employment by the Goodman group is extremely important&mdash;1,650 employees, rising to a figure in excess of 2,500 throughout the season. There are thousands of farmers totally reliant on the good reputation of our beef products.  Because dairy farmers depend on beef farmers for the uptake of their calves and their young stock which they will bring forward to beef, we are effectively talking about all livestock farmers.  The situation affects 50,000 or 60,000 farmers.  This is a major, serious matter which we must not take too lightly.</P>
    <P>This is a time of change in all areas. Margins are tight in the beef industry and there is a great need for rationalisation within the industry, for selling effectively on the open market and to the best possible advantage.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Goodman organisation for the job it has done. I sincerely hope, when this tribunal has completed its work, that we can also stand here and make the same remarks. This is my earnest wish.  At the same time, I am a bit sceptical about a monopoly situation, where too much of any branch of industry, whether agricultural or industrial, are in the hands of one or two persons.  That is one constructive criticism I would make <i>vis-à-vis</i> the entire Goodman situation.  Competition, as has often been stated, is the life of trade.  Too much of a monopoly situation is not good.</P>
    <P>Time is of the essence here and fortunately the sitting of the tribunal is only a short time away.  Each day that goes by before the tribunal starts its work creates an air of uncertainty with regard to beef consumers and a greater uncertainty in the international scene, the countries to which we export our products.  For that reason it is vital that all agencies, Government bodies included, make themselves <Col N="409" /> available very quickly and readily to the tribunal.  They must speak openly and keep nothing back, so that it can be truly said this was a meaningful, effective inquiry.  I hope, and would like to expect that the results will be on the right lines, indicating that there have been no wrong-doings or malpractices of serious proportions.</P>
    <P>If there have been malpractices on the lines indicated on the television programme and indicated by persons speaking on this issue, it could be extremely serious for us as a nation and for all those involved in the production of beef.</P>
    <P>At the moment we have a lot to contend with.  We have allegations of angel dust being used in the production of beef. This is a lethal, deadly powder but one which has enormous effects for promoting growth in animals.  We also have to contend with allegations regarding the use of hormones and with exaggerated comment on the over-use of non-prescribed drugs.  We have more than enough to contend with in the beef industry without having to face yet another major series of allegations.  For that reason I hope the Government will act to make certain that this inquiry is concluded in the fastest possible time.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that we are limited in time and I do not want to go over my time.  I will conclude by welcoming this inquiry. I appeal to all concerned to come forward and to speak frankly and openly.  I hope we will have a good result which, in this context, can only be a result which shows that there have been no major malpractices. If there have been trivial mishaps so be it, but we hope nothing major has been done, as has been alleged, such as changing the markings of carcases in the middle of the night, and so on.  We hope this kind of thing has not happened. I do not say it has happened but that and more serious allegations have been made. It is not appropriate, on the eve of the inquiry, to go further and I do not propose to do so.  I hope we will have an early and favourable result from this extremely important inquiry.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann resolves that sections 4 to 6, 8 to 10, 15, 16, 18 and 19 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 (No. 22 of 1984), shall continue in operation.</P>
      <P>I propose, with the agreement of the House, that each Senator's speech shall not exceed 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion seeks Seanad approval for the continued operation of sections of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, concerning the detention of arrested persons in Garda custody in certain circumstances, the withholding of information regarding firearms, ammunition or stolen property and inferences which may be drawn by the court from an accused's failure to account for certain matters.  These provisions were brought into force on 1 July 1987, and the effect of section 2 of the 1984 Act is that those provisions will cease to operate after 30 June next unless both Houses resolve that they should continue in operation.</P>
      <P>The fundamental purpose of the 1984 Criminal Justice Act was to enhance the capacity of the Garda Síochána to deal with crime.  It is of the greatest importance, in a democratic society, that increased police powers are accompanied by appropriate safeguards and the reason for our discussing of the 1984 Act today is primarily because as parliamentarians we have a shared concern to ensure that the safeguards put in place in this instance are working sufficiently well to warrant the continuance in operation of the sections of the act referred to in the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clearly our duty also to bear in mind that the Act itself is aimed at protecting the public against the activities of criminals and that such protection for the community in general is also a matter <Col N="411" /> which must be of central concern to all parliamentarians.</P>
    <P>Crime is a source of concern to society worldwide.  It is also quite understandably, the source of political and media attention.  For the person whose home is burgled or who suffers injury at the hands of criminals, the reality is one of distress, a feeling of revulsion, of violation and a deep sense of injustice.  It is the mark of a caring society that it demands response to incidents of this kind and that such incidents become the subject of political and media attention.</P>
    <P>It is, perhaps, unavoidable, of course, that occasionally in our understandable wish to show publicly that we care, we may unconsciously present a picture of the crime situation which does not sit easily with the facts.  A worring side to this is that it tends to create an excessive sense of apprehension, fear &mdash; indeed, isolation &mdash; amongst those who are most vulnerable.  There is a duty on all of us to understand that the impact of overstatement can be most profound and damaging to the daily lives of the people we seek most to protect.  It is important, therefore, that they should also hear us say that in recent years the factual situation is that crime levels have come down significantly and that substantial changes have been brought about by way of resource allocation and other wise to strengthen our capacity as a society to deal with crime.</P>
    <P>In the period 1984 to 1990 crime figures fell by about 12 per cent overall from 99,727 to 87, 658 while the number of convictions rose by 10 per cent from 16,396 to 17,957.  Within these overall figures there are very encouraging trends, for example; offences against the person dropped by 30 per cent from 2,331 offences to 1,631; attacks on the elderly, one of the most despicable of crimes, fell by almost 90, from 432 to 51; residential burglaries came down 19 per cent from 18,774 to 15,160, unauthorised taking of cars came down 44 per cent from 18,735 to 10,521; larcenies from the person &mdash; down 23 per cent from 5,842 to 4,495; deaths on the road reduced by traffic law <Col N="412" /> enforcement on an unprecedented scale &mdash; down 25 per cent in the first quarter of this year from 122 to 90; armed raids, which peaked at 685 in 1986 were down 33 per cent by 1990 to 459.</P>
    <P>On the resources and other fronts; 1,000 Garda trainees will have been taken on in the two years to December 1991 and a further 1,000 will be recruited in the next three years; 400 extra gardaí have been put on our streets since July 1989 and over 120 gardaí in Dublin alone have been assigned to Community Policing duties.  Cork, Limerick and Galway have also benefited from this programme which will be further extended shortly; 350 experienced members of the force are being retained by a temporary extension of the retirement age for gardaí, sergeant's and inspectors in order to strengthen the management of the force, some 660 promotions in its ranks have been authorised by Government since November 1989.  In the last 18 months, 189 civilian staff have been taken on to release gardaí for outdoor duties.  A further 60 civilians will be taken on for this purpose before the end of the year.  £10 million is being provided in this year's Garda estimates to upgrade Garda equipment of every kind and by the end of this year, £40 million will have been spent on the current Garda building programme. Garda juvenile liaison officers and public service vehicle inspectors have been put on the seven day roster to enable evening and weekend working by these members of the force and the juvenile liaison service is being totally reformed.  A national office to oversee this service was set up last December.</P>
    <P>Community based initiatives to rehabilitate young offenders have been set up in Dublin and Limerick and will be extended elsewhere and for those juvenile offenders fort whom custodial education is the only option my colleague, the Minister for Education, intends to provided 45 extra spaces by September at the Ard Mhuire site in Lusk, County Dublin, that is 36 places for boys and nine for girls.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Flood, presides over the new inter-departmental <Col N="413" /> committee of officials from his own Department, from Justice and Education, who are dealing with this and all other aspects of the treatment of juvenile offenders and young people at risk.</P>
    <P>A Garda schools programme is now in place in 14 Dublin schools and will be extended to other population centres shortly and I have obtained Government approval for the recruitment of a team of 31 extra probation officers in the current year to provide for an intensive supervision regime for about 200 offenders in the community as an alternative to custody.</P>
    <P>There has been a major response to neighbourhood watch schemes with over 1,046 schemes now in operation covering 202,175 households.  The rural equivalent of neighbourhood watch community alert is now in place in 245 locations around the country.</P>
    <P>I am examining comprehensive proposals on rural policing aimed at securing an enhanced service to the public from the Garda Síochána in the areas affected. These proposals do not involve the closure of any Garda station or any reduction in Garda numbers attached to any station which might benefit from the scheme.  I intend to make decisions in relation to all aspects of the rural policing reform proposals in the very near future.</P>
    <P>On the legislative front I have been responsible for significant advances and, would instance in particular: the Larceny Act, 1989; the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990; and the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1990 and the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>The question of drug-related criminal activity has again become the subject of widespread and justifiable public concern. People feel that this menace, which was brought within bounds in recent years, is re-emerging as a problem on our streets.  I have discussed this issue in depth with the Garda authorities who, while reporting an increase in the level of drug seizures in recent years, mostly cannabis, say there is no question of the problem being on the scale which existed some years ago.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the House that <Col N="414" /> the drugs problem is continuing to receive priority attention from a law enforcement point of view.  All members of the Garda Síochána deal with law enforcement aspects of drug misuse within their operational area.  In addition, specific Garda drug squads operate in Dublin, Cork and Limerick and at present small specialist units are in operation in Dublin's north inner city, Ballymun, Ballyfermot and Tallaght.  Similar specialist units are set up on a temporary basis in other areas as required.  The strategies employed include intelligence gathering and analysis, surveilance, targeting and monitoring the activities of suspects, as well as routine investigations.</P>
    <P>There exists a high level of on-going liaison with the Customs authorities, which provides for exchange of information and for joint operations in major cases.  This liaison includes meetings, as required, at senior level to exchange information and views on current trends and mutual problems.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the strategies are proving very effective.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to develop and coordinate effective measures against drugs on an international level and this problem is being addressed in a number of fora in which representatives from this country are actively involved, such as TREVI (Police Group), CELAD (Co-ordinators), MAG (Customs Group), Pompidou (Council of Europe) and the United Nations.  However, law enforcement on its own will never solve the drugs problem.  This is an area in which the role of parents, teachers and other agencies caring for our young people is at least as important as the Garda response.</P>
    <P>The need for a national drugs strategy has been recognised by the Government. My colleague the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, recently launched the Government strategy to prevent drug misuse.  Our intention is to tackle the drug problem on every front.  Realistic and achievable objectives have been set for the reduction both in the supply and demand for drugs.</P>
    <P>Again, on the legislative side, I have announced plans which I believe will <Col N="415" /> make a major contribution towards the fight against drugs.  Very shortly I shall publish legislation to provide for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and money laundering.  I have no doubt that this legislation will be widely welcomed.</P>
    <P>Before I return to the technicalities of the 1984 Act and the particular sections we are considering, I would like to make a point which I think needs to be made over and over again &mdash; not only by Ministers for Justice but by everybody in a position of influence such as the Members of this House &mdash; and that is, that all the legislation and resources in the world are of limited value in the fight against crime unless there is effective co-operation between the community and its police force.</P>
    <P>I had the privilege within the past week of hosting a TREVI seminar attended by senior police officers and appropriate Ministry representatives from countries on the subject of community oriented policing.  The pre-dominant message which came across from this seminar is that ultimately police effectiveness is not just a matter of numbers or equipment or policing methods but is determined above all else by the level of co-operation and trust existing between the police force and the community it serves.  Studies have shown that only a small percentage of crime detection arises from what are commonly believed to be classic police methods &mdash; the type of thing portrayed in American detective series on our TV screens.</P>
    <P>By far the most effective element in crime prevention is vigilance by the community itself, coupled with a high level of co-operation between the police and individual members of the public who contact the authorities when they have any information which may help in solving a particular crime.  The core of my message today is that the future of law enforcement in this country depends on mutual trust and co-operation between the community and the Garda in the fight against crime.</P>
    <P>The bringing into operation of the <Col N="416" /> sections of the 1984 Act referred to in the motion was subject under section 1 (2) of the Act, to two important matters.  The first of these was the enactment of legislation relating to the investigation and adjudication of complaints from the public against members of the Garda Síochána.  Secondly, there was a requirement that regulations be made under section 7 of the Act for the treatment of persons in Garda custody.  Following the enactment of the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986, which provides procedures for handling Garda complaints, the Garda Síochána Complaints Board were set up under the Act in April 1987.</P>
    <P>In view of the backlog of complaints with the board, perhaps I should say something about the matter and the operation of the board generally.  The Act requires the board to keep under review the working of the system of investigation and adjudication of complaints and to make a report thereon every three years. The first such report by the board, their triennial report, 1987 to 1989, was published just a year ago and gave a very full account of the board's activities up to then.  It contained comments and recommendations on the Act and included chapters on staffing and on possible less costly alternatives to the present system. However, it is particularly noteworthy that the board indicate in the report that their conclusion is that the Complaints Act is basically sound and provides an adequate legislative basis for the proper investigation and adjudication of complaints.</P>
    <P>With regard to staffing, the report referred to a less than satisfactory situation and called for additional permanent staff for the board plus temporary staff to clear the backlog of complaints.  The receipt of a greater number of complaints than anticipated when the staffing complement was being decided was a major cause of the backlog of arrears.  However, the volume of complaints received is dropping steadily since 1987 and I understand that this is in line with the experience in other countries when a new complaints board are established.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="417" /> I, of course, share the board's concern about the backlog of complaints.  My concern is both with the position of the public and with that of the members of the force about whom complaints are made and in whose interests it is that complaints should be dealt with promptly.  It was for this reason that, on assuming office as Minister for Justice in July 1989, and on being made aware of the board's position, I immediately took up with the Minister for Finance the question of additional staffing resources for the board.  I subsequently obtained agreement for the sanctioning of four extra staff members for the board, thereby increasing their complement from six to ten.  All of these extra staff were made available by redeployment from else where in the public service and assigned to the board by December 1989.  The nature of the work involved, however, means that it takes some time for additional staff to make an impact on the volume of arrears. I am glad to say, however, that the impact of the extra staff is reflected in the reduction which has been brought about in the real backlog of complaints from about 750 last November to under 500 today, a decrease of about one-third in six months.</P>
    <P>However, it is my wish that the backlog would be cleared completely and, therefore, notwithstanding this improvement, I am still actively pursuing the possibility of providing further staff resources for the board and provision for this purpose has been made in the board's allocation in this year's Estimates.</P>
    <P>The second matter I referred to earlier, namely, regulations regarding the treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations, came into force in May 1987. The regulations include provision, as required by the 1984 Act, for the assignment to a member of the Garda Síochána of appropriate rank in each Garda station of responsibility for overseeing the application of the regulations to persons in custody.  That responsibility includes such matters as ensuring that persons in custody are informed of their rights and arranging for a solicitor to be contacted <Col N="418" /> or some other person to be notified where a person in custody has decided to exercise those entitlements.  The member in charge also has overall responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of custody records which provide a full and detailed account of any period during which persons are in custody in the Garda station. The regulations were approved by both Houses prior to their being brought into operation.</P>
    <P>I turn now to each of the sections of the 1984 Act which are the subject of the motion before the House.  Section 4 of the Act gives the Garda power to detain for up to six hours a person who has been arrested without warrant for an offence carrying a penalty of at least five years imprisonment.  The six-hour detention period may be extended for a further six hours on the authority of a Garda superintendent.  A period between midnight and 8 a.m., during which questioning does not take place, may be excluded in calculating the permitted period of detention if certain requirements, which include the agreement in writing of the suspect, are satisfied.</P>
    <P>In considering section 4 it is important to bear in mind that it contains the only general legislative power the Garda have to detain, for questioning, persons who are reasonably suspected of having committed a serious crime.  There is a power to arrest and detain persons under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, but that provision deals only with a limited range of crimes &mdash; it does not cover, for example, ordinary murder, rape or robbery.</P>
    <P>Prior to the late 1970s the Garda operated on the basis that they could ask a suspect to go to a Garda station to &ldquo;help them with their inquiries&rdquo;.  That situation changed completely about 1977 when the courts overturned the Garda practice in these situations and held that it was unlawful.  The courts also rejected as inadmissible in evidence confessions or incriminating statements obtained during periods when it was adjudged that an accused person had been unlawfully detained.</P>
    <P>The Garda difficulties in the matter <Col N="419" /> were also exacerbated by court decisions to the effect that where a person went to a Garda station voluntarily and the stage was reached where he came under suspicion for the offence, then he had to be told by the Garda that he was free to leave the station unless and until he was arrested.  That new requirement could involve interrupting a suspect who was freely making a statement containing an admission of guilt and from a Garda viewpoint it virtually destroyed the practical value of being able to &ldquo;invite&rdquo; persons to the station.</P>
    <P>The position prior to section 4 which I have mentioned helps to illustrate the problems the Garda faced before its enactment.  The need for the detention powers as such in section 4 is, I think, beyond dispute.  Much more extensive detention powers for investigating crime operate in other European countries; in the United Kingdom, for example, detention in police custody for up to 36 hours is permitted for the investigation of a serious offence and after that period the suspect may be brought before a magistrate who may order the person to be further detained up to a maximum of 36 hours.</P>
    <P>The real question we have to ask ourselves is whether safeguards built into section 4 to minimise abuse are satisfactory and have in fact minimised abuse. The safeguards in the section are stringent. Before a person can be detained, he must have been arrested, with reasonable cause, on suspicion of having committed a serious offence.  The member in charge of the Garda station to which the suspect is taken must have reasonable grounds for believing that detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence.  The arresting Garda and the member in charge are liable to be cross-examined on the reasonableness of their actions and it is open to a court to decide whether, in all the circumstances, their actions were justified.  This is also the situation where a Garda superintendent extends detention beyond an initial six hours.  The superintendent can only authorise such an extension on the basis of <Col N="420" /> reasonable grounds for believing that further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence.</P>
    <P>The operation of section 4 is limited in other important respects.  A detained person must be released forthwith if there are no longer reasonable grounds for suspecting that he has committed the offence for which detention is permissible. Once a person is charged, questioning must stop and the person must be brought before a district justice as soon as practicable.</P>
    <P>Senators will be interested, therefore, in the way in which section 4 has operated in practice.  The Garda authorities were requested to maintain statistics on the operation of the section and the relevant information is contained in a table which I have arranged to be circulated to Senators.</P>
    <P>In the period 1 July 1987, to 31 December 1990, a total of 24,095 persons were detained under section 4.  This, I believe, demonstrates the importance of section 4 to the Garda.  Of those who were detained, 58 per cent were charged with an offence for which they were held under the section.  That figure comprises those who were charged immediately or on the spot, so to speak, and those who were released without charge but subsequently charged with an offence for which they had been detained.  The very high proportion of persons charged provides a clear indication that persons are being detained under section 4 where there is a real suspicion that they have committed a serious crime.  It is also significant that the number of cases where detention was extended beyond six hours was approximately 16 per cent of the total number of persons detained.  That figure could not be described as excessive and certainly lends weight to the view that the Garda have exercised their powers under section 4 in a responsible manner.</P>
    <P>This is something that also emerges from the statistics for the length of time after which persons were charged or were released without charge; for example, well over 50 per cent of the persons who were released without charge were released after detention for under three <Col N="421" /> hours; and detention was extended in only 11 per cent of cases where the person was released and not charged.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say, on the basis of the information available to me, that section 4, containing as it does reasonable powers of detention and safeguards, should indeed continue to be part of our law.</P>
    <P>Section 5, 6 and 8 to 10 referred to in the motion are related in one form or another to section 4 but are important provisions in their own right.  Section 5 imposes a duty on the member in charge of a Garda station to inform a person detained under section 4 that he is entitled to consult a solicitor and to have notification of his detention and whereabouts sent to another person.  Upon request, the member in charge is required to cause a solicitor and a person named by the detainee to be notified.  Where the detained person is under 17 years of age, a parent or guardian of that person must be informed of his detention.  I might point out that the Supreme Court has since held, in People (DPP) <i>v</i>.  Healy (December 1989), that a person detained by the Garda has a constitutional right to consult a solicitor.</P>
    <P>Section 6 gives necessary powers to the Garda authorities to carry out a full and proper investigation of the offence or offences for which a person is detained under section 4.  A garda may obtain the name and address of the detained person, search him, photograph him, take his fingerprints and palm prints and seize and retain for testing anything he has in his possession.  The section also allows swabs from skin or samples of hair to be taken for the purpose of testing for contact with firearms or explosives.  However, the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, repeals and re-enacts that provision with more extensive provisions in relation to the taking of bodily samples. Arrangements are being made to bring that Act into operation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The section places a number of restrictions on the Garda where the exercise of the more intrusive powers conferred is involved.  A detained person cannot be photographed or fingerprinted or <Col N="422" /> required to remove certain clothing without the prior authority of a Garda superintendent.</P>
    <P>There must, in exercising those powers, be reasonable cause to suspect that the person is concealing drugs or explosives on his person.  Senators will note from the table I have circulated that the number of cases where fingerprints were taken under section 6 for the period 1 July 1987, to the end of December 1990, was 5,501 and that a search involving the removal of underclothing was authorised in 1,274 cases.  These figures represent 23 per cent and 5 per cent respectively of the total number of persons detained and there is nothing in them to suggest that the powers conferred on the Garda are being excessively used.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that every copy and record of a photograph, fingerprint and palm print of a person taken under section 6 must be destroyed after six months if the detained person is not prosecuted or if he is acquitted.  The person concerned is entitled to witness, or to have another person witness, the destruction of photographs, etc., if he so requests.  In the event that the DPP wishes to retain section 6 material when it would otherwise have to be destroyed, he must satisfy a district justice that the material may be required for the purpose of criminal proceedings in relation to the offence for which the person was detained.</P>
    <P>Section 9 applies certain provisions of the 1984 Act to detention under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  These include the right of access to a solicitor and the requirement that the taking of photographs and fingerprints must be authorised by a Garda superintendent or higher officer.</P>
    <P>Section 10 contains safeguards against re-arrest and detention under section 4 for the same offence.  A detained person may not be arrested again for the same offence unless it is for the purpose of charging him with the offence immediately or the Garda receive further information and a district justice authorises the re-arrest.</P>
    <P>A similar restriction operates in <Col N="423" /> relation to the use of section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act where a section 4 detainee is released because, in order to detain that person under section 30, he would have to be arrested and, accordingly, section 10 would apply.  A person, who is arrested for an offence under section 30 and not charged, cannot be detained under section 4 for the same offence or for an offence of which he was or reasonably ought to have been suspected at the time of the initial arrest.</P>
    <P>I turn now to sections 15, 16, 18 and 19 of the 1984 Act covering certain matters other than detention.  Sections 15 and 16, respectively, make it an offence to withhold information about the source of illegally held firearms and ammunition, and stolen property.  The Garda must have reasonable grounds to suspect that the firearm, ammunition or stolen property is illegally held.</P>
    <P>The Garda must also explain to the person the consequences of his failure to provide the required information.  Any information given cannot be used against the person or his spouse unless he is charged with an offence under the section.  Although the number of prosecutions under the sections have been few, I am advised by the Garda authorities that the provisions are of importance in Garda efforts to get at the source of supply of arms used for criminal purposes and the source of stolen property. There were four and five prosecutions, respectively, under sections 15 and 16 for the period July 1987 to the end of December 1990.</P>
    <P>Section 18 allows a court or a jury to draw an inference from the failure or refusal of an accused, when questioned by a Garda, to account for objects, substances or marks found on his person or clothing, in his possession or at the place where he is arrested without warrant.</P>
    <P>The idea behind the section is that a suspect could be expected to account for, say, a stain on his clothing which might be attributable to his participation in a specific offence.  This is no more than common sense and it is something a jury <Col N="424" /> would, in any event, be fully aware of apart from this section.</P>
    <P>Section 19 allows an inference to be drawn where the arrested person fails or refuses to account for his presence at or about the time the offence for which he was arrested was committed.  The garda must inform the person about the consequences of his failure or refusal to comply with the sections and a person cannot be convicted solely on the basis of an inference drawn under those sections. The number of persons failing to comply with sections 18 and 19 was only two and 13, respectively, for the period 1 July 1987 to the end of December 1990.</P>
    <P>Apart from the statistics I have made available about the numbers of cases arising under the sections of the 1984 Act, Senators will be interested to know that the Garda Complaints Board have informed me that while the statistical system operated by the board does not link complaints to specific sections in the 1984 Act, or indeed any other Act, the board can say that they have received very few complaints relating to the 1984 Act.</P>
    <P>That more or less concludes what I have to say about the sections referred to in the motion.  However, I should like to say something about another section in the Act &mdash; section 27 &mdash; which provides that the Minister for Justice may provide for the recording by electronic or other similar means of the questioning of persons by members of the Garda Síochána in connection with the investigation of offences.  The need for such recording was considered in detail by the Martin Committee in the context of their examination of the need for additional safeguards, given that an uncorroborated inculpatory admission to the Garda Síochána can be sufficient evidence to ground a conviction.</P>
    <P>The Martin Committee, in their report, outline the many safeguards which exist at present in relation to Garda questioning of suspects, for example the right to remain silent, the Judges' Rules, the right of access to legal advice, the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986 <Col N="425" /> and the responsibility which the treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Síochána Stations Regulations, 1987 place on the member in charge in a Garda station in relation to persons in custody. Indeed, it is worth noting that the Martin Committee state, and I am quoting here from their report, that:</P>
    <P>We should state, however, that the submissions received from practitioners, and in particular from defence practitioners, are unanimous to the effect that the coming into force of the Regulations for the Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Stations coupled with the setting up of the Garda Complaints Board, has resulted in the virtual disappearance of complaints of physical ill-treatment or threats of violence.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, is that the existing safeguards, and in particular those which were introduced subsequent to the 1984 Act play a very important role in ensuring that the rights of the persons being questioned are upheld.</P>
    <P>My Department and the Garda authorities looked into the possibility of introducing arrangements for the audio recording, that is, sound only, of the questioning of suspects by the Garda Síochána, similar to arrangements which were in operation in some other countries. However, in view of developments in technology, some countries which had introduced audio recording, are now trying out video recording on a trial basis.</P>
    <P>The Martin Committee also considered the question of introducing audio recording, which would cost substantially less than video recording, but came down in favour of the latter.  We are now in a position to avail ourselves of the experience of other countries in relation to both audio and video recording and to ensure that any system introduced takes account of the lessons learned in other countries and make the best use of scarce financial resources.</P>
    <P>As you will appreciate, the introduction of video recording means that video evidence, even during a pilot scheme, will be available to the court. <Col N="426" /> It is essential, therefore, that all issues regarding the operation of the system are decided upon in advance of the introduction of a pilot scheme.  I am considering this matter at present and I hope to be in a position to put proposals in relation to a pilot scheme to the Government shortly.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that all of the sections of the 1984 Act referred to in the motion should continue in operation.  The view of the Garda authorities is that the provisions have played a vital role in the detection and prosecution of serious crime.  It seems clear also that the provisions have played their part in deterring people from criminal acts.  I have no doubt that, as regards the section 4 detention provisions in particular, the vast majority of people would accept that the Garda, for the purpose of questioning and conducting investigations and inquiries, must have the power to detain, for a reasonable period those persons who are suspected of having committed crimes which may include murder, drug trafficking and serious robbery.</P>
    <P>All the indications now in the light of experience of the four years of their operation is that the 1984 Act provisions in question have operated satisfactorily. I, therefore, commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome and support this motion.  It is interesting to note that the 1984 Act was introduced by the Minister for Justice of the time, Deputy Noonan.  It is also interesting to note that from 1973 to 1983 the number of indictable offences increased from 38,022 to 102,387 and from 1983 to 1989 that number has dropped to 86,792.  This is an unacceptable figure but it demonstrates the marginal success of the legislation and the necessity to keep the sections mentioned here in operation.  Unfortunately, our society is prone to crime and this does not address the causes of crime.  We must deal with the causes of crime and tackle them.  Social deprivation and the high level of unemployment play a major role in people turning to crime. We must tackle that problem, we must <Col N="427" /> increase the level of prosperity and, above all, disburse it to all sections of our society.  We must ensure that the sections of society in which petty crime occurs do not feel alienated by the approach of our society.  The Government must tackle the problem of crime, they must combat and control it.</P>
      <P>Crime is also big business and professional criminals make a great deal of money from it.  It is a very profitable business and I am glad to note that the Minister will publish legislation shortly to provide for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and money laundering.  I ask the Minister to extend that to other areas of crime where confiscation of the proceeds can be introduced. Many hardened criminals are aware that if they are sentenced and have put away the proceeds of their ill-gotten gains they will be available to them when they return or they will be available to their families in their absence.  The proceeds from crimes such as robbery should also be included in the legislation which the Minister has promised.</P>
      <P>Our Constitution obliges us to protect our citizens from unjust attack.  It provides that the State shall by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen.  The Act has had an effect on the incidence of petty crime but it has not been effective in respect of serious crime.  This is an area that should be specifically looked at and Fine Gael have been calling for some time for a report from the Law Reform Commission and for legislation to deal with serious crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael and the Garda are concerned about our laws in relation to bail and this has been spoken about over the past few months.  It is accepted that our bail laws need to be tightened up so that the courts do not have to free people who are likely to commit further serious crime while on bail.  In 1989 the number of crimes committed by people on bail was 2,647.  The problem is that bail cannot be refused by the courts on the grounds that <Col N="428" /> the criminal is likely to commit further serious crime.  A constitutional amendment is necessary to restore this discretion to the courts.  I ask, as a matter of urgency, that the Government use the opportunity on 27 June to introduce a referendum to allow a change in the law to give discretion back to the courts for the granting of bail.  The courts are well aware at present that these people commit further serious crime.</P>
    <P>Section 4, as the Minister said, deals with detention after arrest for a reasonable period of time.  This is absolutely necessary to allow the Garda to investigate crime and question people in a proper fashion.  Nobody would suggest that that should be done in anything other than a humane, reasonable and proper fashion.  To do that job, they must have time to do forensic and other tests, as the Minister mentioned.  Prior to this Act it was illegal to detain a subject for questioning except under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act.  The Garda acted as if they had the power and operated the practice of bringing a person to a Garda station and it was referred to as helping the police with their inquiries. They did detain people at that time, or people believed they were detained, but it was found to be illegal.  The admission of statements or confessions under such circumstances did not stand up to the challenge of the courts subsequently. Criminals became very adept at making confessions in such circumstances and the courts had to acquit them.  Sections 4 to 10 of the Act give the Garda power to do their job properly.  Prior to the introduction of this legislation it was assumed they had the power to detain people and the Garda acted accordingly.</P>
    <P>The questioning of suspects is an important element in the investigation of any crime.  The Thompson Committee which investigated criminal procedures in Scotland in its report in 1975 recognised this and recommended that the police should be given power to detain suspects. They said:</P>
    <P>The policeman's real difficulty arises in investigations when he wants to <Col N="429" /> interview a suspect or prevent him from interfering with evidence such as stolen property.  At present the police are powerless to act without the consent of the very person who is likely to have most interest in refusing to give that consent.  Clearly the police should not be entitled to arrest anyone they want to interview but it seems plainly wrong, for example, that a suspected violent criminal with significant evidence on his clothing has to be left at large while the police seek other evidence of his guilt sufficient to entitle them to charge.</P>
    <P>Arrest under the Act must be on the grounds of reasonable submission and cannot be indiscriminately applied.  It allows for reasonable access to a solicitor and under section 5 allows access to a solicitor for persons under 17.  In fact, the person detained must be informed, without delay, that he is entitled to a solicitor and in the case of a person under 17 the parent or guardian must also be informed.  Section 8 deals with the destruction of records and people who are not charged can actually supervise the destruction of such records.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 and 16 deal with the withholding of information in the use of firearms; they allow the Garda to attempt to get to the source of those firearms and, therefore, are aimed at those who supply the guns.  Those sections also deal with stolen property and the charging of persons found in possession of stolen property. They deal with the receiver of stolen property and, as the Minister said, this was expanded in the legislation introduced last year.</P>
    <P>Sections 18 and 19 do not compel a person to give information where he or she is found in suspicious circumstances but the courts can draw adverse inferences from such refusals.  As I said earlier, Fine Gael have asked for a criminal law reform body to be established to advise and report on the updating and qualification of our criminal law.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to his meeting with the TREVI group at the TREVI seminar in the past week.  Will he inform <Col N="430" /> the House what developments, if any, have been made with regard to the opening of our borders in 1992 and the implications this will have for criminal elements?  There is much concern within sections of the Garda Síochána that the opening of the borders will lead to an increase in the level of crime.  Have any developments taken place with regard to the harmonisation of our laws, the harmonisation of police services and the equipping of police throughout Europe? It is accepted that there should be uniformity in those areas to ensure that there will be a co-ordinated approach by all police services throughout Europe when the borders are opened in 1992.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Garda Complaints Board.  While we accept that there has been a reduction in the backlog of complaints from 750 last November to 500 today, this is still an unacceptable figure.  The Minister said that more staff will be provided to ensure a further reduction of this figure and we look forward to that.  The Minister's aim should be to eliminate the backlog in a short time and ensure that complaints are dealt with immediately both from the point of view of the people who complain and of gardaí who find that most of the complaints are vexatious anyway and should be taken off their agenda.  They should not be left hanging over them for several years as is the case at present.</P>
    <P>We also welcome the Minister's statement in relation to the introduction of video-recording in obtaining evidence and in the questioning of suspects.  I appreciate that the implications must be looked into in great detail but we look forward to its speedy introduction.  I welcome the motion which has the support of my party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for coming here today to discuss this very important motion.  In summary, the effect of this motion is to ensure that certain provisions the Criminal Justice Act shall continue in operation.  We are not dealing with new legislation; this motion hopes to carry on the provisions of the 1984 Act which <Col N="431" /> came into effect on 30 June 1987.  That Act contained the very wise provision that those sections would be reviewed and unless the extension is granted the provisions under those Acts will automatically lapse.  In other words, we have to decide if the provisions in the sections set out here are prudent, are working well and so on.  As a result of what the Minister has outlined, there is no doubt that the provisions contained in those sections should be extended.</P>
      <P>I would like to put on record my pleasure at some of the figures and statistics the Minister announced.  It is significant that despite growing drug problems and more sophisticated criminals on the streets, the Government and the Minister are enjoying relative success in the area of fighting crime.  In the period 1984-90 overall crime figures fell by about 12 per cent.  It is gratifying that the number of convictions of criminals in the same period rose by 10 per cent.  This is something any Government and Minister can be proud of.  We all concede that crime is an ongoing problem.  We must protect society and this is the prime motive of the Minister and the Garda who should be lauded for the work they are doing.  From time to time we hear criticism of the Garda and the introduction of the Garda Complaints Body is welcome, but overall the Garda Síochána, from the commissioner right down to the garda on the beat, are doing an excellent job.  We do not give them enough praise.  Perhaps there are a few bad apples &mdash; and this has come to light because of complaints against gardaí &mdash; but 99 per cent of the Garda force, in uniform or plain clothes, are decent, hard-working people doing an excellent job for the protection of the citizens of this State.  They deserve great praise for the work they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also significant that offences against the person have dropped by 30 per cent, from 2,331 to 1,631.  This is very laudable because one of the most notorious and despicable crimes is the crime against the person, physical violence and so on.  The fact that there has <Col N="432" /> been almost a one-third drop over a period of years suggests that the provisions of the 1984 Act, especially the sections mentioned here, are working well.  It is also worth mentioning that attacks on the elderly &mdash; a very despicable crime &mdash; have dropped by almost 90 per cent, from 432 to 51.  This indicates that the policy of the Government, the Minister of the day and, indeed, of the Garda is working well.  There are also falling figures with regard to residential burglaries, unauthorised taking of cars and larcenies from persons.  These dropped by 23 per cent.  This is a significant reduction and, of course, we would love to see it decrease further.  It is the intention of the Government and the Minister to ensure that those figures are maintained and possibly in four or five years' time the percentage figures mentioned will have increased and we will see a downfall in crime.  Any sane citizen would like to see this happening.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant drop in armed raids.  About nine or ten years ago armed raids were commonplace throughout this country.  The job being done in this area by the Garda, with back-up from the Army and the Department, is significant and praiseworthy.  We should also laud the Minister and the Department for the fact that in the last two years 1,000 new gardaí have been recruited and there are plans to recruit a further 1,000. This indicates the sincerity and concern of the Government and the Minister in relation to putting extra gardaí on the streets.  Other efforts are being made by the Department and the Minister to involve civilians in secretarial work, etc., in an effort to release more gardaí on to the streets.  In this respect 300 or 400 senior gardaí in the ranks of sergeant, superintendent and inspector are being allowed to stay on after reaching retirement age to ensure that their experience will be used in the fight against crime. This is indeed significant.</P>
    <P>The budget figure of £40 million for capital expenditure by the Department of Justice last year is significant.  I was glad to see the Minister, Deputy Burke, opening a new Garda station in Bandon, <Col N="433" /> west Cork last Friday.  It is a great asset to the area.  I have had personal experience of the old station through working with some of the gardaí and superintendents and from court work.  It was a very outdated, antiquated, 200-year-old station.  Now they are in a new building, well equipped with every type of facilities available for the gardaí This gives a morale boost to the force.  That expenditure in providing new facilities for gardaí is to be lauded.</P>
    <P>The drive by the Department and the Minister to improve the lot of our citizens must not go without praise.  The neighbourhood watch and community alert schemes have worked very well.  These schemes are common around the country in towns, villages and rural areas.  I come from a rural constituency where these schemes work very well.  It is important that the gardaí have the back-up of the community.  The vigilant individuals in the community who take part in the neighbourhood watch and community alert schemes are certainly an important factor in the fight against crime.  I am sure the Minister accepts the value of these schemes in the protection of our citizens and in the overall fight against crime. They are very praiseworthy schemes and I hope they will continue.  Crime prevention is better than trying to resolve the problem once the crime has been committed.  In my own area in west Cork a few years ago gangs from the city came out regularly and attacked properties, holiday homes, etc., which were unoccupied, and took valuable goods.  These community alert schemes offer a means of protecting houses which are unoccupied for a number of months of the year.  This is certainly something that must be praised and given recognition. The trust of the public in the Garda must be nurtured and improved as much as possible.  The gardaí are doing an excellent job and with the support and back-up of the community they serve they can indeed improve the lot of all parties concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is most important.  Up to 1987, when the legislation came into force, practitioners, gardaí and the courts <Col N="434" /> had to rely more or less on the judges' rules, which were an unwritten code of law in relation to people in custody.  Many of the judges' rules have been incorporated in the 1984 Act.  From my own experience as a practising solicitor, I believe that section 4 works very well. Recently at 4 a.m. the local Garda sergeant phoned me and asked me to see a person being held in custody.  I found that the person was being treated very well. The whole scenario of this section was brought into play.  The person was brought into custody late at night, tired and under the influence of alcohol.  He was given the opportunity by the gardaí to avail of some rest, which made him fresher in the morning.  I thought it was an excellent idea.  That person was treated very well.  After six hours in detention he was released.  The system in that practical example worked very well, to the benefit of both the gardaí and of the person being held in custody.</P>
    <P>The statistics bear out that a large number of people in custody for the six-hour detention period are dealt with in that period.  For a person in custody for questioning or otherwise to be detained for longer than six hours the authority of a person of no lesser grade than a Garda superintendent must be obtained and he must show just cause.  The onus is on him, should he be questioned by a district justice or in any other court, to show that he has reasonable cause to lengthen the period of time the person in custody should be detained.  All the figures show that this section has worked very well.  It is important to strike a balance between the right of the person in custody, for questioning or otherwise, and the duty of gardaí to do a proper job.  The job of the gardaí can be very difficult and unless they have some room to manoeuvre our citizens will be at a greater loss and subjected to greater spates of crime.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Act from my own personal experience &mdash; I do not want to go into practical examples &mdash; have worked well.  This motion should get the support of this House.  I can understand the anxiety of Senators on the other side <Col N="435" /> of the House from time to time and my good friend and colleague, Senator Norris, will have certain remarks to make.  While I can understand their anxiety, one must realise that we are not going to get a Utopian justice system in any part of Europe.  We would love to see it, but overall the working of section 4 has been admirable and the statistics back up the success of the section.  We propose here to extend it for a further period of four years, when I understand it will again be under review.  It will not be extended indefinitely.  It is important to note that.  It certainly warrants a further four-year period to prove that it has been successful and that it is useful and necessary in the fight against crime.</P>
    <P>Some of the other provisions in the Act arise because in the seventies a number of High Court cases, as they related to the questioning by gardaí of people in custody, had proved that the system up to then had been inoperable.  This legislation provides some sort of a framework to ensure that gardaí can do the job which they are obliged to do as protectors of our citizens and property and at the same time individuals in custody get fair play.  They are entitled to access to a solicitor and to make phone calls and they are entitled not to be detained beyond a maximum six-hour period.  If this period is to be extended it is only in extreme circumstances, where a Garda superintendent is satisfied that another six-hour period is warranted.  Indeed, the onus is on the Garda superintendent in question to satisfy himself that this is indeed necessary and warranted.</P>
    <P>The statistics show that 58 per cent of those held under section 4 were charged with an offence for which they were held under that section.  This is a clear indication that the gardaí do not, willy-nilly, bring people in for questioning and hold them in custody.  They do it where there is a genuine suspicion that the person has probably been involved in a crime.  The fact that almost 60 per cent of these are subsequently charged is an important statistic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>He will have his day. We are not going to get a Utopian situation. We must have some sort of meaningful working set-up whereby gardaí can bring people in for questioning.  If a garda has a suspicion when a crime is committed, surely six hours in a Garda barracks is very reasonable.  Regarding the 42 per cent who are released without charge, it should be noted that there is always a certain element of these who are rearrested and brought back in.  It does not indicate that the Garda are abusing the system.  Far from it.</P>
      <P>The other sections deal with the obligation on the Garda to allow the person in custody to contact a solicitor.  This in the normal course of events works quite well.  In one instance where somebody in custody was being questioned in connection with a serious crime the Garda sergeant contacted six different firms of solicitors before he eventually got someone out of his bed.  That indicates that it was not just one phone call.  The Garda sergeant was a responsible person and was anxious to ensure that the person in custody would get the advice of some solicitor in the early hours of the morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, particularly these sections which we are dealing with today, have worked very well.  They are practical provisions and they deserve a further four-year term.  Although there may be certain suspicions by other Senators as to their propriety, the statistics prove that they have worked well.  Crime rates in Ireland are falling.  The success rate of the Garda and of the system of justice has increased <Col N="437" /> and the extension for a further four-year period is very reasonable.  I recommend and urge the House to accept that this be done.  It will be up for review again in four years time.  It has worked well and it must be lauded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for his courtesy in providing me with the sections of this Act which it is proposed to continue.  I oppose them and I will be making, I think, a very reasoned case for opposing the continuation of these sections.  It seems to me that what we are doing here is attempting to use an atom bomb to kill a greenfly.  The Garda already had a considerable range of powers.  I do not think it is quite understood by many people who appear to support these provisions precisely what is involved or the fact that under the operation of these regulations precisely those situations which occurred in the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four cases, about which we waxed so lyrical in this country, would not only be permitted but would be encouraged to take place.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his speech made great play of the fact that this has already been passed.  Indeed it has, during a period when there was considerable hysteria about crime figures.  We were told about crime waves and so on, but I would like to point out that the Labour Party, who themselves promoted the 1984 Act when they were in Coalition with Fine Gael, attempted to alter the situation in November 1989 by introducing a Bill which would ensure that no person was convicted on the basis of an uncorroborated incriminating confession.  I suggest that reinforces a belief that many of the people who actually voted for that measure in 1984 did not fully understand the implications of what they were voting on and at least some of those who did subsequently tried to backtrack as fast as they could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the statistics on crime, nothing that I say should be taken as an attack upon the Garda in general.  I would like to endorse things that were said from all sides of the House.  We have an excellent police force here who have my <Col N="438" /> respect, admiration and gratitude.  That does not mean that they are saints and it does not mean that the technical aspects of this legislation do not foster a situation in which there is a possibility of abuse. There has been abuse in the past.  I would exonerate the vast majority of gardaí but the possibility does exist and it is necessary that we tackle it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the crime figures I was very glad the Minister said it is a mistake to exaggerate the fact that there has been a decline.  I would like to place very clearly on the record of this House that there was a substantial drop in the crime rate between 1984 and 1987, the three years before these provisions came into operation.  That does not suggest that these provisions were necessary.  In fact, it suggests to me that they were quite unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I have to bow, of course, to my colleague and friend on the Government side who is a professionally qualified legal person which I am not.  There are a number of legal people who would feel some disquiet and who would maintain that, for example, under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, very wide powers exist already for the Garda.  There is a clear factual record that section 30 has been used to arrest suspects and round up people who could provide information about suspects.  In other words, it has been used for trawling for information.  If I get the time I will be putting on the record another disturbing fact that there has been a decision in the courts under which somebody who was arrested for a section 30 offence was then questioned about another offence and convicted on the basis of the confession that was obtained as a result of detention under section 30.  That seems to me to be a rather dangerous situation and to encourage the kind of trawling that goes on.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on the record of the House eight cases that give me cause for concern and I would be interested in the Minister's response to them.  There was a very well-known case in 1984 of Joann Hayes, the famous &ldquo;Kerry Babies&rdquo; case where a woman confessed to the murder <Col N="439" /> of a baby in Caherciveen and other members of her family actually corroborated her confession in all its details, including the fact that the baby's body was hidden in a fertiliser bag which was described.  Scientific evidence showed that the baby in Caherciveen could not have been her baby at all.  There is reason to be concerned at the fact that the woman in question was arrested in the first place and that her family signed confessions which agreed on basic points after prolonged investigation and interrogation.  That is the first case.</P>
    <P>The second case involved a man called Mr. Christy Lynch who confessed after 22 hours of interrogation to a murder that it was subsequently determined by the court he could not have committed.  He spent two years in prison for the offence. The Supreme Court said that he had been interrogated in circumstances of &ldquo;harassment and oppression&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the third case a Mr. Paddy Devlin, not I think the politician of the same name, was detained in 1976 in Portarlington Garda station where he alleged he was beaten and a belt was tightened around his neck.  He spent ten days in hospital and was never charged with an offence.</P>
    <P>In 1983 a woman called Amanda McShane was freed by a court in relation to a charge of robbing a post office when it was revealed by her solicitor that a document had been disclosed confessing the offence which it was reported had been written by her but was never signed. In other words, there was a prepared prepackaged all-purpose confession for this crime which she never signed.</P>
    <P>In 1976 there was a celebrated case, the Sallins mail train case, about which I have to say I wish there was a proper judicial inquiry.  It is extraordinary that in this country we are so lyrical about the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and so on and yet in this case where there is a clear miscarriage of justice it is impossible to get justice for Nicky Kelly.  The most disgusting thing of all is that the Government actually use the Denning &ldquo;appalling vista&rdquo; judgment to support <Col N="440" /> what they have done against one of our own citizens.  I find that extraordinary. Two of the accused, Oscar Breathnach and Brian McNally, had their convictions quashed because of oppressive questioning and the denial of access to a lawyer.  Kelly's conviction was affirmed.</P>
    <P>In 1986 there was something that I actually welcome because I fully support the Garda in their crackdown on subversive organisations.  There was a very widespread search for arms and I sincerely hope that the Garda do discover the arms that were imported illegally from a government in Libya with which our present Government feel no difficulty in having friendly relations.  This I find also is an extraordinary fact.  This was in the wake of the <i>Eksund</i> case.  Some of those searches were necessary and I would be at least as delighted as anybody else if they found the appalling quantities of explosives that were involved. However, in this enormous dragnet there were things that gave concern.  There were random, cursory, frivolous excursions into people's homes and flats.  For example, I am aware that the flat of a non-political young woman was raided, with no real excuse; her personal letters were read, her underclothing which was in a laundry basket was investigated simultaneously with her interrogation and she was examined about her acquaintances. No charge was pressed.  That is most extraordinary.</P>
    <P>The final case I would like to cite is one from February 1991, the Damian Marsh case in which Mr. Justice Barron stated that the accused was clearly innocent and should never have been charged.  In this case the Garda witnessess gave contradictory evidence and the prosecution was brought even though the statements in the book of evidence contained marked discrepancies.  The police alleged that he had confessed to a murder after interrogation at the Garda station, although the provisions in the judge's rules about which we heard earlier as to recording confessions in writing appear to have been ignored.  There are eight cases which cause concern.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="441" /> In the work I have done, I have discovered that 40 out of every 100 persons have not been charged.  The Minister supplied a more up-to-date figure of 42.  That comes to 10,000 people held for interrogation but not charged.  That is an extremely worrying situation for anybody who believes in civil liberties.</P>
    <P>The report of the Kerry Babies Tribunal stated that when the Garda develop a hunch about a suspect they are liable to elevate their honest beliefs or suspicions into facts.  This was stated in the report of the tribunal and ought to give us pause for thought, particularly when we are dealing with what used to be know as helping with inquiries, people being invited down to the Garda station to assist the police in their inquiries.  It is clear that in certain circumstances the suspicions elevate themselves &mdash; in the words of the tribunal of inquiry &mdash; into facts.</P>
    <P>With regard to the law and this question of interrogation, the Irish judges have determined that gardaí are not entitled to arrest a person solely for the purpose of interrogating him.  However, if they do arrest a person, that person is detained and they may then, by accident, suddenly hit on something.  As long as there is not a direct cause and effect sequence established in court that does not invalidate the conviction.  In other words it is kind of a nod and wink situation. The Garda can arrest somebody and not say that they are arresting that person for the purpose of interrogation. If they then get a confession, more power to them.  That is also something that ought to give people cause for concern.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 4 of the 1984 Act, the whole thing is kind of elaborate, a tissue, a confection of words calculated to mislead people.  It gives people the impression that there are various safeguards, which do not in fact exist at all under the provisions of legislation.  For example, what is reasonable cause? Reasonable cause could be information supplied by an informer and if the suspect seeks to determine what this reasonable cause is and if it is from an informer, then the Garda do not have to reveal or disclose the source of the information. <Col N="442" /> Even a justice will be very reluctant to do that, particularly if questions of security are pleaded.</P>
    <P>We are told by the Minister that there is a six-hour detention.  We discover then by closer examination that there is actually up to 20 hours.  That ought to be put in context.  The United Kingdom Royal Commission determined that in most cases two hours are all that is necessary for 80 per cent of convictions.  So 20 hours is ten times what has been determined to be the usual, necessary period for securing a conviction.  A number of quite notorious cases in which there have been miscarriages of justice did not require 20 hours or even six hours &mdash; they required far less.  These include the Lynch case, the Joanne Hayes case and the 1991 Damian Marsh case which I already cited.  It is important to bear in mind the fact that two hours seem to have quite a remarkable impact upon people.</P>
    <P>Let us look at this question of the guardian.  The O'Briain Committee recommended the creation of a guardian in the police station who would look after the interest of a detained person.  What have we got?  The officer-in-charge.  That might appear to satisfy some people.  I do not want to impugn the reputation of the police but we must make sure in law that we do not provide for a situation in which abuse may occur.  I would cite the O'Toole and Hickey case of 1990 in which the Criminal Court of Appeal extracted the teeth of this safeguard.  The court decided that it was acceptable if the officer-in-charge was told by the arresting officer that the detention was necessary. In other words, the arresting officer says that it is necessary and the person in charge agrees.  The safeguards are defective.</P>
    <P>Let us look at another one.  This is the question of the admissibility in evidence of a statement even where the Judges' Rules that we have heard of have been abused.  It does not affect them.  Even if there has been a violation amounting to criminal activity on the part of gardaí in extracting a confession, it does not violate the admissibility of the confession. That is precisely what we were talking <Col N="443" /> about in the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four cases.  The fruit of the rotten tree should be suspect but it is actually guaranteed immunity under this legislation. This is utterly deplorable.</P>
    <P>Also there is a variety of treatments from the different judges.  In the first couple of years from 1984 some judges were refusing to send people forward for trial if there was non-compliance with the 1984 Act or the 1987 regulations.  In 1990 in the Keating case, the Supreme Court decided that any probable detention under the 1984 Act should be left to the trial for decision.  This gives a kind of postponed justice.  In other words, the whole question of illegality can wait until the trial and somebody can be subject to injustice for this period.</P>
    <P>Then, of course, there is the whole business of the voluntariness test.  I do not have time to go into this at any length but I would like to point out that the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four convictions passed this test.  Where does that leave us?</P>
    <P>With regard to the offences Against the State Act and the question of ordinary crime, I have already referred to the Quilligan case in 1986 where somebody was arrested under the provisions of section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act and then charged with another crime.  In the 1988 Howley case the Supreme Court went further.  The accused had been arrested and detained under section 30 and when he was in custody he was interrogated about another offence, in relation to which he could not have been detained under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act and the Supreme Court accepted this.  There is a direct parallel with the Dessie Ellis situation here at the moment.  In other words, the Irish Government take one position in their own domestic courts and quite another when they are dealing with foreign courts.</P>
    <P>I will return to this business of voluntariness and cite a couple of cases very quickly.  For example, in the Pringle case in 1981 the judges accepted that a lengthy <Col N="444" /> interrogation while the suspect was in pain from a bullet wound, together with deprivation of sleep, would have amounted to oppression if he had been an ordinary person but his lordship determined that as this man was a fisherman he was therefore used to a life of hardship, so it was no big strain on him.  The Court of Criminal Appeal said: &ldquo;He was apparently an experienced man of the world not unused to conditions of physical hardship.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This brings up the question of inconsistency of court determinations.  In the Shaw case in 1980 the judges ignored the fact that a suspect had been interrogated in a games room in the Garda station where the gardaí maintained they had to hit him a few belts in order to defend themselves against assault from the suspect with a snooker cue.  The judges did not feel it necessary to find out from the Garda why he was interrogated in this most unusual location although in the Breatnach case, the Sallins mail train case, the judges eventually found that interrogating a suspect in a tunnel behind the Garda station took the Garda very close to the limit of breaking the law themselves.  There, again, is an inconsistency.</P>
    <P>In the Lynch case a suspect spent two years in prison for a murder he had not committed but for which he had confessed. The Supreme Court judges decided his confession had been the result of oppressive questioning, but in the Pringle case, which I have already referred to, the judges were prepared to accept a confession which had been obtained in extreme conditions, the reason given, as I said, that the man was a fisherman.  But Lynch was a soldier. Who is going to maintain to me that our Army is wetter, if I may say so, than our fisherman?  Also, there is no independent verification of these procedures.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the question of right of access to a lawyer.  We do not really have it in the way ordinary people would expect.  They are not really positively told they have right of access to a lawyer.  The access is also conditional on the police <Col N="445" /> determining that it is not counterproductive. There are problems also with regard to the holding of minors.  A suspect has no right to a lawyer's advice before interrogation.  They can summon a lawyer, but if he does not turn up or if they cannot afford a lawyer, they have no right and the right is abrogated.  The right to silence has been quenched.  But what about the Winchester Three case? I have my doubts about that myself.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by putting on the record a list of recommendations.  I would like the Minister to introduce, first, a right not to be arrested unless the Garda have an objectively verifiable basis for believing the person has committed a crime; a right to be given the reason for his or her arrest at the time of arrest and a written statement for those reasons as soon as possible after arrest; a right to remain silent in the face of Garda questioning or interrogation; a right to a lawyer upon arrest and to be notified that he or she may not be asked questions until he or she has a chance to consult with a lawyer; a right to a lawyer at the State's expense if he or she cannot afford one; a right to have a lawyer present during interrogation; a right to stop an interrogation at any time and to obtain legal advice at any time; a right to be brought before a court with reasonable speed and, more specifically, before the next sitting of the relevant court; a right to have his or her voluntary confession tape-recorded and to have his or her own copy of the tape; a right to have a confession declared inadmissible at trial unless it can be corroborated by substantial independent evidence.</P>
    <P>There were some positive implications in what the Minister had to say.  I was very glad, for example, that he gave a kind of qualified commitment that he would introduce taping, either by audio tape or video tape, of interrogations in police stations.  I believe that is in the interests of the Garda as well as the general public.  I am opposing this motion for very clear, specific and detailed reasons which should not be construed as an attack upon the Garda for whom I have the highest respect.  I wish them well.  I <Col N="446" /> am glad the crime rate is dropping, but we do not need these draconian laws.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion.  I thank the Minister for Justice for the very comprehensive and informative contribution which he made to this debate.</P>
      <P>The motion refers to those sections of the 1984 Act which will cease to operate after 30 June of this year unless both Houses resolve that they should continue in operation.  As the Minister pointed out, the fundamental purpose of the 1984 Criminal Justice Act was to enhance the capacity of the Garda Síochána to deal with crime.  We must all concede that the 1984 Act has played a vital role in the detection and prosecution of serious crime.</P>
      <P>All of us remember what the situation was in 1984.  It was generally accepted at that time that we had reached the stage where criminal activity was increasing at an alarming rate.  There was growing acceptance among the general public that the Garda were almost powerless in their attempts to deal with the major criminal elements in the country and to deal with the various serious crimes which were being committed.  All the odds seemed to be weighted in favour of the criminals. As a result of the introduction of the 1984 Act and as a result of the powers that were given to the Garda in that Act the situation was redressed.  The powers which were given to the Garda in the 1984 Act are reasonable powers and are no more than are essential for the performance of their duties.  They are the minimum powers required in order to effectively detect and prosecute persons who have been involved in serious crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that there have been very few complaints in relation to the operation of the 1984 Act and, in particular, in relation to the operation of the sections we are dealing with in this motion.  As far as I can recall, I have not heard a single allegation that these sections are not being scrupulously applied and scrupulously implemented by the Garda.  As I said, the 1984 Act has been effective and that is borne out by the statistics which the Minister gave us. <Col N="447" /> There has been a significant reduction in many categories of serious crime.</P>
    <P>Some of the examples the Minister gave us of areas where there has been a very substantial reduction have been attacks upon the elderly, residential burglary and the unauthorised taking of cars. In relation to attacks on the elderly the incidence of that type of crime has dropped by almost 90 per cent since this Act was introduced.  Larcenies are down by 23 per cent and armed raids, which peaked as the Minister said at 685 in 1986, were down by 33 per cent by 1990 to 459.  That is certainly very encouraging.  I was also heartened by the statistics given by the Minister in relation to the allocation of resources to the fight against crime and the increased number of gardaí who are now operating on our streets and involved in police duties and also the fact that an additional 1,000 gardaí will be recruited over the next three years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the assurance given by the Minister in relation to rural policing and in particular his assurance that there are no proposals for the closure of any Garda station or any reduction in Garda numbers attached to any station in rural Ireland.  I welcome those commitments which were given to us by the Minister today.</P>
    <P>In relation to the drug problem and drug-related crime, this is the most difficult area of all to combat and this is the area which in the future will require the most intensive input of both resources and manpower, mainly because of the amount of money involved in the whole drug scene.  I am pleased to hear from the Minister of the new initiatives which have been undertaken and the further initatives which are proposed to deal with this very serious problem in our country. I am also pleased to note that the Minister informed the House that he is shortly to publish legislation which will provide for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and of money laundering.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the importance of co-operation and trust between the police force and the community <Col N="448" /> served by the police force.  Unfortunately, it is in those communities where the crime rate is the lowest that the level of co-operation and trust is highest. It is much more difficult to get the desirable level of co-operation and trust in those areas where crime is endemic and where it is a feature of society.  The co-operation and trust to which the Minister referred is very important, but it is something which will require a considerable amount of hard work and effort if the desirable level is to be achieved in the areas where it is most needed.</P>
    <P>I believe, as I said, that the provisions in the sections we are dealing with are reasonable.  They have proved to be workable.  The rights and interests of the arrested persons are safeguarded in a reasonable manner.  No major difficulty or defect has manifested itself in the operation of these sections since the Act was enacted.  It is in the interest of the country and in the interest of the continued success of the fight against crime that these provisions should be renewed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I often wonder if I live in the same country as everybody else.  I know people who would tell you, for instance, that they would be terrified to be on the streets of Dublin at night because they would have you believe that Dublin is awash with crime.  The same people will travel on a continental holiday and walk around Paris, walk around some of the coastal resorts of Spain, and be oblivious to the fact that in many of those areas the crime, rate, by whatever index you use, is significantly higher than it is in Dublin.  We have a remarkably low level of crime.  By international standards, by the standards of any index you choose to pick, even if you were to included the frightful statistics in Northern Ireland in our statistics, we would still have a lower level of homicide than many of the big cities of the United States of America.  Washington DC alone in a year will have somewhere close to 500 people killed in one form of murder or another. People will take off quite happily and not be in some sort of state of dreadful shock at the prospects of the threat to their own <Col N="449" /> safety from visiting these places.  But they tell you that they would be afraid to go to Dublin and walk around O'Connell Street at night for fear they would be mugged.</P>
      <P>People have talked us into a crime hysteria.  I am quite sick at this stage of my colleagues, particularly in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, working themselves into paroxysms about crime.  I will talk about that again in a minute.  Let us remember that we are, with our low level of crime, among the most policed countries in Europe.  The number of policemen per thousand of the population in this country is higher than that of virtually every country in western Europe.  We are intensely policed.  The idea that the solution to our crime problems is dramatically to recruit more and more gardaí is nonsense.  It is time we looked at the problem of crime, looked at international studies, looked at what works and stop picking knee-jerk reactions that go down, grab a headline and enable Ministers to give the impression that they are exercising their macho selves by being tough with what they like to call thugs, gangsters and criminals.  A lot of what they do does not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us remember what we exist in.  We exist in a State that is in a permanent state of emergency.  We exist in a State that has, under the Offences Against the State Act, among the most stringent emergency powers in western Europe-enormous powers of arrest, detention, questioning, etc.  Anybody who would have the less than pleasant experience of being followed home by the Special Branch that I have had on at least one occasion will realise that the sense of security that one has normally as a normal law abiding citizen, which is what I am, is quite different when you discover you are at the receiving end of somebody else's obsession and when you have people sitting outside your home until 2 O'clock in the morning, changing the guards until somebody else comes and takes over looking at you because you happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and they decided you were suspicious and worth pursuing.  You <Col N="450" /> begin to realise that you have to examine very carefully whether you need all these powers.</P>
    <P>We have, as I said, a state of emergency and the Offences Against the State Act.  There are two issues about that: the first is whether the Offences Against the State Act is necessary and the second is whether it has worked.  On that issue we should look at some of the statistics.  We have had some frightful crimes from time to time.  We have had attacks on the elderly which were appalling and which, thankfully, have now subsided.  We had a huge spate of burglaries in Dublin.  We have had sporadic spates of car theft.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the burglaries.  There was an enormous spate of burglaries particularly in urban areas, pretty petty burglaries, in most cases non-aggravated burglary not involving violence against people.  There were some spectacular exceptions, but it was mostly that.  It is no coincidence that that spate of burglaries coincided with the onset of a considerable rise in the abuse of drugs in our major cities.  As surely as night follows day, the logical conclusion is that most of those burglaries were being carried out by people who were actually trying to feed their drug habit.  As we came to grips with the drug problem so the spate of burglaries declined.</P>
    <P>The other old gorey chestnut for members of all sorts of authorities, whether it is the Oireachtas or local authorities, is car theft.  There is nothing our newspapers like more than a good joyriding car theft story to grab headlines, which, in my view, romanticise it, glamourise it, popularise it and generate the sort of publicity which gets irresponsible youngesters into the mood for doing the same thing and you end up with a cycle, a spiral upwards leading to more joyriding. I am sick to death of the law and order lobby in this country.  It seems that, notwithstanding all their crocodile tears, they are effectively jumping on the backs of people who have been the victims of crime to produce recommended solutions that they should know by now do not work.  If one thing is true it is that more prison sentences and more police powers <Col N="451" />&mdash; unless you have the type of draconian powers that used to exist in eastern Europe until the recent much to be welcomed changes &mdash; do not make a difference, in the same way that the death penalty never could be shown to be a deterrent in the area of homicide.  Let us not forget that the United States is reintroducing the death penalty with an alarming enthusiasm and it is not doing anything to the rate of homicide in the United States.</P>
    <P>Longer prison sentences do not deter. More prisons do not deter.  What does deter is the prospect of being caught and, in my view, that is based on a number of things.  One, good, well-trained police with the resources &mdash; not numbers &mdash; and the support of the Community to back them up.  We could and should look at one of the fundamental problems, which is that there are large communities in our cities today where no policeman resides, where no policeman would dream of bringing up his family, and therefore as far as those communities are concerned the police are entirely an external force which comes in to work in their area. However well intentioned a policeman may be, the fact that he or she has no connections with the area other than for the period of employment guarantees a degree of alienation.</P>
    <P>When you have the extra difference of the experience that 80 per cent of the community are unemployed and that the gardaí are employed and moderately paid &mdash; and that is all you could say about it &mdash; you have another gulf.  We have to bridge that gulf, and that state of affairs, if we are to get the sort of co-operation and trust required between the community and the police.  It is a fact that there are whole communities where the presence of the Garda is regarded as a sign of trouble.  That is the way to increase detection rates and to build up the community trust that will make draconian legislation like this offensive 1984 Act unnecessary.</P>
    <P>As I said, I am becoming quite fed up with the law and order lobby.  For years I have seen this handwringing by a variety <Col N="452" /> of spokespersons from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  At the same time the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal trundled along, almost unheard of, almost inaccessible, in an almost secretive silence, behind a door which did not open and where somebody spoke to you through an answering machine.  Its compensation powers were severely restricted, and have been even more severely restricted in recent years.  This was an institution set up to compensate the victims of crime and what did all those who command an overwhelming majority in both Houses of the Oireachtas do?  They made it less useful.  That is what I call unconcern for the victims.  Locking up the criminals will not make one scrap of difference to the victims.  Proper support, concern, care and a good system of compensation will make a difference to a victim.  The Irish Association for Victim Support has almost gone out of existence on at least one occasion because of absolutely miserable State support.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the vast majority of the Members of these Houses, who can get so worked up when a good headline is available about law and order, do not do something practical about the victims instead of forever talking about locking up the criminals.  If they had a spark of this compassion that they tell us, those of us concerned about civil liberties, we should have about the victims of crime, they should be doing that instead of jumping on the law and order band wagon every chance they get.  That is the way to deal with the victims of crime and they do not seem to want to do it.  I am sick to death of people with their macho instincts proving their virility by dealing with what they call thugs and criminals.</P>
    <P>This legislation and these sections of it were unnecessary in 1984 and nothing that has happened since has convinced me that they are anything other than unnecessary.  They were unnecessary then and were balanced by the necessity for this exercise.  It is perhaps an indication of the declining concern for civil liberties in this country, the declining interest in them as an issue, that the Press <Col N="453" /> Gallery has been empty for the entirety of this debate and that, with the exception of the three of us here and the four excluded Members of the Labour Party, there will be nobody else even to question this renewal.</P>

      <P>This legislation was operating under the shadow of this need to renew it this year when it was first introduced so it is reasonable to assume that a certain delicacy or sensitivity would be exercised in regard to it.  Contrast the detailed statistics and the 50 per cent charge rate with the operation of the Offences Against the State Act.  In 1972, 229 people were arrested under the Offences Against the State Act and 81 per cent were subsequently charged.  In 1987, which is the last year I could dig up statistics for, 2,387 people were arrested under the Offences Against the State Act and only 20 per cent were charged.  As people got used to it, as the public suspicion changed, as perhaps the law and order lobby got themselves into one of their periodic frenzies, the numbers of arrests under the Offences Against the State Act went up and the proportion of those arrested being charged went down to a shameful 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is shameful that under such draconian legislation 80 per cent of those. <Col N="454" /> arrested could not be charged.  The excuse I got from a previous Minister for Justice, a Fine Gael Minister for Justice, was that most of the others were hardened criminals who were able to sit at the wall and ignore the gardaí and that was why they could not be charged with anything.  It is because it is being used in a kind of catch-all way to arrest people who might possibly be suspected of something, because it is difficult to challenge the concept of reasonable suspicion that people make so much of a fuss about in this legislation.  A garda can claim privilege in court and in most cases will be allowed privilege if he says that the sources of information on which he based his suspicion were privileged.  The evidence is that once powers like this go beyond parliamentary accountability and become part of the law the extent to which they are used will be greater and greater.  None of the niceties that currently exist will be retained because there will be no future accountability.</P>
    <P>The evidence of abuse of other powers is enormous.  I have here a copy of <i>Magill</i> magazine which describes in great detail from July 1987, the experience of Siobhán Troddyn when she was ejected from the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis and arrested under the Offences Against the State Act on suspicion of membership of the INLA. She was an exception because she knew her rights and had access to a good lawyer.  She ended up being paid £5,000 compensation by the State for unlawful arrest under the Offences Against the State Act.  That was simply because she had the disgraceful nerve to interrupt the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis.  Quite truth-fully&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let me remind the House that in 1985, under legislation that nobody has ever sorted out, over 30 women in the Phoenix Park ended up spending a weekend in the Bridewell, all of whom eventually got compensation from the State.  They were specific instances, but the most serious is the abuse of the Offences Against the State Act.  Just to show you the way people become sensitive.  In the year that Mr. Trimbole was in trouble with the law the numbers of persons arrested after the Trimbole case under the Offences Against the State Act dropped the following year because of a certain sensitivity by the Garda.  The figures were that in 1984 they arrested 2,216 under section 30; in 1985 that went down to 1,834 due to a certain sensitivity because they had been caught out on Mr. Trimbole. I would recommend evey Member of this House to read the judgments of the Supreme Court because the problem with the Garda does not relate to the vast majority who will operate according to the law; the problem is the enormous powers certain people have which apparently they get away with.  That is why these powers without proper constrainst with nothing more than the vague thing of reasonable suspicion to protect the citizen, are wrong.  If people want to take away people's liberty then they should be obliged to have more than a vague notion that the person is guilty of something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was in 1984 or 1983 we discussed the Criminal Justice Act in this House.  At that stage many of us were concerned about children and about how this Act would impact on them.  We were then told about all the plans that were in train to deal with juvenile justice.  Notwithstanding the Minister's comments here we still have an age of criminal responsibility of seven.  The idea that first <Col N="456" /> communion children can be somehow guilty of criminal offences is so ludicrous as to defy even the remotest intellectual argument.</P>
    <P>We still do not have adequate proper detention centres for children who are severely disturbed and we have these powers applying to them and we have certain sleights of hand in the Forensic Evidence Bill that went through this House which will mean, for instance, under the law, the gardaí do not have to notify parents.  I will not go into it now but there are deficiencies in that I pointed out then about the rights of children.</P>
    <P>The Minister takes great pleasure in producing these statistics.  The truth is that 50 per cent of the people who were arrested under the Criminal Justice Act 1984 in the period from 1987 to 1990, were not charged.  If that is a good definition of reasonable suspicion, then all I can say is pull the other leg.  If reasonable suspicion means that you have one chance in two of being right then I would like to now what a vague notion is.  They are not acceptable statistics.</P>
    <P>We were told that this legislation would be used where the Gardaí had some reason to connect somebody with something and wanted to detain that person so they could investigate other matters. The ratio of 50:50 is hit and miss.  When you look into it and realise that of the people who were not charged 5,000 were held for over three hours.  It took the gardaí three hours to decide to let them go.  Over 500 of them were held for between nine and 12 hours and then released.</P>
    <P>I say the case for this legislation in terms of its usefulness in preventing crime, in terms of its deterrent effect, in terms of its addition to the powers of the gardaí is far from proven.  It should be under continuous regular review in both Houses of the Oireachtas, which the then Government refused to consider.  Therefore, in the interest of civil liberties, the legislation is not necessary, it should be opposed.  I am opposing it.  If those in front of me and on the other side of the House want to be concerned about the victims of crime, they should look after <Col N="457" /> the victims support group and the criminal injuries compensation tribunal and stop taking away what is left of our civil liberties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the motion.  I do so because I am firmly convinced that the Garda need to have the strongest possible facilities in order to combat the new breed of criminal thug that is so frequently encountered in every part of the country.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to call in the clearest manner for a very indepth look at the entire penal code.  Before you can expect Members of the Oireachtas to be in a position to share the care, it is not just sufficient to have law breakers for whatever crime locked up and forgotten about.  We have a further responsibility.  I feel there must be a greater element of re-education, rehabilitation, that people should get a second or even a third chance.  If you look at our prison service and the Victorian buildings we have everywhere, with the exception of Wheatfield, perhaps the Minister could do worse than to invite all of the Members of this House on a tour of at least three of the prisons.</P>
      <P>The courts do a good job but if one talks to prisoners and one finds that men are relaxing in confinement for five, six or seven years, especially those who were involved on the fringe of serious crime, the whole system is indeed harsh.  The parole system should be examined again. I compliment the Minister for his recent relaxation of the entire parole system and the new look he has given to it.  Those people who have left organised crime, the Provisional IRA or any one of those prescribed organisations, get a poorer response to their applications for parole or facilities than do the people who remain in those organisations in prison. That is a pity.  There is need for greater expenditure on rehabilitation to try to turn those people around.  We need to dedicate ourselves to sharing the care for all the people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some knowledge of Portlaoise Prison and if you listen to the stories some of the 200 prisoners have to tell, <Col N="458" /> one cannot come away without feeling that there is an intransigence and a harshness in the entire system.  If we continue on as we are with the penal code, we will very soon find ourselves no better than some of the very harsh eastern countries where people are just incarcerated and seemingly forgotten about.</P>
    <P>I would like to see for prisoners, perhaps with the exception of those convicted of actual first degree murder, greater resources being provided for rehabilitation. The day rooms and the recreational facilities, especially in Portlaoise and Mountjoy are harsh.  Even thought in the occasional riot situation, the furniture will be torn up, broken or burnt, nevertheless there should at least be better facilities provided.  Wheatfield gives the Department an opportunity to assess the way the ordinary criminal will react to a modern setting and comfortable facilities.  I was taken aback and rather disturbed to see disturbances there some weeks ago.  I would like to see the sitting rooms and recreational areas in prisons being furnished more in live with what one would encounter in a hotel or in a lounge.  That may sound extravagant but when you look at the overall cost of keeping an inmate in one of our institutions, the provision of an extra £300 or £400 on more modern furniture to try to soften the atmosphere, to try to help those people to relax and soften up and not keep them in austere cages designed at the beginning of the last century.</P>
    <P>There has been no improvement in the infrastructure of Portlaoise prison since it was built in 1819 except for the erection of steel safelike doors.  The rest of the infrastructure is much the same.  I do not want it to be taken from that that there has not been a tremendous number of improvements there in staffing, facilities and food, which is of a high quality.  The health and care of the prisoners is very good but the atmosphere there is wrong. It does not belong to the end of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to urge his Cabinet colleagues to provide a very significant increase in the amount available to his Department for the updating of our penal <Col N="459" /> institutions.  If we have to have them we must have ones that reflect the kindhearted approach of the community at large.  That is why I would like the Minister to consider opening the doors of two or three prisons.  Of course, there is a wide volume of opinion in the country that would suggest that we should all be inside permanently.  I believe our colleagues should have the opportunity to look at our prisons for a couple of hours and at least see the lack of rehabilitation, and the lack of educational facilities.  D Block in Portlaoise holds about 80 prisoners, who are not political prisoners.  In the main they are fine, athletic young men but 80 per cent of them have one thing in common, they are practically illiterate.  That is a sad reflection on many areas of our society.</P>
    <P>I do not think sufficient finance is being allocated to give those people a chance. It may be a second chance, it may be a third chance but the one thing they missed was basic education, the facility to read and write and to be able to follow on with a trade.  In the main there was only one avenue, the avenue of crime left open to them.</P>
    <P>Many of our institutions are more or less schools for scandal where the béaloideas is passed on, where you have very tough characters and many despicable characters but at the same time those who have to spend a considerable time in prison, those who slipped up or made mistakes along the way, should get another chance, another opportunity. We profess to be a great Christian society and our penal service should be to the forefront of what is desirable in the world.  We cannot preach one thing and turn a blind eye to the plight of people.  A prisoner in E1 in Portlaoise called Paddy Duffy is doing a long prison sentence for hiding two cars which were associated with a very serious crime.  I cannot understand why that man should be doing ten years for merely doing that.  I am horrified that our system is so austere.</P>
    <P>I would like to welcome the Minister's appointment.  I believe the last time we had the Department of Justice up to full <Col N="460" /> strength was the first year I came into this House when the present Taoiseach was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice and had responsibility for law reform.  I hope the Minister of State will forge ahead to bring our institutions into a situation where they will lead the way and give greater help to those in our society who have, perhaps, been less fortunate than the majority.  I am confident that the Minister of State will take this part of his role very seriously and will leave his <i>imprimatur</i> on it.</P>
    <P>I support the motion because I believe it is necessary to give the law enforcement agency, the Garda, an opportunity to compete with modern day criminals.  If we are going to give those extra powers and extra facilities then the prison service must be brought up to a standard where the expenditure will be of benefit to the community in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much of what Senator McDonald said and I hope he will join in the footsteps of an illustrious party colleagues who, on a previous occasion, took that very attitude on this legislation.  I can say the only time I was in this House before I was elected was the night of the vote on the Criminal Justice Bill in 1984.  I was the guest of a friend, a Fine Gael Senator, who was the Fine Gael Whip.  I met him on the stairs and he said &ldquo;O'Leary is voting against the Bill&rdquo;.  I remember well meeting Senator Seán O'Leary that night and expressing my delight that somebody had taken the line he had taken.</P>
      <P>The previous week I had been speaking outside the GPO to a large group of loyalists against this negative and regressive legislation.  I must say I found it appealling &mdash; it is a picture that stayed with me always &mdash; of Special Branch people taking notes of my speech when the attacks on the elderly, as referred to in the Minister's speech, were going on around the block in some of the more deprived areas of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I opposed this measure before it became legislation and I continue to oppose it.  I intend calling for a vote against it this evening.  It is regressive, <Col N="461" /> negative and reflects poorly on our society.  It is critically important that people understand what happens in our prisons.  It would not be a bad thing at all if Members of the Oireachtas had the opportunity to spend a week or two behind bars just to get the feel of what it is like and what is meant by the deprivation of constitutional rights.</P>
    <P>I want to dissociate myself immediately from the comments made by some Senators today that there is not a need for a prison system nor a need for the proper exercise of authority and proper punishment for those who break the law. I do not have any difficulty with that but I have enormous difficulty with this legislation which is based so much on belief, on hearsay and I &ldquo;believe&rdquo;, etc.  I will not go into the legislation.  I do not intend taking up my time with that.  I spent some of the best years of my youth trying to oppose this legislation and I am tired.  I have failed every time and I do not expect to win today either.</P>
    <P>In regard to the way in which we approach the prison system it would be a lot cheaper for the State if we were to build walls around Ballymun or Darndale or around the inner city and not let those people out.  In effect, that is what we are doing here.  We are, in effect, consigning the underprivileged to jail.  The reality is that, invariably, 90 per cent of the prison population come from the same parts of our society, from the same parts of our community.  The underprivileged, the disadvantaged, the illiterate are the ones who make up the very largest proportion of our prison population.</P>
    <P>This State set out, before its first Constitution, to cherish all the children of the nation equally.  Of course, the conspiracy for 70 years, which has ensured that those words have never moved from the Proclamation of the Republic into any one of the three Constitutions, is unfortunate indeed.  Could the Minister tell me why it is always those from the same parts of society &mdash; the underprivileged, the disadvantaged, the unemployed, those in the greatest poverty and the illiterate &mdash; who make up our prison population?  We should address that point.  To many of us <Col N="462" /> the answer is very clear.  It is that when we apply the test of looking at the newborn children the reality is that just simply asking the address of the children will allow us to paint a very clear profile of where those children are likely to be in ten, 20 or 30 years' time and we know exactly the areas which will produce the present population.  When will we break this cycle of deprivation and under-privilege, this vicious cycle of need, poverty, disadvantage, under-privilege, unemployment, illiteracy and, ultimately, imprisonment?  Why do we continue to punish the under-privileged and the disadvantaged with harsh laws, incarceration, imprisonment and punishment?</P>
    <P>The Minister was able to tell us this morning about the proposal to open a new institution for delinquent girls in Ard Mhuire at Lusk.  Nobody could say that is not needed the way our society is at the moment.  I hope that in opening it this time the Minister will ensure that the people involved in all the professional areas of that institutions are fully trained and qualified to do the job required of them.  In previous efforts to open similar institutions in Cuan Mhuire, in Ard Mhuire and in Trinity House at an earlier date attempts were made by the State to put in unprofessional people to do professional jobs.  I want to make it clear to the Minister that is something I am not prepared to tolerate on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The cost to be the State of the incarceration and the imprisonment of under-privileged people could be off-set and could be reduced by making available proper support services at an earlier date. The cost of keeping one person imprisoned is more or less the cost to the State of having available an educational psychologist to address the problems of young children at an earlier age.</P>
    <P>Last year in one of the Dublin prisons a young man in his late twenties committed suicide and there was the predictable response from the usual sectors.  The young man was from a very deprived area close to Clontarf in the north inner city; Clontarf is not noted for being under-privileged but there are areas close to it where things are very difficult indeed.  I <Col N="463" /> took the trouble to check on that young man just to find out what his background was because I was addressing the area of disadvantaged and under-privileged at the time.  I was lucky to be able to trace his career from age four and I was able to get his school records.  His crime had been widely reported in the papers at the time.  He was in jail serving a life sentence for a most vicious murder of a teacher who had found him in his house late at night engaged in a robbery, as it would appear.  This teacher chased after him. Somebody had a golf club but eventually the teacher was killed and for that crime this young man was found guilty and was incarcerated for life.  I do not think anybody would object to the sequence of events at that point.  I have letters written when he was six, seven, eight and nine, when he was still in an infant school in Clontarf and where the school authorities requested from the Department of Education, some form of psychological assessment for this pupil.  I have a written record saying that this child would finish up in serious trouble if he did not get help and support at that stage.</P>
    <P>That child went through infant school, the rest of primary school and the story was the same.  It was the same in post-primary school, he was a failure at all levels.  The point is he was identified at the age of five in a written statement by his teacher at that stage as somebody who would finish up in trouble.  The words were that this child would come to a difficult end unless somebody intervened at that point.  Nobody intervened so he went on to take a person's life and eventually take his own life, two deaths.  That is the true story and it really is a reflection of where we are at in society.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting for a moment, that that is typical but that is a true story. The typical case is more ordinary.  It is somebody who goes through primary school in an under-privilged area, where there is less and less support, where there are fewer and fewer chances of education experience, where the child fails to make it at post-primary, drops out early on because of lack of qualifications; because <Col N="464" /> of the incorrect address he does not find employment, because of unemployment he is in poverty, because of poverty he is in need because he is in need or she is in need will eventually resort to crime.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that any one step justifies the next.  I am simply taking us through the stage, one after the other, and that person finishes up in jail.  That is the norm for parts of the inner city and in the under-privileged suburbs in the outer city.  I am simply making the point and will continue to make it <i>ad nauseam</i> that the building of prisons will not solve the social problems, which are the direct result of under-privileged, disadvantage, poverty, illiteracy, unemployment and all the other aspects of poverty in Ireland. We would have been better employed addressing some of those issues.</P>
    <P>I am completely opposed to this legislation, as I have been long before my election to this House.  I spoke against it when it was first mooted and when it was first published as a Bill and I have continued to be opposed to it ever since. I have seen the legislation being abused time and time again.  I use the word wisely; I believe abuse is the only way I can describe it.</P>
    <P>Gardaí have told me that very often it is the only way they can hold people.  It is being used as a way of holding people rather than as a response to the needs set out originally when the Bill was brought forward.  That is the reality.  We are failing to address the problems of society, we are not doing it with this legislation. It does not address the problems of the homeless who finish up in prison, it does not address the problems of the illiterate who finish up in prison or all the other groups to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The Minister is under increasing pressure to ensure that this legislation stays on the Statute Books.  I have no doubt that the law and order lobby love this kind of legislation.  Where do we intervene?  Do we say this person has committed a crime and put him or her in jail so, therefore, we need jail, we need this authority.  Is that the end of the story or do we say we should intervene earlier?</P>
    <P>I have a very simple line.  There should <Col N="465" /> be a two-pronged approach.  If somebody commits a crime that person should be incarcerated.  I believe that prison is about the taking away of liberty as much as it is about rehabilitation.  It should be about both of them and I agree with Senator McDonald on that point.  I believe that part of it is the deprivation of liberty and I certainly have often argued that point with my colleague Senator Costello.  This is part of it and I do not object to it.  However, we have to look back earlier.  Why did this person become involved in crime in the first place?  Where did the system fail that person?  Are we saying that the day that person was born, he or she had something within them which drove that person to crime?  I do not believe that to be the case.  I do not believe that people are born with an innate motivation which pushes them into crime.  It is the circumstances of their lives, the background, the housing, the community, the deprivation, the under-privilege, that pushes them in that direction.  I realise it is easy for people like me to stand up here and say what I am saying.  I may well be accused of not looking at the needs of society but I will dispute that.  I agree with the process of imprisonment and punishment for crime and I feel very strongly about it.  I am speaking as somebody who has had his house burgled seven or eight times to my intense annoyance and serious loss.  I have suffered from crime but that is not the point.  The point is that crime will be there until we get at its cause.  All we are doing in this legislation is responding to crime.  We should anticipate crime, get our action in first to ensure that people do not find themselves in a crime environment.  I am vehemently opposed to the proposals in this motion and intend voting against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank all the Senators for their contributions to the debate on this motion.  The 1984 Act provisions are very important and it is fitting that they should have been the subject of such a good, wideranging debate and of such general support.  I am <Col N="466" /> firmly convinced that the most effective deterrent against crime that we as a society can provide is the creation of the position where persons who engage in criminal acts know that there is every chance they will be brought to justice and punished.  The detention and other provisions of the Act are vital in this area and it is essential that they continue in operation.  Of importance also are the safeguards which have been built into the various sections of the Act and about which the Minister for Justice commented in detail in his opening speech.</P>
      <P>The enactment of the 1986 legislation concerning Garda complaints procedures, the establishment in 1987 of the Garda Complaints Board and also the making of detailed regulations in 1987 regarding the treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations, have put the Garda powers under the 1984 Act into a comprehensive context of checks and balances.  I am glad to say that these safeguards have been commented upon favourably by the Martin Committee as ensuring that the rights of the person being questioned are upheld.</P>
      <P>The debate on the motion has been wideranging but I shall try to deal with as many points as I can.  Senator Neville referred to the need to tackle the problem of crime.  The Minister for Justice dealt at length with the measures which have been taken and which we propose to take in this area.  Since becoming Minister for Justice in 1989, Deputy Burke has committed himself to providing for the Garda force, at Government level, the resources necessary to provide for the safety and security of all our citizens.  In that time we have seen a recruitment campaign for 1,000 new gardaí and a far-seeing allocation of many state of the art facilities and resources.</P>
      <P>It was recently announced that the Government had approved a new Garda recruitment competition to recruit 1,000 men and women into the force.  This will fully maintain the membership of the force and provide a guarantee to the people that the law will continue to be enforced as effectively and efficiently as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" /> The Government's commitment to a programme of reform in the criminal law area is clear.  A number of important Bills have been enacted recently: the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, the Larceny Act, 1990, the Criminal Justice Act, 1990, the abolition of the death penalty, the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990, the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990 and the Criminal Justice Forensic Evidence Act, 1990.  The Criminal Damage Bill, 1991 is before the Dáil at present.  The Minister hopes shortly, to be in a position to publish a Criminal Evidence Bill and also a Bill to provide for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and the prevention of money-laundering, and he further expects to bring forward proposals to amend the law relating to certain sexual offences, including homosexual offences, and in relation to criminal insanity.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission are at present conducting a comprehensive review of the law on dishonesty and fraud, and their recommendations will be dealt with, when received.  This record is clear evidence of progress on criminal law reform and of the effectiveness of the manner in which it is being tackled.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville also referred to the need for the establishment of a separate criminal law reform commission.  Our approach to the need for updating criminal law is to deal with the matter on a systematic basis, affording priority to those areas most in need of review.  In this we are assisted by the work of the Law Reform Commission who have published recommendations on many aspects of criminal law and are currently reviewing other criminal law matters.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville expressed concern about the commission of offences by people on bail.  As the Minister for Justice indicated to the Dáil in reply to a question on the second day of this month, he is aware of that problem.  He pointed out that since the law relating to bail was strengthened in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, by providing that a sentence of imprisonment for an offence committed <Col N="468" /> by a person on bail, must be consecutive on any sentence passed or about to be passed on him for a previous crime, the number of offences committed by persons on bail has shown a very significant decrease.</P>
    <P>In 1983 &mdash; before the 1984 Act was passed &mdash; 8,295 offences were committed by persons on bail.  Last year the comparable figure was 2,494 offences.  I accept that the commission of this number of offences by persons on bail is a matter of grave concern.  The figures I have quoted do show, however, that contrary to some recent public statements the situation is improving.  The Minister is continuing to monitor the situation, and if he is satisfied that further measures including an amendment of the law on bail are needed, he will bring forward appropriate proposals.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville appears to think that the 1984 Act is not aimed at serious crime.  On the contrary, the provisions in the Act cover specific indictible offences which are punishable by five years imprisonment or more.  Senator Neville referred to the need for increased co-operation between police forces and the European Community in the context of removing the internal borders of the Community in 1992.  This is a very important matter which is currently receiving the attention of the Ministers for Justice of the Community and high level departmental and European officials and police officers across the entire Community.</P>
    <P>During the Minister for Justice Presidency meeting in Dublin last year a programme of action on this matter was agreed by the European Ministers and subsequently published.  The programme of action contained a detailed list of measures designed to protect the citizens of the European Community when the internal borders are removed.  This programme includes measures, for example, in relation to crime in general, drug trafficing and terrorism.  Very intensive work is being carried out to give practical effect to the measures proposed and these will be subjected again to detailed consideration by the Minister for Justice <Col N="469" /> at their meeting in Luxembourg next month.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville referred to the need to look at the causes of crime and to prevent the alienation of socially deprived sections of the community and Senator O'Toole also referred to this situation. Both the Minister for Justice and I are fully aware of the importance of building up good relations between the Garda and the community which they serve.  The Minister for Justice last week hosted an international seminar on the subject of Community oriented policing.  That seminar discussed in detail initiatives by the police of various countries in socially deprived areas and an essential message in the address by the Minister for Justice here today is that the future of law enforcement in this country depends on mutual trust and co-operation between the community and the Garda.  The Minister for Justice and the Department of Justice in co-operation with the Garda Commissioner and the Garda Síochána are placing a major emphasis on community policing, mutual trust and co-operation between the community and the Garda in the interests of detecting and preventing crime.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville referred to the need to clear the backlog of the arrears of complaints to the Garda Complaints Board.  Both I and the Minister for Justice share the Senator's concern about the backlog of arrears.  As the Minister for Justice stated in his opening speech, there has been a very substantial improvement in the arrears situation which has been brought about as a result of the allocation of additional staff which were assigned to the Garda Complaints Board in late 1989. The real backlog of complaints has dropped by about one-third over the last six months and this is very substantial indeed.  Notwithstanding that, the Minister for Justice is actively pursuing the possibility of providing further staff resources for the board and provisions for this purpose have been made in the board's allocation contained in this year's estimates.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan praised the treatment regulations which provide for the <Col N="470" /> first time a statutory code of practice to be followed by the Garda in dealing with persons in custody; previously, Garda instructions were confidential.  The aim of the regulations is to ensure that the Garda, at all times, act with integrity and with respect for the personal rights of persons in custody, particularly any of them with physical or mental disability and with respect for their dignity as human persons, while complying with the obligation to ensure their safe custody while continuing to act with diligence and determination in the investigation of crime and the protection and vindication of the personal rights of other persons.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that the Martin Committee stated as follows:</P>
    <P>The information which we have received from defence solicitors is to the effect that, without exception, the &ldquo;member in charge&rdquo; in a Garda station for overseeing the regulations takes his responsibilities seriously and ensures meaningful compliance with the regulations.</P>
    <P>I think Senator O'Donovan clearly illustrated that situation in his contribution.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris suggested that the 1984 Act provisions could lead to a similar situation here as happened in our neighbouring jurisdiction.  However, I would like to refer the Senator to what the Martin Committee said on this matter and I quote:</P>
    <P>The submissions made to us lead us to believe that the conviction in our courts and imprisonment of innocent persons in circumstances similar to those which have recently come to light in another jurisdiction is entirely unlikely.</P>
    <P>That is not to say there is no need for reform in the law to cover the possibility of miscarriages of justice.  Senator Norris seemed to be of the view that there are no safeguards in the law against or regarding the arrest of people.  However the Martin Committee deals with this situation and where substantial doubt as to the propriety of a conviction exists, it recommends the setting up of an independent <Col N="471" /> body with statutory powers of inquiry. The report raises important issues concerning the respective functions, under the Constitution, of the Executive and the Judiciary and these require careful consideration.  The Minister's priority in this matter is to get the correct response to the recommendations rather than one which could have unforeseen consequences on public confidence in the courts system.  The matter is under active consideration and I can assure Senators that there will be no undue delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>For the benefit of the House, arrest without warrant must be based on reasonable suspicion objectively held by the arresting garda.  The reasonableness of such suspicion, the justification for arrest and any ensuing <Col N="472" /> detention are open to review by the courts.  A person aggrieved by his arrest or detention is entitled to pursue the normal civil remedies and to have the matter examined by the Garda Síochána Complaints Board.  Suspicion must be the result of an honest belief after all the facts have been ascertained and considered and what would amount to reasonable suspicion in any case involves an inquiry into the circumstances of the case for the purpose of ascertaining the state of mind of the members of the Garda Síochána at the time of the arrest.  The criterion of having reasonable grounds for suspicion sufficient to justify arrest is not necessarily sufficient to justify a charge.  Hearsay evidence, for example, may be sufficient grounds for reasonable suspicion but it is not sufficient for a person to be charged since it will not be admissible as evidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Accordingly, the period of detention under section 4 may be used to dispel or confirm that reasonable suspicion.  Senator Ryan referred to the use of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 for questioning persons.  Under section 30 of the Act a member of the Garda Síochána may arrest and detain a person whom he suspects of having committed or being about to commit an offence which is scheduled for the purpose of the Act.  However, it is clear that the power of arrest under section 30 may not be used for the sole purposes of questioning persons and its exercise is subject due to judicial review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not agree with Senator Ryan that there is no need for the kind of legislation we have in the 1984 Act. Senator O'Toole expressed the same view but the powers of detention under the 1984 Act have worked well and have been used with tact by the Garda.  There are substantial safeguards which ensure that the Act cannot be used indiscriminately or arbitrarily.  The existence <Col N="473" /> of recognisable, strictly limited and controlled powers under the Act has, if anything, lessened the pressures on gardaí to enter a grey area where it was not always clear whether the suspects were being detained unlawfully or not.  Senator Ryan said that Irish people often have an exaggerated picture of the crime situation here even though it is much better than in many other countries.  There is, of course, a danger of the crime situation being exaggerated and the Minister for Justice adverted to this today.  However, I do not agree with the Senator's implied criticism that we have too many gardaí. Tell that to the victims of crime when they have been assaulted, when their houses, as Senator O'Toole admitted, are burgled or their cars broken into and they will most definitely not agree.  It is important that crime is tackled on all fronts and that resources of the type outlined by the Minister for Justice continue to be made available.</P>
    <P>I want to thank Senator McDonald for his contribution.  He ranged widely over the prison system which we debated at length in this House some weeks ago.  We have made major advances in our prison regime and services over the years and <Col N="474" /> we are constantly striving to improve conditions for our prisoners.  In a Utopian situation we would not need prisons but I am not too optimistic that we would ever be able to maintain law and order without them.</P>
    <P>The House has had considerable opportunity to debate this very important situation and it is quite clear that, as legislators and public representatives, we must represent the common good.  The Government have a fundamental, constitutional and legal duty to maintain law and order and I believe the Oireachtas must endorse the efforts of the Government in the interest of our citizens' and acknowledge that adequate safeguards for the maintenance of law and order exist and that the system operates in the interest of the common good.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me raise this issue on the Adjournment. I raise this matter as a result of a meeting held in Athlone last Saturday fortnight which most Members from the west of Ireland were invited to attend.  I conveyed the apologies of the Leader of the House for his absence.</P>
      <P>The feeling in the midlands, and particularly in the areas directly affected by the Shannon, is one of great annoyance because of the severe flooding &mdash; much more severe than ever before &mdash; which has taken place over the past two years. Records will prove that in fact the water rises much faster than was usual prior to this.  The reason is the enormous amount of drainage into the Shannon which allows the water to come in much faster.  I am not saying any additional water comes in.  Major developments have taken place over thousands of acres of bog which means those bogs are now drained and the water which would have taken perhaps six months to seep into the Shannon now rushes into the river in a matter of 48 hours.  As a result there are flash floods over a whole area of countryside.  In the past two years the water has remained in some of those lands for up to six months. This flooding has caused major hardship to many of the farmers living in that area, first, because of the difficulties in looking after stock and, second, because of the very long feeding period which in many cases can mean that those farmers have to feed stock for up to ten weeks longer than other farmers.  That has created major financial hardship on those farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right and proper that the State <Col N="476" /> and the Minister's Department should take an interest in this matter to see what can be done to alleviate the problems these farmers face annually.  It would appear from all the trends that this problem will get worse in the years ahead. The Minister will note that I have referred to cleaning rather than drainage. Nobody can realistically expect that a major drainage scheme will be carried out on the River Shannon.  I am asking that a cleaning job be done that would alleviate the early flooding and allow the water to run off much sooner than heretofore.</P>
    <P>I take it, a Chathaoirligh, that there would be no objection to my sharing my time with Senator Fallon?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the hardship on the farmers and the tremendous difficulty the tourist industry is suffering as a result of this flooding.  During this spring two boats were sunk on the River Shannon. They ran aground as a result of not being able to identify clearly where the channel was because of the severe flooding.  We have lost revenue as a result of the flooding because fishermen who normally came there in April did not come this year because the water level was too high. This loss of revenue is due to the fact that the water cannot drain off in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to a report published recently which clearly identifies where the blockages are on the Shannon.  This is why I referred to cleaning, not drainage.  The first major blockage is one mile upstream of Meelick Weir where there is an island in the middle of the channel which literally blocks the water.  There is only a small channel left on the Galway side of that island for water to flow.  On the other side of the island the channel is completely blocked with silt, reeds and other matter, with the result that no water can get through.  At that point the obstruction is approximately 100 yards long and it is holding back two feet of water.  I do not <Col N="477" /> need to point out to this House how small a job it would be to alleviate the major problem that exists there.  The flow of water there is at the rate of four knots, whereas downstream it is three times greater.</P>
    <P>The second obstruction occurs two miles upstream of Meelick Weir.  Here Bord na Móna have failed over the years properly to maintain their silt traps and as a result huge amounts of silt have gone into the Shannon and are affecting the flow of water.  I understand the obstruction is a quarter of a mile long and is holding back upwards of six feet of water at a time of flood.  These two obstructions would be simple to remove.  I am not saying it would alleviate the major winter flooding problem but it would postpone it and allow the water to get away much faster.  It would also allow for a much slower build up of water.</P>
    <P>These are small schemes.  I am not talking about a cost of millions of pounds. I am talking about remedial work to clear the channel.  Some remedial work was carried out by the Minister's predecessor, Avril Doyle, when machines were sent to Meelick Weir to clean it up and allow water to go through it.  It took only a few days to carry out the work and it made a tremendous improvement.</P>
    <P>Many other problems exist there because of the flooding.  I would ask the Minister of State to use his good offices &mdash; I was hoping the Minister for Finance would be here &mdash; to have this area reclassified as extremely severely handicapped, thereby allowing the farmers to get additional headage payments in that region which is flooded.  I am not talking about covering whole DEDS or anything like that.  I am saying that the specific areas which are flooded should be treated separately.  We are talking about no more than perhaps 1,000 farmers from one end of the Shannon to the other and they should get preferential treatment with regard to headage payments.</P>
    <P>This area I am referring to and which the Leader of the House knows very well should be classified as an environmentally sensitive area, thereby allowing people to get special grants so as to retain the <Col N="478" /> structure of the soil and to protect the flora and fauna.  God knows, there are very few parts of this country where one can hear the corncrake, but the corncrake is still hale and hearty there.  In fact, Des Rushe in an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> recently referred to that.  This area should be protected and deemed an environmentally sensitive area.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that some three years ago the Shannon forum was set up rather than a Shannon valley authority.  A great opportunity was missed.  To control and monitor the Shannon properly we should have a Shannon valley authority and I appeal to the Minister to examine the possibility, even at this late stage, of setting up such an authority.  We all know the forum is a mere talking shop where no decisions can be taken and it is basically an advisory committee.  It is of vital importance that a Shannon valley authority be set up to monitor and control the Shannon.</P>
    <P>I understand that last December a meeting was sought with the Minister by the farming community in that region and that they have not heard anything since. I would ask the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was probably the Minister's predecessor.  I ask the Minister to meet those people so that they can put their case and have it examined.  At a very small cost a major improvement job could be done on the flow of the water. Even from an environmental point of view it is important to clear the silt and peat and to restore life into the river. While that peat is there it is causing an obstruction to boats.  It is not unusual for boats to be grounded and stuck in mudbanks as a result of the peat in the river.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to examine what can be done to meet the deputation and to clean the Shannon and allow a free flow of water.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Naughten for giving me some time.  In a way history is being made this evening because we <Col N="479" /> have the Minister of State Deputy Brady, with us for the first time in the Seanad; He is very welcome indeed.</P>
      <P>The flooding of the Shannon has been talked about for hundreds of years because obviously it is a very important matter for the people who live in the flooded lands on the banks.  Over a long number of years it has had a particularly damaging effect on their lives as they literally live in the flood.  My own people come from the middle of the flooded area.  The land at the back of my house is flooded every winter.  Certainly last year it was very bad and 1989-90 was arguably the worst year since 1954.  Some people say it was even worse than 1954. Vast areas of land south of Athlone and further up as well are flooded and cannot be used for between six and nine months of the year.  It is a shocking waste of what should be good grazing land and good land for vegetables such as carrots.  We have all heard of carrots from Clonowen and that is in the middle of the area we are talking about.</P>
      <P>Something positive should be done, if at all possible.  What we are talking about is not the drainage of the Shannon but a short term remedial solution; a cleaning job rather than anything else could be done.  Obviously I do not know what is involved costwise but if it is not very much I think it should be done.  It would be so important for so many people on the Connacht side where areas from Athlone up to Clonowen and further on, and on the other side Goldenisland and Clonbunny, which are the areas close to Athlone, and from Athlone right down on both banks as far as the town of Banagher and further up as well.</P>
      <P>I realise full well that money is the big problem and even if it were decided tomorrow to embark on drainage of the River Shannon the people interested in wildlife might have objections to it.  What Senator Naughten is talking about is short term remedial work.  I do not know how much it would cost but if it was not too much I would certainly urge the Minister to do it as it would be very important for the people who live in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Leader of the House for his kind remarks on my first visit to the Seanad.  I hope it will not be my last but, may I say, not on a permanent basis, with all due respect, a Chathaoirligh.</P>
      <P>At the outset I would like to say that I welcome this opportunity of addressing you on the complex problem that is the Shannon basin and one which has a history of reports and investigations stretching back over the last 150 years.  The reports all highlight the complexity of the problem in technical terms with huge financial implications which are compounded by the multiplicity and variety of interests involved.  Indeed, the complexity of the problem may well explain the reluctance of successive Governments to attempt a comprehensive solution.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have a twofold interest in the engineering aspects of the Shannon, navigation and drainage.  On the other hand, the Electricity Supply Board have statutory control over water levels in the river, but it is their policy to exercise this control in a manner which maintains as fair a balance as possible between the various interests involved.  There is an excellent degree of liaison between the two organisations.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works are bound by the Shannon Navigation Acts to maintain the Shannon as a public navigable river.  The minimum levels of water required for navigation are maintained by means of various weirs constructed in the last century.  Sluices which were subsequently provided at those weirs are always operated to discharge water in excess of what is required for navigation so as to give the maximum relief possible from flooding.  Manipulation of the sluices, however, has only a very limited effect in times of high flow in the river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maintenance by the Commissioners of the required navigation levels and by the Electricity Supply Board of the levels required for electricity generation are often cited as the main causes <Col N="481" /> of flooding in the basin.  This is simply not so.  The basic problem is that the capacity of the channel is not adequate to cater for the volume of water involved. Accumulation of silt is also alleged to be a major cause of flooding in the Athlone to Banagher section of the river but, again, this is not so.  There is no evidence of large-scale silting and isolated patches contain only small quantities, the removal of which would have no perceptible effect.</P>
    <P>The solution to the problem is possible only in the context of a drainage scheme for the entire catchment under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, from which the Commissioners second interest derives.  Under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, the Commissioners are the authority responsible for arterial drainage. An unusually large flood in December 1954 which caused severe and prolonged hardship highlighted the problem of inadequate drainage of the Shannon. The Government of the day sought the services of the US Army Corps of Engineers, a recognised world authority on flood control, and in August, 1956, Mr. Louis E. Rydell of the US Army Corps of Engineers made a detailed report outlining the problem and some possible solutions.  He suggested, <i>inter alia</i>, (1) the undertaking of preliminary engineering investigations to test a number of the more favourable possibilities for the control of floods, selected from those postulated in his report; (2) the establishment of a Shannon River basin inter-agency committee &mdash; or commission &mdash; which would serve as a medium for correlating various points of view, advising on procedures relating to an overall investigational programme and co-ordinating its effective execution.  This committee would exercise advisory rather than executive powers.  Actual prosecution of engineering, economic, agricultural and other studies would normally be retained as a function of the appropriate, regularly constituted, Department or agency.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, the Government approved in principle the recommendations of the Rydell report and <Col N="482" /> initiated a first stage investigation of the problem.  This investigation was carried out between 1958 and 1961 under the joint auspices of the Electricity Supply Board and the Office of Public Works. The joint report agreed with the Rydell view that a solution to flooding must be sought in combining the drainage of the main Shannon stem with a comprehensive plan for the tributary catchments, due regard being given to other users of the river.  The joint report recommended a more detailed second investigation which would establish costs and benefits with an accuracy sufficient to enable decisions to be taken in regard to carrying out selected works.  The report also agreed with the Rydell recommendation that consideration be given to the establishment of the inter-agency committee, which would necessarily include representatives to a wide range of authorities and interests, national and local.  A recommendation by Mr. Rydell that a small, specially qualified task force capable of adequately representing all the various interests be set up to carry out detailed examination and design of drainage proposals was reiterated in the joint report.  There the matter, I am afraid, rested.</P>
    <P>There were no developments between 1961 and the late 1970s because of the other demands on capital resources and because of the large investment which would be required if the Shannon scheme was to be tackled.  In the late seventies, the possibility of EC funding reactivated the question of the Shannon study.  It was estimated that the study would then cost about £1 million, towards which a maximum grant of £400,000 would be made available from the European Regional Development Fund.  Due to financial restrictions the carrying out of this study had been deferred.</P>
    <P>Following the launching in October 1988 of a further report, commissioned by the Irish Farmers' Association, which reaffirmed the views of the Rydell and the Office of Public Works-ESB reports, the then Minister of State agreed to set up a River Shannon forum to serve as a platform for discussion between the large <Col N="483" /> number of bodies with an interest in the Shannon and to foster a spirit of co-opertion and understanding.  The first meeting of the forum took place in March 1989 and since then they have met regularly. Among the items most frequently discussed are flooding, tourist development and, of course, pollution, the responsibilities in relation to which lie with the authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances I would conclude by saying that it is not practical to allocate funds for the piecemeal works suggested in the question before us as they would have little effect on the complex problem involved.  In any event, the commissioners would have no power to undertake them in advance of a comprehensive 1945 Act scheme.  As I <Col N="484" /> advised the Dáil in response to a parliamentary question on the matter just last week, the problem can only be solved by carrying out large-scale civil engineering works, involving substantial deepening and widening at very high costs. There are no plans at present to carry out such works.</P>
