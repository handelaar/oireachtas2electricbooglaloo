      <P>I have notice from Senator Neville that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to fulfil her commitment to construct a second level school at Rathkeale, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Joe Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to fulfil her commitment to the development of the Old Model School, Marlborough Street, Dublin 1.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Neville and Costello as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Neville's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Costello may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take item No. 2, the Radiological Protection Bill, 1990.  We will continue with the Second Stage debate and if we find we have time <Col N="1070" /> we will take Committee Stage.  If we can conclude the Bill, we may do so but it is unlikely that will happen.  We will have a sos from 1 p.m. until 2 p.m.  Then we will take item No. 3, Statements on the plight of the Kurds, from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to be associated with item No. 46 on the Order Paper, which probably is not going to be taken today.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business yesterday we were on all sides of the House very patient because we did not want to in any way interfere in the negotiations that were taking place on the ESB strike. But today, a Chathaoirligh, we cannot be patient any longer in face of the extraordinary anger and bitterness being felt by all groups in the country because of the irresponsible strike which has plunged the country into chaos and which is little more than an act of national sabotage. It is our duty here, as the Second House of the national Parliament, to ensure that the feelings of the community are expressed in the strongest possible terms so that those who are inflicting this hardship on our community are left in no doubt as to its consequences for the old, sick, jobs and industry and that these consequences are brought fully home to them.  I am proposing that the Order of Business today be amended to allow for short statements from each group of no more than five minutes on the current crisis, to be taken either at the start of public business, when one of the Ministers responsible will be in the House, or to be taken between 1 p.m. and 1.30 p.m.  It is a formal proposal that these statements be taken either at the end of the Order of Business or at 1 p.m. for half an hour.  I am making a formal proposal and Senator Liam Cosgrave will second that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, I have no problem with supporting Senator Manning's suggestion on statements.  I would welcome the opportunity for us to be able to place our views on the record of the <Col N="1071" /> House in relation to this matter.  Accordingly, I support Senator Manning's proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the call by Senator Manning for a special debate in the House.  Many people in rural Ireland are in a serious plight.  If we were to order our business in a way that would prohibit us from discussing a problem that is fundamental to the nation then we would be tied up in a straitjacket and would not be responding to the needs of the country.  I strongly support the call for time to be set aside for a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As spokesman on Energy for my party I formally second our leader's proposal.  I mentioned this matter yesterday and I think all of us in the House were very restrained in what we said.  In fact, we suggested yesterday that speeches or comments on it would probably not be appropriate.  Last night the Minister came in here and gave us the up-to-date position and his was the only statement made.  It might be useful that a certain amount of time be made available for short statements from the various groups.  On behalf of this group I would appeal again for a resumption of work until such time as talks can, hopefully, resolve the difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the very serious crisis that now exists and the way the country is being held to ransom&mdash;every-body in every walk of life is being affected, particularly those in industry&mdash; and the commercial fabric of our country is being threatened by the strike, the Progressive Democrats would support a call for an urgent debate in this House. We believe that the Seanad must be seen to take a very strong line on this matter and that the views of fair minded and fair thinking people should be expressed in this House.  We support the call for a debate as soon as possible to give the Minister an opportunity to come to the House to put forward his views on the <Col N="1072" /> efforts he has made to resolve this extremely serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the call for statements.  I hope they will be reasoned and moderate.  In the light of what Senator Manning has said, may I say that I understand the leading article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today lays the blame squarely on management?  I do not think it would be helpful in these statements if we try to apportion blame.  What the Seanad should try to do is to assist the parties to an accommodation in the national interest.  I am very interested indeed that a spokesperson from Fianna Fáil spoke about the national priorities, the sense of urgency.  The Progressive Democrats talked about the serious crisis and urged a debate.  Can I point out that yesterday when I used the machinery of the House under Standing Order 29, this was not regarded as a crisis at 4 p.m., but at 7 p.m. the Minister thought there was a crisis and came into the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris, you may not discuss a ruling of the House as made by me yesterday.  Furthermore, I have allowed a reasonable opportunity for all Members, and rightly so, to express an opinion on whether this matter should be debated or statements made in the House.  The Senator has taken considerable latitude and moved into totally different areas and that is unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not wish to be unfair, a Chathaoirligh.  It raises very serious and important questions but I understand your position and I will ask the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to give some indication as to how these rulings were arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The ruling is a matter for the Cathaoirleach and I had decided, in the light of the information available to me, that it was appropriate at that time.  The Senator is well aware of the procedures that were open to him to raise the matter, if he considered using them.  Clearly the Senator did not.  The Senator came in here yesterday and <Col N="1073" /> expected in some way that I would be intimidated into responding to him when I had sound advice to the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not discover there was any contingency in the matter of national urgency contemplated by the Order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>As we discussed yesterday on the Order of Business, this is a very serious matter indeed.  It is probably the most serious industrial dispute that has taken place in this country for many years.  On both sides of the House yesterday it was taken in a very responsible and serious manner.  I am sure we will continue to do so today.  I certainly would, as spokesman for Energy on the Government side, support the suggestion that perhaps there should be some statements in the House on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support Senator Manning's proposal for a discussion or statements on this dispute. Most people are concerned with the problems it is causing in industry and the inconvenience to the public.  With respect, a Chathaoirligh, the level of fear engendered in ordinary people, both young and old, even in the city of Dublin, when the lights go out, is intolerable.  I appeal to all concerned to continue with their discussions but not to victimise ordinary people who are trying to pay their bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, want to support the call for statements.  We now have a crisis and many workers will feel the brunt of this unfortunate strike.  I would appeal to the leader to allow time for statements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader of the House consider marking President De Klerk's visit here by inviting him into the Seanad this afternoon?  I gather he is coming to Leinster House at 2.30 p.m. and maybe there are already plans to invite him to the Seanad &mdash; I do not know &mdash; about which we did not get advance warning.  In view of the fact that last year Nelson Mandela&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;was invited to address the Dáil, it would be appropriate that President De Klerk would at least be invited into this Chamber this afternoon even though his visit is a working and not a State visit.  In view of that, I formally propose that we take item No. 46 today, but in view of the fact that the Leader of the House said such gracious things about me yesterday I will not press it to a vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for statements on the crisis.  I would also like to support my colleague in referring to item No. 46.  I hope Seanad Éireann will have some opportunity to recognise the presence of President De Klerk. After all, it has been customary for us to draw attention to the presence in the visitor's gallery of lesser luminaries over the years.  Quite recently, in fact, we hailed the presence of Alexander Dubcek.  By any standards it seems to me to be extraordinary if the Seanad does not have an opportunity of recognising the President of South Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have great pleasure in recognising the President of South Africa if he came into the gallery, however, I am not quite sure, a Chathaoirligh, that you would be happy with the form of recognition I would give him.  I am astonished at this proposal from my colleagues.  When Nelson Mandela can vote in parliamentary elections <Col N="1075" /> in his own country I will then recognise the person who is elected under those elections as the President of South Africa.  As far as I am concerned, South Africa has no president.  It has a dictatorship of a minority and until it has a president who is recognised by all its people we should not be recognising him and we should not be making a fuss of him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was simply hoping, a Chathaoirligh, as you did, that you would give me the same indulgence as my colleagues had.</P>
      <P>On the position of the strike in the ESB, I, of course, agree that we should have statements.  I regard the issue as a matter of public importance requiring urgent consideration and I must say that it is perhaps late, but nevertheless necessary, that statements should be made.  I agree the workers should go back to work but I would draw the attention of the House to the editorial this morning in <i>The Irish Times.</i> There are two sides to this dispute.  That does not justify it, but there are two very serious sides to it.  This is the consequence of many other things. I agree that we should have statements, but who will make the statement on behalf of the Independent group I am not sure.  I am sure Senator Ross would love to have a swan-song on this one.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I call on the Leader of the House to reply, I would ask Senator Manning to clarify the time he is proposing for statements.  He suggested that the matter be dealt with at the commencement of Public Business, or between 1 p.m. and 1.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept either, at the Minister's convenience. Either at the commencement of Public Business or before the sos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls for statements in relation to the ESB dispute. <Col N="1076" /> It was a rather unwholesome situation yesterday evening.  The Minister for Labour came into the House when I was in the midst of speaking on the designation of Dublin as the cultural capital &mdash; which had to be abruptly stopped &mdash; yet we did not have an opportunity afterwards to raise any matter in relation to the statement that was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a pointless exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>When I listened to the television I heard that there had been an opportunity to debate it in the Dáil.  That is creating a two-tier system where one House has the opportunity of debating a matter of current importance and the other House is denied it.  That is unfortunate and I certainly would welcome the opportunity that statements be made in this House on this matter.</P>
      <P>In relation to the visit of the President of South Africa, Mr. de Klerk or, as Senator Brendan Ryan has suggested the provisional President or dictator at the moment, I would not put it as strongly as that.  He has certainly made quite an amount of progress in the right direction. I must say that it is an inappropriate time for an invitation to go forth from the Government on behalf of the people of Ireland when the security legislation is still in place and the vast majority of that country have not the right to vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated yesterday that it was a matter of extreme urgency and that remains my opinion.  This is a delicate and sensitive area.  Senator Harte, the wise owl of the Seanad, came to my side yesterday, as did others, when I said that the way forward was through the talks which have been going on now for 39 hours and which will resume at 11.30 a.m. with the Labour Relations Commission. This morning Senator Manning, and other speakers on all sides, supported the idea that statements be made in this House.  I would not object if, as outlined by Senator Manning, we had statements from the leaders of the groups, or people nominated by them, from 1 p.m. to 1.30 p.m. followed by a sos from 1.30 p.m. to 2 p.m.  If the House agrees to that, I am agreeable to it.</P>
      <P>Senators also mentioned the visit of Mr. De Klerk, and motion No. 46 on the Order paper.  I have no plans to take that motion or to mark the visit of Mr. De Klerk who is in Ireland this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the statements on the plight of the Kurds, we should have <Col N="1078" /> agreement that speeches do not exceed 15 minutes.  In regard to the statements between 1 p.m. and 1.30 p.m., speeches will be limited to five minutes for each group.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday evening I welcomed the Minister to the House. This is a very important Bill because its main purpose is the protection of the public.  The necessity for and the seriousness of that arose from the appalling accident at Chernobyl.  That was the first time people appreciated the international nature of radiological dangers and, to some extent, the gravity of such dangers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Sunday in a city called Minsk &mdash; I have never been there so I am not very familiar with it but I gather it is the largest city between Warsaw and Moscow &mdash; there was a huge demonstration.  More than 100,000 people were protesting partly in relation to prices, partly in relation to jobs, partly in relation to democracy but most of all they were protesting about the after effects of Chernobyl. Chernobyl is in the Ukraine, and is quite a distance away from the city of Minsk, which is, in fact, in another part of the Soviet Union, in another State, Byelorussia or White Russia.  This State is renowned for its quietness and tranquility and has never previously been involved in the protests we have reading about and hearing about for the past two years.  It has been very solid, very quiet, with no <Col N="1079" /> protests until last week.  The protest last week arose because so many people in that State are now begining to suffer from the effects of the radiological disaster at Chernobyl.</P>
    <P>Mr. Gorbachev, for whom we have great admiration for the many things he has done as regards perestroika and freedom in Eastern Europe, is, as we all know, in a lot of difficulty at home, primarily it would seem to us because of the economic chaos in the Soviet Union, with the prices of basic necessities doubling, trebling and quadrupling in a matter of days.  One of the main causes of intense dissatisfaction with Gorbachev &mdash; something we find so difficult to understand because we see the great things he has done and wonder why in the Soviet Union he apparently now ranks in popularity only with Stalin &mdash; is that in a large part of the Ukraine and in this State I have mentioned, White Russia, he has failed to give any reassurances in relation to the cancer and other diseases which are now becoming rampant.  Mr. Gorbachev expressed his sympathy but he also indicated that he could do nothing about it. That was one of the main reasons for this huge unprecedented demonstration by the general public in Minsk.</P>
    <P>Others viewed it, I know from looking at one of the evening papers yesterday evening in a totally different sense.  Dr. Chernoussenko, a Soviet nuclear scientist, has been explaining to the West, and elsewhere, the problems they faced at Chernobyl.  Because of the intense degree of radiation there, the various robot machines and so on which in theory should and could be used to clear up contaminated soil would not work.  What they did, and this may seem incredible, was that they employed vast numbers of civilians and soldiers who were virtually unprotected from radiology &mdash; indeed because of the vast numbers concerned it would have been very difficult to do so in practice &mdash; and sent them in with shovels under an instruction to spend a maximum of three minutes in the severely contaminated zone shoveling <Col N="1080" /> out what soil they could in that time. Many of those people are begining to show the effects of contamination.  Sixty thousand workers have been affected in that manner and yet it was the only way the Soviet authorities could see to attempt to deal with the contamination. They could not just leave it there as it would keep affecting more and more people in the general area, contaminating the air and the dust.  The machinery would not work so they sent in these unfortunate soldiers and civilians, who probably did not fully realise the seriousness of what was happening to them. Very large numbers of these people are now going to die.  I might mention that the scientist who has been telling colleagues and other people in nuclear medicine and nuclear protection in the West is doing so in a very unemotional and very factual manner.  He is a very brave man, because he himself is now very severely affected and will probably not live more than a matter of months. Therefore, it is something very real and very specific.  This Bill is very serious and I am glad the Minister and the Government have brought it in.  It is absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>There have been other accidents. There was possibly an even worse one in the Soviet Union about 15 years ago, close to Central Asia; the Chernobyl accident is perhaps in a sense better known. Let us be clear about why it is better known.  It is better known because a radioactive dust cloud was blown across north-western Europe and was detected by the Swedish nuclear monitoring services, but it still had not been announced by the Soviet authorities.  Indeed, were it not perhaps for the changes which have taken place in the Soviet Union, they might well have continued to deny it. Indeed, for a very long time they tried to downplay it to the gross ill-effects of, most of all, their own citizens, the men, women and children for many miles around this area who could have been saved from the effects of nuclear contamination and who now, unfortunately, will begin to suffer those effects.</P>
    <P>These effects last quite a long time. <Col N="1081" /> Last week I was in Japan and, nearly 50 years later, one can still meet people who are suffering from the radiological effects of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, individuals who were in the area and survived but have been affected either at the time or many years later.  I might mention an incidental point, which many people may not realise, Nagasaki was the main area in Japan for Catholics and many Irish priests were among those who had been responsible for the development of Catholicism in Nagasaki.  Not only the people who were there at the time were affected.  One of the dreadful things is that children and unborn children, were affected, as will subsequent generations.  This is appalling.</P>
    <P>This Bill is giving protection to the public and it is one which the public perhaps will hear little or nothing about, and I hope that remains the case.  It is a very essential Bill.  It is particularly essential to us, because there is a very understandable argument, indeed a very understandable logic, in relation to energy.  The Minister rightly mentioned the balance between environmental aspects and the provision of energy.  A few years ago we were all talking about the necessity for alternative sources of energy.  Oil was going to run out, coal was too expensive, hydro-electricity insufficient and the obvious answer was nuclear power and certain countries have gone ahead with this programme&mdash;France and the United Kingdom are the obvious countries in this part of the globe.</P>
    <P>There are those environmentalists who would argue, with a certain amount of truth, that for the provision of energy nuclear power is far more environmentally friendly than using either oil or coal.  This may seem strange, but there is a very strong argument for this form of energy.  Coal, of course, is extremely contaminating from an environmental point of view and oil also has its grave defects environmentally.  It also may be associated with the sort of things that occurred in the Mediterranean recently, with severe oil spills in the Gulf, and of course, the Alaska oil spill, which can be very contaminating.  There are many other <Col N="1082" /> examples.  We have had them off our own coast also.  I think France particularly from an environmental point of view would argue that nuclear power is far preferable and in many ways, if it is controlled, it is cleaner and you do not have the emissions you have from coal fire stations or from the use of oil.  Unfortunately, one does have the other side of the coin in that nuclear power is excellent so long as it can be kept safely under control and you can protect the public, as this Bill is intended to do.</P>
    <P>The question is whether technology is sufficiently advanced for one to be certain that one can protect the public.  Unfortunately, the answer seems to be no, we do not have sufficient knowledge, as yet at any rate, for nuclear power stations to be safe.  This in turn raises a very grave difficulty for us in that our next door neighbours have been involved for many years in nuclear power stations many of which, as the Minister pointed out, are now outdated, unsafe and would not be tolerated today by those in the nuclear industry.  Yet they are literally within a few miles from us, and radiation is no respecter of territorial waters or national boundaries.</P>
    <P>Yet we cannot do very much about it. We have protested.  We have done what we can in relation to the convention.  A very important part of this Bill, of course, is in relation to the nuclear conventions, the exchange of information for protection and so on.  I know the Minister has strongly supported these and argued our case and will continue to do so.  It is absolutely vital that he should.  At least, if we had some early warning, because of the provisions of this Bill we would be able to give a very considerable degree of protection to the public and we would be able to have some influence in trying to see that the nuclear power industry in the United Kingdom and other areas close to us will be given the maximum protection.  It is really very unsatisfactory. If there were a serious nuclear leak, we unfortunately would almost certainly be considerably affected by it.  Let us hope it never happens.</P>
    <P>This Bill is very essential and I hope <Col N="1083" /> that when it goes through there will be at least some practice exercises on a fairly wide scale.  For very different reasons, in Israel they have had some of these exercises which proved very effective and could have been of considerable value in the recent war had such weapons been used in the war.  Now it is not a question of weapons, but in some ways it is almost as bad if you have a nuclear cloud or nuclear dust.  One or two practice exercises for hospitals, Garda and various other groups who would be involved would be enormously helpful.  Hopefully, they will never ever be needed; but it would be far better to have a few training exercises to see how it all works out in  practice rather than to leave it until the day that something happened.</P>
    <P>I would like to join in paying tribute to the staff members and other people asociated with the Nuclear Energy Board over the last 20 years.  Although they were set up for a very different purpose &mdash; and it is very necessary that a new board be established &mdash; they gave a very valuable service.  Some outstanding scientists and other people were associated with the Nuclear Energy Board and have provided a very good service in a totally different capacity from that originally envisaged.  It is very easy at this stage to look at things very differently.  It is not all that many years ago since such was our naivety that children going in to be measured for shoes in this city would have an X-ray taken of their foot.  This was thought to be a great idea; you could see exactly where the bones were and so on.  We have come a long way from there and it is just as well perhaps that we have.</P>
    <P>I would also like to follow up the question of openness and disclosure.  As I indicated, one of the main reasons for the number who either have died or who, unfortunately, will die because of Chernobyl was because of the reluctance of the authorities to give any information. This had serious effects outside the Soviet Union; but, of course, the worst effects of all were for the unfortunate citizens living in the locality who were reassured that everything was all right and are now <Col N="1084" /> in a very horrific manner discovering little by little that things were by no means all right.  There should be openness and spread of information.</P>
    <P>One of the most damning things &mdash; and there was some slight discussion incidentally yesterday of various systems and so on &mdash; of the bureaucratic state socialist system is that it is very reluctant to give information, very reluctant to admit any fault or failure.  This can have disastrous effects not only economically but in such serious circumstances as this, where the bureaucracy refuses to admit that an accident has occured.  When it does admit it, it refuses to accept that the accident is as serious as it is, as in this appalling attitude towards the unfortunate people who are sent in uninstructed, unprotected, literally to give their bodies and their lives in an attempt to rectify something which the State had wrought.</P>
    <P>Thank goodness, we live in a part of the world where there is democracy and some degree of freedom of information. We may find it difficult and tedious at times, but at the end of the day it makes a great difference.  Certainly, the people who were protesting in their thousands in Minsk last Sunday would have dearly loved to have had the information we got within a few days of the Swedes detecting the nuclear disaster rather than to discover many months later that many of their children were going to die of leukaemia, that others would be stillborn and that still others would be born with gross birth defects.</P>
    <P>I might add that it is not entirely the bureaucracies in the Soviet Union who can be slow.  In our neighbouring country there was also a certain reluctance, until the Press sniffed it out, to give adequate information regarding Windscale and Seascale.</P>
    <P>As the Minister indicated, we have a problem with nuclear waste in the Irish Sea.  I know the Minister has made representations about this and it is very important that he should continue to do so.  It is a disgraceful situation that the sea off our coast should be one of the most contaminated seas, from a nuclear point of view, in the world.  We also heard <Col N="1085" /> quite a lot about nuclear powered vessels or nuclear armed vessels, overflights and so on.  As the Minister rightly said, that is more a question of foreign affairs and military matters and can be grossly exaggerated. It is matter of regret, not that these very occasional visits take place &mdash; it is perfectly reasonable that they should take place &mdash; but what I find very unreasonable is that you have nuclear submarines, not simply of the United States but of the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, using the Irish Sea as a sort of freeway to travel up and down. We come across it in a very different sense when the occasional unfortunate fishing trawler and its crew are pulled down.  But much more serious is the fact that these submarines are geared for nuclear onslaughts.  If we are going to talk about nuclear free zones, a nuclear free Irish Sea would be more useful rather than complaining about the occasional visit once a year or so of some ship from a friendly state.</P>
    <P>I would like again to welcome the Bill. It is well organised and very necessary. At the end of the day the matter that we as legislators should be most concerned with is the well-being and protection of the general public.  I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House for this important legislation. In discussing an issue such as this we need, above all, balance in our approach to the topic because all of us have strong views in different aspects both at home and internationally in this field.  I opened a book last night when I was looking up some of my files in relation to this subject and the page fell open at the statement that until recently mankind has taken energy for granted.  In this country for the last few days we have not taken it for granted.  Perhaps, if nothing else has come out of the appalling difficulties being experienced by the ESB staff and management, it is that we no longer take energy for granted, given our individual experiences in different parts of the country. It is a truism, but it says a lot when we state that we take energy for granted. We assume there will be an unlimited <Col N="1086" /> supply of fossil fuels and that somebody &mdash; bureaucracy, Government, someone else &mdash; will keep an unending source of supply to us so we can get on with our daily lives, increasing the technology we use but not having to worry about the sourcing of the energy supply.</P>
      <P>There are many options and over the years the nuclear option looked the most promising, particularly in the western world generally.  I am afraid the public generally are unhappy.  Their perception of the nuclear industry is that it is unsafe and that they do not want it to grow. All the comments so far, I assume, have referred to nuclear fission.  When we are talking about the nuclear industry we are talking in the context of nuclear fission. It is nearly seven or eight years since I spoke in the Dáil on this subject first.  I remember asking at that time for some indication from the Minister as to what progress, if any, there was in the whole area of nuclear fusion.  I would not get in a lather, but it is reasonably justified, given our experiences of Chernobyl &mdash; to take perhaps one of the worst instances any of us can recall &mdash; but also our ongoing difficulties and fears with the Sellafield operation just across the water. Some people get very exercised about it, others just moderately, and more controlled but concerned nonetheless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear very little nowadays of the progress, if any, being made in the whole area of fusion, I would love to hear from the Minister what the state of play is with developments in this area.  I understood &mdash; the situation is probably still the same &mdash; that it was the containment of the experiment that was the difficulty in moving from, if you like, the desk top model or the laboratory top model stage in terms of the development of fusion to the commercial reality of developing fusion as an energy source.  It is an exciting possibility if the difficulties could be overcome, because we do not have the same difficulties with the disposal of radioactive waste; and it is the disposal of radioactive waste and the decommissioning of the plant in terms of the fission industry that causes concern.  People are concerned, they are not often sure why <Col N="1087" /> they are concerned, but it is those two areas, when you boil it down, which would appear to be the main areas causing difficulty generally.  In the context of what we are talking about I would be very interested to hear from the Minister what progress is being made in the whole area of nuclear fusion.  Having said that, I will confine the rest of my remarks to nuclear fission because that, effectively, is what the nuclear industry is all about to date.</P>
    <P>I noted carefully the Minister's speech last night in this area.  Indeed, I welcome the main purposes of the Bill to establish the Radiological Protection Institute, to ratify three very important conventions &mdash; I fully support the Minister's view on that area &mdash; and to enable a range of radiation protection measures to be taken by various Ministers in ordinary and emergency situations.  I have one main problem with the legislation and it is a big question mark in my mind.  With respect, the big problem is that it should not be the Minister present who is presenting the Bill to the House.  For me to have complete confidence in the Radiological Protection Institute I believe that it is the Minister for the Environment who should be proposing this legislation.</P>
    <P>This agency we are setting up and the role we are giving it to do must be seen to be totally independent of the Department of Energy.  It must be free to be critical of the Department of Energy if that needs be in the future.  If it is an arm or a leg or just one step removed from the Department of Energy or under the auspices of the Department of Energy, which it is, with the Minister pushing the Bill through here this morning &mdash; he is very welcome in a personal capacity but I am talking about his official capacity when I might appear to be critical &mdash; it undermines the main function of the Bill.</P>
    <P>If the agency is to perform the duties we would like it to perform, first of all it must be independent, without any question at all.  I welcome the changes in section 20 which certainly help in that regard.  It must be independent.  It must be a body of unquestionable scientific <Col N="1088" /> integrity &mdash; I have no difficulty with that, given what I know about the agency to date &mdash; and it must have public credibility. Independence and public credibility are two very important criteria for this agency to be successful.  I wonder can it be credible or independent if it is an agency under the auspices of the Department of Energy?  It is there to monitor, to protect the public, to advise Ministers; but, above all, it must be seen to stand away from and be totally apart from the Department of Energy.  That is a huge question mark about what we are doing here today.  Perhaps that was dealt with in the Dáil.  I did not read the records, but I would be delighted with the Minister's views on that.  Quite bluntly, I think the Department of the Environment should be the sponsoring body for this legislation, not the Department of Energy.</P>
    <P>We have been discussing in this House over the last few weeks the Environmental Protection Agency Bill and there are many similarities in the issues before us in relation to those two measures. Indeed, in relation to the Environmental Protection Agency, its independence, the scientific integrity of the body, the public credibility, these are the three main issues we are all looking at; and exactly the same can be applied to the Radiological Protection Institute which is under discussion.  In all of these areas where the public are afraid or nervous or suspicious of officialdom and of bodies of one kind or another &mdash; their fears may be real or perceived; that is almost irrelevant at this stage &mdash; we need a body that can assuage the fears, such as they are, of the public generally, of institutions and of individuals. Above all else, my appeal to the Minister is to ensure that the institute we are now establishing through this legislation will be able to do that.  If it does not, it is but another unnecessary layer of the State armoury of bureaucracy.  There has been a relatively healthy attitude in recent years of getting rid of unnecessary quangos &mdash; I hate that word but it is being used freely and I think we all know what we are talking about when we use it.  We must ensure that we are not just heaping another layer on what is left.  What we <Col N="1089" /> establish today should meet the needs of the people in this day and age and be seen to be independent, credible and, above all, beyond reproach.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech referred to the need for nuclear countries to recognise increasingly the legitimate concerns of their non-nuclear neighbours.  In 1986 I was honoured to represent Ireland at a Council of Environment Ministers &mdash; it was a Council of Environment Ministers, I emphasise &mdash; and at the time we were discussing difficulties in relation to Sellafield and with great concern, too, I might add.  I was not expecting much support from my colleagues of the other Community countries around the table, but I got support from what to me at the time was a surprising quarter.  Having said my piece on behalf of the country in relation to our concerns about Sellafield at the time, November 1986, the Portuguese Environment Minister leaped to the defence of the Irish, because Portugal is a non-nuclear country and is experiencing exactly the same concerns about the nuclear power stations of Spain dotted along its border as we do with the stations all along the west coast of the UK.  It was amazing to hear the comments of the Portuguese Environment Minister at the time.  You would almost think he had been listening to the briefings I had had with the Department of the Environment here.</P>
    <P>Apart from Portugal, we were alone in our protestations and I did not notice too many of the major EC countries leaping to the defence of Ireland or any other non-nuclear nation for that matter.  I think matters have progressed somewhat since then and greater sympathy appears to abound in official circles for non-nuclear countries and greater note is being taken of the concerns we express. Tragically, it took a disaster of the scale of Chernobyl, which Senator Conroy so eloquently put on the record a few moments ago, to really bring it home to the doubting Thomases, both in the scientific world and in officialdom, that there were real concerns worth investigating and not just perceived problems <Col N="1090" /> by cranks in different corners or by various environmental groups that were way out at either side of the spectrum, to be tolerated rather than to be taken very seriously.</P>
    <P>Last night a Senator &mdash; I do not recall who it was &mdash; made the point that, effectively, the Department of Energy, through the Radiological Protection Institute, was, being judge and jury in its own area &mdash; and I borrow the words &ldquo;judge and jury&rdquo; from the Senator.  I fully support that fear as well.  It really adds to the point I have been making that I am not satisfied with the Department of Energy as the sponsoring Department in relation to this Bill; the responsibility should be removed entirely from them.</P>
    <P>I was a member of Wexford County Council from 1974 on.  I never fail to be surprised when I recall how the whole nuclear debate in Ireland started with a simple planning application to Wexford County Council to erect a nuclear power station at Carnsore.  We all looked at this and had a double take.  Phone calls were made to the Minister saying: &ldquo;You hardly expect us to decide for the nation whether the ESB will erect a nuclear power plant at Carnsore&rdquo;.  But apparently the ESB were following the procedures such as they were at the time.  The Minister had not enacted the Act under which the Nuclear Energy Board had been established three or four years earlier.  That was hastily done.  The planning application hopped from desk to desk, most people looking at it rather gingerly and then the public took over and serious consideration was not given to it except that the site was looked at to see if a traffic hazard would be created by constructing such a building at that particular location and whether water services could be supplied satisfactorily by the county council. I still recoil when I think of the procedure. If the council had not been as responsible as it was we could have granted permission and let the debate run from there.</P>
    <P>Nowadays we talk about a bottom-up approach to community issues.  If there was ever an example of the need for a top-down approach to an issue it is this <Col N="1091" /> one.  Ironically it started bottom-up in the seventies when we as councillors were asked to make the initial decisions in this area.  The rest is history.</P>
    <P>Last night Senator Brendan Ryan talked about the reasons why Ireland did not proceed with becoming nuclear at the time.  He was giving a lot of credit to the various environmental groups and lobbyists who strenuously objected. Carnsore became a rallying point for years, long after the likelihood of a power station being built there had passed.</P>
    <P>Those lobbies certainly played a part but I am convinced that the only reason it was not proceeded with then was because we could not afford it.  An oil crisis at the time and increased energy costs reduced the demand for electricity and the ESB reviewed their needs and projections for some years to come at the time, but it was the prevailing financial implications that really determined the outcome of the debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech states that the ESB no longer consider Carnsore for a nuclear power station and that they are going to use the land for agriculture and will afforest part of it.  I was interested in that because three years ago that was not the plan of the ESB.  Granted a nuclear power plant did not appear a likelihood at the time.  In 1987 the ESB intended to hold on to the land at Carnsore and their view was that if an inter-connection with the UK electricity grid became a consideration, the site at Carnsore would be suitable for the erection of the necessary facilities.  One wonders what the &ldquo;necessary facilities&rdquo; meant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the point, but we can talk about that another time.  I have not strayed from the whole area of nuclear power.  I am still talking about the ESB and the provision of energy.  It is with interest that I noted that present intentions of the ESB for their use of the site at Carnsore.  The Minister referred to this without wandering too far from the point.  He even mentioned afforestation.</P>
      <P>My interest in this was that they were not the views of the ESB a few years ago in relation to the necessity for this site. The ESB's views then, apart from the possibility of the erection of the necessary facilities if we could connect into the UK grid, was that should additional natural gas be discovered or become available at some time in the future the provision of a conventional power station at the site might be a consideration.  Live consideration of the site has waned somewhat and now we are talking in terms of afforestation and agricultural land, which I welcome.  It is a question of &ldquo;watch this space&rdquo; rather than any definite line from the ESB in relation to the use of Carnsore.</P>
      <P>Various matters were raised yesterday and there is one point I would appreciate the Minister's guidance on.  I would like to know what the relationship will be between functioning of the Nuclear Energy (General Control of Fissile Fuels, Radioactive Substances and Irradiating Apparatus) Order, 1977, and the new Institute we are establishing.  Some matters have been raised and the Minister said they would be more appropriately dealt with by the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Department of Defence or wherever.  I speak from a position of ignorance because I do not know what that Order covers and how it will relate to the new agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago there was a lot of <Col N="1093" /> debate about a Community inspectorate for ongoing monitoring of nuclear power plants, both within Europe and I presume further afield, because radiation respects no boundaries, as we all know to our cost.  What is the stage of development of that concept in Europe at the moment? Are the Government still actively supporting the establishment of such a body and do we feel that it is in our interests that such a body be up and running as soon as possible, given our stance as a non-nuclear nation when we have a limited function in telling other sovereign governments what they can or cannot do in terms of their own energy provision? I strongly support the concept, because I believe we need a Community rather than an individual approach when there are issues like this to be dealt with.  As a non-nuclear nation we do not benefit economically from any nuclear power generation, so it is unacceptable that we should be asked to take the enormous risks that are being asked of the nation now by our nuclear neighbours.</P>
    <P>Will the new institute be handling our dealings with the Paris Convention and the Oslo and London Conventions which were ratified back in the eighties?  How do they interconnect with the three conventions we are ratifying this morning? Again, I ask that question from a position of ignorance.  I could have gone away and studied or asked the relevant bodies, but it is very important that the complete picture be put on record here today.</P>
    <P>In 1986-87 a safety audit was done in Sellafield.  That was quite alarming at the time.  BNFL were given 12 months to put their house in order.  On the particular points that were requested, from management down to the basic safety procedures in the plants, I would like the Minister to put on record whether he is satisfied that BNFL have complied with the requirements of the Health and Safety Executive in the UK.  I would also like to know what the situation is in relation to the radioactive discharges off the west coast of the UK, specifically <Col N="1094" /> from Sellafield, because with the prevailing winds Sellafield causes the greatest concern in this country, whether rightly or wrongly.</P>
    <P>The subject of radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea has been under scrutiny for a long time.  Technology has been available for years to retrofit even these relatively older plants in such a way as to reduce the radioactive discharges to zero. Has that been done?  If not, why not? What level of discharges are being emitted at the moment into the Irish Sea?  We know the position of the Irish Sea in terms of radioactivity and the difficulties there.  I would like to compliment the Nuclear Energy Board for their ongoing monitoring, even though certain sectors chose not to pay attention to the results of the monitoring.  We can take a lot of assurance from the fact that on the west coast as we go up or on the east coast there is no contamination that is of any concern.  Various monitoring stations from Dundalk to Cork have monitored seaweed, seafoods and shellfish regularly and there has been no cause for concern. That does not allow us to be complacent because the discharges across the sea have been continuing over the years albeit reduced.  I would like the Minister to quantify the situation a little more for us so we know what level we are at and when we can expect them to reach zero radioactive discharges because technology is available to achieve that.  I welcome the Minister's reference to the Magnox reactors which are well over their life expectancy at this stage.  There are inherent dangers there of quite a serious magnitude that get little publicity. What is the present position in relation to decommissioning in the UK?  What is the present position in relation to the proposed new power plant on the Sellafield site?  That was headlined some months ago.  Apparently it is only at the research stage but BNFL intend to build a new plant on the Sellafield site as the existing plants reach the end of their useful life.  All of these areas are of intense concern to the general public. While we have the opportunity of a broad discussion on Second Stage on this area, I <Col N="1095" /> would welcome an update in the different areas from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill before us.  I had some concerns with the Bill as originally published and introduced to the Dáil, but the Minister pointed out the changes in the Bill introduced into this House particularly in section 20.  The changes are very welcome.  When one considers what section 20 contained when it was introduced into the Dáil there could have been no question of the independence of the institute.  The arguments advanced in the other Chamber were taken on board by the Minister and I hope that when it comes to Committee Stage in this House the Minister will be as forthcoming and as welcoming of changes that may be proposed here.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not changed his intended procedure for the appointment of the first chief executive.  I cannot accept his thinking in this area.  I know it is only the first one but could the Minister perhaps develop a little further why he intends to appoint the chief executive?  I see from the shake of the Minister's head that there are changes in this area which I welcome.  I await the Minister's response to that at the end of Second Stage.</P>

      <P>I have it here before me but I do not want to go through it all in absolute detail this morning.  I would like clarification in that area since there were major concerns on Second Stage in relation to it.  Why it was necessary to depart at all from practice procedures in this area I am not quite sure.  I welcome the Minister's assurances that that matter has been resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from nuclear energy the new institute will have a very important role in the areas of medicine and research and in various other areas.  Even though they only get a passing mention they are worth putting on the record lest we take only one aspect of the important job this institute will do.  None of us would be as healthy and have such a comfortable life <Col N="1096" /> but for the use of radiation and radioactivity in these other areas which is worth commenting on.</P>
    <P>In relation to the three conventions perhaps the Minister could explain to us &mdash; I welcome their ratification and I understand the thrust of what the conventions attempt to do &mdash; whether they will meet yearly, monthly or what the structure will be behind them.  From the Irish point of view will the Department of Energy or the new institute we are now setting up represent us at the meetings that are obviously designated in the future in this area?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister and the legislation but I am concerned that it is being sponsored by the Department of Energy because I think it takes from the independence of an agency that will have to assuage growing public fears, both real and perceived.  We must compliment the environmental groups around the country who in different ways &mdash; and perhaps we did not support all of their activities &mdash; heightened awareness and brought the impact of the problems and difficulties in this area home to people who otherwise would not realise what was happening. Protest groups &mdash; if I can use that word without being disparaging &mdash; sometimes have to be extreme in order to drag the public to somewhere centre of spectrum to get people to realise that there is a problem that needs tackling.  I would also like to thank and compliment the Nuclear Energy Board for a job well done.  Their job was limited; they laboured under a dreadful title because they have had little to do with nuclear energy since they were established but that was the intention when the Act establishing them was set up and their greatest handicap was their title because they had least of all to do with nuclear energy.</P>
    <P>They did excellent work in other fields in relation to radiation and establishing acceptable standards, monitoring developments internationally in this area and ensuring the health and safety of the Irish public in this regard.  I compliment them and those who have served the board since their establishment in the mid-seventies.  I look forward with <Col N="1097" /> interest to the composition of the new institute and to monitoring the independence of their action and their ability to assuage the fears of the public in this most difficult area.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill.  This Bill commenced Second Stage in the Dáil on 10 May 1990 and it is of great importance that it has come here today.  I often wonder why legislation takes so long to be put into place, particularly a Bill of such extraordinary importance.  Nobody will understand my remark more than the Minister because as a former Minister for Local Government he knows we repeatedly put in place legislation we never seemed to be able to implement.  We, all elected people in local government, are well aware of the Bills I am referring to. I will depend on the Minister for Energy that this will not be so with this important legislation.</P>
      <P>Last year I recall the Minister, as a member of Government, found a strong pro-nuclear lobby in the EC when he tried to get this matter placed on agendas during our Presidency.  I am not sure whether the Minister was totally successful or not.  When he did get the opportunity he probably did quite well.  I am anxious to see this Radiological Protection Bill put in place and a body set up to monitor, control, advise, educate and to speak out at times.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle was concerned about this legislation being handled by the Minister for Energy rather than by the Minister for the Environment.  With this Bill following so closely on the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, and with virtually the same Senators speaking on both Bills, there seems to be duplication. I would hope not.  There are common points in both Bills.  I understand that the question of radiological protection and certain related items have been placed at European level with the Ministers for Energy.  If they are successful why should we change to bring energy or allied problems to the Minister for the Environment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week in my long contribution on the Second Stage of the Environmental <Col N="1098" /> Protection Agency Bill I worried about duplication.  I listened with great care to the Minister's opening address to this House yesterday.  I am not satisfied that there is quite a difference between the Environmental Protection Agency Bill and the Radiological Protection Bill.  It shows that we, as elected legislators, should at all times stay close to the Bills going through because comments have been made that both issues could have been dealt with in the same Bill.  That would not appear to be so from the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the proposal of the Bill to dissolve the Nuclear Energy Board and replace it with the institute.  I would like to pay tribute to the Nuclear Energy Board and the persons thereon for the service they gave down through the years.  I accept that we need to move on and that this Radiological Protection Bill is being put in place because the Government wish to provide for the 1990s and thereafter.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to endeavour to continue with all his power to advocate a cutback on nuclear power worldwide, if possible.  At times as a neutral State, we are afraid to go out front and take the attitudes we should take on various issues.  We should as a nation be seen to set high standards.  We appear to be able to set up monitoring measures, bodies and so on to ascertain the level of radiation and the main question that arises then is how we will deal with problems if they arise.  Indeed, we have had the Chernobyl disaster quoted here throughout this debate.  Its effects on meat have never been explained.</P>
    <P>I understand the Bill contains provision to ensure that the normal and proper controls which are exercised over noncommercial State-sponsored bodies are available in relation to this institute. These controls relate to financial, budgetary and staffing matters as well as to the provision of information to the Minister on its activities.  The main control provision in the Bill on this issue is section 20 and I will refer to that again.</P>
    <P>Some provisions included in this legislation relate to FAS and Teagasc.  Parts <Col N="1099" /> of this Bill may be copies of previous legislation relating to these two bodies.  I presume the Minister is sufficiently happy with the results from those bodies to include that type of exercise in this legislation.</P>
    <P>The institute will consist of a chairman and between six to 11 members and will be able to form committees to advise on various issues.  The staff of the institute will be headed by a chief executive officer.  I want to pay tribute to the Minister's address yesterday regarding section 20 where he said:</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important change has been made in the whole area of ministerial control, in particular the provision as originally set out in section 20.  Senators will see that section 20 is now a very short section merely providing that the Minister may give general directives to the institute. Originally this section was much more detailed but in my view now it places too great an administrative burden on the institute but, more importantly, it creates the possibility of undermining the independence of the institute.</P>
    <P>I welcome his attitude here.  Senator Doyle seems to be confused and wants further explanation of it.  I understand what the Minister intends to do from that statement and I welcome that attitude and thank him for it.</P>
    <P>I have a concern in that general area. He stated:</P>
    <P>In section 17 there was a genuine worry that it was unnecessary and too cumbersome for the institute to have to seek the approval of the Minister for Finance as well as of the Minister for Energy when, for example, any changes to its own programme during the course of the year were considered. Accordingly, on Committee Stage in the Dáil I received the support of the House for the removal of this requirement in section 17 and in other appropriate clauses in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome this more than anything else in the Bill.  I have been a Member since <Col N="1100" /> 1977 and I have the greatest respect for the Minister holding the Finance portfolio at the moment, Deputy Reynolds, but I have often been baffled as to why the Minister for Finance has to have the final clout in so much legislation.  I welcome this Bill and I hope other Ministers will copy what the Minister has done.  I know the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, will understand that my criticism was not a personal thing.  It is the idea of the Minister for Finance having a say over too many decisions that upsets me.</P>
    <P>Yesterday evening we had an address from this side of the House by Senator Ormonde, a Waterford doctor and one of the best radiologists not alone in this country but in Europe.  A quiet man in his way, he does not do as much pushing and shoving around as I do.</P>

      <P>That is how the Senator survives.  When debating legislation here at all times we knock Senators, MEPs, TDs or anybody who, even in an advisory capacity, may have anything to do with a body that is being set up, the crime being that we are the elected people.  I listened with care to Senator Ormonde yesterday speaking about how our people will have to be protected from radiation and I ask why should he not be some place?  I do not plug for people to be put on bodies. I say this because I know the man and his record in this specific field.  I am sure that if I read the Bill through in some section it knocks the idea of anybody with any trace of a political background being appointed a member of the body.</P>
      <P>As I said, I welcome the Bill and I hope it goes far enough.  I do not think it deals with the question of information for public consumption or the passing on of information between states.  I ask the Minister to take another look at that. There should be more information available. Senator Conroy this morning made reference to that.  It is crucial that we get this information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 32 provides for the making of <Col N="1101" /> regulations.  We had this discussion yesterday on the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.  Why must we wait for regulations? Why not put everything in place now when it is such an excellent Bill? Maybe regulations will be needed when an accident occurs but I would rather see regulations being put in place when the legislation is going through. That is the way it should be done.  Section 32 provides that where specific levels are likely to be exceeded the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Minister for the Marine or the Minister for Health may make regulations.  Section 33 empowers the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for the Marine and the Minister for Finance to slaughter and destroy animals.  I want the Minister, who is the expert, to clear my mind as to why we need a plethora of Ministers, four of them.  If they are necessary, that is fine.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan yesterday made reference to innocent passage through the territorial waters of another State.  I accept that that statement seemed to be for another Minister.  I am aware that it is the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins but the Minister for Energy in his address to the Seanad on the Bill referred to innocent passage through the territorial waters of another State.  We know quite well that those ships are by no means innocent and that some military aircraft are carrying nuclear power.  It is important to remember that that is our remit as legislators to protect our people from nuclear radiation at all times.  Whether this is the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister for Energy I ask them not to let offenders off lightly.  I understand that using a code, a ship approaching our territorial waters should confirm or deny that they are carrying nuclear equipment of any kind.  If they do not do so we should not ignore them.</P>
    <P>I was lucky.  Telling this story might make me old but I do not mind admitting my age.  I remember the late Frank Aiken for whom I had high regard.  He was ahead of his time in his policies as Foreign Minister. Deputy Molloy and the others are <Col N="1102" /> in the Cabinet and it is their responsibility to protect the people from radiation. Frank Aiken stated in 1967 that authorisation is normally granted by the Department of Foreign Affairs for visits to Irish ports by foreign naval vessels provided such vessels are not carrying nuclear weapons and do not form part of a naval exercise.  One of my colleagues here said that there were not many overflights that would have such weaponry but I understand there could have been as many as 7,000 in a year.  I am not concerned about which Minister is responsible for it.  If we are putting through a Radiological Protection Bill to protect our people and the people who will come after us from radiation and if there are Cabinet members sitting around when this is going through, what I said there should certainly be talked about.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing is that sometimes politicians think the general public are not watching what we are doing in this area and they do not appreciate the fear of the public.  When we were dealing with the customs clearance Bill for Shannon, I remember clearly the volume of representation I got from people who were genuinely worried about the implications. It just proves how worried people are about nuclear matters.  When one saw the families of the children in the Louth area and down the east coast and the results of that awful disaster they have good reason to be worried.  From now on it is our responsibility to see that everything is put in place to ensure that this country is protected from the effects of a nuclear plant in another country.  I am sure the board will put in place more people in every area, Civil Defence and Army personnel.  I have more confidence in people serving down the line than some of my colleagues.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken a leading role in international fora on nuclear energy since he has been appointed.  It is right and proper that he should bring this Bill in here having successfully put it through the Dáil.  I thank him for his openness and the amendments he has put in place. The Minister's address here yesterday <Col N="1103" /> evening was first class.  I ask him even though he has removed himself somewhat from the body concerned, to remember my remark about people with first-hand experience.  I referred earlier to the contribution of another Member; it was a very simple and clear speech from a man who is an expert in this field.  I have confidence we are doing the right thing.  Maybe it has taken too long for such an important Bill to come to us but it is here now and I welcome it.  I thank the Minister for his attitude towards it and I hope the Bill protects the people of this nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are debating this Bill this morning on the fifth anniversary almost to the day, of the Chernobyl accident. The effects of that accident are still very much with us all.  It is estimated that three million people live in contaminated areas and many of the effects of the accident have not yet manifested themselves. However, we can be quite sure in the fullness of time they will work their way through and many people, particularly in the area around Chernobyl, can expect to suffer terrible diseases and disorders as a consequence of that tragic mistake. The effects of the accident are also evident nearer home at present of the order of 700 United Kingdom farmers in hilly areas are finding themselves subjected to stringent anti-nuclear regulations as a result of what has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nuclear energy and nuclear accidents are terrible in their effects on human beings.  They are terrible in the immediate effects and they are even more awesome in the long term effects which, to be fair about it, I think even the best scientists in this area do not fully understand and cannot yet fully anticipate. That is a reality we must live with.  The response to Chernobyl in this country left a good deal to be desired.  I think it showed fairly clearly that the resources the country devoted to nuclear protection and dealing with nuclear accidents were very deficient.  There are also, of course, the problems I have alluded to already in relation to the changing knowledge of <Col N="1104" /> radiation and its effects.  It was Professor Conroy who spoke this morning about the tendency that existed once in this country to X-ray children's feet by way of making it easy to fit them with proper footwear.  The knowledge has moved on and it is now widely recognised that this was a very dangerous and foolish thing to do because of the hazards of unnecessary exposure to radiation.</P>
    <P>As far as the Bill is concerned, one of the major deficiencies, as I see it, is that it fails to tackle head-on the problem of nuclear weapons being transported into Irish ports and being carried in planes flying over Irish air space.  Radiation and its effects are indiscriminate.  They do not discriminate between the source of the radiation, whether it arises from an accident, a ship which carries a nuclear weapon in an Irish port or some other source.  It is a matter of great disappointment to me that this Bill does not address this question.  We have every reason to be very concerned about this matter.  Senator Honan referred to the fact that something like 7,000 flights of military aircraft go through Irish air space each year.  That is approximately 20 per day.  Since 1980 13 US warships have docked in Irish ports and it is estimated reliably that six of those carried nuclear weapons.  If ships have taken all the precautions and incurred all the expense involved in being capable of carrying nuclear weapons, it is pretty conclusive evidence that they would have nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan also referred to the position taken by the late Mr. Frank Aiken when he was Minister back in the 1960s, particularly in 1967 when he brought in regulations which prohibited ships carrying nuclear weapons entering this country.  It is a matter of great regret to me that such regulations and such provisions are not contained in this Bill.  I know the Minister in the other House advanced a whole series of reasons this should not be done but I certainly do not accept that they are valid and I ask him to reconsider his position on this matter. I cannot understand why there is such a great problem with an amendment to this <Col N="1105" /> Bill which would allow for a clear statement in law that planes or ships carrying nuclear weapons would be explicity prohibited from entering Irish territory unless a certificate was provided that they did not carry those weapons.  It is also a pity that nuclear explosive devices are not defined in the Bill and that there are no references to them.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the Bill is located in the Department of Energy.  I do not think the Department of Energy is the most appropriate place to locate this Bill. The culture of the Department of Energy in this country and, indeed, worldwide, relates to matters such as providing sources of energy which are cheap and efficient rather than being concerned primarily with matters relating to human health.  I am also concerned that this proposed institute is to be located in the Department of Energy because there will be a fair degree of duplication and waste in doing so rather than including this institute with the Environmental Protection Agency.  The primary function of this institute and the provisions of this Bill are to protect people from radiation. That would be done far more effectively under a global set of provisions which would be covered by the Environmental Protection Agency.  Even if it is not best suited in the Environmental Protection Agency there is a very strong case to be made for including it under the Department of Health.  I cannot see any reason it should be included in the remit of the Department of Energy.</P>
    <P>I fully realise that the Minister extensively amended this Bill during the debate in the other House.  I am still somewhat disappointed, despite the great progress he made in relation to the independence of the institute in the other House, that he did not go the whole way and remove the provisions whereby he still has power to direct the policy of the institute generally. That is a matter of concern to me because in a situation two or three moves down the line the Minister can quite simply make a directive which will prevent the institute concerning itself with matters which may be of great public <Col N="1106" /> concern and importance but which conflict with some of the other objectives of the Department of Energy, particularly objectives which may relate to immediate short term economic concerns.</P>
    <P>I am also disappointed that the Bill does not spell out in detail what our response would be in the event of a nuclear accident outside this country which would affect us.  I realise that there is a serious of provisions in the Bill which, to some extent, get around that point but I would like to see the details of how we would respond in an emergency spelled out.  I would like that to happen so that there could be a full debate on the matter. During the Chernobyl accident there were a great number of deficiencies in our response illustrated.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also very vague in relation to the details of how waste material used in this country will be disposed of.  I can see very many good political reasons that would be so, but the public have a right to know about these matters.  I would like a good deal more detail on how nuclear waste generated in various hospitals, third level colleges and so on, is disposed of.  I would also like to see provision for the public to be informed of where this material goes and what its effect are.  In this country we have an uphill battle to fight in relation to the capacity of the European and American lobbies on behalf of nuclear energy.  Nuclear energy and the nuclear industry in Europe and America are very important.  We do not have a nuclear energy industry here and for that reason we should be very conscious of the differences which exist between ourselves and our European and American neighbours.  It is very important that we lay emphasis on that difference and that we set for ourselves the very highest standards in relation to protecting our environment and our people from the effects of ionising radiation.</P>
    <P>The penalties in this Bill are fairly severe.  There is provision for a fine of £1 million in some circumstances but we have also to realise that the effects of nuclear accidents and to breaking the law <Col N="1107" /> in relation to the provisions of this legislation can have absolutely horrific consequences. While the provision for a fine of £1 million seems very large, it is still considerably less than the provision of a fine of £10 million which is provided for in the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that there is no direct reference to food irradiation in the Bill.  I accept that it has been covered in the broad provisions of the Bill but I would like to see some provision either in this or some other other legislation so that the public could be informed that food which they are provided with has been irradiated.  The public have a right to know whether that is the case and that question has not been addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The problem of radon gas and its effects on people particularly in the west of Ireland has not been addressed in the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister would respond to that question and let us know how this Bill will more effectively deal with this problem, which I accept is quite difficult.</P>
    <P>Some of our colleagues in the other House spoke about the fact that much of the provisions of this Bill were modelled on the provisions of the legislation which set up FÁS and Teagasc.  I certainly think that is a pity because the role of FÁS and Teagasc are completely different from the role of the Institute.  FÁS and Teagasc essentially have a development role whereas the role of this Institute is essentially protective.  On that note, I will conclude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speakers, I too am amazed that this institute will be under the aegis of the Department of Energy rather than the Department of the Environment or the Department of Health, which seems to be a more appropriate place to have it located than in the Department of Energy, with all due respect to the Minister here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are concerned about radiation for very good reasons.  It is something you cannot see and propably cannot feel, <Col N="1108" /> but it has an immediate effect and an effect for generations to come.  The genetic mutations that can be caused by radiation can have consequences for many generations to come and this is the frightening aspect of it.  We should also remind ourselves that irradiation was always with us and that 85 per cent of the radiation we have is naturally occurring.  The type of radiation which we are all obsessed about is from nuclear power or nuclear weapons.  I am glad to tell you that that contributes only 0.1 per cent of all the radiation we are exposed to.  I am sorry to tell you that the medical profession contributes 12 per cent of all the radiation we are exposed to and more serious is the fact that 50 per cent of all the naturally occurring radiation that we are exposed to is radon gas.</P>
    <P>We have got to put these things into perspective if we are serious about protecting the people, but we are totally and absolutely obsessed with nuclear radiation. This is the flavour of the time. Of course, there is always the risk of a nuclear accident and that is why there is such a question mark over nuclear power stations.  It has to be said, however, that in the free world the record with nuclear power stations has been good.  It has also got to be said that every aspect of the economy, the environment and so on in the socialist countries has been bad and we have to face the facts that there are many power stations still operating in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe which are of a design which was never acceptable to the West and, of course, we could have another accident.</P>
    <P>It would be unrealistic of us to believe that we can shut down all the nuclear power stations in Europe.  Let us just refer to Europe.  Almost 40 per cent of our energy comes from nuclear power stations and in a country like France it is roughly 70 per cent and in Belgium it is almost 70 per cent.  So we are stuck with the situation for some time to come.  Even those countries which made decisions to phase out nuclear power, such as Sweden, are having a change of mind &mdash; they now do not think it is feasible and will have to look at the situation again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1109" /> As I have said in this House in the past, the solution of the energy problem will go a long way towards the solution of our environmental problems.  I have to say that I do not see any easy solution and I can see bigger problems arising.  By the year 2020 we will probably have eight billion people and, even at the present rate of consumption of energy, that is going to put a huge extra burden on the environment.  If you combine that with the economic growth we are likely to get and the consequent growth in the consumption of energy, I am afraid we are going to have a very big problem indeed.</P>
    <P>The world, and Ireland, is not doing enough to find alternative sources of energy.  Senator Doyle mentioned already this morning the possibility of nuclear fusion.  It would, of course, be a great answer.  It has the advantages that you do not have any nuclear waste; but above all it has the advantage that you are not likely to have an accident of the Chernobyl type for the simple reason that the fuel is drip fed into the process and not all loaded in one go as it is in the nuclear fission type plants we have.  The prospect of nuclear fusion, unfortunately, is quite a long way away yet.</P>
    <P>We are not putting enough research into alternative energy sources &mdash; wave power, wind power, solar power and geothermal power &mdash; and we are as a consequence leaving ourselves open to being too dependent on nuclear fission and we will be stuck with it for a while.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister mentioned radon gas in his paper.  I was glad to see he did but I am greatly afraid that we are not showing enough commitment.  I believe he mentioned that the sum of £150,000 was being devoted to research into the problem.  From the information I can gather, we know there is a significant problem there, that probably between 100 and 160 deaths per year are being caused directly by radon gas exposure, usually in the home but also in places of work, in offices, and, indeed, even in buildings like this we might be subjected to it.  We do not know.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the Nuclear <Col N="1110" /> Energy Board initiated the possibility of people having their homes tested for the presence of radon gas.  I understand the Minister himself had it done, and very rightly so because the problem seems to be greater in the west.  It is also a problem where I live indeed, or near enough to where I live, in Douglas, Cork city.  I believe our credibility as a nation in talking about nuclear matters and complaining about Sellafield and so on would be greatly enhanced if we made a greater commitment to get rid of or do something about solving the problem of radon gas which we have and, indeed, doing more about finding out the extent of the problem. However, it is a lot easier for us to kick up a row about Sellafield &mdash; we are right to criticise Sellafield &mdash; but we would be far more effective in criticising it if we were seen to be doing something effective about solving a problem that is killing probably between 100 and 150 or 160 people per year and possibly a greater number than that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill itself, I have no great complaints about it.  I am pleased to see that the Minister has at least expressed his commitment to the independence of this institute.  To what extent it will be independent, of course, is another matter.  While the Minister is now allowing the board to appoint the chief executive, it is still subject to his sanction and I suppose that is the normal way in these matters.  However, in a matter like the radiological institute it is very important that there is public confidence in it.  The changes I have seen taking place in semi-Government bodies during the life of this and the previous Government do not give me cause for confidence in that respect.  We have had a history of changes.  An Foras Forbartha was abolished and their staff and responsibilities were subsumed into the Department of the Environment.  ACOT and An Foras Talúntais were abolished and merged into a body called Teagasc, which has a totally different board structure, with a very reliable spokesman for the Department of Agriculture and Food appointed as chairman and not nearly as much representation from farming <Col N="1111" /> bodies, the universities and elsewhere as we used to have in the past.  AnCO became part of FÁS, for what reason I do not know.  What I know, is that all of these bodies have less independence now than they had in the past.  The decision-making process has passed back to the civil servants and to the Minister.  I do not believe that that is the case in this new institute.  The Minister has at least assured us of that and it would appear to be that way.  I sincerely hope that he will ensure that this institute are as open and as objective as possible, otherwise they will lose credibility with the public. Indeed the Nuclear Energy Board, through no fault of their own, lost credibility with the public.  A former Minister forced them to put out their statements through his office &mdash; in other words it was being gagged by a Minister.  Therefore you could not expect the public to have great confidence in that sort of situation.</P>
    <P>I am pleased also to note that the Minister is committed to having an independent international inspectorate established to ensure that the standards we would like are being enforced or implemented in nuclear power stations in our neighbouring countries.  That had always been my stand in the European Parliament.  It is far more objective and realistic than calling for the closure of Sellafield, which was never on.  That was not going to happen and we could not force it to happen.  But what we could realistically hope to bring about is a situation where you would have an independent international inspectorate.</P>
    <P>I gave other Senators a commitment that I would not be long &mdash; I know Senator Norris is anxious to get in before lunch &mdash; and I will conclude on that.  I wish the Bill well and I sincerely hope that this institute will play an important and very effective role in protecting the health and welfare of the citizens of this country in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take my cue from Senator Raftery.  I am aware of Senator Norris's anxiety to contribute to this debate and I intend not to delay the <Col N="1112" /> House too long.  It is important that as many contributions as possible should be made on the introduction of this Bill because it affects all of us.  Radiation, as the Minister pointed out, is something one cannot see, smell or feel; it is insidious. It is remarkable there has not been a greater social revolution across Europe at the creeping danger radiation poses in this nuclear age.  However, I commend the Government and the Minister for the introduction of this Bill and I will take this opportunity to commend successive Irish Governments for the stand they have taken on the proliferation of nuclear activity in this country.  On the downside, it is rather unfortunate that our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, has continued to adopt a cheap fuel policy in relation to the expansion of its nuclear facilities, but even in that country the growing anti-nuclear lobby has proven to be extremely effective.</P>
      <P>I share Senator Raftery's view that it was an unrealistic aim of the anti-nuclear lobby to attempt to have Sellafield closed. I have never seen that as being a realistic option.  Certainly, in the context of the Bill, Ireland's role in leading the move towards a more effective monitoring of nuclear operations across Europe and in the European Community is to be commended. I cannot but take the opportunity while the Minister for Energy is in the House to refer to some points he has made on the energy situation in this country.  In the context of the Bill he says:</P>
      <P>I am still firmly of the view that large scale and widespread recourse to nuclear energy is not an acceptable solution to our energy problems,. . . </P>
      <P>In another part of his speech, he comments on the background as to why the ESB originally initiated plans for a nuclear plant at Carnsore Point which the Government subsequently directed them not to proceed with.  The Minister says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as the safety issue, the economic recession which followed the oil crisis of 1979 caused a downturn in electricity demand and by 1980 it was <Col N="1113" /> clear that an early decision on a nuclear power plant was not necessary. . . .</P>
    <P>The Minister also said: &ldquo;The ESB has expanded its natural gas and coal generation facilities and has no longer any plans for a nuclear station&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will allow me to indulge myself with a brief comment.  I hope that he and his Department would take on board the sentiments behind those statements and ensure that the existing generating stations are kept on line, specifically the one in my home area, the Lough Allen power station.  This station admittedly contributes a small amount to the national grid of between 1 and 6 per cent, depending on demand, but if it is allowed to be run down and closed, as the ESB propose, the result will be the loss of some 80 jobs, 50-odd in the plant itself and some 30 in the immediate mining area.  I accept that it is not relevant to the Bill before the House but I would be remiss in my obligations to the people that I represent and to the area in which I live and in whose future I have a stake, if I were not to take every opportunity to impress upon the Minister the serious economic and social implications of the ESB's decision, which I hope can be reversed.  In that regard the Minister will be meeting with representatives from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Like many Members in both Houses I am concerned about the disposal of nuclear waste.  I hope the new board will ensure that the strictest possible safety measures are maintained and indeed expanded.  The implications of a leakage of radiation from the many containers that are travelling across the country are appalling.  Like most Members of the <Col N="1114" /> Oireachtas I have to spend some time in Dublin, and during that time I reside close to a railway track on the south side of the city.  I have had occasion to see at least once or twice a day ammonia containers rumbling by on their way to or from Dún Laoghaire port.  I have often wondered what would happen, despite the most stringent regulations, if any one of those tanks were to burst, or if the train were involved in an accident.  I know that it is a concern which has been voiced by people on many occasions.  Will the new board have any role in that area, short of stopping the actual transport of these containers?</P>
    <P>Like Senator Upton, I, too, would like to express concern at the increasing levels of radon gas, which newspaper reports suggest are increasing rather than decreasing.  In that context I welcome the comments of the Minister on Second Stage when he said that, despite the severe economic difficulties that we find ourselves in, he has authorised an allocation of £150,000 to the existing board to carry out surveys of houses, particularly in the west.  I am particularly pleased that the Minister referred to the fact that this radon testing service is being advertised extensively in the local press. Sometimes Dublin does not acknowledge the impact the provincial press makes in rural communities.  For that reason, I am glad the publicity surrounding the survey has been decentralised rather than appearing exclusively in the national papers.  Perhaps the Minister might indicate the level of response from the general public to this campaign and whether there has been any perceptible reduction in the levels of radon gas.  Has the scare, which is a very real scare that one reads about, been minimised to any great extent?  Obviously, this is of particular concern to the people in the west.  I am sure that the Minister's remarks were hardly coincidential, considering he comes from that part of the country. Obviously, it is a matter of concern. Radon is a relatively recently identified threat in this area of radiation.  I would be interested in any further comments the Minister may wish to make on that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1115" /> I would like also to bring to the attention of the Minister &mdash; and I am sure it has been brought to his notice already &mdash; that according to Greenpeace, there are no provisions to monitor overflights of military aircraft which might carry nuclear weapons in Irish air space.  The Minister did not address this issue in his Second Stage speech.  Perhaps he may wish to respond to the intensive lobbying, which I am sure has reached his Department, on military overflights.  I am not so sure I agree with Greenpeace lobbying in the context of visiting naval vessels, which may or may not have nuclear arms on board.  The Minister quite correctly points out our international obligations in that area, and while perhaps I would sympathise with the lobby which suggests that the Irish Government should monitor and inspect visiting naval ships to ascertain whether they have nuclear capacity, in the real world, this is not a feasible option, and one can rely only on the goodwill of the international community to recognise Ireland's undoubted stand against the proliferation of nuclear activity and act accordingly when visiting this country.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the amendment which the Minister introduced in the other House on the constitution of the new board.  For a long time &mdash; and I remember my late father had a bee in his bonnet about this, and I used to agree with him that Governments of all hues tended to use semi-State bodies to pack them with party apparatchiks.  While in principle I see nothing wrong with qualified people who happen to have a political affiliation being appointed to semi-State bodies, there has always been the sneaking suspicion among the general public that in some instances appointments to these boards have been at best questionable and at worst plain political.  However, in relation to the new board that is being set up, the Minister has made it quite clear that it will be constituted by men and women who are qualified and have a particular expertise in this area.  This is a <Col N="1116" /> courageous development by the Minister. I certainly support it and hope it will transfer to many other semi-State bodies. Bearing in mind that my colleague, Senator Norris, wishes to make a contribution on this debate, I will conclude. I welcome the introduction of this Bill, and the sentiments behind it.  In the difficult environment in which we are geographically located the Minister will attempt to ensure by this measure and others flowing from this legislation that Ireland will at least minimise the risk of radiation to our people and our environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of arguments I would like to take up in a fairly detailed way.  First, the welcome I can give to this Bill is very lukewarm.  I say that because I really think quite a lot of legislation we have been getting from the Government, not all, is minimalist.  I think the intention is to allow us to accede to the international community in certain ways.  We are giving in; we are being pushed.  In order to be part of a certain framework, we have to sign something like this into law.  I believe it is minimalist. I do not honestly think it addresses some of the most important questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was most interested and heartened that Senator Mooney said he felt that the overflights of the country were something that, he felt, the Minister had omitted from the Bill.  He seemed to feel it was an important omission and he hoped the Minister would address it.  I was disappointed Senator Mooney could not extend this concern to the visits of nuclear powered and nuclear weapon carrying ships, because it is perfectly clear that the <Col N="1117" /> response of the Irish State in this matter is grossly inadequate.  If the Minister wants to have facts and figures, signed and sealed, I commend to his scrutiny and that of his civil servants the report entitled <i>US Navy War Ships in Irish Ports, 1980 to 1990: Their Nuclear Weapons and Naval Operations</i>, a paper prepared for Greenpeace by Hans M. Christensen of Denmark.  There are itemised detailed accounts here making it perfectly evident that ships of the United States Navy were very clearly in violation of our Government's position on the matter.  I think it is rather amusing how the Government use the word &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; in their statements about this.  They presume a kind of innocence.  I would have to say that the Irish Government are very innocent if having read this, they were not aware that not only are nuclear powered vessels visiting these shores on a fairly routine basis but also ships that clearly carry nuclear weapons.  The certification of the American Navy itself makes this clear.</P>
    <P>I understand that our policy is to inform the Government controlling the visiting ship of what the Irish policy is. Here is the real innocence, our Government then assume that the Government whose ships are visiting our shores are going to comply, they are going to show goodwill, but the evidence demonstrates quite clearly that this does not happen. The American Government have a policy which they have enunciated that they will neither confirm nor deny.  I would have to ask the Minister if he is satisfied that this is an appropriate response in a country whose people certainly, regardless of what the Government have to say, do not wish even the possibility of a nuclear accident in one of their ports.</P>
    <P>May I take head-on the assertion of the Minister where he partially addresses this problem in the course of his Second Stage speech, which states:</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to turn to an issue which was raised extensively at both Committee and Report Stage in the Dáil, by way of a number of Opposition amendments to the Bill, which effectively meant that Ireland would be <Col N="1118" /> declared a nuclear free zone.  I do not want to go into all the details surrounding those amendments, suffice to say that the proposals in relation to visits of naval vessels and overflights of military aircraft which might carry nuclear weapons are not feasible.  The question is of a military nature and more appropriate to the responsibilities of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that argument.  Even if I did, the more logical Ministry to try to shuffle his responsibility on to would surely be the Minister for Defence.  If it is a military matter, surely it is for the Minister for Defence.  In any case, I do not care where they are trying to shift the burden of responsibility to.  Let me put it this way.  We were discussing the Environmental Protection Agency Bill earlier last week and this week and the argument here is parallel to an attempt to sustain under that Bill that if you were transporting dangerous chemicals through the roads of Ireland the Environmental Protection Agency should not be involved at all, it should be the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Communications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>As Labour spokesman for the Government, I welcome the opportunity to make this statement on this dreadful dispute which is taking place at the moment.  It is all the more serious <Col N="1119" /> because of the total chaos that is being experienced in every facet of Irish life.  It also happens at a time when the country was approaching a situation where we were on a par with the levels of industrial peace in the best European economies. We have to maintain that level of restraint if we wish to continue our economic development.  If we have not got the right climate then most certainly the investment and job creation so necessary for the progress of this country is put into very serious jeopardy indeed.</P>
      <P>Everyone knows the dreadful situation that exists at present.  Industry is being brought to a standstill. Indeed, we are aware of many industries where it is vital that they would keep their production levels and production schedules on time.  The fact that the dispute has now occurred is putting those industries in serious threat of total closure.  There are examples throughout the country where that is happening at the moment.</P>
      <P>Farmers, shopkeepers, housewives, young, old, sick and infirm are all severely affected.  Schools and every facet of Irish life are being adversely and seriously affected by this really unwarranted dispute.  The Government have made every effort to ensure that adequate machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes exists.  We now have in place, as a result of the new legislation, one of the most fundamental reviews of trade union dispute and industrial relations law that we ever had since. the foundation of the State.  The Labour Relations Commission has been put in place, to which the vast majority of Senators paid such glowing tributes in this House not all that long ago.  The ESB have their own internal machinery, which has proved relatively successful in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industrial disputes in large public service utilities portray an image of the country, both at home and abroad, that is, to say the least, very unhelpful.  The damage being done to the economy as a whole and to people in general and the hardship being caused is totally out of <Col N="1120" /> proportion to the issues involved in this dispute.  Surely it should be possible to call off the action and allow proper procedures to operate to find a settlement.</P>
    <P>The most surprising fact is that this dispute is occurring so soon after agreement on a three year programme was reached between all the social partners and the Government.  That programme was overwhelmingly endorsed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I do not think that any small sectional group should be allowed to hold the rest of the country to ransom.  That has to be read into the record.  This country cannot stand the type of small sectional groups of people who for their own specific reasons hold the rest of the country up to ransom and are at this moment causing such widespread difficulties, confusion and frustration throughout the whole country.</P>
    <P>Whether it takes today, tomorrow, next week or the week after, the dispute is going to be settled anyway.  But at the end of the day what happens is that industry, the people themselves and all sorts of sections within the economy have to pick up the pieces and start again. If the dispute continues for any further length of time the difficulty is that there will be no pieces for some of the industries to pick up.  We are going to cause a very serious situation throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> must be adhered to.  There is no way that that programme can be broken.  It is in everyone's interest that this dispute should be settled immediately.  I am calling on the strikers to return to work immediately and have the dispute settled within the proper procedures as laid down there for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>May I, first of all, thank the Leader of the House for having so readily agreed to my request this morning to make this half hour available so that the views of the House can be put on the record?  Clearly, we are all very conscious that we do not want to say anything which could exacerbate a difficult situation. <Col N="1121" /> Nonetheless there are certain things that have to be said and need to be said and must be said here this morning.</P>
      <P>First, I do not believe that I have ever seen such widespread total seething anger among so many people throughout our community as is felt over this particular strike.  If that anger can be translated into pressure on the various sides in the dispute to bring it to a fast end, then so much the better.  We have at least the opportunity here this morning to put our views on the record in that regard.  The strike is without doubt the biggest failure in Irish industrial relations in the past decade or longer.  More important than that, it is a strike which is totally unnecessary.  It is a strike which has, as has been said, consequences out of all proportion to the issues involved or to anything which can come when it is settled. It should never have happened.  Like other speakers, the first most important thing to be said here today is to support the plea to the strikers to go back to work.  They have made their point.  They must now get back within the proper procedures.  They will not be easily forgiven if they do not do that.</P>
      <P>The question of who is to blame is something which must be faced up to. There are lessons which must be learned from this dispute.  The ESB certainly must share a very major proportion of the blame.  It is a monopoly and holds trust from the public.  It is the key semi-State body in our community.  It has a duty to be in the forefront in industrial relations.  It often has been in the past. On this occasion there has been total failure on the part of the ESB management. They failed to anticipate.  They failed to deal properly with the issues. Most of all, they failed to warn the public at large of how imminent and how serious the consequences would be.  There are questions to be asked about the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ETU has pushed its claim further down than any responsible union should in view of the consequences which flowed from it.  Nothing can justify what they have done &mdash; the damage which has been caused, the fear felt by old people, the plight of those who are ill, those who are <Col N="1122" /> uncertain, people locked in large blocks of flats and the lifts not working, the jobs lost; the exports lost, the damage to our economic fabric.  All of this is incalculable and should have been part of their calculations when they decided to go that step further.  It was all done to make a point, just for a few pounds more.  That, at the end of the day, is all that will result from this.  Put that against the consequences of what has happened.</P>
    <P>I would also like to know &mdash; as, I am sure, the Minister does &mdash; what happened to the early warning system that the new Labour Relations Commission is there to provide.  One of the key functions of that commission was to provide the sort of early warning system which could anticipate strikes like this coming up.  It certainly has not worked on this occasion. Maybe it is not long enough there.  The Minister and every Member of this House want to know why it did not work on this occasion with such extraordinary consequences. The ICTU may ask themselves some questions about their importance in this situation, their inability to do anything.</P>
    <P>This morning I telephoned the ESB, because my own house is out completely and will be out for the duration of the strike.  A very nice man at the other end, who is taking abuse day and night for what is happening, said to me two things: he was ashamed to be associated with the ESB and he was ashamed to be a member of a union.  He said: &ldquo;If the strikers out there could hear the phone calls I am getting minute after minute from old people, frightened people, sick people, people whose jobs are at stake, they would go back because nothing can justify the hardship and chaos they are causing&rdquo;. I say here this morning to the Minister and all involved, and especially to the strikers, for God's sake get back to work.  Let the proper procedures take place.  The damage being inflicted on the country is little short of national sabotage. The sooner sanity comes back, the better.  We in this House, without taking sides, without apportioning blame, must stand behind the call to return to work <Col N="1123" /> and the call for a return to sanity and to proper procedures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the tradition of the House.  I would like to make a number of points which are important.  I can stand up here and from a trade union point of view I can say without a shadow of a doubt, with my hand on my heart, bad management blew the lights out all over the country.  I can spend as long as I want in justifying that position, but I do not think it adds very much to the debate.  I think it is a reality.  It is as easy to blame one side as the other.  As Senator Manning said, there is blame to be apportioned on both sides, but he very clearly apportioned blame to one side rather than the other when it came down to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality in any industrial dispute is that it is the person at the end of the line who has to take the action and the person suffering at the end of the line is going to be the worker.  In any industrial dispute the general public are not really interested until the action is taken and then invariably it is the workers who are the ones who have to take the blame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, I see this dispute as a reflection of inadequate procedures. I see it as a reflection of the failure of industrial relations within the ESB.  Industrial relations have two sides &mdash; I readily admit that point &mdash; but it is not just an issue for today.  As Senator McKenna said earlier, we had those who welcomed the Industrial Relations Bill in the media and other places some months back.  They welcomed the fact that we would no longer need crisis involvement from ICTU and from the Minister for Labour, that we would now set up a Labour Relations Commission to deal with these things.  It is quite unfair and <Col N="1124" /> illogical to hear these people today, in the media and other places, calling for the Minister to intervene and calling for ICTU to intervene.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations are in chaos in many places because everybody wants to go to the top of the line before they use the structures.  As far as I am concerned, this action &mdash; and I do not intend to justify it &mdash; is a reflection and an expression of the frustration being experienced by a group of workers who for four years have been trying to process a claim with management, a group of workers who a month ago offered talks.  It seems to me incredible that management refused the ETU's offer of a readiness to talk a month ago and that they waited for the cooling off period to expire before they got around to talking.  I want to make that point firmly for the record, that much could have been happening on this over the last month in order to achieve some improvement.</P>
    <P>The reality is that this is the management who were surprised to find themselves at the end of this very difficult action.  It seems to me that that is an extraordinary admission and an extraordinary reflection of an inept control of the organisation of the ESB.  I certainly cannot have confidence in a management who could be so surprised, who could so mislead the rest of us with statements that we did not have anything to worry about, who refused to accept the offer of the ETU a month ago for talks on this matter.  This is a long term claim.  It was being pushed through the procedures.  It is something that not only is not part of the present programme but was initiated before the last programme.</P>
    <P>That is the reality.  It is no wonder these workers are frustrated.  I would also ask them if they could reconsider their position, if we could perhaps get a bit of space for negotiations to take place.  But I will not just take the view that these workers acted overnight without giving any indication. This has been going on for four years, before even the last programme began.  It is now four years since there was any kind of industrial action in the ESB.  Before we start hammering these <Col N="1125" /> workers for the action over the last two days, let us look back over the last ten years.  We have not had any dispute of this nature in the ESB since 1987.  Previous to that it was 1986, when they threatened industrial action and it was called off the day before it was due to take place.  It was threatened at that time because management would not sit down and talk to the union, exactly the same as happened this time, except that this time it went over the edge and we are into a dispute, a dispute that helps nobody.</P>
    <P>There is chaos out there.  It is unfortunate. It is unacceptable at this stage that this should be allowed to continue. It is certain that we have to find a resolution of it.  It is correct that we would urge all the interested parties to do that at the moment.  But it would be totally wrong for the politicians in either House to present themselves at this point as industrial relations experts.  We are not. It is quite in order for us to comment on it and to represent views on it.  But at the end of the day the industrial relations procedures, which we welcomed in this House some months back, will have to take their course.  We can do no more than urge the people involved on both sides to find a resolution that will allow these workers also to be dealt with in a dignified and a responsible way so that people do not have to suffer further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>This country is now in the middle of a great national crisis.  The economy is put in jeopardy.  The health and welfare of ordinary citizens, who had neither hand, act nor part in this business, is also being put at risk.  Great hardship is being experienced by the vulnerable, such as the ill, the elderly, children, infants.  The safety of ordinary people is being compromised because of the failure of such simple things as traffic lights to work effectively.  Yet this strike was a clear possibility and had been well signalled to the ESB for a considerable period of time.  Due processes of industrial relations procedures were followed.  The 30-day cooling off period was followed. The 14-day strike notice was served and adhered to.  Yet the ESB management <Col N="1126" /> were making statements as late as last Friday evening that there was no threat to electricity supplies.</P>
      <P>Clearly, the industrial relations mechanisms in the ESB have failed.  They have failed to prevent the strike.  They have failed to anticipate it.  They have failed to warn the public of the impending problems so that they might be able to take appropriate measures to limit some of the difficulties that these would create. The dispute has also shown the deficiencies in the industrial relations structures in this country.  It has shown the inability of these structures to anticipate the problem and to take effective preventative measures.</P>
      <P>What is important now is to look for solutions.  Every effort must be made to facilitate the continuation of the talks. Management and unions must now, even with greater urgency, seek a means to get the power supply restored and renewed to everybody while talks continue and while negotiations proceed.  No useful purpose will be served by giving into demands for heavy-handed action.  This strike will finish sometime.  That is inevitable. We must be careful to do nothing now that will inadvertently defer the solution of this strike and make that solution more difficult.  There are enough precedents in this country to show that when this type of strike is handled badly a bad situation can be made worse.  We must all the time keep on reminding ourselves of that possibility.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I would like to thank and to pay tribute to all the people who are working to try to resolve this strike. Talks had been going on for something like 36 hours, the last time I heard about them.  They have probably gone on for as much as 40 hours now.  A great effort is being made by many people in this matter and we should pay tribute to them, thank them and indeed encourage them to contribute to try to find a solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me first of all thank the Leader of the House for allowing time for this very important debate to take place.  One cannot underestimate the gravity of the present situation. <Col N="1127" /> Because of that it is also an extremely sensitive issue and certainly I have no intention of trying to apportion blame. That would not be constructive or assist in the process that is ongoing at the moment.</P>
      <P>As has been referred to by other Senators, it seems to me that there is something wrong with the procedures within the ESB that this situation should have occurred in the first place.  I am at a loss to understand how we have actually found ourselves now in one of the worst industrial disputes in this country in recent years.  I and the vast majority of people living in this country thought that the days of such strikes had long ended, particularly following on the conclusion of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and what that means for industrial relations in this country and the hope it held out to many people.</P>
      <P>This is certainly a very retrograde step and one that must be brought to a conclusion immediately.  As my colleague has just stated, this strike will end and what we are now concerned about is: what price do we have to pay for the ending of this strike?  We have come through a very difficult economic situation in the recent past and great efforts have been made on both sides, from the employers' and the employees' side, to bring forward new industrial harmony in this country.  I have gone on record in this House in commending the new strides that the unions have made in their attitude to industrial relations; and to see that threatened now has grave consequences for the whole economic and commercial life within this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the senior people involved in unions to appeal to their colleagues in the ETU to get back around the negotiating table and put off the strike until negotiations can be completed. There are many companies in this country at the moment, both small and large, who have been hanging on in a difficult international economic climate.  This sort of strike could be the death knell to those companies.  I spoke to many of them in the last 24 hours.  This was the one thing <Col N="1128" /> they did not plan for, that they could not have planned for, that they did not expect to happen at all.  By the admission of the management in the ESB, who certainly did not anticipate it, it certainly would have been extremely difficult for these companies to have anticipated such a strike.</P>
    <P>Not alone are we talking about jobs that are in existence in this country being under threat but it has certainly postponed the agenda of many companies for the creation of jobs both within existing companies and also the prospect of new companies starting out in the immediate future.  The consequences on that side are clear for all to see.  It must be realised by all sides that this strike has enormous potential damage for the whole fabric of the economic life.  It is also sending disastrous signals internationally for the planning which the IDA and other companies are doing in attracting foreign investment into this country.  This is the worst possible signal that could be sent abroad.  I know that the view being taken of Ireland in the last number of years has been one of an economic miracle.  All of the signs were so positive for investment, so positive for job creation, so positive for industrial harmony, so positive for a very great future post-1992 that Ireland was once again at the forefront as an attractive location for economic development.</P>
    <P>It has also had a great effect on the individual in this country, from the very small man or woman in the street right through our commercial life.  The chaos it is causing, the hardship, the worry and the concern is something extraordinary. It is extraordinary because it was not anticipated by anybody in the country.  I would appeal to all of those involved to call off the strike.  That must be the essential first step that must be taken &mdash; to get around the table and find a solution. There is a solution.  There is no question about this.  All of these problems are resolvable, so let us resolve them without paying a horrendous price.  The price at the moment is serious, but it can be an awful lot worse.  I have every confidence in the Minister for Labour, <Col N="1129" /> having seen him act in other situations that I am personally aware of.  I would ask him to use his undoubted skills to bring this situation to a conclusion immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I first of all thank all the Senators for their support.  I am in the unique position in this debate that I could agree with almost all that was said by everybody in the House.  I want to assure the House that the Labour Relations Commission have commenced the talks again this morning at 11 o'clock.  They had finished at about 2.45 a.m.  I was with the negotiating team for the commission throughout the night and we met again at 8 a.m. this morning.</P>
      <P>The first thing I want to put on the record is my appreciation of all the commission staff.  In the last few days they have taken a certain amount of criticism, which they are well used to.  I think some of it is unfair &mdash; for example, to say that they are not available at weekends when for the past four weekends they have been involved in three disputes, in the rail dispute, in the bus dispute and in a mixture of disputes which arose over the Easter weekend.  In fact, the staff involved at least once a week lose a full night on their five day shift and every second week lose a weekend.  When a major dispute commences people look at their job but when they are successful throughout the rest of the year nobody really notices what they are doing.  I want to thank them for the extraordinary effort they have put in on the session of talks that started at 12 o'clock on Tuesday and ended at 2.45 a.m. this morning. Certainly, it was a marathon effort.  I think it is true to say that both sides involved had an opportunity to get some hours sleep and, to get meals, but the Commission staff never left their post and I think that is public service at its best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I cannot tell the House that we have yet reached a stage where we can get a resolution of this dispute.  At around 8 o'clock last night I met the senior people from both sides.  I <Col N="1130" /> explained to them what I had said in this House and the unanimous conclusions of the political parties of the other House. Also, because they had not had an opportunity of seeing the day's news, I gave them a list of the devastation that has been occurring nationwide.  Senator Manning read a list of that, which I have no argument with.  I think this is the reality of the dispute.  It often happens that when people are in disputes, and particularly in long sessions, they can get removed from the reality outside and I spent some time last night emphasising to the people involved that, regrettably, may be they did not intend it, but whether they did or not they had brought the country to a virtual standstill in many areas and that they had an obligation to undo that, based on talks.  In this country we have an amazing amount of industrial relations machinery.  The Labour Relations Commission is there, the Labour Court is there, the Employer Labour Conference is there and in the past perhaps we had not got a proactive Labour Relations Commission.  In this case on Monday morning they were into the front line.</P>
    <P>I want to answer directly the question posed by Senator Manning.  I want to assure him that at the end of this dispute &mdash; I think during the dispute is not a time to do it &mdash; I will investigate, because I think it is important to know why the early warning system did not work.  I am not here to say that it did not.  But I want to assure the House that as soon as the gravity of the situation was made known and the fact that the information that would normally reach us was silent, the Labour Relations Commission were in action within the hour.  I did not do it yesterday or the day before but I just want to put on the record now that I was in the Department of Labour until fairly late on Saturday night on another dispute which was taking my attention &mdash; I will not say which one &mdash; and I was doing some background work on it.  My officials had been there late on Friday night and at no time did anyone make contact with me or any of the officials.  I believe they <Col N="1131" /> may have tried to contact an official on Sunday.</P>
    <P>The normal channels through the Congress of Trade Unions, through the FIE, through the Labour Relations Commission, through the Employer Labour Conference, through the Labour Court or directly to any official were not used on this occasion.  On checking it on Friday one of my senior officials, a very experienced person, was told there was no difficulty on any disruptive action for a week, that we would have a week to deal with this.  That is why nobody from the Labour Relations Commission went into circles on Saturday or Sunday, which was fair enough since they had got that information. However, it is regrettable.</P>
    <P>I intervened in the last ESB dispute prior to the dispute starting.  But this time no information came.  However, I must say, having met the people directly last night that I do not believe there was any major plot by anybody.  I want to make that clear.  What happened was that people were looking at each other waiting for somebody to blink, both blinked together and we ended up in this dispute. I want to assure the House that we will carry out at the end of this dispute an examination of how everything went unnoticed.  It rarely happens, but it is a worry that it can happen and that the information that filtered through was so totally wrong.</P>
    <P>I want to thank Senators again.  It is not often we get a chance to speak on such a topic two days in a row.  The reason the talks stopped at 2.45 a.m. was that I came to the conclusion that after so many hours the key people required some rest.  It was coming to the stage where it was impossible for people to think straight.  They have now got that rest.  As I said yesterday, the enormous effects of the dispute bear no relationship whatsoever to the issues involved.  The ESB are one of the few organisations who have their own joint industrial council. Without any difficulty these issues could go back to the joint industrial council and be discussed over the coming days under an independent chairperson.  If they need <Col N="1132" /> any assistance from me directly, from the Labour Relations Commission, from the Labour Court or anybody else, that will be forthcoming.  I think that is adequate for any set of workers, particularly when we are talking about 1,000 workers affecting 3.4 million people.  We are at a stage now where, in fairness to the society we live in, these workers should listen to what we are saying and return to work. They have my assurance that we will negotiate and examine the issues central to this dispute in a calm atmosphere away from the massive disruption which is being caused.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the saddest occasions or functions one goes to either as a public representative or as an individual is the funeral of a child.  I am sure we have all attended one on some occasion within our own family or among friends or connections.  We know how desolate such a day or such a happening is.  Fortunately for us here it is something which we very rarely have to attend.  That is not the situation with the people we refer to as the Kurds at the moment. Four, five or six children of Kurdish families have been buried one after another over the past couple of weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Kurds have the same human feelings as we have and it is very hard to imagine how one would cope with such a situation: fleeing in panic and terror from one's home, moving through mountains and appalling weather conditions, having no food or drink, seeing members of one's family die one after another of starvation, dehydration or cold and exposure, never able to pause knowing that the helicopter gunships and the troops of the Iraqi army are following close behind, by all accounts indiscriminately shooting and killing the refugees as they attempt to flee.  It is an appalling situation and who these people were or whatever side they were on does <Col N="1133" /> not matter; they are still men, women and children.  In such circumstances it is often the old people and children who suffer most and most quickly.</P>
    <P>Kurds are people largely unknown to us, although very well known in history; in some ways we share similarities.  For many centuries they have been unable to express their political independence. Unlike us, who at least have our freedom, they were cruelly deceived at the end of the First World War when they received promises from the then great powers that they would have independence.  These promises were very soon broken.  Whatever the justification or otherwise for an independent Kurdish state, Kurdistan, there is little doubt that the Kurds themselves wish to have such a state.  That is not the purpose of today's statements or discussions, except in the sense that the Kurds in Iraq have on a number of occasions in the last few years attempted by one means or another to gain a degree not of independence but of autonomy.</P>
    <P>One of the few brighter or more hopeful features has been the meeting between the leader of one of the main Kurdish groups and the Iraqi government, and an understanding has, I believe, been agreed but not yet signed whereby autonomy will be granted to the Kurdish area of Iraq.  Let us hope that that is an agreement which will be signed and kept to and which will give a measure of comfort in the future to the Kurdish people.  One of the terrible things about war is that it is nearly always the innocent, the old and the young who suffer. I do not think there is very much doubt but that these people, rightly or wrongly, felt that they had been encouraged to attempt to rise against the Iraqi regime. With the successful conclusion of the war by the United Nations allied group, they found themselves in a position where they had taken on the Iraqi Government and we heard plenty of statements about the murderous brutality of that Government and their police and armed forces.  They effectively found themselves at the mercy of these forces, forces which had themselves suffered very severe casualties.  No doubt they were not feeling very friendly <Col N="1134" /> towards those whom they would regard as having attacked them.</P>
    <P>The immediate aftermath of the war in which the helicopter gunships were turned on the Kurdish rebels seems to have gone far beyond any necessary military suppression and charged into a situation which could, with a good deal of reason, be described as genocide, an attempt to wipe out an entire people, basically because they are a people and not to discriminate in any sense between those taking part in protests and the vast mass of ordinary people.  The pictures of the torture chambers where individuals were hanged by their heels, beaten, tortoured and maltreated in every imaginable and unimaginable way on a systematic scale gives us to understand why the Kurdish people in their millions fled before the severe and brutal onslaught of the Iraqi armed forces.</P>
    <P>The western world was not prepared for this and I think there was an understandable temptation, perhaps even on the American side, not to become involved.  The war was over, the objectives of the United Nations mandate had apparently been secured.  But starting a war is easy but to end it is much more difficult.  It was only as the television pictures of the tragic circumstances of the Kurdish refugees began to appear on our television screens, and perhaps more importantly on those of the US and other major powers, that it was realised that it was not just good enough to encourage these people to rise and revolt and then leave them to the devices of Mr. Saddam Hussein, whom all of us on both sides of this House have justifiably described in very strong terms.  Yet these people had been left to his tender mercies.  I am very glad to see that steps are being taken, by those involved on the Allied side and by the United Nations.  I am particularly pleased that an Irish officer is playing a major role as Commander of the United Nations unit which has just taken over one area.  I hope that we, our Government, and our people who have already subscribed to this, will support the provision of humanitarian aid and relief to the Kurdish people and will support <Col N="1135" /> measures by the international community to give all possible aid and support to those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the House is taking time to reflect and consider what steps can be taken to make a contribution to ease the plight of the Kurdish people. I hope that the concern of this House will not be wholly concentrated on the Kurds but on all the displaced Iraqi people &mdash; the Kurds, the people from Turkistan and the Christians alike who comprise the Iraqi civil population massing on the Iraqi-Turkish and Iraqi-Iranian borders. We must all strive to understand this tragedy and face our moral obligations. Our generation cannot say in the future that this tragedy was on the other side of the world and we did not know about it. We have all marvelled at the high-tech knowledge used in the Gulf War.  We saw on television the destructive power of modern technology and some people marvelled at the effect and efficiency of it.  Is it too much to expect that a somewhat similar response to this gigantic human tragedy would be forthcoming at this time?  We have seen millions of deprived people in the wilderness.  There are horrific scenes similar to biblical times.  We all bear witness in our own livingrooms to this terrible visitation on millions of unfortunate people.  So we must be aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a growing famine in Africa which is largely ignored or relegated to a poor second place behind the Middle East.  We are told that an estimated 20 million people need food, are undernourished or are starving in a number of African countries, while here in Europe, the fortress of prosperity, the hoarders of food mountains, we complain about the problems of our food surpluses. Europe, especially the European Community, has opened its doors to the East, and rightly so, but the window to the south and to the problems of the south has been tightly closed.  This is not good enough.  We must champion the plight of starving and displaced people.  We must champion the plight of refugees, whether <Col N="1136" /> they are fleeing from Saddam Hussein in Iraq or from inhuman regimes in any other part of the world.  There are starving hordes of unfortunate tribes searching and begging for sustenance, for food, shelter and medication.</P>
    <P>This human tragedy is too large to become the burden of one or two countries. The entire world must provide immediate and generous help and tangible support.  We must not look to Governments alone to answer the call of a free conscience on our behalf but make some individual sacrifices to ease the burden and the pangs of hunger of those millions of people.</P>
    <P>Let there be no mistake.  The blame for the Kurdish tragedy must be put firmly in the court of Saddam Hussein in Iraq.  I have great difficulty understanding the reluctance of President Bush to aid the Kurds.  The UK Prime Minister, Mr. Major, proposed a safe haven for them. This should have been implemented by the United Nations and supported by every freedom-loving person in the world.  There has been sufficient talk. Our Government must take the lead in the European Community and in the United Nations, insisting on human rights for all of these people, so that those deprived and displaced persons also enjoy human rights.</P>
    <P>Our Minister should speak out fearlessly on behalf of humanity in defence of the Kurdish people and nation and we, in our freedom, must advocate maximum pressure on Saddam Hussein not only to stop attacking and threatening those people but to provide land and help for those subjects.  In the television shots Turkey has been portrayed in a somewhat negative light, especially on some of the RTE news coverage over the last number of weeks.  I would like to ask how we would react?  The only recent invasion we experienced here over the last few years was a couple of dozen of itinerant or travelling traders who descended on a number of provincial towns to the consternation of the settled people in those areas.</P>
    <P>How would our public react if, instead of having a couple of hundred people <Col N="1137" /> camping for two or three days in the car parks or in the vicinity of the towns, we had 1,000 people with no sustenance, no means of support concentrated in an area not to mention a couple of million people who are presently in the mountains on the Turkish and Iranian borders.  I do not think that our country, or any country could be expected to meet that challenge alone.  It is clear that this is not the first time Turkey faced this problem.  When the Iraqi regime used chemical weapons against the Kurdish population in 1988 some 60,000 refugees went to Turkey.  Of those the western democracies accepted 418 refugees.  It is unfair to expect one or two countries to bear the entire burden. Turkey has been declared an underdeveloped nation; its standard of development is too low for the European Community to consider it fit for membership. Yet, there is a glib suggestion that that Third World country should be able to take on an additional two million people and feed them.  They cannot do it alone.</P>
    <P>That is why I want our Minister to take a headline from Frank Aiken in the early sixties when he championed a United Nations policy for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and disarmament.  It took years go get that message across. What are we left with 20 years later?  We, with our neutral status and contacts in the EC as a full member of the European Community and as a founder member of the United Nations, have a moral obligation to make our voices heard.  I do not think there is anyone in a better position to do that other than our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins.  I hope he will take that up.</P>
    <P>It will charge out of the history books in one hundred years' time that this generation, especially the western democracies, allowed millions of people not only in the east, in Iraq and also in Africa, to die of starvation and want when the main problem in Europe was one of food mountains.  We are restricting production and not allowing people produce food that is so badly wanted and scarce right across the world.  Nothing less than a concentrated effort such as Mr. Aiken <Col N="1138" /> undertook with Freddie Boland at the time when I first had the pleasure of speaking in this House, will suffice to deal with the horrific problem.</P>
    <P>I listened with tremendous interest to Mr. Gay Byrne and Mr. Charlie Bird on the Radio this morning.  The entire country had the opportunity of hearing first hand an eyewitness account from Mr. Bird.  He told us of his experiences while representing Telefís Éireann and sending the news home.  I compliment the aid workers, the Red Cross, Trócaire, Concern and the United Nations for the tremendous organisation involved in getting aid out promptly although in a small amount.  We should appeal for more.  The Government have an obligation to give the lead and the £500,000 they have made available through the Red Cross, Trócaire and Concern and, indeed as their proportionate share of the one billion ECUs made available through the European Community, is but a drop in the ocean and is not enough.  As a developed country we cannot say we do not know and have not seen and witnessed the misery of these people on the top of those mountains.</P>
    <P>Mr. Major's proposal for safe havens in Kurdistan should be, even at this late stage, implemented with whatever force necessary being used to ensure the safety and interests of those people who were forced to flee barefoot from their homes and country.  This is an episode that history will not appreciate or thank this generation for.  Even at this late stage we must reverse the situation, and be fearless. The United Nations if it is not able to deal with this problem, and cannot cut through the red tape is not worthy of support.  It is an absolute nonsense to accept that once the economic interests of the United Nations have been served humanity means nothing to them.  I had hoped that the reverse would be the position. On behalf of the Fine Gael group in the House I would like to thank the Leader of the House for making time available so that we as a party can express our concern and demonstrate our Christian responsibility in not asking the Government only to give a sharper lead <Col N="1139" /> and make more resources available but to appeal to all right minded people to make a sacrifice so that at least we can say that we made a contribution.  We hope to see a sharp and prompt easing of the situation for those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my horror at the terrible state of affairs that exists at present in Iraq and in the mountains of that country where approximately two million people are marooned in very shabby and inadequate accommodation, with little or no food as the days go on.  Their numbers are almost unmanageable.  One reads in magazines like <i>Newsweek</i> and <i>Time</i> detailed reports of burying children each morning, perhaps 30 or 40, who had died in the night from the cold weather or other factors. That is a standard thing.  The very few doctors who are in the area expect a severe acceleration in the number of deaths in the very near future unless something very major is done.</P>
      <P>We must not forget that the people dying here in very large numbers are not the sort of people that we were confronted with in Ethiopia, Sudan, Cambodia and other places where we were confronted with very unhealthy people in the sense that they did not have much physical resources left to them.  Here we have very strong people, people who have suddenly gone down and are going down rapidly.  In the first instance, we have young healthy children being the victims.  Young children are dying at the rate of 34, 40, 50 or 60 each day.  We also have older people, middle aged people and young people.  There are no sanitary conditions and no food.  It is an environment conducive to massive outbreaks of disease of one type or another, cholera and other diseases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us reflect for a moment on why two million people have suddenly headed for the hills and departed into a no-man's land area.  The reason is fear.  I said in this House previously that the Americans did a marvellous job in the war in Iraq and did teach Saddam Hussein a very firm and direct lesson.  At the same time, <Col N="1140" /> Saddam Hussein is still there.  Saddam Hussein is the reason why these people through pure fear have left their towns and villages, in many cases places of comfort. We are not dealing here with people who had nothing in life.  We are dealing here with a lot of people who had the ordinary comforts that we are all fortunate to enjoy.  They had to leave and disappear or otherwise be forced out by the army.  These people are there in these massive numbers and indeed being joined all the time by additional people &mdash; as well as losing thousands and thousands of people as the days go on &mdash; because we have Saddam Hussein still in Iraq.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to reconcile the American situation here.  I compliment them with others &mdash; the French, the English and others &mdash; for dealing very effectively with the tranny and the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein.  At the same time, I am not at all sure that it was politically correct for the Americans to leave Iraq in the state in which it is now.  The Americans will say, and have said, that they would not be responsible for another civil war in Iraq.  At the same time one has to be conscious of the fact that there is no point in removing the problem unless you remove the cause of that problem.  The cause of the problem in Kuwait was effectively Saddam Husein.  He was the one we all felt should have to leave the scene. The words &ldquo;Hussein should be taken out&rdquo; were used.  Yet we found ourselves with this man firmly entrenched and protected against almost any form of attack from any quarter.  With this I believe that we, as part of the United Nations, and our American and UK friends especially, who dealt with the problem magnificently this far, stand condemned for standing back now and doing nothing.  This is basically our problem and it is something I believe will have to change radically in the days ahead.</P>
    <P>There is no point in expecting countries like Iran to accommodate one million additional persons at this stage.  This is the sort of figure that is estimated of the number of people who have either gone into Iran or are on their way into Iran. There is a figure talked about of 600,000 <Col N="1141" /> persons who are heading for Turkey. These are very underdeveloped countries that have great difficulties in maintaining their own people in reasonable levels of living.  Quite honestly this is not a Middle East problem at this point in time.  It is a problem that faces the world, faces the United Nations and faces us all.  Together we can and must find a solution, but it must be found very rapidly.</P>
    <P>I believe that some policed type of law and order has to be restored to Iraq.  We have to get Iraq removed from the scene where the army is running riot through the country, that is Hussein's army, and forcing out in front of it the people that were in any way against Saddam Hussein during the war.  This is the sort of situation that has to be tackled immediately and simultaneously.  We must get down from the mountainsides all these unfortunate creatures, or at least those of them who are left. The matter is extremely urgent.  Out there, there are thousands of people who will have died before we have completed a short discussion on this vital subject.</P>
    <P>There is little point in piecemeal efforts on the part of the voluntary organisations like the Red Cross, Trócaire and all the others contributing their little bit.  They are to be complimented.  They are to be saluted and admired, thanked and paid tribute to for all their efforts.  Having said that, I believe the impact they are capable of making on this major problem is very, very small.  There is no way that they can make a dent in this major problem at the moment.</P>
    <P>The problem that is facing us at the moment, let us call a spade a spade, is one that would require a major army manoeuvre involving hundreds of helicopters and lots of people, qualified people in the medical and nursing arena, to bring these people down from those positions they have wandered into and been forced into and get them back to ordinary habitation again.  This is something that has to be done quickly.  There is no point in letting the matter drag on. Week after week we read in the various magazines and papers that so many extra hundreds or thousands have died and the <Col N="1142" /> position has become this, that or the other.  Basically, the problem is one of the state that Iraq has been left in after the war.  Iraq did, in fact, leave Kuwait. This was the kernel of the war in the first instance.  However, Iraq was still directed and ruled by Saddam Hussein and his terrorist army.  That is the position that in my view must change.</P>
    <P>Simultaneously to that changing there must be a positive and concrete effort to get the people from their places of destitution down to some area of short term comfort with a view to their being placed throughout other countries in the world.  I do not expect Turkey or Iran to take in hundreds of thousands of people. In the short term I am quite satisfied they could be accommodated there.  They could be kept alive until they could be brought along to other countries like our own.  We recall the uprising in Hungary in 1956.  The refugees were brought here to Ireland and to other countries as well. That is the kind of exercise that will take place but, in the first instance, there has to be a short term effort to get the people out of desperation into a position where we can undertake this very valuable exercise.</P>
    <P>I have gone through the points that I wish to cover.  We as a small nation can contribute enormously to it not in direct terms but through our influence in the UN and through our illustrious Minister whom I would like to welcome to this House, who is doing a very good job in the Foreign Affairs Department.</P>
    <P>We must make certain that we use the UN as a vehicle to put in place what I have suggested with regard to the administration of Iraq, with regard to getting these people down from their places of horror on a temporary level and then I am quite certain countries throughout the world will take them.  In case anybody might get the impression that I was making little of the contribution made by many organisations like the Red Cross and Trócaire, I would refer to all of them with great respect and great admiration. While their effort is to be admired, their final contribution is little in the context of the job to be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> Since the Minister is with us I would appeal to him to use his best offices at UN level and at any other level that he can to make certain that there is an immediate job done to get these people where they can be positioned before they are distributed to other countries throughout the world.  I would also appeal to the Minister to use his good offices to make sure that this tyrant in Iraq does not continue to remain in the position of responsibility he is in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the last few weeks we have witnessed one of the greatest human tragedies of this century.  It is impossible not to be deeply moved by the plight of the Iraqi Kurds and the other Iraqi refugees.  The scenes of suffering, starvation and sheer human misery which we have seen on our TV screens and read about in our newspapers have touched us all.  Particularly harrowing is the fact that those who are suffering most in this tragedy are those who are least able to endure suffering, very young children and elderly men and women.</P>
      <P>These people are ordinary human beings like you and me.  They are the victims of brutal repression by a regime which has in the past shown no regard for the basic human rights of its own people. The Kurds of northern Iraq were deliberately targeted by Saddam Hussein for one of the most savage campaigns of collective reprisal which the world has ever seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the ink barely dry on the agreement which brought about the cessation of hostilities between Iraq and the multinational forces, the Iraqi authorities launched a terrible onslaught against a section of their own people who were fighting for a status of autonomy which had been conceded to them some 20 years ago but regrettably was then withdrawn. Cities, towns and villages were shelled and fired on by helicopter gunships, bombs were dropped indiscriminately on civilian communities, many innocent people were killed or maimed and hundreds of thousands of families were <Col N="1144" /> driven from their homes, many in inadequate clothing and having to leave behind all of their possessions, and forced to flee to the barren mountains of the north-east in the hope of sanctuary from the terror which followed them.</P>
    <P>This is the scale of the problem with which the world has been faced; a massive number of people, men, women and children, people from all walks of life, stranded in the open air on freezing mountain-tops, without adequate supplies of food or water, huddled together in make-shift shelters watching members of their community die in their hundreds each day.  Up to two million people have been uprooted from their homes and forced to endure the most horrific deprivation. The total number of displaced persons remains unclear but this is one of the largest involuntary movements of population the modern world has seen, in particular in so brief a period.</P>
    <P>The immediate needs of the refugees are obvious for all to see &mdash; it is imperative that they receive food, shelter and medical supplies as an absolute priority and they must be safe from further attack while this relief effort is in progress.  The front-line countries which had to bear the initial brunt of the refugee problem were Iran and Turkey.  It is fair to say that these two countries, along with the international community in general, were caught unawares by the scale of the crisis and the speed with which it developed. Because of the swiftness and brutality of Saddam's retribution and the Iraqi ban on foreign media coverage, little was known of the enormity of this tragedy until thousands of weak, hungry and bewildered people began arriving at the Turkish border having made the long trek, on foot, through the mountains.</P>
    <P>No country could, on its own, cope with a refugee problem of this size.  Even in the early days of this tragedy, when emergency relief efforts were getting under way and food and shelter items were beginning to be distributed at the Turkish border, few imagined the scale of the crisis.  The resources of the Turkish state were severely stretched.  The local <Col N="1145" /> population and the military and provincial authorities, under the co-ordination of the Turkish Red Crescent, made major efforts to alleviate the suffering of the refugees.  There was simply no way, however, that this could be sufficient and a massive international effort was always going to be necessary.</P>
    <P>The same must be said of Iran, a country itself ravaged by eight years of terrible warfare and having suffered a series of natural disasters such as extensive flooding and the recent catastrophic earthquake. The Iranian authorities have responded very well to this latest crisis, opening their border to admit the Kurdish refugees and making available to them everything they can, in terms of food, medicines and shelter.  Iran had already accepted many thousands of refugees during the preceding months of the Gulf crisis, including of course the Shi'ites from the south of Iraq whose uprising against Saddam Hussein was also brutally repressed.  Some camps were prepared, but not nearly enough to cope with the numbers involved.</P>
    <P>When the scale of this problem became clear, I believe that the international community responded well.  The United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross and other international organisations launched appeals within days and began setting up organised relief operations.  The European Commission made a preliminary contribution to the relief effort on 3 April.  On 8 April, at the special EC summit meeting, the Twelve Heads of State and Government announced that 150 million Ecus was being made available immediately to help the refugees.  I hope that the massive provision of aid and improved logistics will shortly ensure that food and other vital supplies will become more widely available to the refugees.  However, this will not solve the crisis, as refugees cannot be left in temporary camps in the inhospitable mountain conditions of the border regions.  Apart from the problem of the physical needs of the refugees, the <Col N="1146" /> international community had to address also the question of security.</P>
    <P>What was at stake was the effective possibility for the refugees to receive and benefit from the international aid being provided so massively.  This issue confronted the international community with very serious issues of principle.  The territorial integrity of states and non-interference in their internal affairs are very important principles of international law. However, faced as we were with the deaths of hundreds of refugees daily, especially the very young and the old, we had to consider whether the international community did not have overriding responsibilities to intervene in order to prevent these unnecessary deaths.</P>
    <P>It was thus that on 5 April the Security Council passed a Resolution insisting that Iraq allow immediate access by international humanitarian organisations to all those in need of assistance in all parts of Iraq and to make available all necessary facilities for their operations and requesting the Secretary-General of the UN to use all the resources at his disposal to address urgently the critical needs of the refugees and displaced Iraqi population. The Security Council expressed its grave concern at the developments on Iraq's borders which threatened international peace and security in the region, and thus opened the way for enforcement action by the Security Council.  The European Council, meeting three days later, confirmed the view that the situation represented a threat to peace by virtue of the Charter and envisaged the establishment of a protected zone under UN supervision.</P>
    <P>Since then, the efforts of the international community have been directed towards the establishment of protected zones in Iraq, within which the refugees can be assured of receiving and benefiting in security from the aid being provided. Because of the urgency of the emergency, the safe zones I refer to are being established in Iraq by U.S., UK and French military forces, with assistance from <Col N="1147" /> other states.  The objective is to establish these zones, so that urgent requirements can be met within the time-frame required, and then hand them over to the authority of the United Nations.  Ireland supports this objective, considering that the primary need is to prevent further unnecessary death and suffering.  We note that the objective of handing the camps over to UN authority is shared by those setting them up, by Iraq, and by the UN itself.  Of course, an important consideration in deciding the future responsibility for the camps is the security of the refugee population being aided there.</P>
    <P>The mission of Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the Secretary General's Representative to the region, and his signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with the Iraqi authorities on 18 April is an encouraging development, encouraging in that it opens a possibility of transfer to UN responsibility of the relief operations currently going ahead in northern Iraq.  The Memorandum recognises the importance and urgency of adequate measures, including the provision of humanitarian assistance, to alleviate the suffering of Iraqi refugees. Both Iraq and the UN agree that the measures to be taken for the benefit of displaced persons should be based primarily on their personal safety and the provision of humanitarian assistance and relief for their return and normalisation of their lives in their places of origin.  In it the Iraqi authorities pledge their full co-operation with the United Nations wherever a UN presence is needed.</P>
    <P>UN sub-offices and Humanitarian Centres are being set up under this agreement. The centres are to be staffed by UN personnel as well as personnel coopted from the ICRC and other nongovernmental organisations.  The Iraqi Red Crescent will also play a role in the relief effort.  The memorandum also provides for the urgent setting-up of routes of return, with relay stations along the <Col N="1148" /> way and logistical back-up.  The Iraqi Government has agreed that humanitarian assistance should be impartial and that all civilians in need, wherever they are located, are entitled to receive it.  The agreement specifically guarantees that all Iraqi officials concerned, including the military, will facilitate the safe passage of emergency relief commodities through Iraq.</P>
    <P>These provisions reflect the more general objective of the operations now being carried out, namely, to ensure urgent relief of the suffering of the people concerned and to reassure them that they can eventually return in safety to their homes.  The recent history of Iraq gives rise to legitimate questions concerning the violability of assurances given by the present authorities of Iraq.  While, therefore, we hope that they will deliver on this agreement, the international community will be monitoring the situation closely to see that Iraq begins to behave acceptably to its own population.  In this connection we attach some importance to the negotiations being conducted in Baghdad between Kurdish representatives and the Iraqi authorities aimed at securing agreement on a status of autonomy for the Kurds in Iraq.  From press reports it would appear that progress has been made in these negotiations.  We hope that thus the necessary steps can be taken to ensure that the current crisis can be overcome while maintaining the territorial integrity of Iraq.  In our view the dismemberment of Iraq would not serve the interest of anybody.</P>
    <P>I would like now to go back to the relief effort proper.  The Irish contribution to this has been a significant one.  The Taoiseach announced in Luxembourg at the informal meeting of the Twelve Heads of State or Government that the Government was providing £1 million to assist the refugees, £700,000 of this has been made available through the Community budget and £300,000 was provided bilaterally through aid agencies.  At the weekend I announced a further £225,000 <Col N="1149" /> allocation, bringing the total Government bilateral contribution to £550,000, of which £200,000 will go through the Red Cross, £150,000 through the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and £100,000 each through Concern and Trócaire.  The Irish public have also responded magnificently to the various appeals.  This country's total contribution to the relief effort will exceed £3 million. Once again the Irish people can feel proud of the way in which they have acted to help those in need.</P>
    <P>As Senators know, the first plane-load of Irish aid was flown to Tehran last week in a joint Government-Red Cross effort on a cargo plane provided free of charge by the Aer Lingus's subsidiary, Aer Turas.  The supplies were accompanied by a Red Cross volunteer who was able to report that they were successfully distributed.  Since then further flights have followed and more are scheduled for the coming days, including two more flights arranged by the Government and provided free of charge by Guinness Peat Aviation and Aer Turas.</P>
    <P>One of these will go to Turkey, bringing relief supplies for the Concern operation in refugee camps on the Turkish border, and one to Iran with further supplies from the Irish Red Cross.</P>
    <P>The relief effort has gained momentum rapidly in the last fortnight but there is still much more that has to be done to ensure quick and effective assistance to the refugees so that their suffering can be ended as speedily as possible.  There have been indications in recent days that more aid is reaching those who need it most and some refugees have been airlifted to lower ground.  A more effective distribution network for food and medical attention is being established, and better co-ordinated relief programmes and full and speedy delivery of the resources pledged are getting the immediate problems under control.  The Government, as part of the overall international effort, will continue to review the situation and will consider further action as developments warrant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1150" /> At present the situation in Iraq has not yet been satisfactorily clarified.  It is therefore the view of Ireland and the rest of the Twelve that the sanctions that were imposed on Iraq because of its invasion and purported annexation of Kuwait should be maintained so long as it persists in policies and practices regarding its own population which have given rise to such unprecedented suffering and that derogations from the sanction regime should continue to be examined case by case on a humanitarian basis.  It is also our view that those in Iraq who are responsible for such crimes should be brought to account: we know that the authorities in Kuwait, which was the victim of war crimes and vandalism throughout the Iraqi occupation, are pursuing this matter.  The Twelve have decided to follow up this possibility as far as they are concerned: we have already taken it up with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I would like finally to revert once again to the effort to provide humanitarian aid to the refugees.  The situation on the Turkish border at first received most attention &mdash; understandably, as it was there that the international media had concentrated.  However, I have just been having talks here in Dublin with my Iranian counterpart, the Foreign Minister Dr. Velayati.  I have told him that most of the Irish bilateral aid has gone to Iran. This is only appropriate, when one considers that the numbers of refugees entering Iran are in fact greater than the number on the Turkish border.</P>
    <P>I once again pay tribute to the openheartedness of the people of Ireland in their response to this appalling tragedy. I hope that out of this unspeakable suffering of millions of innocent people will arise a new international consciousness of the solidarity of all the people of the world and of the corresponding responsibility of the international community to do its utmost to relieve the suffering of the innocent, wherever it may occur.  This <Col N="1151" /> will be an indispensable component of any acceptable new world order.</P>

      <P>I do not find a great deal to quarrel with in what the Minister has said, but it is significant that it has taken so long for the Government to be concerned about the Kurds.  It is ironic that President De Klerk is downstairs right below us now or, if he is not, he is on his way.  We as a nation were one of the leaders of the crusade to introduce sanctions against President De Klerk while at the same time we were trading happily with Saddam Hussein.  At the very same time that Ireland was trading with Saddam Hussein, Saddam Hussein was involved in a genocidal war against the Kurds.  It is a terrible indictment of our foreign policy that we can take a moral attitude against President De Klerk and be so much in favour of pursuing sanctions against him while encouraging prominent businessmen in this country to trade with Saddam Hussein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today we are taking a high moral attitude about the plight of the Kurds.  The plight of the Kurds was similar, if not identical, several years ago when the Government was giving export credit relief to the country that was persecuting them.  That is unforgivable, it is rank hypocrisy and is the sort of hypocrisy that our foreign policy is, unfortunately, riddled with.  Our foreign policy is dictated by trade and not by morality or ethics.  I find it difficult to accept a statement from the Government today, written from a position of deep concern and morality, when that concern is so new. When Amnesty International had it in black and white what was happening to <Col N="1152" /> the Kurds many years ago, we were totally unconcerned.  Indeed, we were frightened of raising our voices about their plight.</P>
    <P>I share the Government's fresh, renewed concern about the Kurds but it is only right that it should be pointed out that it is very new.  It is appropriate that the sanctions issue is being discussed by President De Klerk today when we are now belatedly introducing sanctions against Saddam Hussein.  We refused and had no interest in pursuing sanctions against him when he was involved in a genocidal warfare against these people many years ago.  That has to be acknowledged and pointed out again and again, not because it is a particularly good debating point, but because it should never be allowed to happen again in this country.  Having pointed that out, I welcome this concern as evidenced in the Minister's speech about the plight of the Kurds today and I welcome everything the Government are doing to help those unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>I do not agree specifically with many of the things the Minister had to say.  I am not even sure we should accept any longer the principle which he enunciated here that non-interference in the international affairs of another country is justifiable.  I know that is a cardinal rule and principle of international law and of the way many countries conduct their foreign affairs.  The Minister went on to say that &ldquo;the dismemberment of Iraq would not serve the interest of anybody&rdquo;.  I believe we have to question that assertion.  We have to ask ourselves whether the new order of things &mdash; and there is a new world order &mdash; should be pursued a bit further than mere sanctions against Iraq, because by taking sanctions against Iran we are saying that this is a regime which is unfit to govern any territory or any people.</P>
    <P>I am no longer certain that it would not be justifiable, by limited force, to establish havens or homes for people like the Kurds who are otherwise going to be <Col N="1153" /> massacred by a wicked regime.  Is that principle to remain so inviolate that we as a people and other peoples are to say human rights must be subordinated to territorial integrity?  I am not so sure the Minister is right any longer to subscribe to that particular principle.  We will have to look again, not just as a small nation but as a member of the United Nations and the Europe Communities at that principle.  If we are prepared to take sanctions against countries &mdash; and in both the South African and the Iraqi case it was justified at the initial stages &mdash; we will have to examine the principle of whether we should take more specific and more forceful measures to defend the lives of people in other countries where they are being massacred.  That principle of international law is one that has to be questioned.</P>
    <P>It begs the question, which of course this particular crisis begs, of whether it was right to stop the Gulf War so soon. At the time, of course, huge pressures were brought to bear not only on the President of the United States but on the commanders of the Allied Forces and on the United Nations to stop what was an appalling apparent massacre of Iraqi soldiers.  That is something which everybody in the House regrets happened, because we should prevent the loss of any human life.  However, it might have been better to have gone further.  It might have been better to have ensured that the Iraqi regime and Saddam Hussein were removed from office, it might have been fulfilling a greater obligation to the international community to do that.</P>
    <P>I know that infringes basic principles which nations find it convenient to adhere to &mdash; minimum force and territorial integrity &mdash; but it might have been preferable had the regime in Baghdad been toppled because the appalling massacre and genocide of the Kurds which is going on now would probably have been prevented. That is not necessarily something that could have been foreseen, but when the international community is united against <Col N="1154" /> an evil, as it was in that particular case, it might have been preferable to have gone the whole hog and to have taken the regime out and to have disarmed that dictator.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the result of the Gulf War, while it achieved limited objectives, left some unfinished business which has resulted unfortunately in a small distinct people being massacred.  I do not blame the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Irish Government for that because it is in a wider context and it is a wider question, but I think in retrospect we might have been right to say go on to Baghdad and disarm Iraq completely, because those who are in charge in Iraq are uncivilised and barbaric and will have to be removed from office.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech is encouraging in that it gives us some sense of an international community of responsibility.  It is also encouraging that the Minister is obviously prepared to make substantial contributions in terms of the size of this country in the international context to the international crusade and efforts to relieve the Kurds.  The basic lesson in this tragedy is that we should re-examine the basic principles not just of Irish foreign policy but of international foreign policy, that we should re-examine the basic principle of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think it is necessary or useful to reopen the whole question of the Gulf War, but there is one thing that needs to be taken on board, that is, anybody who looks at the map of that region will notice a very suspicious perpendicularity about the borders.  The borders in that area were not created in the interests of the people living in that area, and that is why I share Senator Ross's disquiet when the Minister says that maintaining the territorial integrity of Iraq is the foreign policy objective of this country and that &ldquo;the dismemberment of Iraq would not serve the interest of anybody&rdquo;.  Of course it would; it would serve the interests of the Kurds but nobody is interested in that, nobody opened their mouths when Halabja was gas bombed, none of the people who are now squawking about human rights were the slightest bit interested.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the attitude of the occupying American forces.  I saw on television an American soldier talking about the way in which they were getting the Kurds to come down from the hills, they were putting bait out as they would for animals to draw people down from the hills.  He spoke contemptuously of these people.  There is not a recognition of the rights of Kurds and there are, of course, Kurds not only in Iraq but in Iran, Turkey and so on, and if any group has a right to autonomy, surely it should be the Kurds who have one ethnic social, religious and linguistic system in common, but by virtue of this perpendicularity, as I have described it, they are excluded from consideration by nations.  If anything showed how useless and ineffective the United Nations is, it is the recent operation where it will only intervene to safeguard the territorial rights of states, the relationship between states.  There must come a time when the fundamental human rights of those people inside the states are guaranteed by the United Nations.  It is a lamentable situation that this does not exist at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" /> Let us look at the attitude of the European Community towards the Kurdish people.  Every major organisation, including the European Community, has delayed, there have been bureaucratic delays, there have been suggestions that distribution of European Community food to the Kurds should be delayed because certain bureaucratic requirements have not been met.  I would like to put on the record a quotation from our parallel experience of Famine when Sir Randolf Routh, chairman of the Famine Relief Commission, wrote to Charles Edward Trevelyan the permanent head of the Treasury in Great Britain on 4 August 1846, when he said:</P>
    <P>You cannot answer the cry of want with a quotation from a political economy.</P>
    <P>That ought to be borne in mind in the councils of Ireland.  You cannot answer the cry of want with a quotation from political economy.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Irish people reacted immediately, but the Irish Government did not react immediately; they reacted in a tardy fashion.  It was groups like Trócaire and the Red Cross who got involved immediately and I believe, put pressure on the Irish Government.  I am very glad the fourth plane load of supplies left yesterday for Iran and I think it is good that the Red Cross are sending supplies to Iran.</P>
    <P>I have deep disagreements with the Iranian regime and I am sorry the Minister, Deputy Collins, is not here while I am speaking because I would like to suggest to him that while he is having his cosy discussion with Mr. Velayati he ought to raise a few of the points that are also raised in Amnesty International's report and what is going on now in Iran.  I would like to place on the record that if Mr. Collins's agony about what happened in Iraq is genuine, let him now start agonising about what is happening in Iran.  I say that as a deliberate and intended <Col N="1157" /> attack upon the Iranian regime but not upon the Iranian people.</P>
    <P>I salute the Iranian people for the way in which they have welcomed the Kurds. They have taken in over one million Kurds and the ordinary people of Iran deserve to be saluted for their humanity in treating these people.  It is a regime for which I have nothing but contempt, but I am glad the Irish Red Cross are sending equipment and supplies to the people who are suffering.  It is a cry of want and I am glad there have been faxes sent back from Iran to indicate that these supplies are satisfactory, appropriate, that the balance is correct between medical supplies and blankets and so on, so that what is happening is the best possible and most practical thing we could do for the unfortunate people who are the victims of this situation.</P>
    <P>I also think it is worth placing on record our appreciation of the professionalism of these voluntary organisations.  The relief channelled through organisations like the Red Cross is going directly to the areas where it is needed within 24 hours.  It is worth saying in Seanad Éireann that anybody who contributes to an organisation like the Red Cross can be certain that it is their contribution will be on its way within 24 hours, because they have pioneered a system where volunteers travel with the convoy of materials to the destination of this aid.</P>
    <P>I would like to take up a phrase that has been thrown around here, &ldquo;the new order&rdquo;.  What an unfortunate phrase, even for an accident-prone person like the President of the United States to use. I am not old enough to have active memories of the last new order but I know historically what it was all about.  It was in Europe in the forties and it was a Mr. A. Hitler who was involved in the &ldquo;new order&rdquo; at that stage.  Perhaps President Bush was not quite aware of the sinister resonances of this.  What a cheek for the Minister, Deputy Collins or Mr. Bush to suggest that there should be a war crimes tribunal for Saddam Hussein, the man <Col N="1158" /> they were supplying with arms, food, sustenance, and with every possible thing they could sell him.  May I ask a parallel question?  The Minister's conscience has become so delicate, his friend, Mr. Bush's conscience has become so delicate, but have they heard of a gentleman called Pol Pot who murdered two million people?  They are still trading with Pol Pot.  If we are going to have a war crimes tribunal for Saddam Hussein, our erstwhile friend, when are we going to add Pol Pot to the list?  That will convince me that the Minister and Mr. Bush have the delicate consciences they speak of so movingly.</P>

      <P>The Kurdish problem is not new.  The plight of the Kurds existed long before the Gulf War.  Saddam Hussein did not suddenly come out of the blue and begin to persecute the Kurdish people.  Genocide had been practiced on the Kurdish people far in advance of the Gulf War and we have had numerous investigations by and detailed submissions to Amnesty International, to the EC and the United Nations.  All of a sudden we seem to recognise that Saddam Hussein was guilty of genocide.  Certainly our hands were not clean in the past.</P>

      <P>We gave credit refunds to that administration under that same dictator.  Goodman International, and the Irish people to an extent, have lost well in excess of £100 million as a result of that hypocrisy.  We did not recognise the need to defend human rights when violations were put before us.  That was long before the Gulf War.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq prior to the Gulf War.  At that time the United Nations stated that the Security Council allowed &ldquo;all necessary means&rdquo; to be taken to ensure that Kuwait would be liberated.  &ldquo;All necessary means&rdquo; was interpreted as allowing the infringement of the territorial integrity of Iraq.  Yet our Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed deep concern in his statement about the possibility of any infringement on the territorial integrity of Iraq at present.  Certainly the United Nations have no problem there.  The territorial integrity of states, and non-interference in their internal affairs, is a very important principle of international law.  Suddenly we find that the United Nations has cold feet about giving permission to the United States, a coalition led force, or anybody else, to infringe the territorial integrity of Iraq and allow safe havens for the Kurdish people to be created. That initiative could not be taken by the United Nations or the Community at large but it came very belatedly from our neighbour across the water.  Now perhaps the United Nations will take on board that initiative and take on the job of ensuring that those safe havens are properly guaranteed.  It is a terrible disappointment that the body entrusted with the care of the international community has, on the one hand, been prepared to give total discretion to the United Statesled forces to invade, not just Kuwait but Iraq, and that it is finding itself so reluctant to take the necessary measures to <Col N="1160" /> ensure that two million people are protected from genocide.  The hypocrisy we find on the international scene is amazing.  What happened was that America was concerned with its oil interests in the Middle East, with its oil interests in Kuwait, and, naturally, took measures to liberate Kuwait.  What happened subsequently?</P>
    <P>Subsequently there has been none of that urgency to ensure that the people against whom all this harassment and genocide &mdash; and that is what it has to be called &mdash; is being perpetrated have been protected.  The urgency has gone out of it, and the reason for that &mdash; and it is expressed in the Minister's statement here &mdash; is that it is in nobody's interest to have the dismemberment of Iraq.  By that is meant that what the international community wants &mdash; and the international community our Minister is speaking about is the international community that is US-led &mdash; is the Kurdish people and the Shi'ite Moslems causing unnecessary problems which would destabilise the regime and the last thing they want is a destabilised Iraq.  While an invitation was given to rise, the means to allow the people to rise and to take steps against Saddam Hussein were not given to the people.  That is why the helicopter gunships were allowed and that is why the people who would have been in a position to destabilise the regime were not given assistance.  I think that is the height of international hypocrisy.  It is money matters; it is oil matters; it is not concern with people or community protection.</P>
    <P>I must say that the Iranian people have been magnificent in the manner in which they have provided sustenance to the Shi'ite Moslems when they were being persecuted after the war and that like wise Turkey and the Turkish people have been tremendous in the manner in which they have given aid to hundreds of thousands of refugees.  That is a particularly difficult problem for them, considering this is something that has not just happened overnight.  They have been receiving <Col N="1161" /> Iraqi refugees in the years prior to this, due to previous persecution as well.</P>
    <P>What about Ireland?  What contribution has Ireland made?  I am not at all happy with what the Minister has said in terms of our contribution.  Certainly 150 million ECUs are being given by the European Community; but we find that, out of our £1 million being given, £700,000 of it is part of the Community budget, so this is not a separate allocation.  We are talking about £300,000 and last week that had risen to £550,000, which is literally just over £500,000, whereas the broader community in this country have given in excess of £2.5 million already, which is roughly five times what the Government are prepared to give.  That is a sad reflection on our Government if that is the extent of the contribution they can make towards solving this horrific crisis.</P>
    <P>We must remember that it is only 150 years ago that our people experienced a very similar mass exodus from this country, when approximately two million people emigrated or died.  That is almost the same as the number of Kurdish refugees there at present.  At that time we were looking for funding, resources, food.  Our Government should be very sensitive to our history in that respect and make sure that the least they can do is to match the voluntary contributions being made.  I would be expecting from the Government at least £3 million at this stage, not £500,000, not this cover up that it is giving £1 million, but nearly three-quarters of which is being given through the Community budget and is therefore coming from a different source.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister for Finance to consider whether tax incentives could be given, that there could be tax relief given on voluntary contributions by our people.  Where voluntary contributions are being made to this catastrophe, and then in the broad sphere to Third World needs, they should be tax free.  People are very generous.  We were discussing last night the question of the <Col N="1162" /> development of Dublin in the context of it being designated the European cultural capital and it was mentioned that 100 per cent tax incentive were being given in Temple Bar.  I cannot see why we cannot respond in a similar fashion when we are talking about giving tax relief to people concerned about providing succour and assistance to those who are in great need and who are in danger of losing their lives through hunger.</P>
    <P>All the resources possible should be made available.  The Government should ensure that supplies are delivered.  We have heard how Guinness Peat aviation has made itself available.  We have heard how the Irish Red Cross has made itself available.  But we should assume that Aer Lingus put their facilities at the disposal of voluntary organisations for the transport of food and clothing collected by those voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>The Government are today inviting here the leader of the Government in South Africa, a country against whom we have had sanctions because of their infringement of human rights over the decades.  We are now receiving that President, and by implication that country, into the community of nations by giving that country our <i>imprimatur</i>, by issuing an invitation to the President of that country to come here.  On the one hand, we are still taking the high ground against Saddam Hussein and are suddenly recognising that Saddam Hussein is the great monster.  We have only recognised that since the Gulf War.  On the other hand, although the security laws in South Africa have not been abolished, though there is no secret ballot, though there is no one person, one vote, we are at the same time bringing that country into the community of nations.  Why are we doing it?  The same principle seems&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am rather saddened that Senator Costello should attempt to introduce partisan politics into what is essentially an appalling human disaster. I have, reluctantly, to be drawn briefly into the political debate that he has obviously initiated for his own reasons and his party's reasons.  It is disgraceful that he should compare the reforms which are currently undergoing debate and completion in South Africa with Saddam Hussein in Iraq and to suggest, as he has done, that it has only been since the Gulf War that people have been aware of Saddam Hussein's shortcomings.  I find that to be an incredible statement.  Perhaps it gives some indication of the paucity of the argument that Senator Costello has been putting forward if he suggests for a moment that the people of this country or the people in this House have not been aware of the dictator Saddam Hussein and of the outrageous genocide that he has inflicted on the people of Kurdistan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>To suggest for a moment that it is a recent conversion and that people in this country were not aware is an outrageous statement to make. Obviously, Senator Costello wants to have a political argument and I am not going to be led down that road.  I came into this House to add my voice to the <Col N="1164" /> saner voices on all sides of the House that have complimented the humanitarian efforts that have been carried out by the Government and the voluntary agencies. It is to the everlasting credit of the Irish people that they have risen magnificently to the calls from the various relief agencies over the last couple of weeks to attempt in some small way to minimise the human conflict that has developed out there and the appalling results of that conflict that one has witnessed on the television screens over the last few weeks.</P>
      <P>I want firstly to address myself to that aspect of it.  As someone pointed out in one of the newspapers in the last couple of days, the response of the Irish people has evoked a folk memory of the Famine times.  I could not help but think of how history has a strange way of repeating itself, sometimes in reverse.  I remember growing up reading about the Famine times.  One of the countries that stood out as having helped Ireland in her moment of need, way back in that black winter of 1847, was Turkey by providing ships with grain and maize for the Irish peasant population of the time.  Although it has taken 150 years to repay that generosity the efforts of the humanitarian agencies in this country along the Turkish/Iraq border and the aid being given to the Turkish Government is 150 years later, a small gesture of thanks to the Turkish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I would like to address now is Ireland's role in the general political debate which arises as a result of the initiative to create an enclave of protection within Iraq policed by the British and American Governments through their armies.  I have to put on record that I have been somewhat concerned over the last few months &mdash; and this concern has been heightened by the Gulf War and its aftermath &mdash; at what I see as a certain lack of enthusiasm on the part of the Irish Government to initiate its own attitudes and policies.  Time and again I have read of statements being made through the <Col N="1165" /> Department of Foreign Affairs that Ireland is working in co-operation with its European neighbours on political co-operation, that we are acting with one voice and we will fall in with the European view of what is happening in the Gulf and the political settlements that must flow from the conflict in that region.</P>
    <P>I say &ldquo;concern&rdquo;.  I do not wish it to be interpreted as a criticism, because foreign policy is something that is a continuity, if you wish.  Ireland has a traditional neutral role.  The ongoing debates in Europe on economic and political co-operation are relatively new to us as a separate nation. We are having to come to terms with a diminution of our sovereignty in a variety of areas as a result of our accession to the EC and, more recently, the acceptance of the Single European Act.  It is an area fraught with danger and complexities.</P>
    <P>Sometimes, as an Irishman, I feel that on some issues Ireland should take a unilateral stand.  I hasten to defend that proposal, before I am attacked for being anti-European or for not wishing to fall within the folds of European political co-operation, by stating that several of the major countries in Europe such as France and Britain have acted in their own interests whenever certain issues have come before them.  Indeed, up to the very day prior to the start of the Gulf War the French had unilaterally opened negotiations between Baghdad and Paris.  The British have also acted in a unilateral fashion, particularly to strengthen their close relationship in the NATO alliance between America and Britain rather than looking eastwards to their European partners.  It would not be a matter of grave concern if Ireland were to not only identify its own national interests but were to propound those interests.</P>
    <P>I will be more specific.  As a result of the relationship which has built up between this country and certain Middle East countries, such as Iraq, Iran particularly and Saudi Arabia to a lesser extent, Ireland has a good name in the Middle East.  It has a respected name.  It has <Col N="1166" /> credibility.  It is not seen to be a post-colonial power.  It is seen from its history to have had the same struggles as many of the Middle Eastern countries who emerged as a result of lines being drawn on maps at the same time as a line was being drawn on the map of this country in the early part of the century.  The excellent work of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, acting in concert with the Government as a whole, has reaped enormous benefits for us as a nation among Middle Eastern countries.  This could not have been more manifestly felt than the visit in the last few days of the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Velayati.  Therefore, I would like to suggest, in the most modest and humble way I can as a Member of this House, that we should attempt to build on those contacts and on that credibility by initiating rather than following policy that will help at least to lead to a stabilisation of the situation in the Middle East.  For example, Iran has been treated in the most hostile fashion by Western Governments as a result of the Khomeni revolution and the post-Shah situation in that country. Ireland throughout the eighties maintained a chargés d'affaires in Teheran.  For some time it withdrew, in concert with its European partners.  I believe we have far greater clout in Tehran as a Western nation than many of our larger neighbours.  I would have thought that Ireland, acting through the United Nations and through the Committee for Political Co-operation in Europe, would have taken the initiative in attempting to strongly influence a change in policy towards Iran among the larger more powerful nations.</P>
    <P>There seemed, for example, to have been great enthusiasm for providing humanitarian aid, military deployment and all of the paraphernalia of modern technology to Turkey to aid the Kurdish refugees on the Turkish side of the Iraq border.  However, there are, I understand, over one million Kurdish refugees in Iran; yet there did not seem &mdash; I repeat &ldquo;seem&rdquo;&mdash; to be the same enthusiasm for <Col N="1167" /> helping the Iranian Government because they were not seen to be part of the cosy Western club.</P>
    <P>That is one area.  I believe that the creation of the protective enclave in north-eastern Iraq is the beginning of an autonomous Kurdistan.  I welcome that development.  I unequivocally and unambiguously welcome the establishment of an autonomous Kurdistan state.  I do so as an Irishman, and aware of our history in this regard.  I do not believe that it is a position anybody from this country should feel embarrassed about.  In fact, we should positively welcome it.  The Kurds are, like the Irish, a separate cultural national entity.  It is unfortunate &mdash; because they have become the flotsam of history &mdash; that they are spread over three of four countries rather than being a homogenous grouping within one country. Obviously, big power politics do not wish to see a destabilisation not only within Iraq but also in the Soviet Union, Syria and in Iran where there are large elements of Kurds.</P>
    <P>If one is to believe the recent developments, the meeting of Kurdish leaders in Baghdad in the last couple of days would seem to indicate that the despicable Hussein regime is beginning at last to come to terms with the reality of their situation. I hope Ireland will have a major role to play in developing this line of political action within the European Community and, more importantly, within the United Nations.  Time and time again we have been reminded that Ireland has a proud role within the United Nations. However, I repeat the little concern I have that sometimes it is perceived that Ireland does not take a more unilateral view of things where the big powers are involved.</P>
    <P>It would be in our long term interests if we were to develop our own foreign policy attitude to countries outside the EC without in any way disrupting the <Col N="1168" /> process towards full economic and political union.  After all, every other country in Europe and every other country in the western world, starting with the United States have always looked after their own interests first when the chips were down.  Let nobody be under any illusions that the decision to send in troops to oust Iraq from Kuwait has as much to do with protecting regional interests and the balance of power in the Middle East as it had to do with humanitarian motives.</P>
    <P>I am glad that this debate has taken place.  It is important for us as a nation that we are seen to be identifiably separate, that our foreign policy is not hitched to the wagon of some other entity. Debates such as this should be more frequent in this House because we need more open and regular debate on Ireland's role in international affairs. Towards that end I welcome the speculation rife in the media over the last few weeks that we will soon see the creation of a foreign affairs committee.  I am glad to have had the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I hope that the appalling plight of the Kurdish people will soon be ended.</P>

      <P>It is ironic that earlier today we talked about our suffering and misery as a result of the crippling effects of the ESB strike.  The Kurds would surely see the situation we are exposed to as heavenly when their tremendous suffering is compared with ours.  We listened this morning to the harrowing and horrific accounts of returned journalists.  One particular journalist said he despaired.  He could not adopt his usual professional journalistic stance of not being involved but felt he had to cry out in support of those people.  He conjured up pictures of dying children &mdash; not dying of famine but dying of the cold, which is something that we cannot accept &mdash; of mass inside graves which he believed will be washed away by rains and probably will never be there as even a little sign of <Col N="1169" /> what has happened in that country; of distraught people pushing pathetic little pieces of paper towards the journalists saying, could they please inform their relatives in Australia, Germany, the United States, that they once existed.  It is very sad.  Fathers grovelling on the ground, as we have seen in newspaper photographs, preparing little graves for their beloved children.  It is interesting that we are supposed to see the world as a global village.  I would say that there has been little or no knowledge of the Kurdish people within our Irish consciousness until, like the Ethiopian tragedy and the tragedy of the Sudan, we were forced to look at our television screens and see the devastation throughout our global village.</P>
      <P>I suppose over 20 million people identify themselves as Kurds.  It is mind-boggling relative to our population of 3.4 million.  They speak the Kurdish language.  Their homeland is the mountains where three country boundaries meet, those of Turkey, Iraq and Iran.  They have been persecuted since the 1920s. Thousands of them have fled from their homes in Turkey, Iran and Iraq to other countries in the Middle East and in Europe.  It is interesting that quite a big percentage of the migrant population working in Germany are Kurds, so they are contributing to the wealth of Europe and they are a forgotten statistic.  I am just looking at their population numbers. There are ten million to 12 million in Turkey; four million in Iran; three million in Iraq; 700,000 in Syria and 100,000 in the Soviet Union.  Since the Gulf War you have had a mass exodus of 400,000 refugees arriving in Turkey and 700,000 arriving in Iran.  Of course, we know the Syrian border is closed to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When they reached the Turkish area they were forced to make journeys crammed like sheep in coal lorries.  Perhaps this animal-like treatment is a ploy to make them return to their own country, but it is again ironic to look at what is happening in Europe.  The European <Col N="1170" /> Parliament at the moment is passing legislation about the transportation of animals which would not permit animals the kind of conditions that these Kurds have been made to face.  Our individual response, and the Government's response has been mentioned by many Senators here.  There is no doubt about it that we automatically and instinctively respond to famine.  It is etched in the folk memory of the Irish people.  Once the trigger was pulled you had supermarkets being allocated to collectors.  You had children, old people, young people, male and female, thronging to give their money.  There was no question this time of putting the box towards them; they thronged to support.  I was glad that the Minister referred today to moneys that have come from the Government; and, of course, we would wish that more could be given.  It is interesting to listen to Fr. Finnucane's response to famine.  Fr. Finnucane, with his experience of work in the Sudan and in Ethiopia, found that this was the most atrocious situation he had ever been exposed to.  I suppose with that coming from a man who has been so involved, we cannot but be alerted to the tremendous problems facing them.</P>
    <P>There is the sadness, I suppose, that the problems of Ethiopia and the Sudan will pale into insignificance; and, despite our humanitarian approach and our sympathy, this appears to be the situation throughout the world.  During the Gulf War Ethiopia and Sudan went off the political stage.  I would hope that the plight of the Kurds will not pale into insignificance as some other major catastrophe takes precedence on the world stage.</P>
    <P>Because of the shortness of time I end with some questions.  This is for the future when perhaps the immediate problems of the Kurds have been addressed through the relief organisations like the Red Cross, as a result of the response of the United Nations, Europe, the United States and countries such as ours.  I would <Col N="1171" /> pose these questions; are the Kurds condemned to be the new Palestinians?  Are they just an orphan nation uprooted from their homelands?  They are scattered in exile, dumped in camps, left to rot while the world loses interest.  Hopefully, this will not be the future of the 500,000 refugees from Saddam's gunships who were left to freeze on the hillsides and mountains in unspeakable conditions.</P>
    <P>I suppose we respond because, like our history, Kurdish history is one of betrayal and of suffering; it is one of rebellion and of repression.  This latest mass exodus is the final stage of a tragedy that began &mdash; and we would want to remember this &mdash; after the first world war when the western powers refused to honour promises to create a unified independent Kurdistan. It has continued with sporadic revolts and guerilla campaigns by Kurds in both Iran, Turkey and Iraq until Saddam Hussein's use of poison gas at Halabja in 1988 raised the spectrum of genocide.  All of this was going on and we were unaware of it, except for some people who have an interest in problems of the Third World and minority groups &mdash; Amnesty etc.</P>
    <P>I would pose the final question: will tossing powdered milk and blankets out of helicopters, do anything except salvage our conscience and ease President Bush's embarrassment?  I hope this will not go off the political stage of our so-called global village and that much more will be done to ensure that the Kurds do not become the forgotten people, the people that nobody wants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the <Col N="1172" /> Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, for coming into the House and taking this motion.  I will be brief because this was raised in the Seanad on 7 June last year when the Minister of State, Deputy F. Fahey took the debate. At present there are two schools in Rathkeale, the vocational school and the secondary school run by the Sisters of Mercy.  As far back as 1967 the Department announced major plans for school development in Rathkeale.  In 1973 the staff of both schools were informed by the then Minister that there was a need and a decision made to rationalise the educational facilities in Rathkeale.  On 29 May 1983 the then Minister authorised the provision of a new community school to incorporate the secondary and vocational schools.  In December 1983 a joint committee consisting of management of both schools, and the teaching staff of both schools, was formed to expedite the programme for the new school, ensure that a good structure was provided for the new facilities and ensure that they were up to the standard of modern educational needs.</P>
      <P>In 1985 a site was identified adjacent to the vocational school and in 1986 a schedule of accommodation was agreed. The draft plan was finished in 1988 and in June of 1988 Rathkeale Community Council met the Minister for Education and was informed by her that the school was in the top five priority for construction.</P>
      <P>In 1989 the draft plan was sent back requesting comprehensive changes which were completed in January 1990.  On 7 June 1990 I raised the issue on the Adjournment and the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy F. Fahey, informed me that planning had reached stage two but was being reviewed in the context of demographic trends.  On that occasion the Minister stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this review is completed and the pupil numbers to be catered for in the long term are established it will be <Col N="1173" /> necessary to prepare a new schedule of accommodation.  This in turn will necessitate some alterations to the plan and design of the project by the design team.  It will be appreciated therefore that any changes required will arise from a careful reassessment of the future requirements and I am satisfied that the new school when completed will meet the needs of the community for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>A full range of facilities will be available for the courses to be conducted and for the number of pupils who will enrol there.  Every effort will be made to have the review of requirements completed as soon as possible so that planning can proceed without undue delay.</P>
    <P>In December 1990 the plans were changed to that of a community college and the Minister sanctioned the construction of a community college under the VEC in Rathkeale.  The VEC, the Sisters of Mercy and the Department agreed that a community college was now the right approach for Rathkeale.</P>
    <P>Ten months later I am asking and imploring the Minister to provide proper teaching facilities for Rathkeale immediately.  It is not right to have children, and teachers, in 25 year-old prefabricated buildings; some of them are even 30 years old.  They are now in very poor condition and it is costing money to keep them in reasonable repair.  I do not think it is right that in 1991 pupils must cross yards and roadways in all types of weather to go between classes.  Rathkeale deserves proper educational facilities and I ask the Minister to provide them.</P>
    <P>A report of a recent meeting of the vocational educational committee in the <i>Limerick Leader</i> last week stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Rathkeale Lines up for Community College.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Work can now begin on a community college for Rathkeale.  The Minister for Education has approved the development, the county VEC board heard at <Col N="1174" /> their recent meeting this week.  The college will be given top priority and the VEC vowed to move quickly to make the new ventue a reality.  Agreement had already been reached locally for a merger of the two secondary schools in the town, St. Anne's and the Rathkeale Vocational School.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister if she will put dates on when &ldquo;work can now begin on the community college&rdquo; as reported at the last VEC meeting.  The people of Rathkeale are under the impression, and I hope the Minister will confirm it, that work can commence in 1991 and that this school will be available early in 1992.  I want to sincerely thank the Minister for her attendance and I look forward to her reply.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Neville for coming to the House and raising this matter.  Of course I wish to reply to it but he very skilfully glossed over what was the most important factor in the whole debate, that the scenario has changed dramatically.  We were committed, as the Senator knows, to a community school and that was the procedure.  A proposal came to us in late autumn last year so that it should become a community college.  I wish to pay tribute to the Sisters for their long-standing commitment to education in this area and I understand the reason for their decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new proposal has been submitted to my Department by the two school managements to the effect that the two post primary schools in Rathkeale be replaced by a community college and not by a community school.  A community college is under the aegis of a VEC.  What the VEC state at their meeting, as reported in the local paper, is a matter for them; I do not answer for them.  I have recently conveyed my approval for the proposed change in management which is a major change.  For a community school we are the clients, the people who proceed with the planning <Col N="1175" /> and authorise the school.  It now becomes the duty of the VEC to so do.</P>
    <P>Arising from this development County Limerick VEC will now be the client for the design.  It is a major change and one I hope the Senator will understand. Therefore, the design team responsible for planning will now be reporting directly to the VEC and not to the Department of Education.  The way is now clear for the planning of this project, and I stress, the planning of the project, to commence.  I am not putting any dates on this because the planning is only now beginning.  Planning has shifted in a major way in two respects, one, in the numbers &mdash; we agreed to reduce those earlier this year from 500 to 400 &mdash; and with regard to the people who will be responsible.  My Department have told the VEC to make the necessary arrangements in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have absolutely no control over what is reported in local papers about how the VEC do their business.  We have now given instructions to the VEC to commence the planning process.  The Senator <Col N="1176" /> will be aware that a second level school is a major project.  There are professional steps to be taken which must be carried out correctly and rigorously in order that the considerable public investment in this school is correctly identified and the planning work is carried out professionally. That is now commencing under the aegis of and through the authority and offices of the County Limerick VEC.  We have told them to proceed accordingly.  We await developments from them.</P>

      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.15 p.m. until 12 noon on Wednesday, 1 May 1991.</P>
