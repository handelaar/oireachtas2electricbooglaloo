      <P>I have notice from Senator Seán Byrne that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to explain the reason for the delay with regard to an extension to Ardfinnan national school, Clonmel.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to fulfil her commitment to construct a second level school at Rathkeale, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Raftery of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to take steps to remove dead and dangerous trees in public places, particularly these along the roadsides.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Byrne, Neville and Raftery as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Byrne's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Neville and Raftery may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business for today is as follows: Item No. 3, Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time) Employees Bill, 1990.  It will be taken from now until 6 p.m. and from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. we will have a sos.  From 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. we will take Item No. 12, Motion 75, which is a Labour Party motion.  At 8 p.m. we will continue discussion on Item No. 3 and, by agreement with the Whips this Bill will be brought to a conclusion not later than 10 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House, now there is at last some real signs of progress in Northern Ireland, that as a priority for the next session he would give time for a fairly full debate on Northern Ireland?  Secondly, will he indicate to the House what the programme of legislation is expected to be at the beginning of the next session?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House the position on the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.  I understand it is now being put back until after Easter, but I would like to have on record when you expect it to be taken and when we can expect to have a copy of the Government amendments to the Bill?  I am saying for the third time I think it is important that we have sight of these amendments in time to make a reasonable and reasoned contribution &mdash; it would always be reasonable &mdash; to the Government amendments.</P>
      <P>The other issue on which the Leader gave an undertaking on at least three occasions was to have during the course of this session a debate on the prison service.  This has been asked for on a number of occasions by Members on the Labour and on the Independent benches. The Leader gave an absolute commitment here that it would take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the other commitment, which was given earlier in the year, was that there would in each session be a debate on aspects of education.  I am not carping about it.  It has been a busy session and if there is not time, there is not time. <Col N="283" /> However, I would like to have a real commitment to have a discussion on a particular date.  We are entitled to that.</P>

      <P>I echo the sentiments expressed by Senator O'Toole in relation to the Leader's commitment that we would have a debate on the prison service. May I again remind the Leader of the commitment and ask when is it likely the debate will take place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to support Senator Manning and ask the Leader of the House to arrange at his convenience a debate on the evolving situation in the North.  May I also ask the Leader if he would consider it important and prudent to make a statement welcoming the removal of the 48-hour restrictions because at present there is widespread acceptance that that was a necessary step and it is no longer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say it is no longer detrimental to the traders in the South, thanks to the measures that were introduced in the first place.  Perhaps the Leader would make a statement and that would satisfy me.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House two questions.  First, is it intended to meet on Friday of this week and, if so, will there be any arrangements made to honour the visit of the Dalai Lama to this country who, I think, should be welcomed to this House?</P>

May I ask the Leader of the House, at a time when tourism, industry and all aspects of life and services are being crippled in County Cavan by the potholed conditions of the roads, to request from the Minister for the <Col N="285" /> Environment an explanation why the grant has only been increased in real terms by £45,000?</P>

      <P>The questions raised by Senator Manning for a debate on Northern Ireland in the next session is something I will certainly consider.  Senator McGowan has also raised that question and both have been consistent in asking about that.  It is a matter I will examine in greater detail.  The next session will consist of 12 weeks; therefore, we will have plenty of time to deal with many of the issues that have been raised.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning also asked for details of the programme of legislation for the session after Easter.  At this point the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, with 200 plus amendments, will be taken very early in the session.  It pleased me greatly that the Environmental Protection Agency Bill received a very good debate in this House on Second Stage. The amendments are pouring in.  As I say, there are 200 plus, and there will be more.  We will also have the Child Care Bill; it has completed Second Stage and we will go on to Committee and other Stages of that Bill.  We will also have the Finance Bill, which will take a fairly long period of time.  I understand that the Family Planning Bill will be available fairly early after Easter.  The Sea Pollution Bill is at Committee Stage in the Dáil and will obviously be with us in the next session, as will the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill which is at Committee Stage also.  The Criminal Damage Bill is also at Committee Stage.  I believe the Radiological Protection Bill is finishing tomorrow in the Dáil and will be with us after Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Naughten referred to the Bill dealing with local government reform. <Col N="286" /> That will certainly be discussed in the next session.  I am not sure if it will be initiated in this House; it will not be my fault if it is not.  I will endeavour to get it initiated here, if possible.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole asked about details of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill and I have given a fairly comprehensive reply already to Senator Manning on that.  He made the further point that he would like to see the amendments, and that is very reasonable.  I will certainly make the point to the Minister that all Senators would like to have a full list of amendments in good time so that they may study them and be prepared when debating Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole also raised the question of the prison service.  I have spoken both with the Minister, Deputy Burke, and the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, who has recently moved to the Department of Justice and has responsibility for the prison area.  It is one of my regrets I did not have a debate on the prison service.  It was my intention to do so.  Both Ministers are very enthusiastic for a debate on the prison service and I can assure the House we will have such a debate as early as possible after the Easter recess.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole asked about education. I have no hesitation in saying that the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, will welcome a debate on education in the knowledge that she is doing a fine job&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Minister will definitely come to us as quickly as possible after Easter.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan asked about the Northern Ireland situation and I have already outlined my position on that to Senator Manning.  Senator Upton asked about the prison service and I replied in detail to Senator O'Toole on that particular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Norris asked if we would be sitting next Friday.  We will not be sitting on Friday.  We had hoped to sit on Friday, but the Social Welfare Bill will not be <Col N="287" /> concluded in the other House until Friday and, therefore, we will have the Social Welfare Bill in this House next Tuesday.</P>
    <P>The Cathaoirleach has replied to the question on the Fifth Avenue matter. Senator O'Reilly asked me to convey his wishes regarding the road situation in County Cavan to the Minister, which I will indicate to him.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the next session will be a 12 or a 14 week session and I hope in regard to various issues we did not get time to debate in the last session we will make time available to debate them in the session ahead.  I will pursue them and, if at all possible, have debates on them.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is about change.  We are living in a time of a profound rhythm and complexity of change and this is manifest everywhere, not least in the workplace. One of the many features of workplace change has been the alteration in working time and working relationships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been apparent for some time <Col N="288" /> that a growing number of people in the workforce are employed in some alternative to the traditional full-time job. This has called into question the adequacy of current protective legislation, which to a large extent is aimed at meeting the needs of full-time employees.  As the law stands, many part-time workers could have many years service with the same employer and yet have no entitlement to holidays, maternity leave, minimum notice or redundancy payments and have no redress in the event of unfair dismissal.  This Bill is designed to rectify that situation.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that part-time workers who are normally expected to work for at least eight hours a week for an employer and have completed 13 weeks continuous service with the employer, will enjoy the same protection under labour legislation as full-time workers.  By &ldquo;labour legislation&rdquo; I mean the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1990, the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973 and 1984, the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977 and 1988, the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981 and the Protection of Employees (Employers Insolvency) Acts, 1984 and 1990.  What I am doing, therefore, in this short Bill is amending seven separate sets of enactments, some of which date back almost a quarter of a century.</P>
    <P>There are two points which I want to emphasise at the outset.  One is that all workers including part-time workers are already covered by some of the labour legislation in force.  I would like to underline this.  No distinction is drawn between full-time and part-time workers in the laws which deal with such matters as occupational safety and health, employment equality, the protection of young persons, the protection of employment or the payment of wages.  Their exclusion from the Acts which I mention stems from provisions in those Acts which specify weekly hours threshold of 18 hours or, in the case of the Holidays Act, a <Col N="289" /> threshold of 120 hours a month or 1,400 hours a year.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to underscore is that this Bill is about part-time employees as defined in the various Acts being amended.  It is not about contract workers or agency workers.  Nor does it introduce rights or entitlements which are not available to full-time workers.  It is my intention &mdash; and this is a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>&mdash; to examine several issues which have arisen for agency workers, both full-time and part-time and similarly to explore in somewhat greater depth questions posed by the spread of contract work.  This Bill is not the place and this is not the time to tackle these issues and it is as well for me to clarify that at this early stage.</P>
    <P>By way of introduction I would like to focus on five main themes: why the State should consider action in respect of part-time workers; the extent and the nature of the growth of part-time work in Ireland; the characteristics of part-time workers, including the important gender dimension; the present situation of part-time workers under labour legislation and the need to strike a balance between, on the one hand, the real needs of firms which require greater flexibility in the organisation of production and, on the other, workers needs for stability and society's concern that particular categories of workers should not be discriminated against.</P>
    <P>There are four good reasons why the State should consider action in respect of part-time workers.  First, there seems on the face of it to be no good reason to discriminate in the matter of, say, protection from arbitrary dismissal between a person who regularly works full-time and one who regularly works part-time. In other words, the question is not so much &ldquo;why statutory protection of part-time work&rdquo;, as &rdquo;why not&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Second, much part-time work in Ireland is female-dominated and disproportionately concentrated in the services sector, typically occurring at low levels of skill, poor pay and prospects, with a low likelihood of union protection.  It is <Col N="290" /> difficult to imagine a group more likely to be exploited and, for that reason, more deserving of State support in terms of statutory standards.</P>
    <P>Third, with the exception of Britain and Ireland, most member states of the European Community and many western countries have adopted action to promote part-time work and to protect the rights of part-time workers.  Thus, in many European countries basic terms and conditions apply equally to full and part-time workers with both categories enjoying the same rights.</P>
    <P>Finally, experience suggests that companies ought to adopt progressive policies in their own enlightened self-interest. Where they have not, or where they will not, the State will have to do it for them.</P>
    <P>It is my judgment that developments in relation to the recent growth and changing composition of part-time work requires that State action in relation to this category cannot be delayed further.</P>
    <P>The labour force survey of 1975 provides the first set of data on part-time work in Ireland.  Between that year and 1989, the most recent year for which we have data, the number of part-time workers increased from 71,500 to 82,000. Although this represents an increase of 10,500 part-time jobs over 14 years, or 15 per cent over the 1975 level, the proportion of persons working part-time in Ireland has remained relatively unchanged.  In 1975 part-time workers represented about 6.7 per cent of those with an occupation and the share in 1989 was only slightly larger at 7.5 per cent. Moreover, research carried out by Dr. Eileen Drew of TCD demonstrates that it has not been a steady growth but a fluctuating one with part-time workers accounting for 7.3 per cent of persons with an occupation in 1977, 5.1 per cent in 1979, regaining in 1983 the 1975 level of 6.7 per cent and peaking in 1988 at 7.8 per cent before declining slightly in 1989.</P>
    <P>There are, however, a number of important changes over that period.  One of the most important is the distinction made in the labour force between &ldquo;regular&rdquo; and &ldquo;occasional&rdquo; part-time workers.  Regular part-time employment <Col N="291" /> has increased very significantly since 1975 when it stood at 42,500.  In 1989 that figure was 70,000.  The lesson we can draw from this is that part-time work is becoming a more permanent feature of the labour market.</P>
    <P>There are two further points of note concerning the composition of the part-time labour force.  One is the change over time in the sectoral composition.  In 1975 one in three part-time jobs was in agriculture, forestry and fishing.  That figure has now declined to one in seven.  Commerce &mdash; which includes retail distribution, banking and business services &mdash; and professional services increased their share largely at the expense of agriculture.</P>
    <P>It is in the services sector that the most significant change in part-time work has taken place.  In 1975 part-time workers in the service sector made up half of the total part-time labour force.  By 1989 this figure had risen to about three quarters. This increase has been particularly rapid in the 1980s and hence it has been in services that the real growth in part-time employment has occurred which has tended to be camouflaged by the static levels of part-time work in manufacturing industry or the falling levels in agriculture.</P>
    <P>The second point relates to the gender dimension of the part-time labour force. Relative to other EC countries, a higher proportion of men work part-time in Ireland.  While an examination of part-time work between 1975 and 1989 demonstrates that it is a predominantly female option there is still a substantial number of men working part-time, even if for different reasons than women.  Men account for about 30 per cent of all part-time workers and are more likely to work part-time either upon entry to the labour force, possibly to facilitate study or multiple job-holding or at an age close to or following retirement.  In contrast, women account for more than three quarters of all part-time workers in the 25-44 age-bands which are associated with child rearing.  Over 70 per cent of female part-time workers are married; about 60 per <Col N="292" /> cent of the males are single; about one third of the part-time males were under 25, with a further third aged 25-44.  In the case of females, less than one sixth were under 25, more than half were aged 25-44 and about 30 per cent in the 45-64 age group.</P>
    <P>To sum up the scale and trends: part-time work and particularly regular part-time work has increased in the last 15 years; while it is a predominantly female option, there is still a substantial number of men working part-time in Ireland, but for different reasons than women.  The part-time worker is best described as female, aged 25-44 and married with dependent children.  Nearly three quarters of part-time workers are employed in the service sector.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the extent to which Ireland departs from the EC norm in regard to the gender of part-time workers.  That is not the only important difference.  In 1988 the percentage share of part-time employees in relation to all employees in the Community overall was 13.6 per cent.  This ranged from 4 per cent in Greece to 29.4 per cent in The Netherlands.  Other big users of part-time workers were Denmark, 25.5 per cent, and the UK, 22.8 per cent.  Ireland, at 8.2 per cent ranked seventh among the EC member states, at slightly above half the European average.  In other words, we have a very low level of part-time work by international standards.</P>
    <P>A major issue associated with part-time work in many countries is that of the divergent treatment of part-time workers compared to their full-time counterparts. Part-time work is widely condemned as a threat to full-time jobs, a precarious form of employment and a source of unequal treatment of women workers.  It is also defended as a regular well-protected way to reconcile the needs and preferences of workers with the operational requirements of enterprises; to create jobs; and to benefit workers with family responsibilities, workers approaching retirement and other special groups.</P>
    <P>It may thus be argued that both the detractors and proponents of part-time work are often correct, depending on the <Col N="293" /> country and the enterprise concerned. While empirical evidence on the working conditions and work history of part-time workers is thin on the ground, the perception of many is that part-time workers are unfairly treated, that their pay is low, that they lack fringe benefits and provisions and that most of them are working in job ghettos with little chance of training or promotion.  There is certainly some empirical evidence in Ireland that the hourly earnings of part-time workers tend to be below that of their full-time equivalents. Research by the ESRI disclosed that the low paid part-time workers are predominantly women.</P>
    <P>In general, existing data have not been able to answer key questions about the work history of part-time workers.  Limited evidence on these issues is provided by the reasons given for working part-time in answers to the labour force survey.  These show that most women work part-time because of family responsibilities or did not want a full-time job. Only 25 per cent of part-time women workers cited inability to find a full-time job as the main reason they were working part-time.  These figures imply that the negative connotations associated with part-time work are not sufficient to overcome preferences and family responsibilities which at present result in women choosing to work part-time rather than full-time.</P>
    <P>If it is the case, as some researchers have speculated, that part-time workers tend to be limited to moving frequently between low status, low skilled jobs with few fringe benefits, the increased protection of part-time workers under the law and measures to assist them to break into the wider labour market need to be placed high on the agenda.  The major area of concern, as I have already noted from the contributions of Members in earlier debates, relates to part-time employees who are heavily dependent on this form of employment and who are employed permanently or semi-permanently on a part-time basis.  I am concerned that regular part-time workers who are employed on a long term basis are denied entitlements to the most basic protections <Col N="294" /> which are afforded under labour law. This is the inequity I am seeking to redress.</P>
    <P>As I have explained already, some of our labour legislation, for example in the areas of occupational safety and health, employment equality and payment of wages, makes no distinction between full-time and part-time employees.  However, some laws do not apply to workers who do not work at least 18 hours per week. The idea was to exclude persons whose employment was of a subsidiary nature or of inconsiderable extent.  This also was a requirement of social security legislation but is being removed by my colleague the Minister for Social Welfare by regulations which will come into force on 6 April 1991.  The primary protective employment Acts which currently exclude workers who are not employed for a minimum of 18 hours per week are the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, the Redundancy Payments Acts, and to some extent the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Acts.  Based on labour force survey figures, the 18 hours threshold has the effect of excluding approximately 20,000 employees, of whom at least three quarters are women, from the benefit of the legislation which incorporates that threshold.</P>
    <P>The Holiday (Employees) Act, 1973, does not apply an 18 hours eligibility threshold.  Instead, it excludes from annual leave entitlement those who do not work at least 120 hours per month or 1,400 hours in the leave year; and in order for a part-timer to gain entitlement to a public holiday, he must work for at least 120 hours in the preceding five weeks. The higher hours thresholds which apply under the Holidays Act have the effect of excluding approximately 45,000 part-timers, of whom 76 per cent are women, from annual leave entitlement, and an estimated 38,000, 78 per cent women from public holiday entitlement.</P>
    <P>It is clear that part-time work meets real needs of firms and that there are <Col N="295" /> many workers, too, who want to work on a part-time basis.  The FIE have made clear to me why employers want more part-time work.  Their reasons relate to changing market conditions and extended hours of opening particularly in services which cannot be undertaken within the standard working day or week. The major benfit of part-time work in businesses is that it provides flexibility, allowing the employer to respond to increased competition and the changing demands of customers.</P>
    <P>Further information on the reasons which motivate Irish employers to use part-time work emerge from a survey in course of completion in the Dublin-based European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. This survey indicates that in Ireland the introduction of part-time work is more a result of economic considerations &mdash; cost advantages to the employers &mdash; than a response to employees' wishes.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of calling into question the need for part-time work.  The fact is that employment relationships in this country, as elsewhere, are diversifying considerably in response to international competitiveness and to radical changes in the organisation of production, often stimulated by technological change.  These developments, it has to be said, have helped to maintain competitiveness and to maintain and create jobs.</P>
    <P>Very often these changes on the demand side of the labour market are accompanied by supply-side changes in the matter of workers aspirations and individuals' needs.  Part-time work seems to satisfy better the aspirations and individual and family needs of a number of workers.</P>
    <P>Part-time work can offer a valid and useful entry point to the labour market for people who are excluded from it, although, so far in Ireland, there is little evidence to support that.  Part-time work will, for some, be a valid and long term employment form, providing them with the flexibility to fulfil the varied demands which they face.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="296" /> My objective, therefore, in approaching the thresholds which kept some 20,000 workers beyond the pale of labour legislation, was to ensure that safeguards such as exist for their full-time colleagues also exist to protect part-time workers. At the same time I needed to avoid the danger of over-regulation which would jeopardise flexibility, hinder employment growth, and drive some of those jobs into the black economy.</P>
    <P>The result is the simple Bill before you which extends labour legislation to those who normally work eight hours or more a week and have completed 13 weeks with the same employer.  These regular part-time workers will be treated similarly to full-time workers in relation to all the various statutory rights.  They will have to fulfil the same service and other conditions as full-time workers to become eligible for those rights.</P>
    <P>Some have called for the elimination of all thresholds.  In choosing to retain a threshold and to set it at eight hours a week, I was influenced by two considerations. One was the decision of Vasso Papandreou, Social Affairs Commissioner, to provide for an eight-hour threshold in her proposed directives on non-standard forms of employment, including part-time work in order to rule out any disproportionate administrative costs which could run counter to the objectives sought.  Moreover, only in the past few days she has included an eight-hour threshold in her proposals for a directive on a form of proof of an employment relationship.  The other consideration which influenced my selection of an eight-hour threshold was that such a low level limited the possibility of employers deliberately adjusting their working hours to bring them below the new hours threshold.  I will return in a few moments to this issue of preventing the evasion of obligations under the proposed new law.</P>
    <P>Let me explain, now, the terms of the Bill in some detail.  As I have already said, this Bill, although relatively short, attempts the complicated task of amending seven separate sets of Acts.  Because of this, the Bill may seem relatively <Col N="297" /> obscure and inaccessible to the casual reader.  This has been recognised by one eminent lawyer in the Lower House as being unfortunate but necessary in the interests of legal precision.  I would like to assure the Seanad that every attempt has been made to simplify the Bill while still ensuring that it achieves its objectives without having other unintended effects on the body of legislation it seeks to amend.  In passing, I would mention that adequate explanatory literature will be prepared and disseminated when these proposals have been enacted.</P>
    <P>The Bill is structured so as to define &ldquo;regular part-time&rdquo; employees in section 1 and to then apply the various Acts to that group of employees in the subsequent sections.  The complexity which arose when attempting this task, was that the specific provisions which currently exclude regular part-timers from each of the enactments vary.  The particular group of individuals who would be categorised as &ldquo;regular part-time&rdquo; employees under one Act would not be identical to the group currently excluded under another Act.  For example, employees are excluded from the Unfair Dismissals Act by virtue of an 18-hour per week requirement but are excluded from the Holiday Act by a 120 hour per month requirement.  Because of this fact, I set out in section 1 each of the &ldquo;excluding provisions&rdquo; which at present prevent &ldquo;regular part-time&rdquo; employees from coming within the scope of each particular Act or set of Acts which it is intended to amend.</P>
    <P>The concept of an &ldquo;excluding provision&rdquo; is the key to understanding the Bill and to avert any confusion I want to clarify it.  What I mean by an &ldquo;excluding provision&rdquo; in section 1 is the provision or provisions which exclude certain workers at present from the seven sets of acts I am going to amend.  If workers are excluded from those Acts by virtue of those provisions and meet the minimum criteria in this Bill they are regular part-time employees.  &ldquo;Regular part-time&rdquo; employees, the target group of this Bill are, therefore, defined as those who have at least 13 weeks service, are normally <Col N="298" /> expected to work at least eight hours per week and who are not at present covered by the relevant enactment because of an excluding provision.</P>
    <P>As I have already argued I felt that the minimum qualifications of eight hours per week and 13 weeks service were the appropriate thresholds to define the group of regular part-timers who could and should benefit from the protection of labour law.</P>
    <P>In introducing a 13-week threshold in the Bill it was the intention that this would ensure that students and other short term temporary part-time employees would not be covered by the Bill and that the Bill would not create a disincentive to such short periods of employment.  The 13 week period ensures on the one hand an element of commitment or permanence on the part of the regular part-time employee and, on the other hand, that casual or occasional workers will still be largely excluded from the provisions of the protective legislation involved.</P>
    <P>I decided, as set out in section 2 (1), to calculate the 13 weeks in accordance with the First Schedule to the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973.  This is the mechanism used to calculate continuous service the full-time employees and, since its inception in the early 1970s, has proven to be an effective and satisfactory method of determining continuity.  Where any disputes arise in this respect, the employees will be able to put the case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for determination.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed that unscrupulous employers might try to evade resposibilities imposed by this Bill by (a) using fixed term contracts of less than 13 weeks duration followed by a break in employment and then reemployment on the same basis; or (b) reducing employees' working hours below the new threshold of eight per week.</P>
    <P>I have considered this matter is some depth and, although I am satisfied that the number of employers who might try to evade their responsibilities in this way would be very small, I have concluded <Col N="299" /> that it would be best to give the Employment Appeals Tribunal express powers to deal with the perceived problem.  This is done in section 2(2).  I would stress that this anti-evasion provision is not intended to penalise employers who use fixed term contracts or have to reduce an employee's working hours for genuine reasons unconnected with this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2(3) of the Bill specifies that where a service qualification of 13 weeks or longer already applies in an Act which this Bill seeks to extend to regular part-time employees, then the original 13 weeks which is required under this Bill, to qualify as a regular part-time employee, will count towards the longer service period.  An example of this arises under, the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, where an employee must have one year's service to be fully covered by the Act. Under this Bill the regular part-timers first 13 weeks will count towards the one year requirement.  This provision in the Bill is justifiable on equity grounds but, in any event was considered necessary to avoid confusion and to reduce administrative difficulties which might arise if the 13 week qualifying period were not to be incorporated in the longer service requirement.  I think the provision is justified on equity grounds.</P>
    <P>While the first 13 weeks of employment will count towards longer service periods it will not confer any other benefits or rights under the various Acts.  Section 2 (4) of the Bill, for instance, ensures that no entitlement to holidays will be built up in the initial 13 weeks period.  If this were not provided for, a real cost barrier to employment beyond 13 weeks would be created, leading to a reduction in regular part-time employment opportunities. Some employers who would on the beginning of the 14th week of employment become liable for a backdated holiday entitlement might be tempted not to retain people beyond that time and section 2 (4) is intended to prevent this disincentive to regular part-time employment.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill is a key provision. This provides for the application of all <Col N="300" /> the relevant Acts to regular part-time employees, with the exception of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973.  In other words, section 3 of the Bill extends to regular part-time employees the benefits of the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1990, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973 and 1984, the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977 and 1988, the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981 and the Protection of Employees (Employers Insolvency) Acts, 1984 and 1990.  Because of the definition of regular part-time employee which has been used in section 1 of the Act, it is possible for me to extend in this clear and simple provision all of these Acts to the target group on essentially the same basis as they are applied to full-time employees.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 3 are very important as they give regular part-time employees the protection of basic labour laws which have been built up in the State over the last 25 years and which are relied upon by most other workers to regulate and protect their employment.  Regular part-time employees have been very vulnerable to exploitation and when this has arisen they have not been able to call on the basic legal protection that exists for other workers.  For example, a regular part-time employee could be employed for ten or 15 years with the same employer, giving sterling service and could then be let go at the whim of the employer.  Those workers could not in the past rely on the Unfair Dismissals Act to protect them, they could not appeal their dismissal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and they had no entitlement to a redundancy payment after their 15 years service.  It is this type of vulnerability which the provisions of the Bill seek to redress.</P>
    <P>Another area of vulnerability arose in relation to female part-time employees who became pregnant.  Women constitute almost three quarters of the part-time labour force and when these women became pregnant they were not protected from arbitrary dismissal due to their pregnancy as they were not covered by the <Col N="301" /> Unfair Dismissals Act.  Neither were they covered by the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981, and hence they had no entitlement to take maternity leave and have their job protected until their return.  These women either had to give up their job when their baby was born or else hope that the employer would hold the job open for a couple of weeks by which time they might be able to return to work.  This, again, was a highly inequitable situation as the same period of maternity leave is clearly required by all women workers.  The provisions of section 3 of the Bill will now provide that all women regular part-time employees will be entitled to that minimum period of 14 weeks maternity leave enjoyed by other female employees and they will be entitled to have their job held open for that period with full protection from dismissal during the period of maternity leave.  I am sure the extension of these entitlements will be welcomed by the many thousands of women who are working part-time on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill deals with the extension of holiday entitlements to regular part-time employees.  Basically, the Bill provides for the application of the provisions of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, to regular part-time employees in the same way as they are applied to full-time employees, with the broad exception of the way in which annual leave entitlements are calculated.</P>
    <P>Under the 1973 Act, employees who work at least 120 hours per month or 1,400 hours per year are entitled to three weeks annual leave.  There is no obvious equivalent to the 120 hour requirement for regular part-time employees as defined in this Bill.  Therefore, the Bill attempts to provide an alternative mechanism which will give regular part-time employees an approximately equivalent level of entitlement to annual leave as full-time employees.  Section 4 (3) (a) provides that regular part-time employees, as defined in the Bill, will be entitled to annual leave at the rate of six hours for every 100 hours worked.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> Other important provisions of the Holiday (Employees) Act, 1973, such as the public holiday entitlement and the method of determining times and pay for annual leave, are being extended, under section 4 of the Bill, to all regular part-time employees.  I regard this section as one of great importance as, in the past, a regular part-time employee could be working year in, year out, without getting any annual holidays or any time off or compensation for public holidays.  I believe this was an intolerable position and that it was not correct that people who are permanent members of the labour force should be left open to this form of exploitation.  Accordingly, I feel that the provisions in section 4 of the Bill will also be welcomed by all in the House and will safeguard the rights of these employees to an annual holiday and to the public holidays which are at present enjoyed by the vast majority of the labour force.</P>
    <P>Because the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973 is a relatively complex Act drafted primarily with the intention of providing entitlements to full-time employees, a number of the provisions of that Act have had to be amended to make them applicable to regular part-time employees.  I would like to explain the purpose of some of these provisions as they may seem somewhat obscure to some Members of the House.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (2) is intended to ensure that provisions in the 1973 Act which are not appropriate to &ldquo;regular part-time employees&rdquo; are not applied to them.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (3) (b) provides that time spent by regular part-time employees on annual leave shall count as time worked for the purposes of earning annual leave entitlement.  The subsection replaces an equivalent section in the 1973 Act, part of the wording of which is not appropriate in the context of regular part-time employees.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (3) (c) modifies further provisions in the Act of 1973, the wording of which is not appropriate in relation to regular part-time employees.  Under the Act of 1973 a qualifying employee with eight months service is generally entitled <Col N="303" /> to an unbroken period of leave of two weeks.  Section 4 (3) (c) provides an equivalent entitlement for regular part-time employees.  Because the annual leave entitlement of regular part-time employees is to be reckoned in terms of hours rather than weeks, it is necessary to provide an alternative to the full-timer's two week entitlement.  The alternative provided in the Bill in section 4 (3) (c) is a choice between the leave entitlement earned over the eight months period concerned or of two-thirds of the total leave entitlement earned in the year concerned. Either way, regular part-time workers will be entitled to an unbroken period away from the workplace as their full-time colleagues are at present.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (3) (d) of the Bill also modifies a provision of the 1973 Act part of the wording of which is not appropriate in relation to regular part-time employees. Section 5 (1) of the 1973 Act provides for payment of compensation for annual leave due on termination of employment. However, the method of determining compensation in the 1973 Act is based on the concept of the employee having a &ldquo;qualifying month of service&rdquo;.  This is not applicable in relation to regular part-time employees as under this Bill they will receive entitlement on the basis of six hours for every 100 hours worked. Accordingly, section 4 (3) (d) provides for compensation on a basis which is proportionate to the normal weekly rate of pay.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (3) (e) modifies a further provision of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973 the wording of which is not appropriate in relation to regular part-time employees.  Section 5 (3) of the 1973 Act provides that where employment ceases in the five week period ending before a public holiday and the employee has worked for the employer for at least 120 hours in the part of the period prior to the cessation of employment, the employer must pay an extra day's pay in respect of the public holiday.  There is no obvious equivalent to the 120 hour requirement for regular part-time employees.  Instead, the Bill provides <Col N="304" /> that they must have worked during at least four of the five weeks prior to the cessation of employment in order to qualify. This four week requirement for regular part-time employees imposes a similar obligation to the 120 hour requirement in the 1973 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (3) (f) also changes a provision in the 1973 Act part of the wording of which is not appropriate in relation to regular part-time employees.  Section 6 (3) (b) of the 1973 Act provides that payment for annual leave should be &ldquo;at the normal weekly rate of remuneration&rdquo;. However, as regular part-time employees are to be granted annual leave at the rate of six hours per 100 hours worked, this Bill provides that they be remunerated &ldquo;at a rate which is proportionate to the normal weekly rate of remuneration&rdquo;.  The concept of the &ldquo;normal weekly rate of remuneration&rdquo; is well established in the 1973 Act and was, therefore, retained as the general basis on which payment will be determined for regular part-time employees in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (4) provides that nothing in this Bill shall have the effect of granting retrospective entitlement to annual leave or public holidays prior to the commencement date of the Bill in relation to the holidays provisions.  The reason for introducing this provision is to prevent part-time employees claiming on the commencement date a retrospective entitlement for holidays.  Such a retrospective entitlement would impose a severe cost burden on certain employers.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides for referral to the Employment Appeals Tribunal of any dispute relating to the 13 weeks continuous service and the eight hours a week required to qualify as a regular part-time employee.  This is something entirely separate from disputes relating to periods of service required under, for example, the Unfair Dismissals Act or the Redundancy Payments Acts, which, as far as concerns regular part-time workers, will continue to be resolved under the mechanisms which are already used to resolve these disputes for employees qualified under the individual Acts.  This is a fair and equitable way of <Col N="305" /> dealing with disputes in relation to the service of part-timers and it will allow the Employment Appeals Tribunal to examine the specific circumstances of any particular dispute as to whether the employee was a regular part-time employee for the purposes of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 6 simply deals with the regulations which will control how these disputes are referred to and considered by the tribunal.  The remaining sections of the Bill are standard.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a major social advancement through the extension of the whole body of protective labour law and individual employment rights to a substantial category of employees who, heretofore, were vulnerable and increasingly subject to exploitation by unscrupulous employers.  The good employer has nothing to fear from this legislation.  It simply extends the rights already enjoyed by the vast majority of employees to this rather marginalised group.  As a well balanced and progressive response to the needs of these employees, I commend the Bill to this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>My approach to the question of part-time workers is coloured by my experience as a teacher.  I worked as a teacher for 11 years &mdash; and I hope to return to full-time teaching at some stage &mdash; at both secondary and primary level in Dublin and Cavan.  As a professional in the area of education, the luring of young people into the supermarket chains and major corporations to work in a part-time capacity for a short term buck was a major problem for us as educators. The job in the supermarket down the road was the greatest, most real and cogent counter-attraction to the classroom for young people.  A number of young people had part-time work and missed out on examinations and study. They lacked motivation and were physically exhausted.  They became victims in the sense that their examination prospects and educational opportunity was dwarfed and stunted by the experience of part-time working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Worse still, when these young people reached the age of 18 they were thrown <Col N="306" /> out of the institutions where they were working part-time and sent back on the unemployment register.  They were sent back into a lifelong poverty trap and into a situation that was very difficult for them and their families to cope with, and with little opportunity for second chance education.  That remains the frightening reality of part-time work for many young people and it colours my attitude to the question.  It affects the way I look at it.  It is for that reason, as labour spokesperson for Fine Gael, that I support the legislation in essence and welcome it.  Any advance on the conditions of part-time workers should, in my book, be supported. I will suggest ways in which the legislation could have been improved.  I will look at missed opportunities in the legislation on both Second and Committee Stages of the Bill.  I hope the Minister will be forthcoming in his reply on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>Many of our young people working part-time have been misguided and are exploited.  It is very difficult for teachers, parents and youth groups to deal with this question.  It is a fundamental problem for young people.  Of course, there are related difficulties in that they may come from homes where there is poverty or unemployment.  The more vulnerable young people come from the poorer sectors of the community and that is a double tragedy.</P>
    <P>It should also be said that when many of the large supermarket chains &mdash; I feel very strongly about this &mdash; succeed in closing down or impoverishing a number of small businesses and grocery stores, particularly in rural areas, they do so on the backs of the exploited part-time workers in their employment.  That is a sinister aspect we often miss when we look at the very attractive prices in a number of our supermarket chains.  The human cost behind those prices can be an exploited part-time workforce of students and women.  An exploited part-time workforce allows the supermarket chain to engage in all kinds of sales tactics and cost-cutting.  The social implications of this for the small neighbourhood retail outlet are immense.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="307" /> I make this point in passing but I am very concerned about it.  Something that must be the concern of the Government, Opposition and all institutions of this State is that the fabric of rural life as a consequence of emigration and so on is dying and that is manifested primarily in the depopulation of rural areas.  A major cause of the depopulation and debilitation of rural areas is the fall-off in the neighbourhood shop and grocery store which is so much part of the social and economic infrastructure of a rural community. Major corporations, institutions, major supermarket chains and mega-stores have successfully hoodwinked the general public with prices which they could not offer were it not for their exploitative practices in relation to their workforce.  I make no apologies for drawing that to the attention of the House.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Bill, as outlined by the Minister, is to ensure that part-time workers who are normally expected to work at least eight hours for an employer and have completed 13 continuous weeks service will enjoy the same protection under labour legislation as full-time workers.  At the moment that is 18 hours.  That proposal is welcomed by my party and we consider it to be a correct response.  The proposal regarding eight hours and bringing part-time workers with over eight hours under labour legislation is welcomed.</P>
      <P>There are 20,000 people in the workforce known to be part-time.  I would say that in addition to that 20,000, there are many more because there are a number of workers in the black economy who are not in the official part-time figures.  The tax system can act as a disincentive in that there can often be a conspiracy between employer and employee not to declare the fact that the person is a part-time worker because were they to do so, particularly in the case of a spouse, they would be liable for a punitive rate of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept and would be the first to admit <Col N="308" /> that rectification of our tax system is fraught with difficulty.  We must use our intelligence to readjust our tax system in a way that will not interfere with our scant social services.  The PAYE system is creating a black economy where a number of people are hiding the fact that they are part-time workers because they are afraid of the tax implications.  That must be considered and I ask the Minister to address that question.  It is not something that can be incorporated into the legislation but it presents a challenge to the Government to produce a taxation code which will be equitable, will raise sufficient revenue and, at the same time, avoid creating a black economy where there are all sorts of conspiracies to hide people's working status.</P>
    <P>When we discussed part-time workers I made the point that it was very much a young person's issue, a student's issue. I repeat the point at the risk of being laborious that the lure of part-time work in its present form has been massively destructive to the education, social, cultural and personal opportunities of young people.</P>
    <P>If it is a young person's issue, it is also very much a woman's issue.  A matter that is of immediate concern is that 70 per cent of the part-time workforce are women.  The supermarket chains are only one source, albeit a major source, of part-time work.  Many women have part-time work in this area and they are very often caught up in the trap of poverty and exploitation.  Many of these women will come from homes where unemployment already exists, where their spouse may be unemployed.  Some women come from homes where the spouse is on a low income; some will be single women.</P>
    <P>A breakdown of the part-time labour force indicates that a large number of the women are married and have children but many of them receive a paltry sum of money for their work.  They have no security.  In addition, they are in the dreadful position of having to run a home.  Officially they are part-time workers in the sense that in their workplace they are part-time but the reality is that they return from that workplace to <Col N="309" /> engage in a whole range of household duties, child rearing etc., that turns them into round-the-clock workers.  Not only are they round-the-clock workers but they are a poor, impoverished and disadvantaged sector.  The poverty trap and the system of part-time work has been one of the greatest sources of exploitation and of lack of equality of opportunity for women.  It is horrendous to think that a woman who was 15 years with a firm, working less than 18 hours, would not be entitled to maternity leave.  That is most unacceptable.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong of a responsible elected representative not to welcome constructive initiatives and I welcome the fact that maternity leave will now be the right of a woman in established part-time work.  It is regrettable that the Minister did not take this opportunity to introduce paternity leave.  The concept of paternity leave is only now becoming fashionable on the Continent of Europe.  We could be trend setters in this regard.  It is now accepted that men play a major role in parenting and that is how it should be.  It would be a wonderful initiative if the Minister recognised that developing social reality by introducing paternity leave.  I accept that such an initiative would have economic implications but I ask the Minister to take a courageous stand on this and, with due consideration to the economic realities, to consider the introduction of paternity leave.  The Minister would gain public respect for taking such an initiative.  It would complement the maternity leave provision of the Act.</P>
    <P>It is also regrettable that we have not extended the maternity leave provisions to adoptive parents.  At the moment we are very conscious of adoptive parents because of the recent media interest in the Romanian babies.  A considerable number of Irish families went to Romania and adopted babies there and that was a welcome development.  It is because we have become much more conscious of adoption recently that I say to the Minister the provisions of this Bill should apply to a parent or a family who have adopted a child.</P>
    <P>It is to be welcomed that access to the <Col N="310" /> Unfair Dismissals Tribunal will now be extended to part-time workers.  It is a pity the Bill fails to recognise one of the most important features of part-time employment and that is the prevalence of contract and agency work.  Congress recommends that the Bill be amended to incorporate their definition of employer and employee.  Congress suggests that such an amendment should provide that an &ldquo;employer&rdquo; means the person by whom the employee is employed under a contract of employment or the person who secures the services of an employee through a contract with an employment agency, or otherwise that an employee should be defined as a person insurable for occupational injuries.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to hear the Minister's response on Second Stage to the proposition by Congress that the Bill should be so amended.  If such an amendment would improve the Bill it would be wrong if we failed to do that simply because the complete initiative did not come from this House.</P>
    <P>Congress also raises the point with regard to redundancy payments, whether exempting employers from making a contribution to the redundancy fund on behalf of regular part-time workers would interfere with the employees' statutory requirements.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's reply to this.</P>
    <P>It is a frightening concept that all part-time workers &mdash; I think this will not be questioned &mdash; are effectively in low pay posts.  In essence, they must be, by virtue of the number of hours they work and because of their situation.  It is frightening that two-thirds of those are women.  It is an indictment of society and it raises fundamental questions that should be addressed by any Parliament interested in achieving equality between the sexes and equality of opportunity for all citizens. It is a matter that must be addressed urgently.</P>
    <P>We will have to address with great rapidity and in a more meaningful way the matter of the income level of part-time workers.  I made the point that I <Col N="311" /> welcomed the extension of the rights of part-time workers to bring them under the umbrella of all existing labour legislation. I favour that, with a couple of reservations which I drew attention to and which, I presume, will be answered on Second Stage and later on Committee Stage.  To give meaning and worth to this legislation, I would have thought it would be necessary to do more than we are doing about prescribing an income level for part-time workers.  In that area we should be more prescriptive.</P>
    <P>The point should be made that there are a number of benign and good employers of part-time workers.  That is unquestionable and that is not at issue. That is what should exist and it is in the best interests of employers to intelligently put their own houses in order in terms of income and conditions for their workers because it has a lot of implications. Apart from the fact that it is the right thing to do, I think it creates a much more beneficial situation for the industry or business if that be the case.  We have to take account of the fact that no more than in Charles Dickens's days, we still have today a number of exploitative employers.  We have to accept that reality and we have to address it.  It is on that account that I am concerned that aspect of the legislation is deficient.  I urge the Minister to be more prescriptive about the level of income that part-time workers can, of right, earn.  I believe we should prescribe a minimum rate and I put forward the view that in this country generally there should in law be a minimum income.  The laws of the land should be amended to provide by right for the citizens of this country a minimum income.</P>
    <P>The argument could be made, and it is often trotted out, that, if we are overly prescriptive or overly legalistic it can act as a disincentive to an employer.  I do not accept that.  I believe that in proper circumstances a reasonable level of income can and would be paid out by employers if that was prescribed, and you would find that in many cases it is already happening.  It is also the case that in <Col N="312" /> America where a minimum wage for part-time workers exists there is no evidence that job creation has in any way suffered as a result.  I urge the Minister to think about that matter.</P>
    <P>I am fundamentally of the view that any amending legislation of the existing situation is to be welcomed.  I am very conscious that we must strive in this legislation and in other measures to give dignity to our part-time workers, to give dignity to the person who works very odd and difficult hours for low pay and with no job security.  I welcome any dignity that is bestowed on such persons as a result of this measure.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to respond to the issues raised by Congress which I brought before the House and to respond to the matter of a minimum income for part-time workers by law to get over problems of exploitation.  If we can do that, it will be most helpful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  On the basis of his performance as Minister for Labour and in relation to the legislation he has introduced he is accepted on all sides of the House as one of the best Ministers for Labour this country has ever had.  It is a tremendous compliment to him.  It is also a tremendous compliment to his ability and his expertise that no less a critic than Senator O'Reilly with some few exceptions that I probably would not agree with myself, has accepted the terms of this legislation.  The Minister is again to be complimented on the very progressive legislation before us today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that part-time workers who are normally expected to work for at least eight hours a week for an employer who have completed 13 weeks continuous service with that employer will enjoy the same protection under labour legislation as full-time workers.  That legislation will include very important measures which would include the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1990; the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973 and 1984, the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts 1977 and 1988, the <Col N="313" /> Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, the Maternity Protection of Employees, Act 1981, the Protection of Employers, Insolvency Acts 1984 and 1990 and the Holidays (Employees) Act 1973.  The Bill covers a wide range of legislation for part-time workers which is already available to the full-time employee.  It is most welcome legislation.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister and the Government have been concerned for some time that there are people in regular, part-time employment who find themselves outside the legal arena of legislation designed to protect the worker.  This Bill will do just that.  As the Minister said, somewhere in the region of 20,000 part-time employees will have a range of statutory entitlements for the first time. The fact that the threshold of 18 hours will now be reduced to eight hours is extremely progressive and ahead of many other European countries.  That is extremely important when at times we are being decried for not moving with the times and for not being as progressive as other countries.  The Minister has taken the initiative in this instance and we are now ahead of many other countries in Europe in relation to this type of legislation.</P>
    <P>Women, in particular, will benefit greatly from this Bill.  Three-quarters of the 70,000 regular part-time workers are women and as 20,000 of them work fewer than 18 hours they will now benefit from this legislation.  The country has an increasing number of part-time workers and the growth of part-time work is actually providing job opportunities for women.  Part-time work suits many women.  It is important that we appreciate that.  They would not be in a position to hold down a full-time job because of their responsibilities in relation to the rearing of children and other responsibilities in the home.</P>
    <P>The situation is that the woman still remains the main worker in the home and has the greatest responsibilities within the home.  That situation and attitude is changing, but is changing rather slowly. I have no idea when both the husband and wife will become equal partners in <Col N="314" /> relation to the running of the home and the responsibilities therein, but at present the woman bears most of the responsibilities in relation to the home.  For that and other reasons quite a number of women have to work to supplement the family budget.  They make a fantastic contribution and I would have to agree with Senator O'Reilly in regard to the enormous contribution women play in relation to the whole family structure. The old adage that a women's work is never done is true.  If there ever was a truism that is one.  It probably goes back to our upbringing or our background. We expect to work for the day and then expect the dinner to be ready and everything laid on for us.  The lady who may also be working is expected to carry out all the extra-curricular activities outside her actual workplace.  I am speaking in terms of full-time women employees as well as part-time employees.  There is an expectation by many men that once they have their day's work done that is it, and the lady of the house should do all that is needed after that.</P>
    <P>In relation to adding to the family budget, there are many women, for various reasons, who would not be able to work full-time but who find it very convenient to engage in part-time work mainly for the addition to the family budget but also for the psychological reason that they are getting out of the home and into a different environment, into the work environment.  In many cases women take on low status and lowly paid jobs for the benefit of getting away from the home environment.  From that viewpoint, they may be victimised in terms of very low income because they are prepared to accept the low income in return for the opportunity to get out into a different environment.  In many ways it relates to psychological difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important to recognise their contribution to the labour force and to the family budget; this is exactly what the Minister is doing in this legislation. He is recognising that contribution.  It is important to understand that in all developing countries there is a shift from employment in manufacturing industry <Col N="315" /> into services.  That is a standard progression with developing countries: the more developed a country becomes the more services will be available and the emphasis in relation to the labour force transfers from the manufacturing into the services industries.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, in many of the services industries it suits a lot of those areas to have part-time employment because flexibility is extremely important in relation to services.  On the one hand, it suits the services industries and, on the other, many people who would not be in a position to avail of full-time employment but who are very happy to be able to avail of part-time employment.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there has been exploitation of part-time workers and the Bill sets out to tackle that type of exploitation. The whole area of part-time work is very sensitive and it is to the Minister's credit that he has taken such care and has had such exhaustive discussions, as always, with the various union-employer organisations to arrive at a consensus in this very delicate area.  His patience in negotiating skill and his ability to reassure the various interests has marked him as an outstanding Minister for Labour.  This legislation is no different from what has come through this House and the other House in the past.  We have to recognise that part-time work is here to stay, there is no question about that.  It will play an ever-growing part in the labour force in the future.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased that the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, has introduced legislation which also gives part-time workers the benefit of social security.  Under that legislation, any part-time worker who earns over £40 a week will now be able to apply for social welfare payments.  Along with this legislation it goes a long way in protecting the long term part-time employee.  It is a tremendous and progressive step.  I agree with the Minister when he stated that industry in general should adopt a progressive approach and progressive policies in their own enlightened self-interest.  It would <Col N="316" /> be in the interest of all organisations and companies that they would give a fair day's wage for a fair day's work.  That is extremely important.</P>
    <P>In the long term any company which adopts a progressive attitude towards its employees, be they part-time or full-time, will gain substantially from the commitment, work and enthusiasm the workers in general will return to the employer where they recognise that the employer is a fair-minded individual and is interested in their welfare.  That is the attitude that employers in general should adopt because, as the Minister has said, it is in their own self-interest to do that. That there is a need for part-time work is without question.  The Minister went into detail about flexibility in relation to services and so on.  It is appropriate that we have this legislation before us at this time.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with the Minister's decision to use the Employment Appeals Tribunal to deal with unscrupulous employers who try to evade the continuous 13-week working duration and the eight-hour week threshold.  This is further evidence of the type of protection the part-time worker will be able to use. As Senator O'Reilly said, it is appalling that employers who have regular part-time workers working for them for ten or 15 years could, at a whim, dismiss them out of hand and they would have no way of getting any compensation or getting anyone to represent them.  Equally, a female part-time employee could have continuous service over a period of time and if she became pregnant she would have absolutely no entitlement to retain her employment except for the goodwill of the employer who might say he would hold on to the job for her for a week or two or so on.</P>
    <P>The normal statutory requirement for full-time employees is a relatively longer period which is recognised as being the time that women who have children are entitled to, and require, in order to give them the opportunity to recover sufficiently and to get back into the workplace in a healthy frame of mind and in a healthy condition.  The fact that a <Col N="317" /> woman is a part-time employee does not mean her physical and psychological make-up is any different from a full-time worker.  Both are human beings, both go through exactly the same experience in childbearing and one should be as entitled to the same protection, regulations and legislation as the other.  It is a tremendous achievement that we are now dealing with this legislation.</P>
    <P>With regard to annual holidays, again it is very important that the regular part-time employee should be entitled to some holidays.  It is crazy to think a regular part-time employees has not been entitled to an ordinary public holiday. This legislation provides for this.</P>
    <P>The Minister's idea is to strike a balance between greater flexibility for industry and a need for stability in relation to employees.  I reiterate what the Minister said, that the good employer has nothing to fear from this legislation.  It simply extends the rights already enjoyed by the vast majority of employees to a rather marginalised group.  It is a well balanced and progressive response to the needs of these employees.</P>
    <P>Again, I compliment the Minister on an excellent speech.  It is one of the most detail exposés of legislation I have had the good fortune to hear in this House.  I congratulate the Minister on this very progressive legislation and the excellent way in which it was presented.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at legislation like this where you are dealing with something that is called &mdash; I use the phrase with considerable resentment &mdash; the labour market, it is as well to get some of the old myths out of the way.  One of the great myths is that Irish workers are exceedingly well paid.  This, of course, is not true.  They are well paid in the sectors <Col N="318" /> of the economy that can more than afford to pay them well.  The profitable multinational sector, particularly in fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals, electronics and a few areas like that, pay people extremely well.  They do it because they are enormously profitable.  It is worth remembering that the relative share of profits as against employees' incomes in terms of their proportion of the national income has shifted by a considerable extent in recent years towards profits and away from wages, reflecting the extraordinary restraint in terms of wage claims of the greater part of the Irish workforce. We have yet to see the expected benefits from that shift.</P>
    <P>The other thing I have always had difficulty with &mdash; and I want to put it on the record again &mdash; is this myth of competitiveness. Competitiveness exists.  The myth is the attempt to quantify competitiveness entirely in terms of one index, namely, the growth in hourly wage rates, the growth in employee earnings. It is one of these fascinating issues where you could have interest rates shoot up and you do not have a loud shout about competitiveness, but if you have wages creep ahead of the rate of inflation for even 12 months, there is a chorus of protest that our competitiveness is being severely undermined.  We had a particularly virulent chorus of this in the first half of the 1980s.  We were told we were being priced out of international markets. When statistics became available &mdash; of course they are always after the event, by definition &mdash; in the first half of the 1980s Irish exports grew faster than virtually every other country in the OECD, grew dramatically faster than those of Japan, for instance, and dramatically outstretched the growth in exports, or indeed as it was in the first half of the 1980s the decline in exports, of a country that is often given to us as an image of how a labour market ought to work, that is the United States.</P>
    <P>The evidence that Irish wages rates were ever on a threatening spiral to the extent that they would undermine the structure of industry is patchy to say the least, and in many cases non-existent.  I <Col N="319" /> have frequently invited employers' representatives at conferences to name the companies that they know closed down simply because the employees got wage increases representing the going rate of wage increases, where they could say unequivocally that if these workers had been prepared to accept lower increases or no increases, the company would have succeeded and where the company closed only for that reason.  I have yet to be given any examples of this.  I have had occasional ifs, buts and maybes but no specific examples.  I say this not because I believe we can have uncontrolled wage increases but because the common sense of ordinary people will always tell them when they are being had. They will begin to believe they are being had about recent levels of wage restraints if in five years time their children are unable to get jobs in spite of the considerable restraint they have shown and in spite of the evidence available to them that the profits of the company they work for are spiralling.</P>
    <P>I find that distasteful because it is the sort of phrase economists will churn out; the overwhelming majority of them will take exception to regulating what they call the labour market.  They have a habit of talking about the labour market as if it was not different from the market in oil, potatoes or some other commodity, a commodity to be bought and sold.  They seem to object when it does not allow itself to be subjected to the same fluctuations in demand and price as other commodities.  They would have us believe that the people who are the units of this market should forget they are people and pretend they are things and accept the right of the market to buy and sell them with the same degree of anonymity that would apply to potatoes.  It is a classic example of the inanity that passes as scientific economics and economists try to persuade the rest of us that we must accept it.</P>
    <P>Why does it have to be said and sound almost like a heresy in economic terms that the labour market is made up of people, that they make free choices and <Col N="320" /> do not operate on a Pavlovian supply and demand curve of the kind that is much loved by most economists of whatever point on the political spectrum they occupy?  It is an interesting comment on economics as a so-called objective science that one has to find out an economist's politics before one can find out what he is really talking about.  Imagine if the politics of a chemist or physicist had to be worked out before one could figure out what they were taking about. If one wants to know what an economist means one has to find out what his politics are because his economics are posited on that and not the other way around.</P>

      <P>The idea that economics is a science is one of the myths that has been foisted on late 20th century humanity.  It is not a science, it has none of the characteristics of a science.  It is neither measurable, quantifiable, experimental nor capable of experimental testing; therefore, it is not a science.  It is a useful tool that can be of some assistance, particularly to government, when it is treated with a considerable degree of scepticism.  That is the only way it is useful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fundamental objections to legislation like this will come from the dismal scientists.  They will object categorically and consistently to regulation of the labour market because they like markets; one of the reasons they will object is because they can understand markets but little else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truth is that we talk ourselves into contortions of logic on the question of the workforce.  For example, everybody believes labour mobility is a very good thing.  The economists have convinced us that the more you have of what they call &ldquo;labour mobility&rdquo; the greater the chances of efficiency in the allocation of resources in the &ldquo;labour market&rdquo;.  At the same time <Col N="321" /> we will all say we are against emigration, which is a classic example in the large economic unit we are now part of, the EC, of labour mobility.  We are in favour of labour mobility in principle as long as it does not apply to ourselves because we know there are many other things that matter to people as much as a certain type of job, one of them being where they work.</P>
    <P>With regard to legislation for the rights of workers, the last people to whom we should listen are those who preach the doctrine of the marketplace.  Perhaps we have spent too long listening to people who preached other kinds of doctrine but we would be very foolish at this stage, having watched the world liberate itself from one nonsensical and tyrannical ideology, to allow ourselves to walk into the arms of another equally inhuman ideology.</P>
    <P>It would be a foolish person who would deny a connection between the amount a person is paid and the persons willingness to look for work.  There is an increasing tendency in our society to look at the disincentive to work in terms of the level of welfare payment that people will receive rather than in terms of the level of low wages that will be offered.  I am fascinated by the implied criticism in much of what was said about the recent anomalies which suggested that it was more unfair to pay people a generous family income supplement than to excessively tax them; nobody questioned the idea of paying a man who is supporting a spouse and four children £10,000 a year in a job.  The truth is that £10,000 a year to support a spouse and four children &mdash; as every Member of this House, the other House and the Government knows &mdash; is very little.  If Members of this House or the other House had to support a spouse and four children on £10,000 they would have a very different view.</P>
    <P>I am fascinated, in terms of the ideology behind a lot of the talk about incentive to work, by the farcical campaign for tax reform because there are anomalies in the PAYE system, particularly the application of relatively high rates on relatively low incomes.  We have not done <Col N="322" /> anything of any significance about that. We have reduced the top rate which is of no great benefit to people who were not paying it in the first place but is of considerable benefit to the tiny minority of people &mdash; the 2 per cent of PAYE &mdash; who have assessed incomes in excess of £25,000.</P>
    <P>In terms of the issue of why and how people work, a lot of nonsense has been talked.  I do not believe a word from those employers who are suggesting that this legislation will significantly reduce job opportunities and the willingness of employers to employ people because there are a couple of things that need to be said about jobs.  One of them is so self-evident that it should be said at the beginning of every speech, and that is that the only jobs we want are decent jobs that pay people reasonably well.  We do not want a slave labour economy. There is an implied threat by many employers and their spokespersons about the prospects of retaining jobs but our labour protection legislation is not particularly strict by the standards of northern Europe.  It is probably better than that existing in our nearest neighbour but that has more to do with the historical disasters of the past ten years they will come to regret in terms of what has been done to the social fabric of that society.  We have never gone down that route and I do not think even at this stage that a single political party in the State want to go that route.  I had suspicions about Fine Gael for a while but they have recovered their senses.</P>

      <P>Given how well Senator O'Keeffe knows me, it is a matter of considerable amazement that he is surprised by anything I say, even if I contradicted myself twice in the one speech.</P>
      <P>Before I move from the incentive to work and the simplicities that underlie it, it is worth putting on the record that somebody earning £10,000 a year in Germany actually pays more tax than somebody on the same income in this country, according to the figures published in <i>The Irish Times</i> the day after the budget.  The reason for this is that income tax rates are lower but social security contributions are dramatically higher.  At the end of it if you subtract all the deductions the net take home pay is less.  The only level of income where there is a dramatic difference is somewhere around £75,000 a year.  Even up to £25,000 it is about £20 per week.  I am not sure &mdash; notwithstanding what some people say &mdash; that droves of young Irish graduates with high level of qualifications are taking off from Ireland to work in Germany for the sake of £20 per week.  Yet again we are being fed myths, we are very fond of mythology in this country; the trouble is we believe them far too easily.</P>
      <P>Now that I have relieved myself of a few prejudices, the Bill is, of course, extremely welcome.  The Minister mentioned that many part-time workers currently excluded from the legislation would be brought in under the Bill.  How many of the 82,000 part-time workers will still not be protected by the legislation? I do not recall a figure in his speech.  Of the 82,000, how many are working eight hours a week or less?  Will the Minister clarify that in his reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister said the Bill excludes contract workers and that he specifically said he proposes to look at that area because it is an extremely sinister development, particularly in Irish manufacturing industry.  It is one that seems to have hit the food processing industry particularly strongly and it has <Col N="324" /> surfaced now in the chemical industry in my home area.  The trade unions in some areas have worked extremely hard to educate their members about what is being done to them.  It is important to remember that a contract worker, by definition, loses all the protections of the 1906 Industrial Trade Disputes Act.  If a contract worker attempts to withdraw his or her labour because of a dispute about the rate of payment he or she can be sued for breach of contract, which entirely changes the nature of the relationship and puts the individual, who is effectively a self-employed person providing a service under contract, in a very vulnerable position.  Even if contract workers are organised in a union it is doubtful if the union can do much for them because any kind of collective action would again be a breach of contract.  This is an area where fundamental changes in legislation are extremely badly needed.  We should not allow a situation to develop where the nature of the contractual relationship between an employer and an employee can be changed simply by redefining the terms of that relationship in terms of contract work.  In the interests of working people, reasonable job security, the existence of a large and effective trade union movement and long term good industrial relations, we have to ensure that contract work cannot become a way out of a whole host of areas of worker protection legislation.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of extreme importance. I do not believe the problems of flexibility that some industries have, the need for modern, intelligent work practices, the need for the things that most industries need and are entitled to ask for from the workforce in terms of flexibility and so on, have to be solved via contract or, indeed, agency work.  There are areas where specialist needs can arise on occasion and in those cases contract and agency work may well be the solution. They have always been a part of work and perhaps there is a need for more of those in certain areas.  However, to suggest &mdash; as was done in my own adopted county, for fear Senator O'Keeffe will get sensitive again &mdash; that <Col N="325" /> a large section of the food industry, one major co-operative, tried to get a large part of their straightforward shop floor workforce to accept a contract relationship has nothing to do with specialisation or the need to have access to specialised services or flexibility.  That is an attempt to exclude the employer from most of the responsibilities that employers must take on and it should not be allowed to happen.  I hope the Minister will introduce legislation to ensure that it cannot happen.  It will not do any good for any part of our society.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the application of worker-protection legislation which characterised most European countries except Britain and Ireland.  He mentioned the EC directive which had an eight hour minimum.  Can he tell us about some of the countries of Europe which have a minimum hourly threshold? I am not trying to trip the Minister up but I am interested because it is important. Do the Scandanavian countries have a minimum hourly threshold or is this eight hours more or less a reasonable figure by European standards generally? Do any of them have a zero threshold?  I suspect some of them do and I would like to know because I am afraid I do not have as benign a view of Irish employers as the Minister has.  I visualise considerable readjustments; nothing as crude as people being sacked and reemployed but simply as the turnover of the labour force proceeds that one person doing 17 or 18 hours a week will be replaced by two people doing eight hours a week.  This will be done gradually and slowly.  That is what bothers me.  I do not believe there will be a wholesale clearout next week.</P>
    <P>I heard one of the assistant general secretaries of the ICTU claim that some employers are moving in that direction already.  It is extremely important that the Minister should ensure &mdash; and I am glad there will be provisions to do so &mdash; that employers cannot do this deliberately. There is at least one major supermarket chain &mdash; Dunnes Stores &mdash; which has been berated by a succession of reports from the Labour Court about <Col N="326" /> their attitude to part-time workers.  I only mention the name, not in any way to abuse the privilege of the House, but because their name has already been used extensively by the Labour Court.  I am doing no more than reporting what the Labour Court said.  I can see the Chair getting edgy with me but I am simply reporting to this House what the Labour Court has said about a named body; I am not trying to abuse my position at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am doing so. We are talking about part-time workers and I am talking about how they are treated.  However, I have finished in that regard.  I would also like to know the view of the Government to the draft directive out of which came the eight hours.  Did they ask that the hours be increased or reduced?  I know we have a figure of eight hours but did the Government object to the eight hours?  Was there initially a lower or a higher threshold and what was the Government's view on it?  The Government's view on the social charter was, to say the least, confusing for those of us who had to observe it from the outside.  I got the impression we were enthusiastic about it until we got down to <Col N="327" /> the details and then we wanted a lot of changes to it.  I am far from clear on what our position is.</P>

      <P>I would like to answer the Senator on that point.  Our legislation had been published three months before the Commissioner published her draft but it is highly unlikely that she will get eight hours into her draft.  It is a bit like the social charter where at least we were honest and said where we stood.  The countries that have followed us since have done nothing.  The eight hours is the Commissioner's first draft.  I pre-empted that and came to that figure.  My German and Italian colleagues changed their minds in the last few years, and are now trying to raise the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are of course, other areas where part-time workers are affected.  The Minister mentioned the whole area of services and the banks in particular.  The carry-on of the banks in their schemes to disemploy and re-employ employees &mdash; and re-employ some of them on a part-time basis &mdash; was no great example to our society.  I do not believe there was any overwhelming need for that.  None of us has yet found a degree of flexibility in the services provided by the banks in terms of longer opening hours, weekend opening or even lunch-time opening hours that could justify this demand for a much more flexible workforce.  Many of us suspect that there is only one reason for the changes that the banks have introduced in terms of their workforce, that is a cheaper workforce. There is, in this, a great difference between what employers said when they explained to the Minister the need for increased part-time work and, on the other hand, why they want part-time work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a difference between what one needs and what one wants and why one needs or wants something.  Understandably, one may want something because of changes in work practices, changes in the structure of work, changes <Col N="328" /> in the workforce, changes in the composition of the workforce, or in the part of the workforce, in which one thinks one has the best chance of getting the sort of workforce required.  That is one thing, but if one wants part-time work simply because it is cheaper and because one can get around a whole lot of the provisions in good legislation, then one does not deserve the sympathy of either the Minister, the State or society and one should not get it.</P>
    <P>I have some queries in relation to Irish employers.  The Minister on a couple of occasions last year gave vent to some of the same frustrations.  It appears that no matter how well they are provided for in terms of the tax code, wages and every other area, they do not yet seem to be able to provide the jobs which all this is supposed to do, provide jobs.  We still have an extraordinarily cruel high level of unemployment.  If I hear anybody else in our society suggest that all this is caused simply because our tax on work is somewhat higher than in some other countries, I will lose whatever limited patience I have left; that is not true.  If I hear somebody say that the other reason is because employers' PRSI is too high, what is left of my patience at that stage will finally expire.  Irish employers pay one of the lowest levels of employers' social insurance in the EC; it is astronomically lower than in some other countries and to suggest that to reduce those would shift the numbers of unemployed is not true.</P>
    <P>When we had the PRSI incentives to encourage employers to take people on, we were told the number of people that had been taken on but the real figure is the comparison between the number taken on and the number that would have been taken on if this had not happened. These are worthy subjects of study. There is no point in the State producing incentive after incentive to employers if all the incentives do is make it cheaper and cheaper for them to employ the same number of people.  We are inclined to create incentives to get people to work.</P>
    <P>There is a serious problem about which the Minister was vocal in his Opposition <Col N="329" /> days.  It is true that our workforce is changing; an increasing proportion of the workforce will not be employed in the direct wealth producing area of manufacturing industry.  The two important areas in society are the section that produces wealth and the section that draws in wealth from outside; in other words, internationally traded services and manufacturing industry.  I am not aware of any other area of activity in our society which can contribute unless it contributes to one or other of those.</P>
    <P>An increasing proportion of the workforce will not find work in the manufacturing industry because it is increasingly automated, which is as it should be.  The function of manufacturing industry is to produce and, in the process of producing, to create wealth.  The problem for this country is the scale of the export of that wealth from here.  The level of profit and dividend repatriation in 1990, for instance exceeded the total value of agricultural production in that year by about 25 per cent.  It represent £1 in £9 of our entire gross national product being taken out of the country.  There is no point in creating wealth if it leaves the country.  That scale of profit, if it were retained and reinvested in this country, would eliminate our levels of unemployment in a very short time.  That is the problem with our economic policies; we get one-half of the equation which is restraint in wages resulting in high levels of profitability.  This would be justifiable if the money was actually being reinvested but when £1 in £9 of our gross national product leaves the country &mdash; 11 per cent of GNP in 1989 in repatriated profit and dividends &mdash; then there is a serious problem.  It could be argued that to reduce the profits of many of those multinationals by allowing their workforce to seek much higher wages would keep a considerably greater proportion of the wealth created in the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked a great deal about women and the rights of women workers. It was alleged in one of the British newspapers &mdash; I think it was <i>The Guardian</i>&mdash; that the gap between Irish male and female workers in the manufacturing <Col N="330" /> sector was the greatest in Europe and that women's wages as a proportion of men's in manufacturing industry was greater than in the rest of the EC.  I found that a little surprising; I thought we had made more progress than that over the last 15 years.  I would be interested to know if that is true.  I cannot make up my mind about what the Minister thinks because in his speech he seemed to say that he accepts the part-time workforce, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Much part-time work in Ireland is female dominated and disproportionately concentrated in the services sector, typically occurring at low levels of skill, poor pay and prospects with a low likelihood of union protection.</P>
    <P>Further on he was much more cautious, he said:</P>
    <P>If it is the case, as some researchers have speculated, that part-time workers tend to be limited to moving frequently between low status, low-skilled jobs with few fringe benefits...</P>
    <P>I take it the Minister accepts that part-time workers are in that less than happy category.  I am only picking up a detail in his speech and, therefore, I need not pursue it.  That means, of course, that we have left a large section of working women in a position of enormous vulnerability. Has the Minister some further information on the income background of part-time women workers?  What income category do they come from?  Is the income background similar to the income background of society at large?  What proportion, if married, are single parents and what proportion of those who are married are married to unemployed spouses?  That would give us an even better picture of what the Minister was talking about, which is moving frequently between low status, low skill jobs with few fringe benefits.  That is the picture of part-time workers and it would be good to know that we are doing something at last about an area of serious workforce exploitation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> I am glad Senator McKenna talked about the assumption underlying the presumption that many women want part-time work because of their domestic responsibilities.  He was quite right to point out that that is not necessarily writ on tablets of stone.  Surely the longer-term objective ought to be a system of work distribution and a system of work which facilitates and encourages an equal sharing of responsibilities between the two parties.  It seems to be a reality that increasingly many women rightly feel the need to work outside the home as well as the traditional work they have done inside the home.</P>
    <P>The solution is not to have two people outside working enormously long hours, being enormously high achievers.  The solution is a distribution of work in the home and outside the home which enables both parts of people's lives to be satisfied by involvement.  It might be good for many men, who are driven to a frenetic level of activity, actually to be both facilitated and encouraged to participate more in the ordinary domestic duties.  It might not only be good for their spouses, it might be good for the men themselves. It might slow them down a bit and do them a lot of good.  I presume in the longer term we will be talking about the sort of measures that Senator O'Reilly was talking about to facilitate paternity leave and part-time working in a way which can distribute work between the two partners in a marriage.  We might even do something about politics, which has probably produced more exploited spouses than in any other area of employment in the State in terms of the presumptions of the sharing of domestic responsibility.</P>
    <P>We would want to remember that this is important, but it will not make anybody who is badly paid well paid.  It will not change by a penny an hour the wage rates that part-time workers are receiving.  It will not change the fact that somewhere around 250,000 people in the Irish workforce are being paid less than £150 per week gross.  While it would be comforting <Col N="332" /> for somebody with my politics to be able to attribute all this to exploitative private sector employers, the truth is that a huge proportion of that quarter of a million is actually employed by the State in a variety of areas of work.  The State as an employer has a particularly shameful record in terms of the wages it pays to many of its employees.  There are many badly paid people in the public sector.</P>
    <P>When our friendly economists talks about public sector wages, I wish they would go away from the average and look at the distribution of income and talk about the difference that even a 14 per cent or 20 per cent wage increase would mean to somebody in the public sector on, say, £120 per week, so that they will move from £120 to perhaps £140 per week because of this enormously generous provision for special pay increases.  They will still be poor at the end of it and they will still be very badly paid.  It is a tragedy that we have this huge number of people employed in the public sector in appallingly badly paid work.</P>
    <P>I subscribe to the view that we need a national minimum wage.  It was perhaps one of the great disappointments of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that the trade unions failed to extract a commitment to that.  I am not entirely sure why Irish employers objected to it other than attributing even more malign motives than I am inclined to attribute to them from time to time.  I cannot see why.  It is something that has worked in countries with a much less regulated, God bless the mark, labour market than our own and worked apparently relatively successfully to prevent sweatshop labour.  It is something we need.  It is something we need also to avoid the ridiculous anomalies that arise when we begin to put together reasonable levels of welfare benefits in certain areas and we then end up with ridiculous anomalies because of the wage rates that people are being paid.  I am sceptical about so-called scientific studies which claim to detect some correlation between national minimum wages and the number of jobs that would be lost.  I am profoundly sceptical <Col N="333" /> about those correlations.  They are to be treated with the same degree of scepticism that most of the products of that science should be treated with.</P>
    <P>Perhaps as an afterthought, it needs to be said that one of the things that would do a lot for the rights of part-time workers would be unionisation.  There is an extent to which one can criticise the trade union movement for a certain lack of a willingness to get out and recruit part-time workers.  My own union, for instance, until relatively recently did not condescend to allow part-time teachers to be full-time voting members.  It is relatively recently that my own union got around to recognising that part-time teachers existed and were entitled to union membership. Until recently they were not allowed to be members.  They were allowed to be associated non-voting members.  My own union is a good progressive union with a good record in many areas.  I suspect that many other unions may have a less enthusiastic view.  It is a lot of work for a branch secrertary to deal with part-time workers who perhaps are mobile and where perhaps there is a considerable turnover; and, of course, the Irish trade union movement is hopelessly under-resourced.</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions operates on what can only be described as a shoe string.  For instance, the Cork Council of Trade Unions, which I have some knowledge of and which is expected to provide representatives for a range of bodies and to be the voice of trade unionism in Cork, the last time I saw it, it was operating on a budget of £1,000 per year.  The trade union movement is hopelessly under-resourced and, because it is, it is not in a position to recruit part-time workers.</P>
    <P>I hope the extension of the unfair dismissals legislation may make many part-time workers feel freer to join unions. Whatever is said about the trade union movement, and many valid criticisms can be directed at them, the single greatest protection a worker has is to be a member of a union.  It at least guarantees minimum standards of wages, minimum conditions, etc.  and at least they then have <Col N="334" /> a voice, if nothing else, to use the legal processes to ensure that their rights under the law are made available to them.</P>
    <P>Again, let us not get ourselves into knots about the impact of unions on industrial performance.  The truth is that Irish industrial productivity, particularly in modern industries which are properly managed, with high levels of investment, is as high as anywhere in the EC.  Part of the OECD, the United States, which has the lowest level of worker organisation, has had an appallingly low level of growth in industrial productivity for the past ten years.  There is no reason to believe that high levels of union organisations are in any way inimical to high levels of industrial productivity.  It is a matter of good management more than anything else.  If there is good management and a good union, it is an asset; it is something that helps good management, not the opposite.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give us some information about what level of enforcement there is of existing legislation &mdash; the joint industrial councils that set the wage rates in certain areas.  I get a bit fed up at this stage every year reading about the large numbers of solicitors', for instance, who are found guilty of paying their staff wages well below the legal minimum.  Do the Minister's Department have the resources to ensure enforcement in the areas where these joint industrial councils exist?  The catering industry, for instance, is another major area of potential exploitation, where many people feel there is large-scale exploitation.  Yet, there are minimum binding legal agreements irrespective of whether a place is unionised or not.  Is it possible to believe, given the resources, that these regulations can be enforced and will be enforced?</P>
    <P>In regard to the constitutional right to join a union, there is a major retail chain which has expanded rapidly in this country and which the General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has accused of requiring all of its employees to sign a commitment not to join a union.  Has anything been done about drawing the law of the land, and <Col N="335" /> indeed the Constitution of the land, to the attention of the people who run that business?  The critical question for the Minister is: how will these laws be enforced for a vulnerable, less organised and frequently mobile part-time workforce? Would all these people have to take action through the civil courts?  They are people who are badly paid, very often in vulnerable positions, in low skill work and, therefore, in many cases poorly educated. Unless there is some workable method of enforcement, the classic one would be through a trade union, but, short of that, does the Minister have any ideas as to how these laws can be made to stick in the area of work where they are most needed, where there is a threatening employer and a vulnerable employee?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be brief.  I want to use the opportunity to welcome the Minister and to say that every time he is present here we know he is coming with what is progressive policy. I would also like to mention, before Senator Ryan leaves, that I would have preferred him to say &ldquo;our union&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;my union&rdquo; because Senator McKenna and myself also happen to be members of the Teachers' Union of Ireland.  It is quite right to mention the fact that the TUI have recently taken on board part-time teachers on a full-time basis as members of that union.  It is also quite right to mention the new deal that part-time teachers in the educational sector have obtained through the Department of Education.  We have seen real and meaningful progress with regard to part-time teachers.  I remember teachers who, for seven years, had 21 hours a week during the school term and then, when it came to holidays, they were back on the dole again.  Thankfully, that has been redressed, and not before its time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention has been made that this is the year of Mná na hÉireann.  In that regard, we can refer back to having elected a lady President.  Since this Bill has been introduced to protect part-time workers in the labour market, I would like to <Col N="336" /> use the opportunity to congratulate the Minister for having the foresight to bring this Bill forward and also to stress its importance as a piece of social legislation which mainly affects women.  In his speech today the Minister told us: &ldquo;The classic part-time worker is female, age 25 to 44, married with dependent children, and nearly all of those are employed in the services sector.&rdquo;  Basically, therefore, this piece of social legislation can be claimed as another blow on behalf of Mná na hÉireann, and the Minister is to be congratulated for that.</P>
    <P>We are all very much aware of the cleaning jobs, factory jobs, supermarket jobs, part-time jobs all over this country where employers with mainly women on their books do not allow them to work over 18 hours a week, because to do so would give them certain rights within law. In many cases these workers have had to put up with discrimination from employers out of dire necessity.  On the one hand, there are women who have children, homes to run, bills to meet, shopping to do and clothes to buy.  More importantly, on the other hand, is the fact that many of these women gain self-esteem from the fact that they have part-time employment.  They are proud of the fact that they are contributing in some way to their own home, even though in some instances the pay may be meagre.</P>
    <P>At the moment it is generally accepted that most of these people would work more than eight hours per week.  While the Bill will not help their rate of pay or the nature of their work, it does extend a protection to all of them who work more than eight hours per week.  I would like to ask the Minister, when he is replying to Second Stage, in respect of people working part-time on a consistent basis in excess of eight hours per week, is there anything in the Bill that will bar an employer, where he has somebody working 12 hours a week, taking in extra people and breaking down the number of hours that these people will work in order to keep them below the eight hour threshold? Is there any meaningful way of ensuring that unscrupulous employers do not operate on that basis?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> This is the first time that part-time workers will be included in the operation of the redundancy scheme, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, the Worker Participation Act, the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Protection of Employees Act and the Insolvency Act. They will now also be included in the operation of the Holidays Act giving them a <i>pro rata</i> entitlement.  All of this is excellent and very welcome.</P>
    <P>It must be accepted by all Members on all sides of the House that this Bill is a marvellous and heartening improvement on what went before.  In future, as a result of this Bill, we will cease to see these workers as victims &mdash; for instance, being punished because they had children. They will now be workers in the same way as full-time workers operating in a regulated and honourable way.  Some employers will find fault and make all sorts of excuses as to how this legislation will adversely affect them.  I am happy that the Minister in framing the legislation took into account not alone the legitimate claims of part-time workers but also the needs of employers for flexibility. Why would employers be afraid of this type of legislation?  Employers spend a lot of money on advertising and on selling themselves by means of public relations exercises.  Surely the best public relations exercise of all would be to treat their employees, be they full-time or part-time, in a fair and progressive manner.  I hope that with the advent of this Bill we will have a positive approach from such employers.</P>
    <P>The dramatic increase in part-time work required new responses.  We have only to look at the increase between 1977 and 1988 when that growth went from 39,000 to 72,000.  This represents 7.8 per cent of all employees.  The statutory protection for part-time work has not had an adverse effect in the general labour market in Europe.  The surest way to secure social change is through legislation. When a person has rights and stands in a court then that person has something that cannot be taken away.  In framing this Bill, therefore, the Minister <Col N="338" /> has given part-time workers something that can never be taken from them.</P>
    <P>The Bill touches on the liberation of women.  It has the effect of including the excluded.  It moves people towards mutual respect and tolerance.  As law, it cannot be ignored or denied.  Listening to Senator Ryan denying his Fianna Fáil background, it occurred to me as a member of Fianna Fáil that if the other parties, particularly the parties of the Left, had introduced this Bill, what kudos would they be taking for doing so.  I make the point here today &mdash; and I think it is worth making &mdash; that Fianna Fáil since they came into Government in 1987 have introduced very progressive social legislation and will continue to do it.  But the extraordinary thing is that, as a party, we do not really claim any credit for it; we just get on with the work.  The Minister for Labour must be congratulated for the quiet way with which he has gone about his business in this area.  It just comes naturally to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased the Minister is having a look at legislation to cover contract work, because contract work is becoming a major source of employment in various industries.  Senator Ryan mentioned the chemical industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>My apologies.  Contract work is also a feature of the electronics industry and for that reason it is important that we would have legislation to cater for this section of the market.  I would also like to mention the catering industry, because at times I have lectured to students in that industry.  I have heard of experiences where these students have been exploited when undertaking a CERT course.  They have been exploited when sent out to certain hotels.  I suppose that is inevitable.  We would need to have tighter control and a better feedback from some of these students who are sent out on a short term basis, be it for the summer or over any other training period, to find out how these young <Col N="339" /> students were treated, how they were paid and to make absolutely certain that they were not exploited.</P>
      <P>My final point will be to ask the Minister about the mechanism for making a complaint.  These are low skill jobs and many of the persons involved may not be educationally well endowed.  It raises the question that, if a trade union does not exist, does the Minister have in mind any particular mechanism by which these people could lodge complaints against unscrupulous employers?  That being said, I welcome the Bill and I am very pleased that all sides of the House have seen fit to be supportive of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly welcome the Bill on behalf of the Labour Party.  It is a great advance in social legislation and it comes to the aid of a very substantial number of part-time workers.  It represents great progress, particularly in regard to the present threshold of the 18 hours, which has been the subject of a lot of abuse.  This Bill will put many things right.</P>
      <P>However, I do not underestimate the ingenuity of a minority of employers in sidestepping their responsibilities under this legislation.  I would be very disappointed if a minority group of employers, through their legal advisers, were to look for loopholes, particularly where the continuous service requirement might present them with the best opportunity &mdash; for example, having contracts drawn up that would expire before the 13 week period.  If this were to happen to any great extent, there is the possibility of our having to face up to the fixed contract concept creeping in.  That is not to suggest that the fixed contract concept must never be accepted, but individual employers should not have the opportunity of resorting to the fixed contract concept in isolation to get out of their obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see the fixed contract in a broader context from the 13 week period; I see it in the European context.  If there is a problem about fixed contracts it should be put before both Houses of the <Col N="340" /> Oireachtas where we would have an opportunity of discussing it and dealing with it before any abuses would get too far out of hand.  I fear there will be many of the worst type of employer who will use the fixed contract concept to cut people out before the 13 week period has ended.</P>
    <P>The question of the fixed contract has many ramifications.  If we ever want to get round to that in the European sense, then it would need considerable discussion. For that reason I am a little scared about the ingenuity of some of these people.  I know things have improved.  It is a long time since I was an official of the union working with employers, but we did run up against this on quite a number of occasions.  If we did not encounter this kind of thing there would not be a need for this law.  It is reasonable to suggest that there will be a certain amount of ingenuity and that people will try to get around the law by way of their legal advice.</P>
    <P>We have to accept that part-time work is here to stay and is playing a very large part in the total labour force not only in Ireland but throughout Europe.  Consequently, it is very encouraging to see that the Minister has seen that it is vital to bring in this type of comprehensive legislation. However, I must express some concern at the fact that part-time work is going to increase.  There are good arguments to suggest that this increase results from the need for more flexibility, new consumer demands, changes in manufacturing industry, the moving of part-time workers into services, young mothers requiring some time at home with their children, early retired people who need to pick up the extra money and so on.</P>
    <P>Having expressed an understanding of some of the reasons for the growth of part-time work, I have to register my concern about its growth in the sense that it makes us complacent and we tend to accept it as a compensating factor, for the lack of full-time job creation.  I know that is not at the back of the Minister's mind because he made a commitment to full-time job creation under the national <Col N="341" /> programme but it is of serious concern. There are 221,000 people on the live register which accounts for more than one in six of the total labour force.  The character of unemployment has changed regarding the length of time unemployed people are likely to remain on the live register; 100,000 persons have been continuously unemployed for a year or more. Approximately 45 per cent of all unemployed persons have been on the live register for over a year and of that 45 per cent 46,000 have been out of work for a continuous period of over three years.  It is always necessary to make the observation when we are talking about part-time work that it is not a balancing factor to complement any job-creating task we might undertake.</P>
    <P>While we can part ourselves on the back and praise the Minister &mdash; and quite rightly so &mdash; for bringing in this legislation to remedy the ills of the part-time workforce, it is sad we do not appear to be able to do anything about creating full-time employment to a greater extent than we have been doing over the years.  I have yet to be convinced that jobs will be created in sufficient numbers in the next few years to make any marked impact on the unemployment situation.  The employers can hardly cite trade union activity or wage increases as a reason why industry is not competitive and why markets fail to attract orders, etc.  These are my concerns when we are talking about the employment situation and it would be remiss of me if I did not draw attention to that aspect of employment in the course of my contribution.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Bill, I know the Minister received some observations from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and I do not know exactly what answers he gave to them.  There is concern that while the reduction of the weekly threshold from 18 hours to eight hours represents a substantial improvement in the conditions of employment for people who currently work more than eight hours a week, I am worried that discrimination may arise under this section.  The eight hours threshold leaves the legislation open to challenge in the European Court of Justice <Col N="342" /> on the grounds that it indirectly discriminates against women workers because many of them do not work eight hours a week.  Secondly, the threshold could give rise to serious abuse by employers who would reduce the normal hours of part-time workers below the eight hour threshold.  It is therefore a twofold matter.</P>
    <P>The question of discrimination arises because the eight hour requirement would exclude many women workers, who constitute 75 per cent of the part-time workforce.  There is a risk involved of doing something that would eventually constitute indirect discrimination.  There is nothing in the Bill to indicate that the eight hour requirement can be justified on objective economic grounds.  The eight hour threshold may, therefore, be contrary to the EC Directive on Equal Treatment, 76/207 EEC, which applies to legislative requirements as well as employment contracts and collective agreements.  The trade union movement considers that this matter should be addressed in the legislation and recommends the inclusion of a section that would give a general commitment to the principle of equal treatment for part-time workers.  I am sure the Minister has such a section in mind.</P>
    <P>The eight hour threshold gives rise to real concern that employers will reduce their working hours to deliberately exclude workers from the protection of the Bill.  I mentioned that in a broad way in my opening remarks.  In the past the Labour Court has expressed concern in cases where there was evidence of specific employment policies designed to restrict part-time workers so that they worked for periods below the statutory threshold. Unless this issue is dealt with in the legislation many part-time workers could find themselves worse off following the introduction of this legislation.  That is not what the Minister intended and I hope that when he is replying on Second Stage he will be able to reassure us on that and that we will have it on the record.  There is a feeling that part-time workers working hours and, consequently, their pay could be reduced.  They may not have sufficient <Col N="343" /> power of redress or protection under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Congress suggested to the Minister that he insert a new section in the Bill which would place an onus on employers who reduce working hours below the eight hour threshold or pursue a deliberate policy of only employing part-time workers for less than eight hours a week to prove that the shorter working hours can be justified on grounds other than the minimum statutory threshold.  Disputes concerning this matter should be dealt with by the employer tribunal.  It is very likely that the Minister has been notified of this by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I do not know what reply he made nor can I get any accurate information on how the Minister reacted to that even though I made inquiries this morning.  Perhaps when he is replying on Second Stage he will put the Senators' minds at ease.</P>
    <P>In relation to the definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; and &ldquo;employee&rdquo;, it is essential that the Bill contain a broad definition which would incorporate the atypical employment relationships which affect many part-time workers.  By restricting the definition to one that is covered by the existing legislation which specifically excludes part-time workers, this Bill fails to recognise two of the most important features of part-time employment which are contract work and agency work.  I understand that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions sought to have the Bill amended so that it would incorporate its own definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; and &ldquo;employee&rdquo; as distinct from other Bills. They felt an amendment to that effect would deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>Section 2 relates to the question of continuous service.  The 13 weeks continuous service is to be calculated in accordance with the definition set down in Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973.  This section also provides that this 13 week period will count towards the longer service qualifications required under the Unfair Dismissals Act and under the Redundancy Payments Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> The definition of continuity of service laid down in the First Schedule of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, does not take account of the insecure nature of part-time employment. The trade union movement agrees that the definition contained in the Redundancy Payment Act is more appropriate and should be adopted in this Bill.  They believe that this would provide that employment could be taken to be continuous if an employee is dismissed before attaining the qualifying period of service, in this case 13 weeks, but resumes employment with the same employer within 26 weeks.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement believes that section 3 extends specific benefits to regular part-time workers.  Congress are seeking clarification on two points relating to this section.  Does the exemption of employers from the making of regular contributions to a redundancy fund on behalf of regular part-time workers interfere with these workers' statutory entitlements under the Redundancy Acts? Secondly, in the event of protective legislation being introduced, it should be confirmed that the benefits of such legislation would also be extended to regular part-time workers.  I will leave that with the Minister.</P>
    <P>The section extends the provision of the Holiday (Employees) Act, 1973, on a modified basis to regular part-time workers. The Bill states that the regular part-time worker will earn six hours leave per 100 hours work and proportionately less where fewer hours are worked.  Entitlement to public holidays will be on the same basis as for full-time employees.</P>
    <P>These provisions give part-time workers practically the same annual leave entitlement as full-time workers.  The entitlement is set at the lowest level which does not reflect the substantial gains made through national and local collective agreements since the enactment of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973.  In the context of the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to review the operation of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, the leave entitlement of regular part-time <Col N="345" /> workers should be brought into line with current practice.  This is something the Minister will have dealt with and we would like to hear about this in his reply.</P>
    <P>It is not clear why sections 5 and 6 refer to disputes relating to continuity of service.  There is a belief that this section should clearly state that regular part-time workers would have the same access as full-time workers to the Rights Commission and to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  In relation to their entitlement under the relevant legislation, it seems that it confines itself strictly to the question of the continuity of service. We know that an appeal can be made to the High Court on a point of law only.</P>
    <P>These are my observations on the Bill which is a good day's work, although it took more than a day's work to produce it.  The Minister has lived up to the promise he made in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  I have no doubt that despite our observations, the Minister has gone as far as he could on the advice available to him.  There are some things which give rise for concern and we recognise that the Bill cannot be considered in isolation from developments at Community level.  The Minister is being very progressive in the area of industrial legislation and in other areas of social advancement, etc.  We appreciate the Bill <i>in toto</i> but we would be glad if the Minister could allay some of the concerns we expressed and put replies on the record. This would be very useful to us when dealing with people who want to know what the Minister meant by this, that and the other in the Bill.  I have been trying unsuccessfully to talk to someone about the aspects I have raised here.  Perhaps the Minister could save me a lot of running around.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider this a very important Bill. As somebody who has effectively acted as an employer for a long time, I feel that rather than acting as a disincentive to employers, this Bill will allow for greater <Col N="346" /> flexibility and will encourage further co-operation between employers and employees.  I have always opposed the drawing of arbitrary lines which tend to distort the natural course of events.  As our country and society develops I think we are going to find many varying patterns in employment.  We have noted already that, at present, a large number of women make up the part-time labour force.  This is not surprising and it is not all due to necessity.  My experience is that many women nowadays choose to take part-time employment that allows them to be both homemakers and part of the workforce.  I remember an employee, whom I value very much, who started a family.  In that situation we were able to draw up an arrangement which suited both the employer and the employee and met the requirements of both in a very positive way.  I see this type of development occuring more and more in industry. However, it would be a disincentive to this type of arrangement if basic entitlements which the employee would have enjoyed as a fulltime employee would be lost in becoming a part-time employee.  Therefore, this Bill has to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The cost to employers of implementing this legislation will not be very great.  As an employer with very limited resources, I have always operated the Holidays Act in line with what has been proposed here. We have always given our regular part-time or temporary employees holidays in proportion to the amount of hours worked in any year.  We did not find that this cost very much.  We found that the goodwill generated more than compensated for any minimal costs incurred. Generally, employees' performance improved once they believed that the employer was not trying to operate regulations to their disadvantage.  On the other hand, I have seen considerable resentment build up in other employments where employees were kept marginally under the rate that would entitle them to holidays.  These employees were working year in, year out, for the same employer and were kept under the threshold that exempted the employer from <Col N="347" /> having to give paid leave.  Those employers were the losers because in losing the goodwill of the employees over a very small amount of money, they lost production and work output they would otherwise have got.</P>
    <P>I do not see this Bill as being aimed at the average employer who in respect of many of the provisions of the Bill has been acting properly, particularly with regard to holidays but at those employers who are purposely exploiting the existing legislation to take rights away from people.  Similarly, for employees who have long term relationships of employment with one employer, I welcome the extension of the Redundancy Act to these people.</P>
    <P>The statutory provisions of the Redundancy Act are minimal.  What is involved is a half week's wages for those under 41 years of age, one week's wages for those over 41 and one week's wages on top of that.  Even for a full-time employee made redundant after many years, the cost of the Redundancy Payments Act when taking the rebate into account is not great.  We hope that redundancy is not occuring in most employments every day of the week.  The extension of this safety net for workers to part-time employees is not a burden of any great significance on employers and gives some compensation for loss of employment to people who have been working over a long period of time.  The Redundancy Payments Act only applies to employees who have been working for more than two years.  I also welcome the protection of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act because I cannot see the difference between somebody working 20 hours a week continuously and somebody working 40 hours a week continuously.  It is a false distinction.</P>
    <P>The provision regarding the maternity protection of employees is very reasonable because somebody working continuously on a long term part-time basis should be entitled to that type of maternity leave.  The Minister mentioned in his speech that the social welfare legislation to come before us next week will <Col N="348" /> improve the social welfare provisions for part-time employment.  That was another anomaly that needed to be addressed. The protection of workers is very important. The elimination of possible problems for 91 per cent of part-time employees is a fantastic step forward.  It will force recalcitrant employers into line on some very basic worker rights.  It will not cause any problems for employers who are concerned about their employees and who believe that employer-employee relationships and profitability are best achieved in a spirit of co-operation rather than in the adversarial type pattern which some people think is the best type of industrial relations.  I have always found that where the basic rights of workers are protected and where there is a happy workforce, if sacrifices are needed and if workers are asked to do things over and above their obligations that they are more than willing to do so; they do not see work as a &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; situation but as a partnership in which everybody shares the fruits and has their basic rights protected.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill as a very important part of social legislation.  It is a Bill for the future because, as our economy develops, there will be a huge increase in the number of people who will re-enter the workforce on a part-time basis and in the number of people who now work on a full-time basis and who would opt to continue working part-time.  It will allow for greater flexibility and adaptability between employers and employees to suit the working week, day and year to the requirements of each.  In that flexibility I foresee better employment opportunities for employees and, in turn, the employers will be able to make more flexible arrangements with the employees to suit their requirements.</P>

      <P>I accept that the function of the Opposition is to deal with inadequacies in legislation; rarely is it their function to bestow outstanding compliments on the Minister.  There is a general acceptance for this Bill which is recognised as being progressive and which is being brought in by a Minister who is regarded as progressive.  I do not quibble with either of these assessments.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill which will extend the protection enjoyed by full time workers to a number of part-time workers.  A number of interesting figures have been mentioned in the course of the debate. The Minister mentioned them in his speech and they highlight the growth in part-time work over the period 1975-89. While they highlight the growth, they also show that there has been a change in the type of work available to part-time workers.  There has been a substantial decline in part-time work available in agriculture, forestry and fishing.  The Minister pointed out that the drop in that sector over the 14 or 15 year period has been from one in three to one in seven. That has been offset by a growth in part-time work in the services industry.</P>
      <P>I was impressed recently by an article by Patricia O'Donovan, Assistant General Secretary of the ICTU, which appeared in the July issue of a magazine called <i>Newsline</i> and I will quote briefly from it because it has a relationship with the issue we are dealing with this evening.  It states:</P>
      <P>...Women and young people predominate among low paid workers.  The results show that nearly half of our women workers, that is, 140,000 out of 300,000, are in low paid work.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to introduce legislation to &mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) protect consumers from food poisoning, the improper use of additives, the dangers arising from the contamination of food with hormones, pesticides-herbicides and the illegal use of chemicals such as beta agonists or angel dust in animal production; and</P>
      <P>(2) ensure that foods and food products are adequately labelled so that consumers can be aware of the nutrients-additives contained therein and whether or not the foods have been subjected to ionising radiation.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming in to listen to the debate this evening and I congratulate him, somewhat belatedly, on his elevation to the position of Minister of State.  At this stage I am sure he is well consolidated in his new post.  He is a political neighbour of mine to the extent that he works in the constituency adjacent to the one I have been in for the last number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two reasons the Labour Party put down this motion.  We are concerned about the health aspect of the <Col N="351" /> foods which our people consume and we are concerned about the degree to which the consumer gets value for money when he or she purchases food.  Another reason why we introduced this motion is that we are very anxious that the image of Irish foods on the European markets as wholesome, pure, healthy and green should be protected.  We should make every effort to ensure that European consumers have no reason to doubt that image.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that there does not appear to be any opposition to the motion.  It seems as if it is acceptable to all.  That is very encouraging.  It does not come as any great surprise because it is fair to say that the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, is on record as saying that many of the food laws date from Victorian times and need to be simplified and, presumably, updated.</P>
    <P>There are many anomalies in food legislation at present.  For example, health boards, State Departments and institutions such as prisons, are exempt from food hygiene regulations.  They are not obliged to comply with the food hygiene regulations.  Anybody is entitled to start up, own and run a business dealing with the manufacture, production and distribution of food without the slightest training in food hygiene, food science or anything else.  There is nothing to stop them doing that.  There are further anomalies and difficulties in the law.  In many cases, people found to be distributing and producing food using unhygienic practices can continue to do so by the use of the appeals system.  I know the appeals system is important and fundamental in law but, at the same time, it creates difficulties in such cases.</P>
    <P>There are a number of specific areas in relation to food production that concern me.  The first is the problem of food poisoning. Food poisoning is a continuing problem in this and in many other countries as well.  It is fair to say that the number of days lost through illness arising from food poisoning in the workforce is considerably greater than the number of days which are lost due to strikes.  United Kingdom data would indicate that is <Col N="352" /> clearly the case.  There might be three to four times as many days lost due to illness arising from food poisoning as there are arising from industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>Food poisoning and its impact on industry, to take one aspect of it, receives much less attention than industrial relations.  That in many ways is a strange commentary on our perspective of these matters.  Usually what happens when there is an outbreak of food poisoning is that we have banner headlines, a great deal of commotion, people become very hot and bothered about it and generally it receives a lot of attention.  Then it all fizzles away and is forgotten about until some time later when there is another food poisoning scare and the process is repeated.</P>
    <P>The extent of the problem can be gauged from the fact that in August 1990 it was estimated that 1,000 cases of salmonella food poisoning occurred in this country, not to mention all the other different types of food poisoning that also occur.  There are many reasons for that, for example, ignorance of the correct temperature of fridges and the need to keep them below certain basic temperatures so as to ensure that these pathogenic organisms do not spread.  There are the risks of food poisoning posed by self-service salad bars and so on.  In many cases, one could say that this is a form of self-service salmonella.  These outlets can pose great hazards for the consumer. They do not have established codes of practice; for example, there is nothing to stop somebody going in in overalls and purchasing food from a food salad bar. There is nothing to stop somebody coughing and sneezing on top of the food in these salad bars.  There is nothing to stop people picking up food with their hands. I do not think in most cases there is anybody monitoring how such places operate.</P>
    <P>Cooked chilled products are a source of great worry.  There are no clear guidelines laid down as to how they are to be prepared and reheated.  There is no timespan to indicate their shelf life. There is no obligation on the people who produce these items to adhere to any <Col N="353" /> standards.  Anybody can go into this business if they have the necessary financial resources.  There is no obligation on them to have any expertise or knowledge of food hygiene or food science.</P>
    <P>Part of the solution to this problem would be increased consumer education on the maintenance, storage and utilisation of these products and on the principles of food hygiene and so on.  I accept there was the &ldquo;Clean Watch&rdquo; campaign. I welcome it as a step in the right direction but I do not think that it had much impact.  The incidence of food poisoning last summer speaks loud and clear about its ineffectiveness.  There is need for better manufacturing and distribution practices and better reporting of the outbreaks of food poisoning.  This is an area which is within the Minister's terms of reference.  I accept that, to some extent, what we are talking about is the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  As regards the reporting of food poisoning, I would be pleased if the Minister would consider what could be done in the area so as to improve the effectiveness of reporting such cases.</P>
    <P>If anybody doubts that we do not have considerable cause for concern in relation to the standard of food produced in this country, they have only to read a document such as the annual report of the Dublin region public analyst in 1988 where there is some valuable information. For example, two samples of a food product contained faecal pellets of a mouse, another contained the hairs of a mouse, a sample of chicken stew contained 13 dead spiders, a swiss roll contained a carries human molar tooth, gur cake contained rat hairs.  The list goes on and on &mdash; one dead crane fly in a carton of pickled onions and one dead rovebeetle in a can of orange.  For those who like live insects in their food, there was brown rice which contained 15 live rice weevils and lasagne had numerous dead moth larvae.  Bread contained the head and thorax of an insect which raises the question, where was the rest of that insect?  The report does not tell us.  That is a sample of the data available to anybody <Col N="354" /> who wants to read these published documents.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken at some length about pesticide residues.  There is no published data on the levels of pesticide residues in Irish food.  I know the Department of Agriculture have the data but they do not publish it.  There is no data on the intake of pesticides by the public or by groups considered to be particularly at risk, for example, women during pregnancy, lactating mothers, the young, or those who have special medical disorders which might be exacerbated by exposure to these products.</P>
    <P>There is of the order of 1,000 pesticide products on sale here and the regulations do not preclude their improper use.  They can be used at levels greater than those recommended by the manufacturers. There is no obligation on the users of these products to familiarise themselves with what is on the lable or, for that matter, to understand what is on the label prior to use or even to read the label prior to use.  Legislation should be introduced which would oblige people who use these products to use them in a manner consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations. People who use these products should be properly trained in their use so as to protect themselves and the public.  The use of these products should be more closely monitored.</P>
    <P>There are constant scares about chemicals in food.  Some of them are misleading and misplaced but, at the same time, the consumer has reason to be worried. There was the cling film scare last year.  There is the ongoing scare about food irradiation and its effect on food. For instance, 15 per cent of consumers say they would not use irradiated food, yet nobody knows for certain whether irradiated food is on the Irish market. Certainly there is no food that I am aware of on the Irish market that is labelled as being irradiated but, of course, that is not to say it has not been irradiated.  There is good reason to believe that some spices which make their way onto the Irish food market have been irradiated although I am not in a position to confirm that is the case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> The manner in which food is labelled can be misleading.  Claims have been made that certain foods improve fitness and energy and there does not seem to be any legal restriction on the use of such terms.  Scientific terms are used in such a way as to create a buzz and a notion that foods which are associated with them have some beneficial value.  Terms like &ldquo;isotonic&rdquo; are used to create an impression that products have characteristics and capacities which there is no basis for believing they have.  What, for example, is meant by &ldquo;fresh&rdquo;?  What does &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; mean when it is used in terms of food?  What does &ldquo;homemade&rdquo; mean when it is used in terms of food?  For example, when one buys &ldquo;homemade&rdquo; soup, does that mean the soup was made in the home of the outlet?  In other words, a packet of soup was mixed on the premises, or does it mean that fresh raw materials were used and it was made <i>de novo</i> on the premises?  The consumer is being ripped off.  When does a fresh product cease to be fresh?  When does it move into the intermediate phase of being neither fresh nor stale?  When does it become stale, spoiled and unacceptable?</P>
    <P>It is good practice to read the labels of some of these products and the blurb on them.  For example, there are ice-creams described as liqueur ice-creams but in the list of ingredients any reference to liqueurs is conspicuous by its absence. There are terms such as &ldquo;permitted preservatives&rdquo;. What does that mean? Somebody who is allergic to some &ldquo;permitted preservatives&rdquo; will not know which ones are contained in the product. What does &ldquo;organic&rdquo; mean?  The Department of Agriculture and Food have set up an organic food section.  What is organic food and when does food cease to be organic?  What are health foods?  The use of these terms has a certain value.  The consumer is purchasing something over which there is no control.  These products are sold by those who are into ripping consumers off.  That is not to suggest that all people who use those terms are ripping off consumers.  It is important that clear definitions be drawn up so that the public <Col N="356" /> know what these terms mean and get what they think they are getting.</P>
    <P>Restaurants should be forced to disclose the contents of their dishes and the origin of the ingredients.  That is important in relation to cooked chilled products and so on.  There is the question of the nutritional value of foods and its impact on the chronic diseases of western society.  Many foods are badly labelled. The consumer has little understanding of what is contained in them or of their fat content.</P>
    <P>Legislation is urgently needed to cater for the changes in food production, processing and distribution which have taken place and will continue to take place in the years ahead.  Four or five basic points should be considered.  Food manufacturing outlets and distribution centres should be licensed so that they can meet certain basic standards in relation to equipment, hygiene standards and so on. Certain basic levels of education and training should be provided and should be essential for all people who work in the food industry.  Food production units of any reasonable size should be obliged to employ qualified food scientists to ensure that basic standards are met and maintained.</P>
    <P>There is a need to update the labelling regulations so that the public know what they are purchasing and, if they purchase fresh produce, that it conforms to certain standards.  The terms &ldquo;fresh&rdquo;, &ldquo;homemade&rdquo;, &ldquo;health foods&rdquo;, &ldquo;organic foods&rdquo; and so on, should be clearly defined. Codes of practice should be established in relation to the food industry.  They should be implemented and have the force of law.  Regulations should be made in relation to minimal micro-biological standards in foods.  Provision should be made for the sale of food which is fit for human consumption and the notion of &ldquo;food which is fit for human consumption&rdquo; should be defined.</P>
    <P>Food producers and distributors should take all reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of food during its production.  Diligence should be exercised by food producers and distributors <Col N="357" /> during the production and distribution of food.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be able to pronounce some of the names the Senator referred to.  What Senator Upton said makes us think.  British surveys have revealed that restaurant menus contain misinformation and misleading statements about the freshness of food. Senator Upton mentioned that fresh fruit juice was likely to come from a can and homemade soup was likely to be made from processed ingredients.  Surveys have been carried out in Ireland so we do not know the position here.  The public are entitled to know exactly what the ingredients are and what is contained in food served in restaurants and the origin of the ingredients.</P>
      <P>The food industry is given a <i>carte blanche</i> to exploit the public through the use of terms such as &ldquo;fresh&rdquo;, &ldquo;homemade&rdquo;, &ldquo;organic&rdquo; and &ldquo;health&rdquo; in relation to food without any obligation to ensure that food so described conforms to any standard whatsoever.  These terms are used widely in the catering industry. There is no reason to believe that these terms are anything more than an advertising blurb.</P>
      <P>Outbreaks of food poisoning are a regular occurrence and represent more days lost at work each year than do strikes. Despite this, there is no legislation establishing codes of practice for the hygienic production, distribution and sale of food. Anyone can own and run a food business without the slightest training, education or understanding of the most basic principles of hygiene.  In the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 17 March Dr. Tom Barragry, Professor with the Veterinary Pharmacology, Drugs and Residues Faculty at UCD stated:</P>
      <P>...only this month there had been a case of alleged food poisoning reported from the Clermont Ferrand region of France where 22 people became infected after eating liver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This followed another outbreak in Spain last year where 135 people <Col N="358" /> became ill after eating meat contaminated by &ldquo;angel dust&rdquo; or clenbuterol. A report on this incident in the medical journal, <i>The Lancet</i>, before Christmas, was the first authoritive report on the subject.</P>
    <P>The facts relating to the outbreak were compiled by a scientist at Madrid's National Epidemiology Centre, which blames &ldquo;angel dust&rdquo; for the poisoning of the people in two major and six minor outbreaks between March and July.</P>
    <P>The common factor was the eating of cooked liver.  No deaths were reported.</P>
    <P>Dr. Barragry gave credit to the Department of Agriculture for the legislation banning angel dust but added that the earlier banning of hormone implants throughout Europe had indirectly opened the door for the illegal use of angel dust.</P>
    <P>One can go into any health food shop and the attendants will inform one of such-and-such a product and what it is good for.  They will even go so far as to ask if one has high blood pressure.  They are not qualified and are chancing their arm.  I have nothing against health food shops.  If people think the food from health food shops is good for them, they would be better off eating what Senator Upton described.  Food outlets need to be monitored.  Legislation is to be introduced in England whereby there will be a system of temperature controls in food chains in order to minimise the opportunities for growth of pathogenic microorganisms such as listeria and salmonella.</P>
    <P>The whole food industry needs to be watched.  The fact that much technology has been introduced into the industry does not defend the public or the consumer from mishaps in processing because it is outside the marketing area that a lot of the problems begin and much of the sales talk takes off.  In conversation with Senator Upton, he told me that the whole question of food legislation sickened him.  It seems to be in urgent need of modification, particularly to protect people from cowboys in the food and <Col N="359" /> catering industry and their unhygienic practices and the misleading terms they use to describe their products.  I do not know enough about the subject to go into any greater detail.</P>
    <P>I am fully in support of Senator Upton's motion and I am satisfied that the consumer in many cases, whether it be in this or any other case, is the one vulnerable person that needs all the protection he can get.  Things are so high-flying that people who are out there looking for markets lose all sense of proportion, they go beserk looking for markets.  Sometimes it is not their fault; they are being driven that hard and the pressure is on them because the competition that we all adore and believe in. We have to be very careful about people's health.  As Senator Upton said, the abuses are very substantial.  We appeal to the Minister to ensure that the public know the ingredients and their origins, and that outlets are using the correct titles for the products they are selling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody could disagree awith this motion which states:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to introduce legislation to &mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) protect consumers from food poisoning, the improper use of additives, the dangers arising from the contamination of food with hormones, pesticides/herbicides and the illegal use of chemicals such as beta agonists or angel dust in animal products; and</P>
      <P>(2) ensure that foods and food products are adequately labelled so that consumers can be aware of the nutrients/additives contained therein and whether or not the foods have been subjected to ionising radiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very sensible motion because we are all anxious that the food we eat is good and that it is free of all those additives and so on.  The Government are committed to ensuring that the food <Col N="360" /> industry achieves its potential and towards this end it is essential that the wholesomeness and safety of our food supply is guaranteed, and this includes any food consumed in Ireland, whatever its source.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for high standards of food hygiene and, indeed, a need to raise the level of public awareness of food hygiene and thereby improve the standards of food hygiene nationwide.  In recent years we have seen greater use of additives in food.  Those additives help to prolong the life of food but in my opinion they reduce the quality of the food and should be used sparingly.  We have the reputation of producing good food and it would be a pity to tarnish that image by the use of additives.  In the short term, we might indeed gain but in the long term it is far better to preserve our image as the producers of good, wholesome food. It is important at all times to ensure that food and food porducts are adequately labelled so that consumers can be aware of the nutrients/additives contained in food and whether or not foods have been subject to ionising radiation.  Indeed, this proposal is contained in the second part of the motion before us.  Consumers should know exactly what they are buying and the legislation should be in place to compel manufacturers and those packing food to display on the labels the nutritients and additives in that food.  As part of the process of raising standards of food hygiene, the Minister for Health made new regulations in 1989 amending the food hygiene regulations 1950 to 1971. Under these regulations stricter controls are being exercised over the operation of mobile fast-food vans, ice cream vans and food stalls, such as travelling shops which sell meat or meat products.</P>
    <P>The major asset of the new controls is an annual licensing requirement for these type of food stalls.  Improved standards will be required of food vehicles used in the transport and delivery of food.  As regards the use of hormones or angel dust in cattle production this, of course, is illegal and anybody caught using growth promoters should be prosecuted and, <Col N="361" /> indeed, they are being prosecuted.  If consumers in Germany, Holland or France do not want hormone-treated beef then we should not produce it.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food has already given an assurance to this House that those engaging in this kind of irresponsible action will be brought to book and we are all in full-support of the Minister and the sentiments he has expressed.</P>
    <P>Our beef industry is too important <i>visá-vis</i> our national economy to allow any group or individuals to damage it and indeed no effort should be spared by the Department of Agriculture and Food to ban the use of angle dust and hormones and have those who are using it severely dealt with.  I hope the Minister and the Department will make use of the legislation that is there to see that those people are dealt with.  I am not aware of how widespread this practice is but the situation should be monitored carefully and spot tests should be made to ascertain how widespread this practice is.  This could be very effective if Department officials were allowed to do spot tests on herds throughout the country.  It would be a deterrent to stop those people from using angel dust.  As I said, I am not sure how widespread it is but if one believes the rumours, and that is all we have to go on, it is fairly widespread and it should be curtailed.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton made a very strong case for the banning of pesticides and for the proper labelling of food and so on.  This is also very important because it is only right that people should know what is in those foods.  We see more and more coming on to supermarket shelves, powdered soup, powdered this and powdered that, and nobody seems to know what is in them, or how long they are there or what the life of those products is.  It is important that consumers should know that.</P>
    <P>I add my support to this motion and ask that the necessary legislation be brought in to cover these points.  I am not sure whether it is necessary to introduce new legislation because there is a volume of legislation there already on the Statute Book to take care of this, but I am afraid <Col N="362" /> a lot of it is not being put into effect.  We have many regulations from the EC going back a number of years.  Those regulations could be brought into force to ensure that food is presented properly and that the risk of food poisoning, salmonella and all the other dangers are eliminated.  For that reason I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I too, would like to support this motion but I would qualify it by saying that there is an implication in this motion that meat that has been touched by hormones is dangerous.  I will deal with that at a later stage.  The late President John F. Kennedy once said the consumer has three rights; the right to be safe, the right to be informed and the right to choose.  I do not think we could disagree with that.  Certainly the right to be safe is a basic right but in order to be safe one has to be informed as well and if you look at the perception among consumers today &mdash; I know this from facts I got from my colleagues in the Faculty of Food Science &mdash; it is that 90 per cent of the problems are caused by chemicals.</P>
      <P>However, the reality is entirely different. Over 90 per cent of food poisoning problems are caused by biological problems and of the biological problems about 90 per cent are caused by salmonella poisoning. This is where the lack of information comes in.  We have seen in our lifetime a change from housewives going out and buying the food each day, having no fridge in the home, and suddenly along comes supermarkets stocking cold food, frozen food and so on and, in the homes there are microwave ovens, rôtisseries for cooking frozen chicken and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happens now?  The family go out to do the shopping perhaps once per week.  Having loaded up the car with food from the supermarket shelves they put it in the boot and then proceed to do shopping for clothes, shoes and so on for the children.  Meanwhile, all the food that came out of cold cabinets in the supermarket is heating up in the car and the bacteria are having a wonderful time, growing and multiplying.  The food is then taken home and put into a fridge or into <Col N="363" /> a freezer that is not working properly, and eventually is taken from there before it is properly thawed and is put on a rôtisserie to be cooked.  It is being cooked on the outside, of course, especially in the case of chickens, but not at all cooked on the inside where all the salmonella contamination is located.  We have other examples of cooked food being put under uncooked food in the fridge and the drops from chickens or whatever raw food is there can fall down on to the cooked food.  This is the kind of information that is absolutely essential for the consumers if they are to avoid biological contamination.</P>
    <P>It is salutary thought to remind ourselves that at the height of all the publicity about salmonella in eggs in Britain, more people got salmonella in hospital than went into hospital with salmonella, precisely because of bad practices in the catering establishments in hospitals. Senator Upton has already referred to this problem.  It is also a salutary thought that two years after the slaughter of two million hens in Britain because of alleged problems with salmonella in eggs, the incidence of salmonella poisoning in Britain increased by something like 20 per cent to 30 per cent, at least the reported cases.  There is a huge problem in informing people about how to handle food, given the modern technology we have with cook, chill and reheat processes, with frozen food being taken home and not thawed properly before it is cooked and so on.</P>
    <P>Having said that, we cannot overlook completely the problem of additives and pesticides in food, but we are misdirecting our resources by concerning ourselves unduly with the problem of residues.  It is a scientific fact that 99.9 per cent of all pesticides in food are naturally occurring, produced by the plant as its only natural protection against predators. Of course, some plants produce too much of it and are totally poisonous to the human, but all the plants we eat have a level of naturally occurring pesticides and yet we get very concerned about the 0.01 per cent of man-made pesticides.  That is <Col N="364" /> not to say we can ignore it.  We must be careful that these products are used properly.</P>
    <P>The question of hormones and angel dust was raised.  My experience of legislators in this area left me confounded by the absolute intellectual dishonesty and the lack of integrity I came across in the European Parliament.  We had the five safe hormones banned for political and commercial reasons.  We banned them despite a warning from the World Health Organisation which not only approved these substances but actually recommended that they be licensed for sale in order to avoid the very problem we now have on our hands, the problem of a black market.  We were told by scientific experts from all over the world that it was not feasible to enforce a ban.  We did so in the light of all that knowledge and the Community is suffering ever since from a declining consumption of beef, from a reduced quality of beef, and we in Ireland particularly are suffering because it is our single biggest item of export.</P>
    <P>What have we got today?  Rumours abound, as Senator Hussey and other Senators said, that there is widespread use of angel dust.  Perhaps it is safe for the consumer.  I do not know, but certainly it was never tested adequately and what is certain is that the quality of meat, whatever about the safety of it, from this product is inferior.  You would almost want to be an Alsatian dog to consume it, it is so tough.  This is what is happening now.  In desperation, because the safe products which enabled them to make a few pounds on cattle were banned, farmers resorted to getting something from the fellows in the backs of vans in marts and so on.  Indeed, it is reported that some meat factories are actually encouraging farmers to use angel dust. This is a disgrace but from the factory's point of view it enables the factory to make more money by selling what appears to be a better quality beef into intervention, the carcase is a grade better.  We got ourselves into that sort of trouble &mdash; I say we; it is the European <Col N="365" /> Community as a whole &mdash; through political pressures, particularly from the Greens in Germany.  I am afraid until the matter is resolved by some kind of amendment of the legislation we will never get out of it.  But I say here and now to the farmers of Ireland, if the legislation is wrong, amend it.  Do not break it.  Our beef industry is now sitting on a time bomb as somebody said and I am afraid that time bomb may well go off.</P>
    <P>With regard to health food, there is a con job going on here.  Let us be honest about it.  There is an implication that because these foods are sold as health foods they have some kind of miraculous health-giving properties.  The latest results I can find from the British Ministry of Agriculture of Food and Fisheries shows that these health foods have a much higher level of the undesirable residues than the normally produced and normally processed food.  We need some kind of official certification with regard to whether foods are organically produced, whether these health foods are what they are supposed to be.  The consumer is at the mercy of the racketeers.  I am not saying there are not genuine people producing organic food.  Of course there are. I am not saying that organic is any better than normally produced food.  It is not, and consumers had better be informed about that too, but if they feel they would like to have organically produced food and are prepared to pay a premium price for it, then by all means they must be entitled to get that service but they should not be exploited by people selling conventionally produced food that is being sold at a premium price as organically produced food.</P>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with labelling. There is a problem with this.  There is misinformation as far as labelling is concerned. I can think of a classic example that I raised in the European Parliament some years ago in relation to Irish smoked salmon being sold to continental customers.  Of course, it was Pacific salmon, bought cheaply, an inferior quality product, smoked in Ireland and sold as Irish smoked salmon.  The message <Col N="366" /> there was that it was Irish smoked salmon but it was not.  What did we do about it? I do not think we did enough about it.  I doubt if we did anything about it.</P>
    <P>Finally, throughout the Community there is a lack of confidence amongst consumers in the regulatory authorities. There is every good reason for this lack of confidence because we have had too much political interference in the matter of authorising the use of products, or supervising the use of products and banning the use of products when they should not have done so.  The Community will never get away from the problem until we have an independent, objective body like the Food and Drug Administration in the United States in which more than 70 per cent of the consumers in that country have confidence.  What percentage of people in Britain today have confidence in the Ministry of Food and Agriculture?  I would think a very, very small percentage.  For that matter, how many people have would believe the Department of Agriculture and Food when they say that things are all right? People do not believe this anymore when they see political interference in these matters.  I suggest that we press for a centralised, independent authority for dealing with these matters and in that way try to regain consumer confidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister here and find a great deal to commend in this motion from the Labour Senators.  It is one that deserves serious discussion.  I share the concerns expressed by Senator Upton when he moved the motion in relation to the need to protect the consumer, not just the Irish consumer but the growing number of consumers throughout Europe whom we will be forced to look to for our markets under the proposal for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and, indeed, through the way the market is going to develop over the next ten years or so.  I believe there is an interest in the industry.  It is in the industry's interest to implement measures like these because by having an industry we can stand over and by having wholesome food which <Col N="367" /> represents Ireland and the image we have for good, wholesome food, that we can hope to penetrate these highly competitive and sophisticated markets on the Continent.  These markets are highly demanding, and rightly so.  Anything we can do through legislation to improve matters in that respect is to be welcomed. I share the view that the consumer is absolutely entitled to know what is in the food that is being eaten, what it has been treated with and what sort of residues are involved, purely as a guarantee of its wholesomeness.  This is something which is going to become increasingly important.</P>
      <P>I do not share the view that we can farm without the use and support of pesticides, herbisides and the other chemical agents which are available to the industry. Senator Upton may have inadvertantly supported the use of these substances when he catalogued the bugs that were in the various jars that were analysed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be contested that they would never have reached the jars had they been treated adequately with the appropriate pesticide in the first place.  While having said that there is a need for these substances and that they must be controlled and environmentally friendly, there are opportunities, of course, for organic production.  But I do not think that anybody should be under any illusion that organic production can replace conventional production in agriculture. There certainly is a market for organic products but it would be naive for anybody to assume that we are going to be able to feed Europe and the world through organic production.  There will be a responsibility on us to feed a world. The population is expected to double before the year 2025.  While we have surpluses within the European Community and while those surpluses are indefensible on the basis of what they are costing the taxpayer, or on any other basis, it must be remembered that a huge <Col N="368" /> proportion of the world is starving.  It is not the surpluses themselves that are the problem, it is their location.  We are going to be faced with increasing pressure to feed a world where the population is expanding.  EC surpluses make it difficult to understand that that crisis is facing us, but it is a reality.</P>
      <P>The motion infers, willy-nilly, that all food is contaminated with  hormones and all sorts of undesirable substances.  I reject that suggestion.  Some food is contaminated by some substances which are undesirable and we must do what we can to root out those substances.  In a different context, when we spoke about the Birmingham Six, Senator Upton made a very good point in relation to science being al lowed to speak the truth, that science was abused in that particular instance.  In this much more minor instance, science is frequently not allowed speak the truth.  Science is abused for propaganda purposes and to do with things that have no relationship whatever with the quality of the food we are talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the aspect of the motion that deals with beta-agonists or angel dust or clanbuterol, there was a very disturbing article in <i>The Sunday Times</i> of 2 December last which referred to what was allegedly going on in Ireland in regard to angel dust, how it was being used on about half the cattle being produced in the country.  That was extremely damaging to our beef export business. The people who are using these substances ought to be made aware of just how much damage they are doing to the industry on which our economy depends. To my certain knowledge there are prominent people in agriculture using these substances on large numbers of cattle. They consider themselves to be highly respectable, law-abiding people.  They need to be made aware of the fact that they are not law-abiding people and that they are damaging the very industry from which they derive their living.  In addition to that, there are factories within the industry which are party to the illegality which is going on and which is damaging the industry.  I heard of a case in the past <Col N="369" /> week where it was alleged that a factory had an insurance scheme whereby if carcases were detected and rejected because they had angel dust in them, the producers would be compensated for those carcases.  If that is the case it is a total outrage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statements made by the Minister in this House and elsewhere that he intends to deal very severely with these matters.  There is one very easy way of stamping out this type of activity.  If several loads of cattle, at several factories, were sent back or condemned and the people were not paid for them, I can guarantee that very soon they would stop using substances of this nature.</P>
    <P>I share some of the reservations expressed by Senator Raftery in relation to the naturally occurring hormones which were banned by the Community. All the scientific evidence produced suggested that these materials were safe. Now we have a situation where we are using much more damaging substances, not only damaging to the animals but damaging to the human beings who are using them.  It has been suggested that people with heart conditions have died as a result of angel dust being used on cattle. I do not know if that is true but if it is the case, it is a very serious situation.  A doner from one meat factory told me that the moment he puts a knife into a carecase he can tell whether it has been treated with angel dust.  The analytical procedures must be refind in order to be able to say whether a crecase was treated with these substances.  That comes back to the question of science.  Senators Upton, Raftery and I share the same scientific tradition and I notice that at least one of the Department officials has the same scientific tradition.</P>
    <P>I realise there is a unit within the Department which monitors agro-chemical matters.  There toxicology is gone through in detail so that when they come on the market they can be regarded as being safe.  My question relates to the efficacy and use of those materials.  To what extent are the Department prepared to intervene to ensure that those <Col N="370" /> materilas are tested under field conditions to establish their efficacy under Irish conditions because sometimes the field trials which are conducted in other countries may not be appropriate to Irish conditions?  I support they need for labelling all foods sold over the counter; the consumer is entitled to know how those foods were processed and what is in them.</P>
    <P>There is a place for ionising radiation. The fact that the word &ldquo;radiation&rdquo; is used is very emotive and people automatically assume that they will develop cancer as a result.  In some developing countries it is the only realistic way of providing people with food which is not contaminated by the biological agents which were referred to by other speakers.  We have enough scares about salmonella and other illnesses. One week pigs are involved, the next week poultry, BSE and so on, and I wonder how many people are trying to sabotage the industry.  However, I realise those motives are not behind this Labour motion.</P>
    <P>There is a need for control in relation to vans which are selling burgers outside football pitches and disco clubs as they are causing digestive problems throughout the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. This is something we all should be concerned about.  Over the past 25 years the whole food chain has been damaged.  In the agricultural sector corn and beet sprays which are used indiscriminately have not been tested to find out if they pass on any harmful effects to the consumer. DDT was used in the production of beet and other crops and caused serious problems in humans in that it was a cancer-forming agent.  It took years to discover that.  Its use was continued in this country after it was banned in the United States.  I ask the Minister to look at that area urgently because chemicals and sprays are being dumped into this country and used on various products with no regard to the effect on humans who consume products such as chickens, beef, grain or sugar beet.  I support the need for urgent action in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Senators mentioned the tragedy of <Col N="371" /> angel dust and the irresponsible, greedy attitude of people using that product illegally.  The Minister's Department are doing what they can to track down those irresponsible people.  That is an important area and anything the Minister can do as speedily as possible would be appreciated by the public.</P>
    <P>People are at the stage now where they wonder what simple products such as tomatoes and cabbage are sprayed with. I know people who used liquid DDT until very recently and were producing acres of green crops like cabbages.  There should be some way of testing those products. Children get rashes and become ill due to eating such treated products.  We are wide open to abuse here more than any other country.  In the United Kingdom there is some control over those sprays and chemicals that are being dumped at a great rate.  In any of the farmers' papers or journals one reads about remedies for everything but there is no mention of the effect those sprays may have on humans.</P>
    <P>This motion should be looked at urgently and steps should be taken to control the use of sprays so that the public may be reassured about our products. We have the name of producing clean products in the food industry and that name should not be damaged.  Many young people are very conscious of their health and they do not consume various products such as chicken or beef.  They read about what is being used in factory type farms.  Not all farmers are that way inclined but are a few greedy producers who destroy the market and create many problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I want to express my appreciation of Senator Upton for his good wishes to me.  We are neighbouring politicians and I wish him success in his own political career presuming, of course, it does not impinge on my objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Food safety is, of course, of paramount importance and fortunately there is now a greater public awareness of the risks <Col N="372" /> associated with unfit or contaminated food and the need to observe proper standards of hygiene at all stages of production and manufacture.</P>
    <P>As well as the raising of public awareness, enforcement authorities must have adequate statutory backing to enforce proper standards.  The statutory powers under which the Minister for Health and the health boards operate are mainly contained in the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts 1875-1936, the Health Acts, 1947-53 and in regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972, to enforce EC rules in relation to food.  The Minister for Health also has enabling powers under the Food Standards Act, 1974.</P>
    <P>The statutory powers available to the Minister for Health under the Health Acts, 1947-53 are of particular significance. These powers enable the Minister for Health to make regulations to prevent danger to public health arising at any stage of the food chain.  However, other Ministers have responsibility for food safety within their own sectors of responsibility.  In particular, the Minister for Agriculture and Food safegaurds the food chain in relation to milk and meat production and dairy produce production. An integrated structure of food controls has developed between the various Ministers with food control resposibilities. The broad statutory powers available to the Minister for Health under the 1947-53 Health Acts enable him and the health boards to exercise control in regard to food safety over areas of the food chain not under the specific control of other Ministers and in particular at the point of sale to the consumer.</P>
    <P>As regards the protection of the consumer from the risk of food poisoning, the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950, which were last updated in 1989, lay down the hygiene standards to be observed in food premises and in food transportation and provide health boards with an effective range of powers for the registration of food premises and for dealing with unfit food.</P>
    <P>The creation of the Internal Market in 1992 has focused attention on the implications for the safety of the food supply <Col N="373" /> given that control measures currently operable at points of entry into individual member states will no longer apply.  This refers to the safety of food supply.  This has given rise to the need to ensure a level of equivalence among member states in relation to the control systems in place to ensure safe food supply.</P>
    <P>The pricipal initiative in this area was the adoption by the Council of Ministers of EC Directive 89/397 on the Official Control of foodstuffs.  In summary, this directive provides for monitoring foodstuffs for the home market and for export within the Community.</P>
    <P>Inspections must cover all stages of production, manufacture, import into the Community, processing, distribution and trade.  Food premises, plant, transport, machinery and equipment, raw materials, ingredients, food processes, staff hygiene, etc., shall all be subject to inspection.</P>
    <P>Each Minister with a food control responsibility is bringing into force within his own sector of responsibility whatever additional measures may be necessary to give full effect to this directive.  As far as the Minister for Health's responsibilities go, the EC directive will be implemented through a further amendment of the food hygiene regulations.  Details of sampling programmes must be submitted annually to the Commission under the directive and only laboratories designated as &ldquo;official laboratories&rdquo; may carry out analyses of foodstuffs for compliance with the law.</P>
    <P>These additional food control measures are of considerable importance and will provide significant additional safeguards for the protection of public health.</P>
    <P>A series of regulations have been made under the Health Acts, 1947-70 and the European Communities Act, 1972, in regard to colours, preservatives, anti-oxidants, emulsifiers and cyclamates.  Regulations are also in place controlling arsenic, lead and mineral hydrocarbons in food.  The additives regulations specify the additives permitted for use in food; the types of food and, where appropriate, <Col N="374" /> the maximum levels of use.  The regulations are regularly updated to take account of EC directives.  The European Commission is putting forward additional proposals for directives covering a comprehensive range of additives which in addition to the foregoing will include sweeteners, flavourings and many other categories.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposals are based on the views of the Scientific Committee for Food, a body of independent experts from each of the member states which examines and monitors the use of food additives.</P>
    <P>In advance of decisions at EC level, the use of additives is kept under constant review by an expert advisory body, namely the Food Safety Advisory Committee. In the event of the committee expressing concern about the safety of a particular additive, adequate powers are available to the Minister for Health to take appropriate action in the interest of public health and safety.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Advisory Committee were established jointly by the Minister for Health and the Minister for Agriculture and Food in July 1989 for the purpose of advising on matters relating to food and zoonotic diseases referred to it and of making recommendations to both Ministers.</P>
    <P>The committee replaced both the Food Advisory Committee and the Joint Services Committee on Zoonoses and now provide a cohesive forum to provide advice on the full spectrum of food issues, ranging from safety to microbiology.  The committee represent a broad range of scientific and technical expertise in human and veterinary medicine, toxicology, microbiology, food science, food analysis and environmental health.</P>
    <P>To date, the committee have produced reports on the following issues: listeria, BSE, food irradiation, farmhouse cheeses and potassium bromate in flour.  The reports have provided a valuable source of information to Ministers and have included important recommendations&mdash; in particular in relation to prevention of foodborne diseases &mdash; many of which are currently being implemented.  For <Col N="375" /> example, in relation to listeria and farmhouse cheeses, the Department of Health and Food have instructed health boards to ensure more efficient monitoring and control systems so as to minimise risk of food contamination.  In addition, the health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Food are producing an information leaflet for pregnant women on precautions to take against listeriosis.</P>
    <P>Reports on the use of cook chill systems of cooking in hospitals and catering premises, problems associated with the use of cling film for wrapping food and the foodborne diseases, salmonella and campylobacter, are currently being finalised and I am looking forward to receiving reports at an early date.</P>
    <P>Since their establishment, the committee have shown themselves to be more than willing to come to grips with complex issues and ultimately to provide the best possible advice on a wide range of complex food safety issues.  The public can feel assured that it is being well served by this committee.</P>
    <P>With regard to nutritional labelling, proposals made by the European Commission for compulsory nutritional labelling of foodstuffs were recently considered by the Council of Ministers but a majority of the member states were not satisfied as to the need for such a measure at this stage.</P>
    <P>However, the Council of the European Communities recently adopted Directive 90/496/EC which makes nutritional labelling compulsory where a nutrition claim is made.  The directive also lays down detailed rules as to the information to be included where nutritional labelling is provided.</P>
    <P>The general feeling among member states is that it would be prudent to monitor the impact and effect of the directive, when implemented, before taking on board the major implications attaching to a scheme of compulsory nutritional labelling.</P>
    <P>The 1980 report of the Food Advisory Committee on Nutritional Labelling and Claims recommended that nutritional <Col N="376" /> labelling of foodstuffs should be encouraged but did not advocate compulsory nutritional labelling as such.  Consumers are becoming more conscious of the relationship between diet and health and are demanding additional information on product labels to enable them to make informed choices.  The Minister for Health welcomes this move on the part of consumers and points out that the industry has been quick to respond to the demands by voluntarily providing nutritional labelling in many cases.  The application of the detailed rules laid down in the aforementioned directive, when adopted amd implemented in the member states, will considerably enhance decision making on the part of the consumer by ensuring that information is given in a standardised format, thereby facilitating comparison between products.  The directive provides for the phased implementation of the proposals outlined in the directive over a five-year period up to Octber 1995.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has established a new nutrition advisory group as a sub-committee of the Advisory Council on Health Promotion.  A priority of the Minister is to give effect to a more proactive approach to nutrition, including the education of the general public.  The nutrition advisory group will provide expert advice to the Minister, to his Department and to the general public in the area of nutrition, including nutrition policy, surveillance and education.</P>
    <P>There is already a Council directive requiring foodstuffs which have been treated with ionizing radiation to bear the indication &ldquo;irradiated&rdquo; or &ldquo;treated with ionizing radiation&rdquo;.  Proposals for the labelling of foodstuffs containing ingredients which have been subjected to ionizing radiation are being considered by the Council of European Communities as part of proposals for a Council directive regulating the treatment of food with ionizing radiation.  It is important that if the consumer is to be offered food which has been treated with ionizing radiation, or which contains ingredients which have been so treated, he or she should be <Col N="377" /> aware of this so that he or she can exercise choice in the matter.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, the Minister for Agriculture and Food safeguards the food chain in relation to meat, milk, eggs and dairy produce.  This is done through a series of Acts and EC regulations or directives relating to the individual sectors concerned.  All of these lay down hygiene standards for the maintenance and operation of the premises involved. They also contain provisions to ensure that animal diseases and undersirable substances are not transmitted to humans. In particular, this body of legislation includes the Abattoirs' Act, 1988, which was introduced to address any imbalance between the standards prevailing as between home and export plants.</P>
    <P>Domestic abattoirs are now subject to a licensing system which provides for minimum standards of facilities and operating procedures to ensure that meat produced in such facilities is of equivalent quality to that produced in export plants. Further regulations providing for equivalent veterinary <i>ante</i> and <i>post mortem</i> inspection of meat destined for the domestic market will shortly be introduced. The introduction of these measures is a further step in assuring domestic consumers of the wholesomeness of the product produced for their consumption.</P>
    <P>In so far as the application of EC Directive 89/397 to the foregoing legislation is concerned, the position is that most of this legislation contains inbuilt provisions which will facilitate full implementation of the directive without any additional statutory measures.</P>
    <P>For many years, Ireland's unpolluted environment, high animal health status and reputation for methods of livestock production have been a key element in our marketing strategy and access to important export markets.  In recent times we have seen a move from traditional animal husbandry to more intensive production and a more widespread availability and use of pharmaceutical substances for therapeutic, prophylactic and yield-enhancing purposes.  Used correctly and responsibily, these products make a valuable contribution to animal <Col N="378" /> health and welfare and, through reduction in animal mortality, to the prosperity of the farming community.  While recognising the potential benefits of these developments, I can fully appreciate and share the concerns of consumers that they are used correctly and responsibly and, most importantly of all, are not abused for short term gain.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the attention which the use of hormones, antibiotics and particularly the beta-agonists have received of late.  Consumers are rightly demanding assurances that the food they purchase does not contain residues of these and other contaminants and has not been derived from animals that have been treated with illegal substances.  It is particularly important that a country such as Ireland, which is so dependent on food exports, should be able to give these assurances both to domestic consumers and customers abroad.</P>
    <P>In response to these concerns comprehensive measures have been progressively introduced over the past ten years to tighten controls on the availability and use of hormones, antibiotics and other veterinary medicinal products to ensure these substances are used only for authorised purposes, where necessary, and that withdrawal periods are properly observed before taking produce from treated animals for human consumption.</P>
    <P>In 1981, the EC adopted directives providing for the assessment of all veterinary medicines on grounds of safety, quality and efficacy.  These measures were transposed into national law in 1986 and since 1987 all veterinary medicinal products are required to be assessed by the National Drugs Advisory Board before they can be placed on the market or administered to animals.  Prior to the introduction of these measures, legislation introduced in 1981 and 1982 strictly curtailed the range of hormonal products available to farmers and in 1985 legislation placed these substances under veterinary control.  In 1986 all antibiotics became prescription only medicines and observation of withdrawal periods following their administration became mandatory.  The use of hormones for <Col N="379" /> growth promotion was totally prohibited from 1 January 1987.</P>
    <P>In 1988 stringent consolidating measures to control the importation, manufacture, possession, sale and use of hormones were introduced.  The measures provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the condemnation of meat derived from hormone-treated animals, the destruction of illegally treated animals, powers of enforcement for the members of the Garda Síochána and officers of Customs and Excise, and for fines of up to £1,000 and one year's prison sentence.  In 1990 these regulations were extended to cover the illegal use of all substances, and these measures are now applicable, for example, to beta-agonists.  These national legislative measures are supplemented by an EC residue testing plan which provides for random sampling of meat for residues.</P>
    <P>I can assure you that these measures are vigorously enforced.  Over 400 officers are authorised to enforce the regulations by checking manufacturing and sales outlets, farms amd slaughtering facilities. Since 1986, 57 persons have been convicted of nearly 200 offences.</P>
    <P>In referring to consumer demands, undue emphasis may be placed on consumers abroad.  I would like to stress that while these are undoubtedly most important to us, the concerns of home consumers are not forgotten.  The legislative measures I have referred to are equally applicable to produce intended for the domestic and export markets.</P>
    <P>Pesticides, including herbicides, have proved a huge boon to modern agriculture by controlling diseases and pests of crops and contributing to the production of cheap high-quality foods, thereby reducing the incidence of under-nutrition in developing countries.  However, being biologically active products, they are also potentially dangerous to man and the environment.  They are intended to be toxic to the unwanted or pest species, without causing damage to treated species, to man or the environment. It is necessary, therefore, that their use be controlled by laws and regulations <Col N="380" /> which have a wide margin of weighting in favour of the safety aspect, This is the position here in Ireland where two bodies of statutory regulations governing the sale and use of pesticides, are administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>The first body of regulations is entitled the European Communities (Classification, Packing and Labelling of Pesticides) Regulations, 1985 to 1989.  A pesticide may not be sold on the market without getting clearance under these regulations.  The regulations came into operation in 1985 and an arrangement was made that products already on the market could continue to be sold provided they met certain conditions of the regulations.  These old pesticides are being called up in batches for a more detailed examination before getting final clearance.  Any pesticide put on the market for the first time after 1985 has to receive examination and clearance beforehand.  In the process of clearing pesticides under the regulations, safety evaluations are made and a pesticide that is regarded as constituting a danger to human health or the environment may be prohibited or have special conditions attached to its clearance.  Inspectors of the Department of Agriculture and Food carry out regular inspections at wholesale and retail outlets to ensure that pestcides on sale comply with the regulations.  As a result, several seizures were made and a number of instances of court proceedings resulted in successful prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The other body of legislation deals with the level of pesticide residues in or on fruit and vegetables, cereals and foodstuffs of animal origin.  These regulations, which operate throughout the European Community, lay down maximum residue levels for a wide range of pesticides in designated foodstuffs.  The maximum levels are set at a very safe level.  Regular samples of all designated foodstuffs, both home-grown and imported, are taken by officers of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  To illustrate the effectiveness of these controls, out of 2,187 samples taken in 1989 only six were found to be above the limit.  In such cases a warning <Col N="381" /> is issued and special attention is given afterwards to produce from the same source.  I would like to assure the House that in no case was a repeat discovered.</P>
    <P>A third body of proposed legislation on pesticides is at present being discussed in Brussels.  It will impose a tighter control on pesticides by requiring that all acceptable active ingredients are registered and only pesticides manufactured from these ingredients can be put on sale.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a relatively small user of pesticides.  From my presentation here you will note that the policy and control measures being operated are designed to maintain a high degree of safety for the consumer.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and the Minister for Agriculture and Food are satisfied that the statutory powers available are adequate to ensure the protection of public health.  The Minister for Health recently indicated to the Food Safety Advisory Committee that he would welcome the views of the committee on the legislative framework under which various Departments exercise food control responsibilities and any recommendations the committee might wish to make for the improvement of this framework and for achieving greater integration and co-ordination in regard to the exercise of controls at central and at local level.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food would also welcome the committee's views on these matters.</P>
    <P>With regard to a few points which were also raised, I would like to point out that in dealing with angel dust in hormones, sampling takes place both on the farm and at factories.  This sampling takes place both on a random, non-suspicious basis and on a suspicious selective basis. With regard to organic production, I understand that directives are currently being formulated.  In relation to pesticides, as and from 1990-91, the results of pesticide residue monitoring for all member states will be published by the EC.  Hygiene laws in relation to products dealt with by the Department of Agriculture and Food are of recent origin.  I refer particularly to the Abattoirs Act, <Col N="382" /> 1988, which applies to meat plants catering for domestic markets and EC directives and regulations covering meat export plants, milk and dairy produce.</P>
    <P>With regard to the comments of Senator Dardis on pesticide efficacy, at present clearance to market pesticides is granted where they are on sale, from the point of view of consumers, farm workers and the environment.  I would also like to point out that as and from 1993 efficacy will be a further criterion to be considered.</P>
    <P>Regarding further comments by Senator Dardis about vanmen, I would like to point out that the officers of the Minister for Agriculture and Food monitor vans selling at marts and calling from farm to farm in regard to veterinary medicines and the distribution of products on an ongoing basis.  Prosecutions of vanmen have taken place and Senators will no doubt be aware of such a case within the last five weeks when a vanman was fined over £2,000 for possession of hormones and antibiotics.</P>
    <P>With reference to DDT, as raised during the debate, I want to point out that DDT has been banned in Ireland for many years.  The reason for the prohibition was its persistence in the environment. DDT has not been shown to be a carcinogen.  Its use in tropical countries for the control of vectors of many diseases &mdash; malaria, yellow fever, etc. &mdash; saves millions of lives.</P>
    <P>We have had a very substantial debate here and I want to thank everybody who has contributed.  I trust the information I have imparted on behalf of the Department of Agriculture and Food and of the Department of Health will be found helpful by Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wish to respond to a few points which were made by some Senators, particularly Senator Raftery. He listed three entitlements of consumers as outlined by John F. Kennedy.  I would go back a little further than John F. Kennedy and quote the oldest one of them all: the consumer is always right.  If the consumer does not like chemicals in food <Col N="383" /> as in additives, hormones and all the rest of it, it just does not matter&mdash;the consumer is right, full stop.  It does not matter how unreasonable the consumer is by scientific standards, the consumer is still right.  Anybody who thinks otherwise is on the road to nowhere in the world of commerce.</P>
      <P>Senator Raftery also spoke of the fact that 99 per cent of pesticides in foods were natural.  So be it.  That does not at all take away from any potential toxic effects the 1 per cent which are added might have.  That is what I am concerning myself with.</P>
      <P>In relation to safe hormones, I do not know how you can talk in terms of safe hormones.  Just think of the power of hormones.  Just think of the power of a hormone analogue like clenbuterol&mdash; angel dust &mdash; and what it can do to animals.  It changes the whole composition of the body.  Think of the power of the sex hormones and what they can do.  The mind boggles when you talk in terms of safe hormones.  Talk in terms of the effects of stilbesterol given in America to prevent miscarriages in women. You will find that one generation on their daughters began to show up cancer of the cervix.  It boggles the mind when you talk in terms of safety.  You just cannot.  You can talk in terms of acceptable risk and that is about the size of it.  The hormones were indeed banned for political reasons. That is entirely right.  That is the function of politicians.</P>
      <P>My view of the function of scientists&mdash; and I speak as someone who is to some extent still a practising scientist&mdash;is that it is to lay out the facts, and that is it.  It is the function of politicians to make the decisions.  We should all be very careful of scientists, acting as scientists, when they then begin to disguise themselves into the role of advocates.  It is fair enough if scientists become advocates. Let it be known clearly that they are acting as advocates in those circumstances, not that they are disguised as scientists so that people are under the impression that they are scientists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The angel dust is still a matter of great <Col N="384" /> concern to me.  We all have to be very alarmed at the fact that in the last few days the Minister has seen fit to call in some of the key executives in the meat factories and issue them with a warning and threaten them in hurling lingo&mdash;it must be coming from his old St. Flannan's days &mdash; when he told them they would be winded if they did not behave themselves because of the jolt they could expect.</P>
    <P>Finally, it seems to me that most of the regulations in relation to food in this country are European-driven now.  It is a pity that we are not up there taking the initiative rather than responding to European initiatives to improve our food regulations. We should be grabbing the initiative so that our image as a producer of green, wholesome food is second to none.  Again, I thank the Minister and all the Senators who contributed to the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Just before I revert to the point I was at before the adjournment, as the Minister of State, Deputy Flood is sitting in, may I avail of the opportunity to congratulate him on his recent appointment and wish him every success there?</P>
      <P>Before we adjourned the debate I was about to quote from an article by Patricia O'Donovan, Assistant General Secretary of the ICTU.  It appeared in <i>Newsline,</i> July 1990 issue, and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Women and young people predominate amongst low paid workers. The results show that nearly half of all women workers, 140,000 out of 300,000, are in low paid work.  The age divisions are also striking.  About half of the low paid are under 25 years of age.  The part-time/full-time distinction is also crucial because nearly 60 per <Col N="385" /> cent of all part-time workers are low paid.</P>
    <P>The Minister has come forward with further figures which reflect the growth of part-time work.</P>
    <P>There are a few aspects of the Bill on which I wish to express my views.  I do not wish to go over the ground that has been gone over by previous speakers.  I believe from the debate, as I have listened to it, that very many aspects of the Bill are being covered very thoroughly.  I would suggest that the growth we have had in part-time work over the past 15 years, which is the period referred to by the Minister in his speech, is more or less a response to a need.  I want to suggest that that is a need that is shared&mdash;perhaps not equally&mdash;by both employers and employees.</P>
    <P>I believe that the growth that we have had, particularly in relation to women in part-time employment, is more of a response to the general economic conditions we have, such as the need to balance the family budget, than it is in itself a desire to find work outside the home and the family.  Both the growth in part-time work among women, and particularly the type of women that are engaged in part-time work, actually reflect this.  I concur with the views that have been expressed here that a very high proportion of young married women are in low paid jobs in part-time work.  That highlights social and economic problems that go far beyond the capacity of this Bill to address.</P>
    <P>I also want to put on record that, as far as I am concerned, I am absolutely opposed to exploitation of part-time workers or of any workers.  I have to say that if there is exploitation, and I accept other peoples views on it, during my time as a public representative I have not met part-time workers who have come to me on the basis that there is discrimination in their job, that they are at a disadvantage in some way or other or that they have sought my assistance in rectifying a problem that would fall within that category.  Perhaps it relates to the part of the country I come from. <Col N="386" /> However, I accept the views expressed by others that there can be exploitation and that it probably exists.</P>
    <P>This word &ldquo;exploitation&rdquo; has been mentioned on a number of occasions during the discussion this afternoon and with it goes the implication that most employers could be guilty of this charge.  I would like to reject that.  I accept that there can be examples.  In any society&mdash; and we have yet to find the perfect society &mdash;there will always be a few bad apples capable of damage.  If that is the case&mdash; and I am not disputing it may well be the case in a limited number of instances &mdash;it is wrong to suggest it should have general application to the whole body of employers.  Perhaps I misunderstood some of the observations made, but I got that impression and I feel I should put it on record.</P>
    <P>More is needed than what this Bill can achieve.  We have to look at the environment in which this legislation is being introduced.  That environment in itself puts effective constraints on the objectives of the Minister and on everybody in this House.  It is a Bill brought in, to a degree, in isolation even though its net effect is to extend the provisions of seven separate pieces of legislation that at present apply to part-time workers.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted figures in his speech.  I want to suggest to him that the figures he used relate to the numbers known to him and his Department who are in part-time work but there are many others who are unknown to the Minister and to his Department.  There are those who work in the black economy, who will not declare their position as part-time workers and they will not do that for one simple reason.  It is because of the inequities of our tax system.  Our general tax system and the manner in which it penalises initiative, work and effort is the environment I am referring to.  It is the existence of this inequity in our tax system in relation to work and enterprise that will effect the capacity of this measure to be as effective as we all might wish it to be.  Many of those who work in part-time employment and who are <Col N="387" /> unknown to the Minister and his Department will remain outside the ambit of this legislation.  Perhaps there is a hope on his part that this Bill and its provisions will encourage them to come out in the open but I question that.  I look forward to the Minister's response in this regard.</P>
    <P>I want to take, for example, the woman in part-time work, the wife in part-time work whose husband is in full time employment.  Let us be realistic about this.  If the wife gets part-time work and declares it, so much of what she earns will be deducted from her in tax as to not make economic sense for her to take up part-time employment at all.  That is the difficulty that will curtail the effectiveness of this Bill in the workplace or marketplace. For as long as our tax laws discriminate against work and enterprise, many part-time workers will not declare their correct returns.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the protection of seven different enactments which will now be available to part-time workers. The part-time worker's sole interest will be to earn that additional few pounds week by week simply to balance the family budget.  That is the chief objective. The protection that will be available under this legislation will have a far lower priority.  So long as the overall tax situation continues, this is something we will have to contend with and face up to.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the maintenance of the threshold of eight hours and the 13 weeks.  I accept this I do understand &mdash; although I have no personal experience of it&mdash;that certain large-scale employers perhaps here and elsewhere throughout the country devised a system whereby they could ensure that their employees would work some minutes less than the present 18 hours and, therefore, were able to exclude them.  That is a type of practice we all find objectionable and to the extent that reducing the threshold is a method of meeting that situation, I welcome it.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Minister say in his speech:</P>
    <P>In introducing a 13 week threshold <Col N="388" /> in the Bill it was the intention that this would ensure that students and other short time temporary part-time employees would not be covered by the Bill and that the Bill would not create a disincentive to such short periods of employment.  The 13 week period ensures, on the one hand, an element of commitment and permanence on the part of the regular part-time employee and, on the other, that the casual or occasional workers will still be largely excluded from the provisions of the protective legislation involved.</P>
    <P>On the one hand, I welcome that because I believe students have found that this part-time work is useful for the provision of pocket money and helps to ease the cost on their families in maintaining them.  On the other hand, I would like to know what happens in relation to the student once the 13 week period is exceeded.</P>
    <P>There are two categories of work that students avail of: I am speaking in particular of my own area.  There is the tourist season and the employment that hotels and other such establishments provide in tourist areas for students.  Certainly, the 13 week period is more than adequate to cover that.  I am also aware that students at third level here in Dublin and elsewhere avail of the opportunity to work part-time, sometimes nights and sometimes at weekends.  That would certainly take them for a longer period than 13 weeks.  Perhaps when the Minister is responding he would indicate to me what is the position of the student who has part-time employment during his school term and which extends beyond the 13 week period.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Cuív suggested an interesting development that could occur under this legislation.  He spoke as an employer of some experience and suggested he saw opportunities for people to move from full-time employment to part-time employment under the provisions of this legislation.  That is an interesting observation.  I have not thought it out, but I was quite intrigued by the suggestion.  I <Col N="389" /> have a fear that the Bill may reduce the opportunity for casual part-time work, because employers&mdash;I am talking about responsible employer in this regard&mdash; are likely to reassess their role in view of the implications of this legislation and may reduce the availability of part-time work.  They may do that by replacing one or more part-time workers by one full-time worker.  It may have certain positive effects.  It may very well&mdash;and I believe that this will be the case &mdash; create a number of permanent full-time jobs that would not be created in its absence.  But I want to raise with the Minister the question of whether the Bill is going to have a negative effect by reducing the availability of part-time work and that those seeking part time work will, because of the Bill, be pushed further into the black economy.</P>
    <P>Unless our tax laws are adjusted to ensure that a second income earner in a household can retain a worthwhile portion of his or her earned income, many of the people will continue undeclared in part-time work.  That will continue while economic conditions remain as they are and while our tax laws penalise those who are progressive, penalise the work ethic. To a very great extent this is what is happening.  Tax laws, as they stand, punish the second income earner in many households.  If that is the case, the objectives of the Bill will remain for many nothing more than an academic exercise, by an large.  The opportunities for the casual and part-time worker will remain a feature of the work place.  If the effects of the Bill are to reduce the opportunities in decent, open employment, the risk is that it will force those seeking part-time employment to remain undeclared.  That is the major reservation I have in relation to the Bill.  However, I am quite sure the Minister will be capable of reassuring me that my fears are groundless.</P>
    <P>I want to say, finally, that for its many good points I welcome this legislation.  I wish it well, but I feel I had an obligation to raise genuinely held fears on my part and also to defend the honest employers &mdash;and they are by far in the majority&mdash; from any implication or to have their <Col N="390" /> reputation damaged in any way by the unacceptable activities of the few who go wrong.</P>

      <P>I would like, first of all, to welcome this Bill.  I congratulate the Minister for bringing it to the House and I thank him for his interest over the years for all workers, part-time workers included, and in creating better conditions for workers.  Until the end of time there will be people who will exploit others.  It is the practice, particularly during the summer months, to exploit young people in our larger supermarket stores.  I am sure that this Bill will prevent a lot of that injustice.</P>
      <P>Another section I would like to mention&mdash;I know this Bill does not cover them but I would appeal to the Minister to sort it out with the help of his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare &mdash;are the people employed as meter readers by the ESB, a body that should be showing an example to other bodies. They are regarded by the ESB as working under contract and deemed to be self-employed. This problem has been around for a few years.  They may not be big in number, but they are there, people with families, some of them working for 30 years with the ESB, and working very hard, reading perhaps 7,000 meters every two months.  They pay PRSI at the class S1 rate.  The ESB are discussing a change in that area which would mean that these people would be employed only eight weeks on and eight weeks off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is very serious concern about this and I believe it was mentioned in the Dáil last week when the Minister was taking this Bill.  To put it bluntly, these people are not entitled to sign for a stamp, they will not qualify for the dole and their income will be cut by half.  In this day and age that is grossly unfair and I appeal to the Minister, if he can, to help these people and to take urgent steps to see to it that justice will be done.  If the ESB change the system these people will be out on the side of the road with their income cut by half.  That would be a grave injustice.  I will not go into the details of it.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of <Col N="391" /> the hardship in that area and the fears of these people who have given excellent service down through the years.  They feel now that, with changes being discussed by the ESB, they could be in serious trouble.</P>
    <P>I want to again thank the Minister for his hard work to improve the lot of the workers of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is important at an early stage to welcome this legislation. From a personal point of view, on two previous occasions in this House we argued with the Minister on other pieces of legislation which we attempted to have extended to those workers who worked fewer than 18 hours per week.  On two of those occasions we called it to a vote to indicate in a clear way our opposition to the fact that the particular protective legislation we were then discussing did not extend to those workers who worked fewer than 18 hours per week.  On both occasions the Minister said that this was something he was prepared to look into and which he hoped to address in the near future.  Credit where credit is due, I would like to put on record my appreciation of the fact that, despite whatever reservations I have about this legislation, he has brought back legislation which goes a long way towards addressing and resolving the problems of many part-time workers.</P>
      <P>I do not need to reiterate what has been said by so many speakers today and what has been said by the Minister on many occasions previously.  Part-time workers have been exploited.  Part-time workers have been used, abused and, indeed, misused.  Part-time workers have been used in the many employments as a lever to exploit full-time workers.  We have seen many examples of full-time workers being replaced by a series of part-time workers who did not have rights, who did not have the protection of legislation.  This Bill will go a long way, perhaps four-fifths of the way, to deal with that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am intrigued by the eight hour figure. Unfortunately, the Minister's speech <Col N="392" /> must have been very popular because it is the first time in my experience that there has been a sell out, and I have not been able to get a copy of it for the last three hours.  Perhaps he should produce a second edition of it.  I did apologise at an early stage to the Minister for not being here for his presentation.  I do not know the justification for the eight hour limit or how it was arrived at.  I am speaking purely from reading the Bill and these are my observations on it.  I do not accept and I disapprove of the eight hour limit. It is important, however, to say that I see this Bill as progressive and forward thinking and one which will protect the rights of many workers.  The trade union movement have been calling for legislation like this for many years and has maintained a consistent level of debate with the Department of Labour and the ICTU on this issue for a number of years. A number of unions have had to address this.  The fact that part-time workers have been used time and again to replace sacked or disposed of full-time workers has led to industrial disputes in a number of places.</P>
    <P>I also accept that this legislation will provide protection for a large body of workers.  It will create a great problem for some unscrupulous retailers who have being using and abusing part-time workers for years.  It is a milestone in legislation in terms of what existed before now.  It goes beyond part-time workers. We will also have to look at the area of seasonal, temporary and agency workers. I know this has been brought to the Minister's attention on a number of occasions previously.  The difficulty that arises with the 13 weeks multiplied by eight hours per week is that there would be many people working in continuous employment for fewer hours than that, or perhaps for fewer weeks than that.  I know the Minister will respond to that by saying: &ldquo;One has to draw the line somewhere, one has to create a threshold at some point&rdquo;.  I am not convinced on that issue.  I do not see a justification for deciding that part-time work lasts more than eight hours per week and for longer than 13 weeks per year.  I appreciate the Bill <Col N="393" /> because of the implications for equality contained in it.  Seventy-five per cent of part-time workers are women and any legislation introduced, promulgated or enacted on behalf of part-time workers is, by its very nature, tied in with the notion of equality of opportunity and of equality between the sexes.  Certainly any improvement in the lot of part-time workers is a positive development in terms of equality.</P>
    <P>The ICTU have reckoned that 68 per cent of males as opposed to 72 per cent of females in part-time employment work less than the current 18 hour figure.  The 18 hour limit was riduculous and it is important that that limit has been removed. For that reason, more than any other, I welcome this legislation and I see it as a move towards gender equality and towards equality in terms of grades and categories of workers.  Perhaps the Minister in his response will refer to the point I raised in relation to seasonal workers, such as food pickers, people working in the canning industry or in the fruit preservation area, whether in canning, jam making or freezing, which is dependent on a particular season of fruit.  People in these areas might be excluded from this legislation and perhaps the Minister would indicate how we might address that in the future.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised with the Minister whether or not this legislation complies completely with the EC position. I have asked a number of people where we stand on this issue.  I know it has been brought to the Minister's attention that the EC Directive 76/207 covers many different aspects of a part-time employment. I have been asked whether this legislation complies in spirit with what was required by that directive.  I would certainly welcome the views of the Minister on that point.  Why the threshold? Why the eight hours?  Why does this suddenly become a matter of tremendous importance?</P>
    <P>I would also say to the Minister that up until this time the difficulties that arose quite regularly with the employment of part-time workers is that they were used, particularly in supermarkets and in retail <Col N="394" /> outlets, to fill positions that should have been filled by full-time workers.  I want to make it clear that there will always be a need for part-time workers.  The very nature of retailing outlets makes it inevitable that there will be peaks and valleys in employee requirement.  It is quite clear that coming up to Christmas in a supermarket, toy shop, clothes shop or indeed in the delivery of post, there will be a peak period when it will be necessary to take on part-time, temporary employees. I recognise and accept that fact.</P>
    <P>Previous to this, employers could unscrupulously take advantage of their workforce to replace regularly full-time workers with part-time workers and they did this to keep outside the law, or inside the law, depending on your perspective. The reason I welcome the Bill is because it makes that practice more difficult than before and no matter what my reservations would be on the Bill it has to be seen as progressive and forward-thinking and a great development on what was there previously.</P>
    <P>A problem which now arises and which the Bill has not addressed and on which I would welcome the Minister's views, is the fact that people will always try to get underneath the threshold.  If we see an employer deliberately restricting the hours of work of an employee to seven and a half hours, or seven and three quarter hours per week, or finishing a contract after 12 weeks, how do we address this?  There are two issues here. I asked earlier why we have to have this particular threshold?  That is one question to be addressed, and I am sure the Minister will have very solid reasons for coming to that point of view.  We may differ on them but at least there will be reasons for it.</P>
    <P>Let us take the other question of the unscrupulous employer who attempts to beat the system by restricting work to seven hours and 59 minutes per week or to a 12 week contract which will then be broken.  I know there is the question of the renewal of contract at a later stage, which was mentioned in the Bill, and maybe I am not clear on whether that may address it.  Is there redress?  Is there <Col N="395" /> a procedure for dealing with the grievance of a worker where an employer is quite unscrupulously restricting work to ensure that the employer will not be subject to the Act?  It is an important point. If the Minister were to say to me in response to this that it is a problem and that it will be addressed at another time, at least I would see that there was a plan there, that he had taken this on board and that it was the view of the Department and of the Minister than it cannot be addressed at this time.  Obviously then we could agree to differ on the issue but at least it would mean that we were moving forward.</P>
    <P>By its very nature, part-time work is insecure and part-time workers are insecure in their employment.  What is not covered in the Bill, and which always creates a problem, is the relationship between different Government Departments, as in the case of the Minister's Department and the Department of Social Welfare.  People move in and out of various types of employment and people move from part-time to full-time temporary employment and back to part-time employment.  That is because the various outlets, retailers and services have different peak and valley times when they need to employ some people full-time on a temporary basis and others part-time on a continual basis.  This raises issues, not only in terms of the Bill, but also regarding the class of PRSI which people are required to pay.  A person in full-time temporary employment might be paying into a pension fund and on that basis be in a particular class for social welfare payments, whereas a person in part-time employment might be paying a different level of social welfare and paying the social welfare contribution which would entitle them to the contributory old age pension.  There could well be a conflict here.  I am not saying that there is because I do not know enough about it.  I cannot identify quite where that conflict might take place but I have seen difficulties arise between people <Col N="396" /> who for lack of a consolidated social welfare system, cannot move in and out of different categories of PRSI.</P>
    <P>I raise this issue because I believe the Department of Labour and the Department of Social Welfare &mdash; like the ploughman and the farmer &mdash; should be friends on this issue and should be able to talk to each other and get their act together. There is nothing as frustrating for trade union officials as to find one Department saying: &ldquo;Yes, we are with you but that is a matter for the Department of Social Welfare.&rdquo;  I would like the Minister to respond to that.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the legislation, as we see it, will stand the test of time.  I have raised some queries in the European context and other queries in the context of the way part-time workers operate and find employment but it is not clear in the Bill how disputes relating to the continuity of service might be addressed. Sections 5 and 6 of the Bill, for instance, should clearly state that part-time workers will have the same access as full-time workers to the various avenues where employment problems can be resolved, for instance, to the Rights Commissioners and the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  It is not clear in the Bill that they will have access to these places.</P>
    <P>I have raised a number of issues and instead of being petulant I will finish by saying I welcome this legislation which is progressive and forward-thinking.  The Government and the Minister must be complimented on introducing it.  It meets a need and responds to the representations of the trade union movement and it will ease many difficulties for part-time workers.  The questions I have raised are questions I would be happy to see dealt with in the future.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a milestone in labour legislation. Since 1974 the Department of Labour have repeatedly brought in legislation which has advanced workers' rights.  The present Minister has been superb in addressing these difficulties and it is good to have that on the record. We can certainly move forward from this point.  I have raised difficulties which will <Col N="397" /> have to be addressed but it is clear the Minister is not prepared to address them at this stage.  Recently I heard him comment that it was his wish to have this legislation enacted before the commencement of the new tax year.  I can see his reasons for that and it is worthy of him to feel he should do that.  However, there remain the problem of workers who can still be exploited whether or not they work an eight hour week.  In the meantime I welcome the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to welcome the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Bill, 1990.  I congratulate the Minister on its introduction and commend him on his presence throughout the afternoon in the Seanad to hear the views of the contributors to the debate.</P>
      <P>As the Minister mentioned, we have now in the region of 82,000 part-time workers and it is generally accepted that many such workers do not respond to surveys to determine their number as many of them are forced to work in the black economy because of our tax regime.  They are not in a position to obtain the fruits of their labour, especially if their partner is in full-time employment and their tax level is high.  Many people are forced by high mortgages and high expenses to work part-time. Because of the tax regime they find that if they come within the tax net that they are working for practically nothing. Therefore, many work on a part-time basis outside the tax regime.</P>
      <P>At the other end of the scale many people are on unemployment assistance. We cannot accept that they are, in fact, working part-time and drawing unemployment assistance but we must face the fact that that actually happens.  Many politicians working on the ground come across that on a regular basis.  These people work to augment their income because of the low levels of unemployment assistance available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the present legislation is necessary because the people to whom I have referred are outside the protection of the previous legislation to <Col N="398" /> which the Minister has referred.  He highlighted the fact that people with 30 years part-time service have no protection under the various Acts, under the Redundancy Payments Act, the Unfair Dismissals Acts or the equality Acts.  Under these Acts maternity leave is not provided for.  This is totally unacceptable for people with long service and I welcome the fact that they will now be covered under the new legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister also pointed out that these people are predominantly female. This is a positive indication that married women are availing of the opportunity to go back to work part-time.  I was involved in organising an evening shift of four hours over three or four days where married women were delighted to be able to take the work opportunity when their husbands came home from work.  There were economic pressures on them to go back to work on a part-time basis.  We should accept it as positive that these opportunities are now being provided and that these people have a right to be covered under the various Acts which the Minister mentioned.</P>
    <P>The growth of part-time work is no doubt a response also to employers' needs for more flexibility of employment due to increased competition.  Employers need more flexibility to respond to the changing needs of the marketplace and of their customers.  It is important that we recognise good employers who offer good conditions to part-time workers. They should not be put at a disadvantage by employers who want to exploit part-time employees.  This Bill puts employers on an even keel with regard to some of the conditions of employment for part-time workers and that must be recognised.</P>
    <P>We must also recognise competition within the EC because part-time work operates at various levels from as low as 2.5 per cent in Spain up to 29.4 per cent in the Netherlands.  Ireland stands at 7.8 per cent in comparison to our nearest competitors the UK at 22.8 per cent. There is an inter-European competition element in this which we must recognise.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan referred to <Col N="399" /> labour costs as they effect competitiveness, about which I would take issue with him.  In some industries labour costs in relation to total cost are high, while in other industries, they are low. While no single increase in wages will put a company into liquidation over a period of time high labour costs have put companies out of business.  The high increases and cutbacks of the seventies forced companies that were not in a position or who did not have the expertise to cut back on labour costs through improved productivity to go out of business due to increased competition.</P>
    <P>Regular part-time work facilitates people who look towards early retirement and who have acquired expertise over the years, and we must recognise the expertise and experience of older employees.  It allows them to contribute on a part-time basis and it allows younger people into the workforce while not losing the skills and experience of older employees.  It allows mothers of families to work.  It also allows people to work part-time work and study.  Many went through college on the basis of money earned on part-time work which is a positive development.  The more opportunity people get to do part-time work while educating themselves the better the educational opportunities of people at the lower levels of the socio-economic sphere.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to the growing complexity of labour legislation.  As a member of the Employment Appeals Tribunal I am aware of the confusion of employers with regard to labour legislation.  Larger employers may employ trained personnel or consultants to look after this area. Smaller employers&mdash;once they get into the labour area&mdash;are so confused that they are often unaware of the situation they are getting themselves into.  If there could be a less complex approach to the labour area it would help the smaller employers especially to understand their duties under the legislation and the rights of their employees.  Most of them often offend through ignorance rather than by <Col N="400" /> design.  The Minister should consider consolidating legislation for areas dealing with holidays, unfair dismissal, equality legislation and so on.</P>
    <P>Other Senators dealt with the growing area of contract employment.  There are two aspects to this.  It can be quite positive when it allows high potential earners to obtain higher earnings by virtue of their skills and their work output.  One of the areas quoted already was the meat industry where boners on contract can earn phenomenal amounts of money because of their commitment to working, ten, 12 or 15 hours a day and their scarce skills.  If this filters down to the lower earners, there is the risk of a high level of exploitation because these low earners are totally outside the scope of the various Acts.  If contract work expands there will be a risk of exploitation by unscrupulous employers.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to a contract situation in the semi-State sector of Coillte Teoranta. Coillte Teoranta made employees redundant and promised them work on a contractual basis for the planting season which is about eight to ten weeks.  These people returned to work on a contractual basis and most of them came off unemployment assistance because Coillte Teoranta operates in the more severely handicapped areas.  They were on contract and found that they would consequently be means tested for unemployment assistance.  The money earned for the ten weeks on contract was taken back from them when they returned to unemployment assistance.  A married person with two children receiving £98 per week or £784 over an eight week period on unemployment assistance received £1,600 while working with Coillte Teoranta over the same period on contract.  These earnings would have the effect of reducing a person's unemployment assistance over the following 12 month period from £98 per week to £69 per week.  Therefore, the £1,600 will be taken back together with loss of unemployment assistance for that period.  We are now in an exploitative situation where people in a very deprived area of the <Col N="401" /> country are penalised for working with Coillte Teoranta on contract.  Their skills are lost to Coillte Teoranta and they themselves are deprived of an opportunity of employment.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Miniister for Social Welfare for bringing 21,000 new workers under the social welfare system.  These are part-time workers, 17,000 of whom are women. They are now in a position to claim disability benefit, maternity allowance and unemployment benefit.  I would also like to compliment the Minister on his decision to appoint the Employment Appeals Tribunal as judge of whether a fair practice is being operated by an employer with regard to the 13 week break in employment contract.  I would also compliment my colleagues on the tribunal for the work they have done already and I am confident they will now continue their good work into this area.</P>
    <P>I would like to take up one final positive point.  The Bill will now change the rule with regard to holiday entitlements for employees who revert for periods of the year to short-time work for two or three days a week.  Heretofore, people who were on a three-day or two-day week lost their holiday entitlement for the periods they were on short-time.  In some industries&mdash;especially the meat industry with which I am familiar &mdash; short-time can last for as long as seven to eight months and full-time 40 hour employment can be as low as four to five months. While unions in certain cases negotiated holiday entitlements people did not have this as a right.  Under this legislation they now have holiday entitlement <i>pro rata</i> to the amount of time they work on either a three-day week or a two-day week.  I welcome this provision.  I commend the Minister and compliment him for spending his time in the Seanad listening to our views.  I wish some of his colleagues would follow his example.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I take up the point my colleague has just finished on and thank the Minister for his interest in and commitment to this House.  It is all too easy at <Col N="402" /> times to get a junior Minister of whatever persuasion to come in and sit out the Bill, so the Minister is very welcome.</P>
      <P>I would like to dwell on the area of the European Commission and the three specific proposals dealing with what is referred to as non-standard employment generally and where this legislation slots in.  In some areas the Minister has gone further and in others he did not go far enough.  It is interesting to know exactly where this legislation will slot into the overall framework of what is considered part and parcel of the Internal Market. Apart from economic union, social cohesion was also emphasised and is very important in that context.</P>
      <P>The three Commission proposals I refer to are a directive on the approximation of the laws of member states relating to certain employment relationships with regard to working conditions; a directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states relating to certain employment relationships with regard to distortions of competition and the third directive is the introduction of measures to encourage improvement in the safety and health of temporary workers at work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that these three directives are the first concrete expressions of the so-called social dimension to be proposed by the Commission.  The directives potentially affect a significant part of the Irish working population and a part which, in general terms, has tended to be under-protected by social welfare and employment legislation in the past.  Perhaps we should always bear in mind when we discuss the move towards equalising the treatment of full-time and part-time workers, in as much as that can be achieved, that part-time work of its very nature responds to a need not just of employers but also of employees.  There could be a point where State regulation would have the effect of employers ceasing to provide this type of employment. That is not what we want to achieve. A balance is needed, bearing in mind equality and the best possible treatment for employees in all sorts of non-standard employment without moving to the point where employers back off and decide it <Col N="403" /> is not for them; that it is too regulated and that Big Brother, the State, is too involved.  The aim is to get the balance right in an area that has been under-protected by social welfare and employment legislation in the past.  It is a very difficult job and one that must be handled with balance and discretion and with a real understanding of the needs of both employer and employee.</P>
    <P>The Commission had a White Paper entitled &ldquo;Completing the Internal Market&rdquo;.  This was subsequently incorporated in the Single European Act and has led to great acceleration in the work of the European Community in creating a single market.  Although the bulk of this White Paper &mdash; I know the Minister is very familiar with it &mdash; dwelt on the measures necessary to implement the economic aspects of the Single Market, it also emphasised the social aspects.  A section of the White Paper states:</P>
    <P>The Commission will pursue the dialogue with Governments and social partners to ensure that opportunities offered by completion of the Internal Market will be accompanied by appropriate measures aimed at fulfilling the Community's employment and social security objectives.</P>
    <P>This document, entitled &ldquo;Social Dimension of the Internal Market&rdquo; and was circulated in 1988, represents the Commission's view of why and how the completion of the Internal Market should have a social dimension.  It emphasises that the completion of the Internal Market should be accompanied by measures resulting in the establishment of a European &ldquo;social foundation&rdquo; by 1992.  I take it that this legislation will be part of our contribution to the social foundation.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to the circulation of the Commission's document, the European Council in 1989 adopted the Community charter of basic social rights for workers. This charter endorsed the principles that were enunciated at the time in the document &ldquo;Social Dimensions of the Internal Market&rdquo;, including among others the proposition that &ldquo;the same importance <Col N="404" /> must be attached to the social aspects as to the economic aspects of the completion of the Single Market&rdquo;.  We have spoken in different fora about economic and monetary union and there has been a stab made here and there at political union and the implications for our security and defence issues in relation to that, but very little has been said about the social aspects of the Internal Market.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposals under the social charter action programme are grouped under many different headings, including proposals to improve living and working conditions of employees, social protection, information for workers, consultation and participation in the workplace, health protection and safety at work.  In all, there are about 43 new initiatives proposed by the Commission.</P>
    <P>The three proposals for the Council directives on non-standard work which I referred to at the outset are among the first of the social action programme proposals to be published by the Commission. In identifying non-standard employment or part-time and temporary employment, as we more commonly refer to it, as an area for attention the Commission is responding to two important features of the Community's labour market and they are very important features in Ireland also.  The first one is the fact that part-time and temporary work is a large and rapidly growing element in the total labour force and the second is that social welfare and labour legislation in member states has tended to overlook the requirements of this segment of the labour force.</P>
    <P>Various different analyses by the Commission show that part-time employment accounts for about 13.5 per cent of the total labour force in the Community.  Its relative importance among member states ranges from 5 per cent in Mediterranean countries to 30 per cent in the Netherlands.  Thirty per cent of the workforce in the Netherlands are part-time workers.  Temporary employment is less significant, amounting to about 9.5 per cent of the total on a Community average. Again, there is considerable variance in its relative importance among <Col N="405" /> member states though temporary employment appears to be inversely related to economic development.  In other words, there is a greater amount in countries where there is less economic stability.  One-fifth of the Spanish workforce is engaged in temporary work as compared to 5 per cent in Belgium.  If one considers that 15 per cent of part-time workers are temporary, it would seem that about one-fifth of the Community, or 20 million workers, are engaged in some form of non-standard, temporary or part-time work.  That is a significant number.</P>
    <P>Statistics generally and trends in this area are not great nor are they easily come by but from the data that is available it is clear that the incidence of part-time employment has increased much faster than the growth in full-time employment almost everywhere.  Temporary and part-time work are not temporary phenomena, nor are they insignificant when one considers the numbers involved.  In fact, there are many good reasons why non-standard employment should be a large and growing element in the labour market generally.</P>
    <P>There is one very difficult area we have yet to come to terms with.  There is work which is not organised into part-time or temporary jobs and it is mainly carried out in the black economy because of the difficulty in getting back to social welfare benefit when part-time jobs are finished. The bureaucracy involved in signing on again and getting your entitlements after three days work, three weeks work or a month's work is an enormous disincentive to people to take part-time or temporary work.  Such work could be structured into part-time and temporary jobs or non-standard employment which comes under legislation if we could get over this difficulty.</P>
    <P>How many people come to our clinics &mdash; the Minister knows what clinics are better than most of us&mdash;with difficulties in re-establishing their entitlement, particularly to unemployment assistance, <Col N="406" /> if they get short time work of one kind or another?  If we could get over this bureaucratic difficulty we would encourage more people out of the black economy into properly structured part-time or non-standard employment.  All the legislation in the world will not get over that difficulty unless the social welfare aspect is also tackled.  If we do not sort that out, they will continue to work in the black economy.  That suits the employer and it suits them because they will still sign on at the same time.  If we could unravel the bureaucratic mess at that level we would have more jobs properly legislated for and properly structured.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons why non-standard employment should be a large and growing segment of the labour market providing we sort out the social welfare hiccups.  There is the need on the part of employers for flexibility.  That goes without saying.  There are difficulties in the economy as regards recession, increased competition, different demands for products at different times of the year, when companies want extra workers for a short period.  Equally, they want to be in a position to drop their labour force during the winter months or whenever it does not suit.  There is a growing importance of the service industries, particularly for consumer and personal services, where by its very nature, what they call &ldquo;non-standard&rdquo; hours of work are demanded by the market.  There is the need on the part of certain groups for non-standard employment to complement other activities, for example, students or women who are rearing their family and cannot work full-time in standard employment but could do four or five hours in the evening when the husband comes home or the children are back from school.  There are many reasons why non-standard employment will be a growing feature of our workforce generally.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, having given the statistics for the European position on part-time and temporary work and having <Col N="407" /> stated that the proportion of the workforce in part-time work is inversely proportionate to economic activity in the country, the figures for Ireland are that as a percentage of total employees, in 1988, 8.2 per cent of the workforce was in part-time work and we had 9.1 per cent in temporary work.  In 1983 we had 5.8 per cent in part-time work and 3.5 per cent in temporary work.  Even in this country the figures have virtually doubled in relation to those now in non-standard employment compared to 1983.  It is a very interesting phenomena and one which I am sure motivated the Minister in relation to the legislation before us today.</P>
    <P>One very important point about non-standard employment that needs underlining is that this segment of the labour force is dominated by women workers. When we are evaluating legislation in this area from a social viewpoint we must take into account not only the impact on equity as between standard and non-standard work or employees but also the contribution of legislation in this area to the equality of employment as between men and women.  Most of the workforce in non-standard employment are women. It is a fact of life, for different reasons. It suits them and it often suits the employers.  In some cases it is not just a question of suiting them but is is a question of what is available at the time.</P>
    <P>As we are a country with a level of economic development well below that of the larger and northern European member states, it is not surprising that non-standard employment in Ireland is also somewhat below the Community average.  In Ireland, women are strongly represented in the figures I have just given for part-time and temporary work, representing 70 per cent of the regular part-timers.  It is worth noting that while a large number of male part-time workers work part-time because of the absence of full-time jobs, a high proportion of women work part-time because of family responsibilities.  Senator Honan and I can <Col N="408" /> particularly identify with that fact.  The growth in the size of the non-standard employment workforce&mdash;the increase in the numbers doing part-time and temporary work in our country to translate it into the vernacular&mdash;has outpaced the extension of social welfare and labour legislation for the workers involved in nearly every member state in Europe. This has led to a situation where the scope and content of legislation varies greatly from one country to another.</P>
    <P>The rationale for the Commission's proposals in this area is, therefore, based on the three main requirements.  First, the improved operations of the Internal Market and greater transparency of the labour market.  Secondly, the improved living and working conditions of workers and, thirdly, protection of the health and safety of workers at the workplace.  It is the view of the Commission that the cost difference between member states which are the results of legislative-based discrimination as between standard and non-standard employees constitute a distortion of the labour market and should, therefore, be abolished.</P>
    <P>The Commission has noted major labour cost differences resulting from different national regulations with respect to social insurance contributions, redundancy entitlements, holiday pay and promotion.  With regard to the improvement in living and working conditions of the workers, the Commission has also noted a number of areas in which the disparity of member states' legislation calls for harmonisation, including access to training, right to information and entitlement to social assistance.</P>
    <P>The Commission has already proposed legislation in the areas of health and safety at work.  This is for all employees and does not make any specific provision for the needs of non-standard employees; in other words, the over 18 hours a week and under 18 hours a week or the A1 and J1 employee as we have referred to them up to now.  This group needs special consideration as is evidenced by statistics <Col N="409" /> from various member states showing that non-standard employees are more prone to accidents than their full-time colleagues. This can be attributed to different factors, including lack of training and inexperience on the part of the employees.</P>
    <P>There is another basic objective which the proposed European legislation hopes to meet and that is greater equality as between men and women workers.  The requirement that there should be no discrimination between men and women with regard to pay and conditions is embedded in national and Community legislation.  It may be embedded but in many cases it is merely aspirational, even at this stage.  However, the European Court of Justice has found that the requirement of equal treatment extends to indirect as well as to direct discrimination, specifically the different treatment of part-time and full-time workers can be found to be indirectly discriminatory when part-time workers are mainly women and full-time workers are mainly men.</P>
    <P>Under legislation in this country, at the moment the 18 hour cut-off has been a very important one for workers of all kinds; over 18 hours and one is considered to be a full-time worker; under 18 hours one is considered to be a part-time worker.  Almost all the entitlements under our labour legislation, until this Bill was introduced, were for full-time workers.  Only the health, safety and equality legislation was available for people who worked less than 18 hours a week.  Other benefits require a minimum of 18 hours per week and a period of employment which ranges from 13 weeks to two years.</P>
    <P>The position with social insurance is comparatively simple at the moment.  In effect, part-time workers working less than 18 hours per week benefited only from occupational injuries insurance for which a contribution of 0.5 per cent of their pay was made, payable by the employer.  Other benefits, including <Col N="410" /> maternity pay, unemployment benefit, old age and widow's pension, illness and disability benefit are not available for those working under 18 hours or part-time. However, this legislation recognises that alterations are needed to our domestic legislation with regard to part-time workers.  The legislation will materially affect the protection of such workers under Irish law and it is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Bill will anticipate some of the provisions of the three Commission directives I referred to.  In some ways it is more far reaching than even the Commission required.  Some areas have still not been covered.  Rights with respect to maternity, unfair dismissal and insolvency in the Bill are entitlements which were not proposed in the Commission directives.  The Minister is to be complimented for going further than he had to in relation to the Commission's requirements.  On the other hand, there were proposals in the directives which would require employers to extend benefits which companies give to full-time workers in the areas of training, social welfare and seniority pay to part-time and temporary workers.</P>
    <P>They are important additional benefits which the Minister has not included.  I would appreciate if the Minister could say &mdash; perhaps he did so in his opening speech which regrettably I did not hear why these areas were left out.  I would appreciate the benefit of the Minister's experience and expertise in this area.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill has just been circulated.  I confess to not having gone through it in much detail&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the schedule for next Tuesday and by next Tuesday I will be very familiar with the Social Welfare Bill.  At this stage, I have just gone through it briefly without having gone through each section and <Col N="411" /> subsection in detail.  I understand we are extending social insurance to those working less than 18 hours per week.  The entitlement to occupational benefits, for example, pensions, which the Commission directives have proposed is also an important additional entitlement.  Am I right in assuming that the Social Welfare Bill will require employers and employees to pay PRSI contributions, which will probably be one of the most significant cost items in any of the directives? I appreciate that it is not this Minister's area of responsibility but it is directly relevant to what we have been talking about and is a further step along the road towards equalising the treatment of part-time and full-time workers. I would be interested to hear the Minister's views.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if the Minister is aware of this, but there are implications in relation to the equal treatment of part-time and full-time workers which might require a change in the family income scheme which is only available to people who work at least 20 hours per week at the moment.  Are there proposals to change the requirements of the FIS?</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the legislation. I emphasise again that part-time and temporary work responds to a need of both employees and employers and whatever legislation we put in place, whatever will be required of us by way of directives from the Commission between now and the completion of the Internal Market on 1 January 1993, must respect the fact that as we equalise treatment, which is only just and right, as far as we can, we must always ensure that it is in the best interest of both the employee and the employer so that part-time work will increase in the legitimate economy and can be brought out of the black economy where, for various reasons, it has languished for far too long.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I <Col N="412" /> made a lengthy contribution when introducing the Bill earlier today.  It is important that we set out exactly what we are trying to do in this legislation.  There is one thing have learned in the Labour brief and that is that there are people outside this House who study the text of what is said, for example, people involved in management and industrial relations and schools which are partly funded by the trade union movement. They used to say about legislation that we went through some aspects in detail and not others.  In all the legislation I have brought in recently I have put the detail on the record as well as trying to answer the various questions.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for their very good contributions.  They put a lot of research into them.  I thank Senators who sat here throughout the debate, particularly Senators McKenna, Honan and others.  I acknowledge their contributions.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been given a considerable airing and the whole topic of protection for part-time workers has been teased out in some detail.  It is important that we as legislators ensure that this growing category of employees is properly protected while, on the other hand ensuring that there is no unnecessary over-regulation in this area.</P>
      <P>It is clear, as Senator Howard emphasised, that there is remarkable consensus that this legislation is necessary and, broadly speaking, there is general agreement on the content of the Bill.  During the course of today's debate a number of Senators made various points about the Bill.  I would like to address as many of these as possible.</P>
      <P>Senator McKenna said my proposals represent an enormous improvement on the situation that now obtains.  This has been acknowledged by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who described the Bill &mdash; I am grateful that they did &mdash; as the most significant labour legislation since the seventies.  In the discussion with the Congress, I explained my position on the point Senator Harte raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="413" /> In practical terms, what it means is that almost 20,000 workers who were hitherto unprotected under labour law have now been brought into the system.  It means that many thousands of workers who were not covered by the Holidays Act and whose employers took that fact as a basis for not granting paid leave can now look forward to annual paid holidays and a paid day off every public holiday, like the rest of us.  It means that many of the women workers among them can now be confident that their jobs will be kept for them if they take maternity leave.  It extends to many of them the security of knowing that they cannot be arbitrarily removed from their jobs at the whim of their employer.  If they are made redundant there are some minimum payments which will be made and periods of notice to which they are entitled.  It means that once they have the requisite service they can, like full-time workers, go to the Rights Commissioner or to the Employment Appeals Tribunal to resolve their disputes with their employers.  These are significant new developments for a very large number of workers.</P>
    <P>With reference to Senator Harte's concern about growth in part-time work, I do not think we are complacent in any way.  The important issue is that part-time workers should be protected and this is what teh Bill is about.  Many Senators have expressed views which broadly seek to grant part-time workers rights over and above those which full-time workers enjoy under the relevant Acts.  It is not the intention of this Bill to concern itself in this way but to provide <i>pro rata</i> treatment for part-timers.  The mechanism we employ to do this is to treat them in the same way as full-time workers.  All those part-time workers who have had continuous service for not less than 13 weeks are normally expected to work not less than eight hours a week and are excluded from the various Acts including Unfair Dismissal etc., by virtue <Col N="414" /> of an exclusion provision generally identified by hours and sometimes by social insurance status.</P>
    <P>This is the basic approach taken in the Bill.  It is important that they should be clearly understood, as it governs my response to calls seeking to give part-timers more favourable rights than their full-time colleagues.  It is not seeking to do that; it is seeking to give parity with those that are already covered n the Acts I have amended.  This is also the reason behind my inability to accept the amendments about the definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; and &ldquo;employee&rdquo;.  I am not proposing to change the scope of each of these Acts and it is not necessary.</P>
    <P>The issue of exploitation of young workers was raised by a number of Senators.  Senator O'Reilly spoke at length about that and made the point that part-time work is often a form of employment which is taken up by young people.  I share Senator'O'Reilly's concern about the exploitation of these young persons, particularly in the retail trade.  A number of other Senators mentioned the point about retail trade also. This exploitation was most evident in situations where some supermarkets kept their part-time employees limited to working 17½  hours per week purely to evade their obligation under the labour law when the threshold was 18 hours. They did likewise when it was 21 hours, they limited the hours to 20½. This Bill will stamp out this procedure and should lead to major improvements for workers who are very vulnerable to exploitation. The measures proposed by my colleague the Minister for Social Welfare are also relevant to this question of exploitation, as was mentioned by Senators McKenna and Ó Cuív.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly spoke about parental leave and leave for adoptive parents.  In the context of this Bill I interpreted his remarks as general and primarily a matter of getting on the record a desire that statutory measures should be introduced <Col N="415" /> generally in place of the present arrangements. I do not interpret his remarks as a proposal that leave should be introduced exclusively for part-time workers.  The question of making a statutory provision has been considered on a number of occasions in recent years.  However, in the context of other social priorities, it is considered inopportune to introduce statutory provisions.  I intend to keep the matter under review and I have already indicated that in the Dáil.  It would not be appropriate for me to provide for this matter in the legislation for part-time workers exclusively because that is going into the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>In relation to statistics, Senator Ryan asked a question about the numbers excluded.  Some 82,000 people describe themselves as part-timers under the labour force survey and some of them are working very long hours.  Some of them are working over 18 hours, perhaps 30 hours, but they are not full-time.  Some 20,000 people work less than 18 hours and less than 5,000 work less than eight hours.  What we would be excluding in this legislation is probably something like 9 per cent of the hours worked by part-time workers who are not covered by labour legislation.  They would be spread all over the place&mdash;some with a few hours now and again.</P>
    <P>On international comparisons, Senator Ryan asked about the position of part-time workers in Scandinavia.  The position is that there is no generally applicable statutory definition of part-time work in Norway and Sweden.  In Denmark the number of hours worked affects eligibility for certain rights and benefits.  For example part-time workers in Denmark, a country mentioned by a number of Senators, must work at least 15 hours a week to enjoy the same level of employment security from dismissal as full-time workers.  As regards annual leave, part-time workers get the same <i>pro rata</i> entitlement in Denmark and Norway.  However, in Sweden if a worker works for less than three months or for <Col N="416" /> less than 60 hours, they have no entitlement to annual leave.  The implications of the Senator's remark was that perhaps we were keeping more in line with EC laws and were far behind Scandinavia but that is not the case.  I hope that the information is of some benefit to Senator Ryan.  My source of information for all of the records, and particularly these ones, is the ILO &ldquo;Conditions of Work Digest, 1989.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly, Senator Ryan and Senator Harte reflected on the concern mentioned by the Congress of Trade Unions about the growth of non-standard forms of employment, including contract work and agency work.  Congress requested that the Bill be amended to incorporate its own definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; and &ldquo;employee&rdquo;.  I do not propose to take this up, as i have already explained.  Senator Harte pointed out that there are a number of issues involved in this area and it is useful to tease them out.  The situation about agency workers needs to be examined.  We have had a lot of research on part-time workers but we have very little surveys done on contract work or agency work.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard made the valid point that there are many very good employers. Indeed, the vast majority of employers are very good employers and I do not think we should try to create disincentives for them.  What we have to do is close off loopholes that are used.  I would like to agree with Senator Howard that it is only small employers who get into these difficulties and who become unscrupulous employers but that has not been my experience over the years in various capacities involved in industrial relations. The people who played ducks and drakes with the legislation over the past 15 years since 1975 to a great degree were some of our larger employers.  I do not intend to mention companies but it is a fact that some of the biggest employers, perhaps for reasons relating to the operation of their own businesses, were involved.  I do not expect people to have the same <Col N="417" /> workforce in on a Monday as a Saturday if all the customers come in on a Saturday and very few on a Monday.  It would be nonsensical for people to work a 35 hour week and have the same number in all the time.  I have rejected that concept from the start.  However, some of the bigger employers played ducks and drakes with the legislation and it is no good in people trying to deny it.  Senator Howard said he never had a constituent or met a person who complained about exploitation.  In some ways I wish I was in the same position.  My life would have been very much easier in the past few years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that there are probably better people down there than some of the delegations met. Some of the biggest employers in the country who have locations everywhere, including Clare, when the reduced the hours from 21 to 18 on the following Friday reprogrammed their computers to 17 hours 50 minutes to block out the rights.  I would not dare mention the name of that large company.  We have to protect people against that type of blatant exploitation.  I will do equally so.  I have spoken to most of the major firms who were abusers and they are quite happy with the spirit of the legislation.  We can change the threshold if people try to break it out I do not believe they will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in relation to agency workers needs to be examined.  I have, accordingly, undertaken in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social progress</i> to examine the position of agency workers and the legislation relating to the control of employment agencies and that review will take some time, but I do not consider it should hold up this Bill at the moment.  There is also the question of the nature and extent of change in relation to contracting.  Some people believe that there has been a dramatic increase in subcontracting or production services from <Col N="418" /> enterprises to sub-contractors.  The evidence for this is often anecdotal and often relates to a small number of high profile examples. We have to be very careful in that area.</P>
    <P>My impressionis that for reasons of production and market strategy companies are in the process of decentralising and rationalising and jobs are being devolved; catering, cleaning, transport and security are good examples of this. The point is, however, that many of the workers in these jobs remain employees, employees of the new sub-contractors perhaps, but employees nevertheless and are fully protected under labour law. That is a matter i want to point out to a number of people because I think it was missed by both Houses during the debate.</P>
    <P>I cannot deny that there are also those who become or who are made to become self-employed as a result of these strategies. There is nothing new about this nor is there anything intrinsically wrong with it.  It is a practice which has obtained for a long time.  My concern would be what I would term bogus self-employed workers, close to the black economy, freelancers without the responsibilities and the right either or workers or of the self-employed. We are continuing to gather information about the extent and location of this category, not just because it concerns labour law but also because of its responsibility <i>vos-á-vis</i> tax and social security.  Senator Doyle raised that question today, and I agree with her.  I agree with Senator Harte also that it is a matter of dealing with the question under a Bill covering part-time work.  It is a much bigger question.  However, the issues raised are relevant to my labour legislation programme for the nineties.  As indicated, I propose to start with the situation of agency workers.</P>
    <P>Senators expressed concern about the post-Dickensian exploitation by employers and suggested that there should be a statutory minimum income. That is a preference that has been indicated for conclusion in the provision for a <Col N="419" /> statutory national minimum wage in the Bill.  Low pay is usually associated with certain sectors of the industry and services where part-time workers also predominate. I can understand how in that context the pointhas been raised here.</P>
    <P>It is well to recognise where the debate on a statutory minimum wage currently stands.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions proposed in the course of discussions on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social progress </i> that there should be a statutory national minimum wage and the employer organisations stated their total opposition to the proposal.  It has been agreed that during the period of the programme the Employer-Labour Conference would consider all the issues involved including the operation of the joint labour committee system in regard to a statutory minimum wage.</P>
    <P>For my part, I have made my policy clear.  Much low pay work tends to be unskilled, requiring few qualifications, with little or no prospects of promotion, and subject to high rate of labour turnover. As a consequence, measures to comprehensively tackle the problem must cover a range of areas such as education, training, social benefits and taxation as well as the question of pay. Research carried out by my Department on the economic effects of minimum wage legislation concludes that such legislation could reduce employment levels.  It is also the case that American research, bears this out.  According to this research, the effects of this reduction would be concentrated most severely on vulnerable groups, such as young workers, women and the least well-educated and, I would venture to say, part-time workers.  This research also indicates little connenctionbetween low pay and poverty, as many of the low paid do not come from low income households. A statutory minimum wage is, therefore, regarded as being an ineffective anti-poverty measure.  Pending the outcome of <Col N="420" /> the Employer-Labour Conference examination it is my conviction that in attempting to address the low paid problem we must look at all the factors associated with low pay and the categories of workers involved.</P>
    <P>As far as pay determination is concerned, I am still inclined to the view that the best approach is collective bargaining operating in conjunction with the joint labour committee system.  Because of lack of time I cannot go into that point but I just want to say people who talk glibly about low pay that they should really stop to think and examine what is happening everywhere.  I am not saying that somewhere down the line we may not need a statutory minimum pay, although I think it should be confined to sectors, otherwise we will create great difficulties for employment.  It is an issue that has to be teased out and rarely do we hear people putting forward constructive arguments on it.  I am prepared to debate it and have a look at it but I still remain to be convinced tht it will not do more harm than good.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the concern of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions about a provision that was covered in the Bill as originally published, that provision which exempted part-time employees from having to contribute to the social insurance fund in relation to entitlements to redundancy payments which these employees are being granted under the Bill.  However, since the publication of this Bill in December the Minister for Social Welfare has enacted social insurance cover to part-time workers and because of a provision related to this it was included in the Social Welfare Bill and I was able to delete it in the Dáil.  The provision which Congress had expressed concern about in the Bill is now gone.  In short, I can assure Senator O'Reilly that regular part-time employees under the Bill will enjoy full entitlements to redundancy. <Col N="421" /> payments on the same basis as their full-time colleagues.  Senator McKenna also raised that issue.</P>
    <P>On the sharing of family responsibilities, I would like to thank Senator McKenna, Senator Ryan and Senator O'Keeffe for underscoring the point that there should be a greater sharing of family responsibilities, a view with which I would agree.  In my capacity as Minister responsible for employment equality, I have initiated a range of measures of positive action, the development of child care services and legislative reform to achieve that aim of more equitable sharing. My aim in relation to reform of the law on part-time work is not to trap women in a part-time work ghetto but to ensure that if they choose to work part-time they will not be treated as secondclass citizens under the law.</P>
    <P>In response to a number of Senators whose contributions were on this issue, particularly Senator Ryan, it is fair to say that the reforms in this Bill owe very little to classic supply and demand analyses.  I agree with the Senator when he says that this Bill will not result in the disappearance of large numbers of part-time jobs. That is not what we are seeking to do.  A number of Senators raised the issue of enforcement of employment regulation orders set out by the joint labour committees. I would like to assure the Seanad that these orders are in force and, to ensure that, I have increased the number of labour inspectors in the Department. Inspections have increased by about 50 per cent.  During 1990, over 4,000 inspections were carried out under employment regulation orders and I intend to ensure that this practice continues.</P>
    <P>The question as to how this Bill is to be enforced in relation to part-time workers was raised by almost every Senator. These workers will now enjoy for the first time free access to the Employment Appeal Tribunal wherever they are being denied their statutory entitlements.  The tribunal over the years has done sterling work in rooting out poor employment <Col N="422" /> practices in relation to full employment and I now expect that the powers contained in the Bill will enable the tribunal to deal with any denial of statutory rights.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte asked me to respond to the suggestion by Congress that the Redundancy Payments Acts will provide a more appropriate mechanism than the First Schedule to the Minimunm Notice and Terms of Employment Act for calculating continuous service.  It was also indicated that unscrupulous employers will use fixed term contracts to avoid obligations imposed by the Bill.  It was suggested that we would take on board a Congress idea of alternative important social welfare legislation, the notion of cumulative service, 13 weeks service for half a year.  I have looked at these suggestions but I do not believe it necessary to amend the Bill in this respect, principally because the First Schedule is already widely used.  It has proved in practice to be a very effective mechanism for calculating continuous service.  Any disputes which might arise can be dealt with by the Employment Appeal Tribunal.  To make absolutely sure that the tribunal would have an expressed power to maximise the situations where employers were deliberately attempting to avoid obligations in the Bill, I introduced the anti-evasion provision in section 2 (2) and I am confident that this gives the tribunal wide enough powers to deal with any attempt to get around the hours and service qualifications in the Bill.  That, again, arose briefly from the debate in the Dáil. I think it closes off any loopholes for employers who set out deliberately to get around the threshold.</P>
    <P>Senators Harte and O'Toole have been critical of the retention of thresholds.  In a perfect world maybe we could dispose of thresholds but the reality is that labour laws and the mechanism set up to ensure that these are observed and that people can exercise their rights under those laws, impose costs on the employer, the Exchequer and on society generally.  In deciding how far I could extend the social <Col N="423" /> policy measure I had regard to several factors.  First, as I already explained, there is the position of the Social Affairs Commissioner who has maintained an eight hour threshold in a number of her recent proposals.  I do think she would not have done so if it was contrary to the judgments of the European Court of Justice.  Secondly I have had regard to the numbers of hours which part-time workers work according to a labour force survey and I have pitched the level at this point.  It brings in a very high proportion, about 91 per cent of the man-hours worked by those working less than 18 hours per week.  Again, this was something we agreed in the consultations which preceded publication of the Bill and to entirely remove the threshold would give rise to problems out of proportion to the benefits received.  We are not out of line with any of the suggestions made and the various research carried out in the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>With regard to the points raised by Senators O'Keeffe and Harte about the possibility of unscrupulous employers trying to avoid responsibility arising under the legislation; section 2 (2) applies.  Some concerns have been expressed by Senators O'Reilly and Howard that the provisions of the Bill would force people into the black economy. It is the view that advanced statutory protection increases the gross cost of labour or the employers long-range commitment on future costs and, for this reason, there will be recourse to the informal sector sometimes with and sometimes without the workers' concurrence. Nobody can deny that this is one possible reaction to government initiatives whether in the tax field, the extensions of social security or labour law generally and that a certain number of workers and employers are prepared to live with the long-term consequences of that kind of insecurity.</P>
    <P>There is an equally compelling argument on the other side, that this Bill provides an incentive to keep people in <Col N="424" /> the formal labour market and my proposals are designed to encourage workers to stay out of the black economy.  I believe that is what will happen because now there are very good entitlements for people to stay out of it.  The amendments the Minister will make to the Social Welfare Act in the debate here next week will make that obvious.  It will only be a person on very low hours and very low money who will have any incentive now to go on the black economy.  If you take the rate of pay paid to lounge boys and lounge girls and with the hours threshold and the payment of money, as set out in the social welfare legislation, there is not much of an incentive.  However, it is something we can review as time goes on.</P>
    <P>The eight hour requirement was chosen because it was felt that a minimum reduction to 14 hours would not benefit part-time workers and it would be abused.  The reduction of the threshold to eight hours was considered as more suitable because first, the desirability of rendering it impractical for unscrupulous employers to reduce the working hours for part-time employees in order to avoid incurring statutory obligations and secondly, the desirability of matching the eight hour threshold to the proposed EC directives on part-time workers.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville raised some issues concerning the complexity of labour law, the need for consolidation and particularly the need for comprehensive explanatory literature for part-time workers and their rights under labour law through the published Departmental Guide to Labour Law I have responded to the need to reduce the burden on small employers in that regard.  I can assure the Seanad that I will be arranging for the issue of appropriate explanatory literature on this Bill, as I have done in the past year on the Bill relating to industrial relations.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole spoke at length on the question of people moving in and out of part-time status.  The answer to this is the new threshold employed by the <Col N="425" /> Minister for Social Welfare, the consequences of which is that most part-time workers are now fully insurable.  Part-time workers under this Bill have exactly the some means of redress in the event of disputes as full-time workers, that is for unfair dismissal and access to a tribunal. In addition to the first 13 weeks they have recourse to a tribunal under section 2 (5) of the Act.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle referred to the nonstandard directives.  The three non-standard directives cover part-time work, temporary fixed time and agency workers.  I have mentioned agency workers but I am going to take that separately. This will cover and do better than the Act dealing with part-time work. Because I wanted to deal with the matter separately and deal with part-time workers right across the economy this question will be dealt with on another occasion as soon as we have all the data.</P>
    <P>As far as the part-time workers are concerned, we are more or less in course with the EC Directive.  There is a common position already on safety and health in the draft directive for temporary workers.  There are some ongoing discussions and there are very widely different views in member states.  I have a meeting in Luxembourg shortly where we will be reviewing what progress we can make in these areas.  Basically, we have agreement on part-time workers' safety and health.  There will be no difficulty in that.  Our legislation is in line.  The Bill we passed in 1989 is in line with the EC Directives.  In regard to other legislation we may have to make changes in due course and I am looking at some areas in that connection.</P>
    <P>I have tried as far as possible to answer questions that arose in the debate.  I thank Senators for their co-operation.  It is important that the Bill should be through by 5 April so that it can be lined up with social welfare legislation.</P>

      <P>I welcome section 2.  I have a case of a man who worked for 50 years; he worked temporary full-time for the South-Eastern Health Board for the past 20 years and at 85 years of age could not retire as a dental surgeon in the local hospital because he was not entitled to redundancy or pensions of any kind.  He pre-dated the establishment of health boards.  I had to go pleading to the health board to give him a few pounds to let him retire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank the Minister for coming to this House to reply to my motion.  Since 1967 there have been major problems, with a long waiting list for repairs and extensions to national schools and colleges and she tackled this with great energy and determination.  She had to deal with a list of broken promises going back many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the problem with Ardfinnan national school, patience has worn thin.  They have been trying for the past ten years to provide an extension to their school.  The Ardfinnan national school finance committee started fund-raising for the extension in May 1982 and continued until 1985.  This entailed a lot of voluntary work.  The site was prepared and the playground was extended in 1986 at a cost of £13,000.  That cost would have doubled were it not for the voluntary help given by people, with machinery and materials.  I congratulate the school <Col N="429" /> committee, the teaching staff and parents.  Their contribution to the cost of the extension to the school has been on deposit in the bank since 1985.  Despite many deputations over the years to various Ministers and Departmental officials, they seem to be no nearer to getting their extension.</P>
    <P>Two pre-fabs were acquired in 1986, after a long wait and many promises prior to that, to alleviate overcrowding.  I have been informed by the principal that the floors of those pre-fabs are rotten due to flooding last year.  In the interest of health and because of their danger to pupils they will have to be replaced.  They are of very poor quality, they are made of glorified plywood.  It is sad that this type of material is put into a school where there are many pupils.  The flooding from the River Suir was unavoidable and damage was caused to other private property in the village of Ardfinnan also.</P>
    <P>The Minister may remember having met the parish priest, Fr. Callinan, in Powerstown when opening a school.  He was trying to get progress on this project and he is still very concerned.  Fr. Callinan also contacted the Department to be told that the person dealing with this was on sick leave and three months later he was told that the person was on holidays. I am not making this up, it came direct from the parish priest.  More recently he was told that the plans were not ready yet as the Department were very busy.  I know the Department are busy as is the Minister and this is appreciated by everybody.</P>
    <P>It is now 1991 and there are over 300 pupils attending that school who have collected over £45,000.  This money has been in the bank since 1985 and the parents are very concerned about what will happen.  The school board, parents and staff are totally disillusioned at this stage and they will not go on any more deputations as they believe it is a waste of time.  Now that the pre-fab floors are rotten they would like to get on with the <Col N="430" /> building of the extension.  The parishioners who have contributed £45,000 and put in the voluntary work preparing the site and the playground feel that the whole thing was a waste of time.  They have seen no progress whatsoever.  I hope the Minister will have some good news for me this evening.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Senator put down this motion on the Adjournment. I do not blame the people for being wary and worried about how the extension is progressing.  I put it to the House and to the Senator that it was when the Senator put the skids under me, so to speak, that anything got going on it.  With respect, I cannot speak for the delays of 1982 and 1985 and pre-fabs along the way.  Pre-fabs are unsatisfactory and in the Programme for Government there is a phased programme for their elimination.</P>
      <P>When the Senator and others brought Ardfinnan to my attention, things started to move.  It is a fine school; there are ten teachers and a principal.  There are 306 pupils enrolled, it is what we would call a &ldquo;strong&rdquo; school and we would like it to remain so for many years.  I understand the standard of teaching and the standard of management is of the highest order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions are not satisfactory.  I do not have an intimate knowledge of the floors in the pre-fab but the conditions are not satisfactory in that school.  The reverend manager also outlined that to me.  The architectural planning for the project is in hand and is proceeding.  It involves planning permission, architectural planning, the sketch plans and the working drawings.  That process has started.  I admit that between 1982 and 1986 when they provided the pre-fabs, it was at a standstill.  There is no doubt about that.  I suppose I will be accused of making a political point but that is quite genuine.  I looked at the file and there was nothing done in that four years except the provision of two pre-fabs.  The architectural planning is in hands and this will <Col N="431" /> be completed at the earliest possible date.  There are a number of factors outside our control, including planning approval and various other matters but it is in hand.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Senator that he and I keep a watch on this matter as it progresses. He should feel free to use my offices or to contact me to find out how matters are faring.  I will keep a personal interest in the case, particularly knowing the urgency of the matter and how the <Col N="432" /> patience and forebearance of the community, of the teachers and children has been tested.  Many children have passed through that school since the money for the work was first lodged.  I am interested in furthering the case and, as I said, the architectural planning is in progress.  We will try to work speedily to bring the matter to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 21 March 1991.</P>
