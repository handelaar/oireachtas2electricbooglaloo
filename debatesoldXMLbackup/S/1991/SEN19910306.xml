      <P>I have notice from Senator Howard that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to take immediate action to alleviate the severe overcrowding of patients in Ennis General Hospital because of acute shortage of beds.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure the continuation after 1995 of the post primary school at Mount Trenchard, Foynes, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for a paediatric unit at Wexford General Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1874" /> I also received notice from Senator O'Keeffe of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The present state of negotiations on the sale of Irish Steel and in the event of international interest having dissipated the proposals he has for the long term viability of the plant.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to increase support to the Irish Victims Support Group and other related victim support services.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to hold a public inquiry into any proposed infill and housing development at West Pier, Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Jackman of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to outline the strategy of future funding arrangements for integrated rural development, in particular the Slievefelim pilot programme in the Tipperary-Limerick area.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Howard, Neville, Doyle, O'Keeffe, Cosgrave, Ross and Jackman as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Howard's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Neville, Doyle, O'Keeffe, Cosgrave, Ross and Jackman may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take item No. 3, the motion on the Appropriation Act, 1990, until 6 o'clock.  There will be a sos between 6 p.m. and 6.30 p.m.  From 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. we take motion 73, the Independents' motion and I would draw Member's attention to the fact that <Col N="1875" /> there is an amendment circulated &mdash; it has been mentioned on the Supplementary Order Paper &mdash; in regard to that particular motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we have a copy of the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is circulated, I understand. At 8 p.m. we resume discussion on the motion on the Appropriation Act, 1990, and the Minister is to reply not later than 9.45 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, first, may I ask the Leader of the House if he could indicate to us what Government Bills other than those already on the Order Paper he expects to introduce in the House before the end of the session.</P>
      <P>Secondly, may I ask him &mdash; and ask him with a great sense of urgency &mdash; if he would try to respond to the request that has come from this side of the House over the past number of weeks for a debate on Northern Ireland?  The bloody killings of the past week indicate the urgency of this debate, allied to the fact that there seems to be closeness of agreement between all the constitutional parties. I think all sides here would welcome an opportunity to have a debate as soon as possible on Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, last week the Leader of the House responded very quickly to the request for statements on the Gulf, and for that I commend him. He did something which the other House was not capable of doing and in a way with which all of us here were very pleased.  To a certain extent he has whetted our appetite and I believe there is now a range of foreign policy issues &mdash; certainly, the aftermath of the Gulf War, South Africa, the Baltic states; and Senator Ryan has mentioned a number of issues in recent times.  It would be of great value if within the next week or two he could arrange to have a day set aside for a wide-ranging foreign affairs debate. The issues and the interest are there and I would appeal to him in the interest of <Col N="1876" /> the House that he would as far as possible accede to this request.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points.  First, I asked the Leader of the House last week if he would indicate to us how he thought Committee Stage of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill would be taken.  It is a long and complex piece of legislation.  I asked that we would have some prior indication of when particular sections were proposed to be taken.  I suggest that in order to expedite the business and to ensure that the matter is dealt with fully &mdash; I have no doubt it will be changed quite considerably in the course of debate &mdash; perhaps we should organise it in such a way that certain parts are taken on particular days or that a set number of sections are taken on particular days rather than to start off with the view that we are going to head straight into this Bill and see how far we get on it.  It deserves longer consideration and I think the Minister and Department would prefer to have it that way.</P>
      <P>The matter of a debate on education was raised in the course of the last session. At that stage the Minister herself during the course of the debate here, and I think also the Leader of the House, indicated that the possibility of a debate during each session on developments in education was something that would be welcomed.  Certainly, in the light of the role of education <i>vis-a-vis</i> discussions and negotiations, that would be very much welcomed.</P>
      <P>Having said that, however, I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on Northern Ireland as taking precedence over all other issues at this time.  It was also called for recently by Senator McGowan.  It is time to consider that issue at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House if he would make time available for debate on homelessness in view of the problems which Fr. Peter McVerry is at present experiencing in relation to the accommodation of homeless boys in <Col N="1877" /> the Dublin area and the crisis of homelessness among young people in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Secondly, may I ask the Leader if he can give us any indication as to the status of the local government reform legislation, when we can expect it or, indeed, if we can expect it in this session?  Finally, will the Leader of the House give us some update on the progress if any, which has been made, in relation to suggestions for reform of the business of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would first like to congratulate Miss Blake on her appointment and ask the Leader of the House if he would confer with the Minister for Justice with regard to motion 75:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to reform the Irish bail laws, and to hold a constitutional referendum in line with the local government elections to facilitate this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Upton said with regard to the question of reform of procedures.  I understood there was a committee which had met and made some recommendations but perhaps my memory is hazy.  I say this because I would like, for example, certain informations which you, Sir, might be able to place in my possession.  For example, I understand there is in existence &mdash; and perhaps you could confirm this &mdash; a book of guidelines covering rulings from the Chair on various issues such as raising matters under Standing Order 29 and so on.  If this does exist and can be confirmed, could this not be made available to Members of the House so that we can frame motions in such a way that they will fall within the remit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not in order on the Order of Business, Senator. I ask you to stay with the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a matter of concern.  If this body is still sitting, perhaps the Leader of the House would draw this matter to its attention.  I think we could perform more efficiently if we had <Col N="1878" /> this information.  You will recall, Sir, that during debate on the Altamont Bill we discovered there was a completely different&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The question brought to mind by Senator Honan is to ask the Leader if he is aware that, unlike the Fianna Fáil Party, the Independents are not in a situation of having <i>uno duce</i> or <i>una voce</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another matter that could easily be brought up and that is that on many occasions Ministers come in during times allocated to Members of this House and they take much of the time that should be properly allocated to Senators.</P>

      <P>I ask the Senator to put a question to the Leader of the House, if he has one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indeed.  I would like to support what Senator Manning said about a foreign affairs debate.  I note that at least one of the items appears to have been overtaken by events.  I refer directly to motion 72 in the names of Senator Ryan and Senator O'Toole, about the Gulf War.  Senator Manning referred to the aftermath of the Gulf War and surely, Sir, it would be appropriate for us, in the light of our being a neutral nation, to say something about the plight of the Palestinians in Kuwait.  I believe we have a responsibility to say something in terms of our international guardianship of human rights.  I believe many Members in the House would welcome a debate on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to <Col N="1879" /> congratulate Miss Blake, our new Clerk Assistant, and wish her well in her new job.  Also, I would like to focus again on the number of issues we brought up in the distant past and some of them in the recent past; for example, the question of a debate on Northern Ireland and a debate on the prisons.  I see once again, indeed almost every day in the papers, where there is not just a juvenile but a child, a 13-year old boy, for whom there is no residential centre.  Senator Upton mentioned the situation of the homeless and the flat in Ballymun where Father Peter McVerry is trying to accommodate these young lads who are at risk.  Certainly, the whole area of prisons requires a debate and we have been asking for it for a long time.</P>
      <P>In relation to a debate on education, may I ask the Leader of the House whether he will include such a debate? Senator O'Toole also mentioned that matter.  There are very considerable developments taking place in this area. Tomorrow, for example, is the launch of the new National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and a number of other areas.  I would like time to be given to that.  I would like the Leader of the House to refer to that matter.</P>
      <P>I would also like to ask if, in view of the daily collapse of the case against the Birmingham Six and the imminent release of those people who have been in prison now for almost 17 years, people who have obviously been in prison largely because they were Irish people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Leader of the House any thoughts on an appropriate way for us to receive or honour them in some way?  May I ask whether it is appropriate to refer to some outrageous remarks that were made by a Minister in the other House in relation to rejecting the principle of votes for emigrants on the grounds they might abuse them, whereas nearly every other country in the European Community has that facility?</P>

      <P>I know a coalition Government is difficult.  I appreciate that coalition is painful and that it involves <Col N="1881" /> compromise.  May I have some indication from the Leader of the House when or if Government amendments to the Environmental Protection Agency Bill will be introduced?  The Minister, quite rightly, asked us to be as prompt as we could with our amendments on this side to give time for reasonable consideration. I think it is reasonable to say that those of us who have to consider amendments from the Government should be entitled to a similar period of time.  May I know if there are going to be amendments and, if there are, when they will be published. Perhaps they have been published in which case I stand corrected.</P>
      <P>As they say in America, read my lips. I agree with Senator Manning that we need a debate on foreign affairs.  I look forward to hearing all the defenders of freedom in the Gulf defend the decision to suppress any possibility of democracy either in Kuwait or Iraq in future.  I believe that freedom means democracy and I would like to hear people explain this.  There is a whole series of issues.  We have, unquestionably, a new word&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say in passing that I do not agree with Senator Norris and his strictures on the Ministers speaking too long.  We have a problem in getting Ministers in here to speak sufficiently long in this House.  Perhaps the Leader of the House might give consideration to some arrangements under which if Ministers are speaking at length there might be some extended time so that time is not whittled away from Senators.  However, I welcome any Minister coming to this House, speaking at length and treating us with the respect we deserve.</P>
      <P>I would like to put a question to the Leader of the House in support of Senator Manning.  The Leader has been very helpful recently in convening debates at short notice on a number of issues &mdash; for example, including a very fast response to the Gulf issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is leading me on to <Col N="1883" /> ask you, as we requested two or three weeks ago, to arrange with considerable haste a debate in this House in relation to the Northern Ireland question and the initiative taken by Secretary of State Brooke.  From what we read, it is reaching crisis proportions but unfortunately it is an issue which apparently is not being discussed in the Oireachtas. We are completely at the mercy of the Executive for what&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take your point but if we could have an urgent debate on this issue it would be helpful to the whole process of democracy and would express our interest in this part of our island. Secondly, I support Senator Manning in asking the Leader of the House to arrange a debate on foreign policy issues. My principal concern is the post-Gulf War situation in the Middle East and the urgent necessity for a fundamental settlement of the Middle East question, which is centred on the Palestine question.</P>

      <P>First, I would like to add my congratulations to Miss Blake on her appointment as Clerk Assistant.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I would like to support Senator Costello and Senator O'Toole in looking for a debate on education.  Unlike the situation where Ministers may not be available, the Minister made it quite clear when she was speaking on the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill in the last session that she would like to be here once every session.  This session is nearly at its conclusion and I ask that the Leader would convey our invitation to the Minister to come before Easter, because there are many burning issues in education that need to be addressed, as already outlined.</P>

I understand from the Order of Business <Col N="1884" /> today that we are again sitting until 10 o'clock tonight.  When I first came here almost 21 years ago it was customary to sit until that hour in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The late John Kelly went to great lengths to persuade the Oireachtas to change to an earlier, and I think the term used was a more respectable concluding time.  It seems now we are slipping back into&mdash;&mdash;</P>

One does not mind that for a couple of weeks, but it now seems that every week we sit until 10.30 p.m. The House is owed an explanation as to where this decision was made, who made it and why it was made.

      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House when is it intended to have a debate on the health services?  I want to stress very briefly that the position on the health services at present is absolutely dire and I think a debate at an early date is urgent.  I want to wholeheartedly support the point made by Senator Kennedy in this regard.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Government side, I would like to congratulate Miss Blake on her appointment and wish her very well in her new role.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning asked for details of Government Bills for the two or three weeks before Easter.  At the moment it is suggested to me that we will have the Sugar Bill, The Worker Protection (Regular Part-time Employees) Bill, the Radiological Protection Bill, the Sea Pollution Bill, the Destructive Insects and Pests (Amendment) Bill and the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill.  In addition, I have been, as always, endeavouring to have new legislation initiated and I am hopeful that something will come to us before Easter.  Obviously, if a request came from the Minister for a Bill to be initiated here we would like to facilitate him if at all possible.  That is the programme coming up to the Easter recess.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning also asked for a debate on Northern Ireland.  I cannot say at this time if that is on.  He also asked for a debate on foreign affairs.  Again, I cannot give any commitments on that before Easter.  I will examine it, but I do not think it is possible in the light of all the legislation on hand.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole asked, as did other Senators, how Committee Stage of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill might progress.  Obviously, there will be many amendments, and I would imagine that the Government, too, would have amendments to such a major Bill.  I was led to believe that we would take Committee Stage next week; but, if not next week, certainly the week after.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole and Jackman asked for a debate on education.  I will certainly make inquiries and see if it is possible. With so many good things happening in Education, I think the Minister would be very happy to talk to us.  The Northern Ireland situation was also raised by Senator O'Toole and I have indicated what might happen there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Upton referred specifically to the position that Fr. Peter McVerry finds himself in and asked for a debate on that broad issue.  As I said to Senator Upton, it is a matter suitable for Private Members' <Col N="1886" /> time and it is certainly suitable for mention in the Child Care Bill, which we will be discussing tomorrow.  I cannot see that I will be making time available for a discussion specifically on that point.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton mentioned local government reform and when we might discuss that matter.  My understanding is that it will be probably in April or May or thereabouts.  Senator Neville asked about motion 75.  I have no plans to take that at the present time.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris queried the Order of Business.  He is right in saying that it has been discussed by &ldquo;some committee&rdquo;, as he put it.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges have mentioned it and had some discussion on it last week.  It would probably be true to say that there will be ongoing discussions on the Order of Business for a few weeks at least with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris also raised the foreign affairs issue and I have explained that.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello asked specifically about a debate on education and on the prison system.  I am very anxious about this.  I gave a commitment to Senator Brendan Ryan, Senator Harte and other Senators about the prison situation.  I would certainly like to do something about that and I am trying to do something, if possible, before the Easter recess.  He also raised the question of education and of the Birmingham Six which were not relevant.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Foighil raised a question about Seomra na Gaeilge which is not relevant to the Order of Business.  I understand the point he made and I know it is causing concern to many Senators.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan asked about Government amendments.  I imagine that there will be amendments from the Government side.  He also asked for a foreign affairs debate and a prisons debate.  We will have Seachtain na Gaeilge next week.  We are actively pursuing a two hour debate as agreed last week and we hope to have it next week.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy referred to the funding of health boards.  That is suitable for <Col N="1887" /> Private Members' Business and I have no plans to take it in Government time.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton referred to the question of Ministers coming in here and speaking for a long time.  I support what he said.  It has been a tradition in this House that if a Minister comes in and wants to leave his script aside and continue as Minister O'Kennedy did last week when he gave us a fine contribution on agriculture, he should be allowed to do so.  I understand and appreciate his point that if that happens again, there might be some extra time made available. We will talk about that again.  He also asked about foreign affairs and the post Gulf War situation.  I have outlined my position on that.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman referred to a debate on education.</P>

      <P>Senator McMahon referred to long sittings. The reality is that it was the Senator's side of the House that asked for long sittings.  We have so much business to discuss that it is necessary now to sit for the extra two hours on Wednesdays.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting the country on an even keel again.  If we are honest it must amaze us where the Government are getting money after starting from such a low base a few years ago and how so much work is being done.  In my county we have had regional water schemes and augmentation to those schemes.  There is a new sewerage scheme coming on stream in Strandhill and we have had two small group sewerage schemes.  Small sewerage schemes for rural villages are a great advantage and if we are to continue planning for villages, we must have such schemes.  The way to do that is to provide a good water supply and a good sewerage system within those small villages.  I am pleased that we are progressing in that way and that we have more small group schemes in the pipeline which I hope the Minister will sanction so that we can begin work on them this year.  They are beneficial in so many ways.  We have the opportunity to build more old peoples' dwellings in serviced areas.  The more houses we build for old people and pass on to other old people so as to keep them in stock all the time, the more we do to keep people within their community.  In rural Ireland many people live away from villages and when they get on in years it is not easy for them to get to the village. We cannot have houses in villages without the necessary infrastructure.  In that regard local authorities are doing a very good job and getting excellent value for money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It amazes me in a scheme recently in Sligo that where chimneys did not work properly the Minister for the Environment was blamed.  This matter hit the national headlines.  When we open houses and schemes all credit is given to architects and engineers but when anything goes wrong the Minister is blamed. We should have a system of checks on professional people and surcharge those <Col N="1889" /> who do a bad job.  They get off the hook at present.  The Minister for the Environment who has done great work gets all the stick.</P>
    <P>I would like to see more accountability regarding the amount of money architects and engineers get.  Auctioneers have to have bonds to ensure that they act in a proper way and that whoever is selling property does not suffer a loss regardless of how the auctioneer might handle a sale.  The same thing applies to solicitors. People who draw up plans and designs and who are experts on planning should have insurance so that the local authority could put pressure on them should anything go wrong.  It is grossly unfair that taxpayers should have to pay for those peoples' mistakes in Sligo.  It is time that an insurance premium was levied on them as it is on auctioneers, solicitors and other professionals.  The contractor has to have a bond.  If he goes bust the work has to be done and the insurance companies pay up but the people who draw up the plans and designs are let off the hook.  I appeal to the Minister to have a look at that.</P>
    <P>I am annoyed at the amount of abuse the Minister is receiving.  No man has done more for local authorities than the present Minister.  The new housing scheme he has unveiled is good.  Every county council has wondered at some time why it was necessary to spend £30,000 or £40,000 to build a house when one can buy good houses for a fraction of the cost.  Up to now county councils were precluded from buying private houses and had to build new houses.  This new housing scheme is going to be a huge success.  There will be criticism of it but in the long term I believe it is going to be the first real advance in house building for a very long time.  It will allow us to buy secondhand houses and to do much more in order to enable people to buy their own houses.  If people can pay for 50 per cent of the house they can pay for a loan on the other half.  This is a great idea and will certainly increase housing provision.  It will make people more aware that they are looking after their own houses.  When driving around Dublin and other big towns, it is sad to <Col N="1890" /> see the numbers of houses which have been vandalised, are lying idle and are uninhabitable.  Many of these houses are only 25 or 30 years old.  At the same time, we are saying that we should be preserving houses that were built 125 and 130 years ago.  I am sure that it these houses were sold to the private sector, there would be &ldquo;yuppie&rdquo; flats in them in no time.  It is a pity to see so many of them boarded up and something should be done about them.</P>
    <P>On the industrial side, I am very proud of my own village.  We have up to 150 jobs there at present.  No village of its size in Ireland has as many jobs.  I am glad that the emphasis of grant-aid is on the numbers of jobs created rather than on building and industry.  For too long the idea was to get the money to establish the industry and there was no emphasis on jobs.  Now they must create jobs that will last or else they will have to pay back the grant.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Government on the good job they are doing.  I do not know how they are doing so much with so little. They started from a very bad base a few years ago but are doing an excellent job. I wish them good luck and I hope that they will continue it, because if we get another few such years we will certainly be over an awful lot of our problems and on the way to full employment and to a better Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Appropriation Act and in particular to highlight what I regard as the dismal failure of the Government to deal with the two important issues which deeply affect the people of this country: the funding of the health services and the funding of local government services.  Indeed, the non-capital allocations for 1990 and 1991 represent an appalling indictment of the failure of this Government to provide reasonable funding for the eight health boards throughout the country.  This serious lack of funding will mean further cuts, bed closures and totally inadequate staffing in our hospitals this year, as it <Col N="1891" /> did last year.  As a member of the Mid-Western Health Board, I can say without fear of contradiction that the shortfall of £2 million for 1991, coupled with the shortfalls in 1989 and 1990, will make it impossible for our health board and for other health boards to provide a proper and safe level of patient care.</P>
      <P>The present critical situation is well summarised by Mr. Denis Doherty, Chief Executive Officer of the Mid-Western Health Board, when he states:</P>
      <P>It will not be possible to continue to provide a service of a standard acceptable to the board from the allocation received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a statement from the Chief Executive Officer of the Mid-Western Health Board, not a statement of an Oireachtas Member.  In March 1988, the Mid-Western Health Board agreed, very wisely, to rationalise the acute hospital services within their area.  This was done after great deliberation and consideration. This rationalisation involves designating the Limerick Regional Hospital as the flagship hospital for the Mid-Western area, while the general hospitals at Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's Hospital in Limerick, would play complementary and supplementary roles to the Limerick Regional Hospital.  However, because of the very severe financial constraints being imposed by the Minister for Health &mdash; not only this year but over the past number of years &mdash; it will not now be possible to achieve reasonable bed provision at either Limerick Regional Hospital or at Groom Regional Orthopaedic Hospital. This means that we now face appalling problems at the flagship hospital, the Limerick Regional Hospital, in terms of nursing and medical care for the public at large.  We now face intolerably long waiting lists because of a lack of important and essential specialities, such as cardiology, and a lack of sufficient theatre facilities.  Outpatient facilities and accident and emergency services are very inadequate also.  The crisis situation which now prevails was well summed up by the chief executive officer in a report <Col N="1892" /> to the Mid-Western Health Board.  The Chief Executive Officer of the Mid-Western Health Board, appointed on a part-time basis by the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, stated:</P>
    <P>Unlike other years, there is no scope for further rationalisation in the short term which would yield the substantial reduction in expenditure now required.  The facilities at the Limerick Regional Hospital are seriously deficient and restrict the ability of the staff there to meet the needs of the population served by the hospital.</P>
    <P>Yet, in his speech to the Dáil on 26 and 27 February this year the Minister for Health stated:</P>
    <P>The Government will honour fully their commitments.  The message I want to give to the House and to the public is that services will be maintained at not less than the levels approved for 1990.</P>
    <P>That was the same Minister for Health who gave similar assurances and commitments to Seanad Éireann on the Adjournment matter initiated by me on 2 February 1988, that Limerick and the mid-west would be fully compensated in capital and revenue terms in respect of the closure of Barrington's Hospital. During the course of my speech on that occasion I emphasised the fact that Barrington's Hospital was the heart of Limerick and that it was a lifeline for over 90,000 people in Limerick city and county and in the catchment area of Clare and North Tipperary.  In 1987 Barrington's Hospital catered for 50,000 people, between inpatients, outpatients and casualty. Instead of compensating Limerick and the mid-west for the closure of Barrington's Hospital, £8 million has been lost over the past number of years because of the closure of that hospital and no compensation whatever has been received in respect of that closure in 1988 and no significant capital development has taken place in the Mid-Western Health Board area.</P>
    <P>I am reminded that this was the same Minister for Health who told the Dáil, <Col N="1893" /> as far back as 2 June 1983 that &ldquo;our responsibility here is to ensure that we provide proper health services.&rdquo;  Because of their strict monetarism, this Government are not in a position to do that and it is not enough to hide under the umbrella of the WHO prophesy as to what may happen by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>On 1 March 1984, the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, told the Dáil, &ldquo;Our concern is to ensure that an adequate health service will be provided.  In view of the massive cutbacks for 1984 for which the Minister is responsible, this is not possible in 1984&rdquo;.  Again on 19 November 1981, another member of the present Government, Deputy Woods, Minister for Social Welfare, told the Dáil, and I think this is most interesting:</P>
    <P>I believe that this is a tight-fisted, scrooge-like, heartless Coalition who will stop at nothing to meet the requirements of the economists who are quite disinterested in the realities on the ground.</P>
    <P>We have the same Deputy O'Hanlon on 4 December 1986 asking in the Dáil if anybody had looked at the cost, in human terms, to the patients of the long delays of 13 weeks waiting for a hospital appointment.  Barry Desmond was certainly an angel.  This Minister for Health is the worst Minister for Health this State has ever seen.</P>

      <P>I can see the Senators on the other side are rather upset over these quotations, but all these promises now ring hollow as the health services are reduced to a state of crisis and shambles. The position is well summarised and summed up in an <i>Irish Times</i> editorial <Col N="1894" /> entitled &ldquo;There must be a better way&rdquo;. That editorial states:</P>
      <P>Cuts in the health services have provided more hostility, inspired more rumours and raised more fears than almost any other action taken by a Government in recent years.</P>
      <P>The editorial concludes:</P>
      <P>Dr. O'Hanlon has the opportunity today to dispel some of the rumours, ease some of the worries and eliminate some of the fears.  He can do this by clearly saying what he and the health boards are all about.  That has to be a political and not merely an administrative decision.  The Government may need to be reminded of its election campaign and the premises on which its platform was based.  There must be a better way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been total failure on the part of this Government and the Minister for the Environment to honour commitments and assurances to properly fund local government services and to fully compensate local authorities in respect of the abolition of domestic rates in 1978. For example, the allocation to Limerick Corporation by way of domestic rate support grant is only £2.2 million for 1991. This represents a huge shortfall of £5.7 million in the domestic rate support grant to my own local authority.  This means that in 1978 the domestic rate support grant accounted for 25 per cent of total income whereas in 1991 it accounts for a mere 11 per cent of total income.  One of the major items impacting on the finances of local authorities, especially in the larger cities and urban areas, is the cost of insurance, particularly public liability insurance.  In the case of public liability alone the number of claims made against Limerick Corporation is alarming.  A total of 130 such claims were made against the corporation in 1990.  It is estimated that the overall claim figures will amount to over £2 million in respect of that year.  To illustrate this statistic more strikingly, a public liability claim is received at the City Hall in Limerick every second working day.  We all know, <Col N="1895" /> in spite of what has been said by Senator Farrell, that the vast majority of these claims arise because of insufficient funding made by central Government in respect of the proper maintenance and repair of roads and in the case of Limerick Corporation, the proper maintenance and repair of urban roads and footpaths.</P>
    <P>On the question of funding local authority services, I believe that the Government should abolish the system of local service charges and restructure the whole system of local government financing, preferably by setting up a national finance council similar to that which operates in Holland.  I am, therefore, taking this opportunity to call for the scrapping of the controversial system of local service charges and its replacement by a reasonable allocation from national taxation because the system of local service charges is seen by many people in this country &mdash; especially those in urban areas &mdash; as unsatisfactory and unworkable and is seen by the public at large as double taxation.</P>
    <P>A good political system would finance local government from the national taxation yield without hampering the proper development of structures and services. In Ireland, unlike most European countries, local government has no positive constitutional status and it suffers from a lack of autonomy and a restricted range of services.  The chief complaint of local authorities is not the lack of power to collect funds but the lack of autonomy and discretion to spend the reasonable amount of funds that should be allocated.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, advocating the setting up of a national finance council on the lines of a Dutch system where the municipalities are given considerable latitude in the management of their domestic affairs, even though Central governments contribute substantially to local funds; in the case of Holland the contribution is in excess of 90 per cent.  The degree of local autonomy in Holland is considerably higher than in any other European country.  The Dutch authorities operate a municipal fund which is administered by a national finance <Col N="1896" /> council and the majority of its members are local authority members.  The proceeds of national taxation are disbursed on a defined basis without recourse to arbitrary considerations.  Central Government does not, however, seek to strengthen control over local government in return for this heavy subvention from central funds.  It is possible, therefore, to conclude with a great deal of certainty that a good system of local government could operate in this country without undue interference from central Government and that the quality of that local government system should not be determined by the extent of its own fund raising powers.  It should be within the competence of a good political system to finance local government services out of the yield of national taxation and it is not necessary in doing so to impose constraints which may inhibit the proper development of good local government which is essential to our form of democratic government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this subject and to have a look back at the way our affairs have been handled by this Government over the last 12 months.  I would like to make a short remark in relation to the previous speaker who I hold in very high regard indeed for many good contributions to the House.  I am a member of the Midland Health Board and he is a member of the Mid-Western Health Board, both under the excellent chief executive officer, Denis Doherty.  I am glad that we have been recognised over the last six years as the best health board in Ireland.  We have carried out all the various demands that were made on us by Governments &mdash; both the Labour-Fine Gael Government from 1985 to 1987 and the present Government led by Fianna Fáil with the Progressive Democrats as partners.  We, in the Midland Health Board area, because of our efficient and effective way of conducting business under the astute chief executive officer, Denis Doherty, are glad to report here today, that there will be no bed cuts in our health board area this year and no <Col N="1897" /> frontline staff job losses on the nursing side.  It is a matter of how well the board adhere to their budget.</P>
      <P>The Leader of Seanad Éireann, Senator Sean Fallon and I are the only two Oireachtas Members, with Senator Charlie McDonald, on the Midland Health Board.  We have conducted our affairs in the manner in which we were obliged and asked by the former Government Minister Barry Desmond and the present excellent Minister Deputy O'Hanlon and consequently we have had no cuts in the number of beds and no loss of nursing staff on the frontline.  Having said that, we have an allocation of £63.3 million for our area with which to conduct our affairs &mdash; £16 million less than the North Eastern Health Board which is where the Minister is from and which has the same population.  I take into account the fact that the Minister is from a rural constituency but I am making the point to show how effective, efficient and businesslike we are in the Midland Health Board.  I blame the board members.  If they do not implement cuts when they are advised to do so by their chief executive then whether they are a private company, a State or a semi-State organisation they will have a problem somewhere along the line.  There is no point in crying wolf and saying it is the Government's fault irrespective of what Government are in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a business person, I compliment the Government on the magnificent way they have handled the economy since 1987.  I do not have to tell anyone in this House how disastrous things were from 1983 to 1987.  We had a Minister who could not even bring in a budget on one occasion. Today they are looking for credibility. I would not like to wake up tomorrow morning and find there was a Government in power like the Government we had from 1983 to 1987.  We had the highest emigration rate ever recorded under that Government.  We also had the highest bank interest and inflation rates ever recorded.  To make it worse, we had no growth whatsoever for the last three years of that Government.  I only hope <Col N="1898" /> that we will not have such a Government inflicted on us again.</P>
    <P>We have a Taoiseach who has proved himself to be one of the best in Europe &mdash; President of the EC, statesman extraordinaire and one of the top three leaders in Europe at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>He would be an ideal candidate for the position of chief executive or Prime Minister of any country in Europe.  In 1987 when he took office we were bankrupt.  In his last few months in Government the present leader of Fine Gael showed the white feather and wanted job sharing.  The national understanding was the cornerstone for the policies of the Government under the leadership of Deputy Charles Haughey to get the country back to where it is today.  Our inflation rate is 2.7 per cent while that of our near neighbours, the UK, is 9.3 per cent.  That speaks for itself. For the past two years we have had a 4.5 per cent growth rate.  Look at Australia, Canada, America and the UK and see what growth they have in those countries. They do not have recession in those countries but massive depression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national understanding is in place for the next ten years and that is what young people listening to us can look forward to.  Four years ago our national debt was unbelievable; today we have a manageable economy.  When we came into power in 1987 the top tax level was 60 per cent but by the time a person paid PRSI and PAYE he was paying 64 or 65 per cent.  That meant that a chief executive was taking home 35 per cent of his or her wages.  That is why we had a brain drain from 1983 to 1987.  That is what happens when one gets power and does not use it.  Everything around one crumbles. Today, the top tax level is down almost 10 percentage points.  The lower income tax band is down from 35 to 29 per cent and there is a promise to have it down in two years time to 25 per cent giving everyone an incentive to work whether as an employee or self-employed. That is what it is all about; <Col N="1899" /> getting a fair return for a fair effort.  That is what Fianna Fáil can be commended for since 1987 under Deputy Charles Haughey.  He gave respect and dignity to the trade union movement, to employers and to anyone who made an effort to get the economy back on track.  He must be complimented for the astute, shrewd way he got the economy into shape.  It is only a businessman or woman who could do that because they know how to run the country as a business.</P>
    <P>Our interest rates are lower than those in the UK.  They are only two percentage points above what they are in Germany. That creates a great opportunity for investment.  When one goes abroad and tries to entice investment into the country, whether it be the IDA or Córas Tráchtála, the first two things one will be asked is the growth rate and the inflation rate.  If the two are coupled together we have the lowest in Europe.  We are the country which is most attractive to the Koreans and the Japanese.  When one thinks of the might of the USA and the UK and the fact that we are just a small little island running our own affairs with 3.5 million people, it is an outstanding success story.  Any fair-minded person or politician would say this is one of the best Governments we have had since the war.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, most people are only interested in getting a fair return for a fair effort.  On that people will judge our performance.  There are many other points I would like to make but other speakers have covered them.  Since 1987 this Government have had an outstanding record and long may it continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very interested in what the previous speaker said about the management of Ireland Incorporated.  It had almost the flavour of Evelyn Waugh about it.  I propose to concentrate principally on the matter of overseas development aid and simply reinforce submissions that have been made to the Government by a number of bodies in this area.  I am sure the Minister is more aware than I of the unusual convergence of opinion between a number of different <Col N="1900" /> groups such as Campaign Aid, Trócaire, the Irish Missionary Union, the Advisory Council on Development Corporation and so on.  Before I embark on this element, which will be the main element of what I want to say, there are a number of other matters I would like to raise.  I raise them because of the presence of the Minister in the House.  He may be in a position to respond to some of the points I will make.</P>
      <P>I should like to raise a matter where finance and foreign policy have what the Americans call an interface.  The Minister will know that for a number of years I have been pursuing the possibility of the opening of an Israeli Embassy in this city. In the light of the tragic developments in the Middle East of recent weeks and the need for this country to be able to exert pressure, for example, on the Israeli Government to come to a just and generous settlement with the Palestinian people, it would be appropriate to have such an embassy.</P>
      <P>The reason I raise this in a debate that deals principally with budgets is that every time I bring it up either in a public debate such as this or privately in meetings with senior politicians, I am given a different excuse.  One is security.  I was told by a very senior politician &mdash; not from the Government party &mdash; that one of the principal problems was that they would have to strip the Border of police and soldiers in order to maintain a guard on the Israeli Embassy.  That is absolute hogwash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another reason I was given was that we could not allow an embassy to be maintained when we did not have a reciprocal embassy.  I should like to put on the record information I received from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Four countries have resident embassies in Dublin with no reciprocal arrangements. They are Finland, Hungary, Norway and Turkey.  That cuts into the heart of the economic argument.  Another argument I was given was that Ireland could not afford to establish an embassy either in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv because of the expense.  Perhaps the Minister will say whether this is a matter for discussion <Col N="1901" /> between the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs and whether it would be an appropriate limiting factor in the development of our foreign affairs position.</P>
    <P>I recognise this is not perhaps the most appropriate debate under which to raise this issue but at least it provides a convenient opportunity for me to get on the record my scepticism concerning the financial problem that members of Government have indicated underlies the refusal to allow the opening of an Israeli Embassy in Dublin.  In other words, one can be opened here without any reciprocal embassy being opened in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv.  There are four precedents and I am quite sure the urgency of the Middle East situation would dictate a situation in which finance would have to be made available.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister &mdash; there will be a possibility to explore this in another debate quite soon &mdash; whether he would support in Cabinet the inclusion of a separate AIDS heading in the budget.  It is quite clear the problem of AIDS is not being centrally attacked in a co-ordinated or cohesive fashion by this Government.  One of the principal reasons for this is apparently a lack of finance.  Would the Minister indicate whether he would support, as a member of Cabinet, the provision of an AIDS heading in the budget or provide money to the Department of Health as they seem to be incapable of organising their finances in such a way as to immediately tackle this important subject?</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister for some information with regard to the possibility of funding the health services in other ways.  I have recently been solicited particularly in regard to the apparently disastrous situation in the local hospital in Kilkenny.  I am not going to go on at length about this because the local representatives are better equipped to deal with it but I put it to the Minister that despite what Senator Cassidy said and despite the fact which we all must acknowledge that the Minister did a very good job in rectifying some of the most difficult problems in the economy, there <Col N="1902" /> is still a problem in the area of health to which every politician must be sensitive. It is important that I say the Minister has done a good job and that the economic climate is improving.  It would be ungenerous, unjust and certainly unwise of me to say that this was not the case because part of the argument I have been making with regard to overseas development aid depends on the fact that the economy is improving.  However, parallel with that we have declining contributions to the Third World through the overseas development aid programme.  I am sure the Minister, who is a decent and just person, will wish to see that rectified.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister a technical question which occurred to me when I was watching the budget debate.  I may very well be quite incorrect in my reading of this because I am not a mathematically gifted person.  I could not help noticing that in the increases for old age pensioners there was a rise for persons under the age of 80.  I gather that subsequently some form of increase was triggered for persons over 80 years but my understanding is that it was smaller. I would like to know whether my nasty suspicions are justified and whether a single person living alone receives a smaller increase.  I wonder what is the thinking behind that, if I am correct.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, included some sections in a budget about two years ago which dealt with the restoration of houses in the inner city of Dublin.  It was a very far-sighted measure.  There has not, however, been a significant take-up of this grants scheme.  I spent a long time discussing this with officials of the Department who were extremely helpful.  It was clear that, as the watchdogs of the public finances, those officials were anxious that there should not be a haemorrhaging of money out of the Exchequer into this cultural objective, however worthy it might be.  I would like the Minister to tell the House &mdash; if it is not possible for him to do so today he could communicate them to me &mdash; the precise amounts of money that have been taken up.  I think they are very small and from my researches they could <Col N="1903" /> actually be zero.  If that is the case, obviously it may not be possible to do anything this year but would he bear this in mind?</P>
    <P>After all, this is the year when Dublin assumes its role as European City of Culture and it would be most appropriate to expand this scheme, particularly if there has been no loss or cost to the Exchequer. We should be a little more generous and adventurous and I am sure we would all agree that this is a desirable objective both culturally and economically.  In this year when Dublin takes its role as European City of Culture nothing could be more appropriate than that this grant or tax rebate should be looked at again with a view to expanding it and doing what happens in other countries, namely, making direct grants.  I congratulate the Government on having introduced this and roundly condemn Fine Gael for diluting this measure in a most mean-minded way when it was introduced in the Dáil during the budget debate.  I recall that they removed provisions which would allow maintenance on historic buildings to be included.  I urge the Government to examine that again.  They will have the support of the organisations in this area if they should do so.</P>
    <P>I spoke at some length on the Derelict Sites Bill and I warned about what I saw as the flaws in that Bill.  I was assured it would operate to save our heritage but it has become quite clear that this is not the case.  We recently had a situation in North Great George's Street where two List One houses in a List One street were threatened with demolition.  Thanks to the intervention of local people and a number of Ministers and the City Manager, this was avoided.  Subsequently I wrote to the Corporation drawing their attention to the provisions of the Derelict Sites Bill under which they are empowered to enter a listed building, do restoration work and recover the cost through a court process.  The response I received from Dublin Corporation is they will not operate this Bill because they say they have no money.  They do not have <Col N="1904" /> the financial capacity to operate the provisions of the Bill.  That, in my opinion, makes complete nonsense of the whole thing.  I ask the Minister if &mdash; I am being very parochial in this &mdash; as a pilot scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>May I be irrelevant to the end of the sentence?  Will the Minister make a special provision available this year to the corporation for the pilot preservation scheme of those two houses?</P>
      <P>I move on to the question of overseas development aid.  It is relevant that I should have in my initial remarks indicated my pleasure at the Government's success in the area of containing the expansion of the nation's debt.  However, it is not a matter of great satisfaction to notice that Ireland has cut back on its commitment to overseas development aid.  I would like to put on the record precisely what this means.  It is set out in leaflet after leaflet.  One states that 40,000 children die unnecessarily every day from malnutrition and disease, yet Ireland's contribution to UNICEF &mdash; the United Nations children's fund &mdash; has been reduced by 75 per cent.  Surely this is a matter on which we should express concern, particularly in the light of our historical development.  Our natural resources were exploited and the development of our industry was hindered by a colonial power.  We had a famine in the 1840s and surely if any country in Europe understands the nature of this kind of suffering we should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to UNICEF's report for 1990 on the state of the world's children.  It states that it is the greatest condemnation of our times that more than 250,000 small children should be dying every week of easily preventable illness and malnutrition.  I quote this in the context of what I see as our moral and financial obligations.  In 1970, Ireland gave a commitment, as one of the United Nations members, to make progress towards setting aside 0.7 per <Col N="1905" /> cent of gross national product as development assistance to the world's poorest nations.  How have we progressed in this matter?  That percentage we were then told was going to be achieved.  The target date was 1975, the latest we were told was 1980.  The figure of 0.7 per cent was calculated with regard to the actual needs of the Third World.  What has happened is that our overseas development aid has fallen from 0.25 per cent of GNP in 1986, that is, one-quarter of 1 per cent, to 0.16 per cent this year, which is a year when we are facing a crucial period in these underdeveloped areas.  I do not want to preach because we all feel about this but if we look at the convulsion that has recently shaken the world, it is astonishing that a vast amount of money could be made available by the international community to intervene in what was an unnecessary and avoidable war in the Gulf, yet, we are unable in this country to give more than 0.16 per cent of our income to assist those people who are going through the kind of experience that we had in the 1840s.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister agrees because he is on record as saying that it is impossible for low income countries to succeed with their own efforts unaided and they continuously need practical assistance to sustain improvement in their living standards.  It is vital that we should engage once more in proper, NGO cofinancing which had increased significantly in the years preceding the cuts and has now been cut back badly.  There have been cuts in food aid.  It is of grave concern to all of us that the Government should have decided not to comply with their two-year commmitment to the world food programme.  From a contribution of £1.35 million in 1987 we have contributed almost nothing to the food programme since then.  There has been a fall-off in our contribution to UNICEF to the point where it has almost diminished. The reason given by the Government was that we had our own economic problems. The Minister will say that we are well on our way to solving them.  We are the twenty eight richest country in the world; I would like a commmitment from the <Col N="1906" /> Minister that he would begin an improvement in what is a rather niggardly contribution in this important area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the contributors on the other side, one would have to say that they have not been living in the real world because for the second time in many years we have come in her to debate the Appropriation Act at a time when the economy has improved dramatically.</P>
      <P>I did not catch what Senator Norris said with regard to setting up an Israeli embassy here, but as I left the office he said that if there were an Israeli embassy here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it would be easier to deal with the Israelis in terms of the atrocities they commit on an almost daily basis against the Palestinians.  At least the Israelis have an ambassador accredited to Ireland, based in London, but the Palestinian people do not as yet have their state and, therefore, they do not have an ambassador even though they do have a representative accredited to Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Appropriation Act obviously takes in the spending of money on foreign affairs.  Senator Norris mentioned the fact that within the health areas such places as the hospital in Kilkenny have to be looked after.  I spoke to the Minister about this matter and I know that within a short period he will address the urgent problem that exists in the Kilkenny hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Norris also spoke about our contributions to overseas development aid.  I agree with him and the Minister would also agree that not enough has been given, but nevertheless there has been an increase this year, for the first time in a number of years, in this area. We should also take into account the fact that our overseas aid has grown dramatically through our contributions <Col N="1907" /> through the European Community. Quite a number of countries have benefited significantly particularly when something comes up that needs to be addressed in a hurry.  The contributions made by this Government have been acknowledged overseas.</P>
    <P>Last year we had an economic growth rate of 4½ per cent.  This was well above the average in Europe.  No growth was achieved during the period of the last Government and their performance was the worst in Europe, according to the OECD figures.  I was just looking at the latest report of <i>The Economist</i> Intelligence Unit who have been very critical of our economic progress and economic scenario in the past.  If one looks at the latest issue, one sees that GDP growth in the Republic remains above average and will continue to do so in 1991 despite a slowdown.  The report mentions the fact that there would be a suppression of growth in GDP because of the Gulf conflict. We all acknowledge that is a real possibility but as the conflict was over in a short number of days I do not think any lasting damage has been done to the world economy.  Already we see in America and Britain signs of confidence and lay-offs that were threatened in industry have been avoided.  In the first week after the Gulf War, retail sales in Britain improved for the first time in 18 months. There are signs that the down-turn will not be as grave as it was.  If the conflict had continued for longer, great damage would have been done to us in terms of our tourism industry, which impacts very greatly on employment.</P>
    <P>The growth in our tourism industry has been phenomenal because of Government policy over the past number of years and will continue even though there will be a slight hiccup this year because of the Gulf conflict.  Because of the aggressive policies Bord Fáilte, the Government, the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, and the hoteliers have adopted in trying to sell in areas which were not traditionally orientated towards us, the down-turn will not <Col N="1908" /> be as bad as in the past.  I believe, because of the aggressive marketing that is going on in places other than America, we will see an increase in tourism from other areas.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the problems associated with our health services. There are problems in the health services of every country in the world because the cost of providing health services is escalating enormously.  One of the problems in the area of the health services has been the success of the people involved in the health area in providing completely new means of keeping people alive longer and of transplanting hearts, lungs and various organs of the body.  These, obviously, are of fantastic benefit to the recipients but the cost to the State is huge.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy criticised the cutbacks in health but no cutbacks have been made in the amount of money that are available in the health services.  In my own health board area £100 million was spent last year and a 5.6 per cent increase was allocated which brought the total amount available to my health board to £105 million.  Because of the increases under the national agreement, the majority of that money has been taken up in wage increases.</P>
    <P>The Minister is looking very sympathetically at the problems associated with the long term provision of services. I do not think that throwing money at immediate problems will solve the long term problems.  Senator Kennedy stated that the Minister for Health was the worst Minister for Health this country has ever had.  He has done a tremendous job in the health services and has brought back a sense of reality into the provision of health services.</P>
    <P>Health services are an essential part of the fabric of Irish life.  The Minister is quite knowledgeable, up-to-date and sympathetic towards every situation that arises.  On the one hand, we have an increase in the provision, but we could give a lot more if people did not want tax decreases and were prepared to give a little more of their salaries or their own spending power to the health services. <Col N="1909" /> We cannot cut taxes and at the same time continue to increase the amount of money available to any of the services the State provides without getting the best value for the money provided.  In certain areas in this country the best value for money is not obtained.</P>
    <P>With regard to the commercial end, there has been an actual increase in the health services because when the previous Coalition Government were allowing what seemed to be substantial increases in spending in the health area inflation was at an enormous height, so in actual fact no benefit was given.  Between 1982-86 there was a 30 per cent increase in nominal spending on health, but inflation increased by 31.3 per cent at that stage so there was an actual decrease in the amount of money available to the health services.</P>
    <P>Between 1986-90, because of a high inflation rate, there was a very small increase in the amount of money available. Between 1986-91 there was a 23.5 per cent increase in nominal spending and only a 17.3 per cent increase in inflation. Therefore, there was a net increase available. For those who borrow, the higher the inflation rate the lower the cost.  If one is a borrower the higher the inflation rate the lower the actual cost is.</P>
    <P>There has been a better climate in business over the past number of years. There has been an increase in the taxation take from business.  I can think of a few good ideas the Minister for Finance brought in.  The tax amnesty was of vital importance because it brought money into the system.  Because of the interest being charged people could not afford to avail of this.  People got into difficulties because the business atmosphere was bad.  If people got into arrears the escalation of interest caused them problems. When the interest amnesty arrived they paid their tax and that brought in a lot of money.</P>
    <P>In the past 12 months, the self-assessment scheme, which many people were worried about, has been of importance and will continue to be of importance.  A lot of people will say everybody out there in business is a crook and everybody who <Col N="1910" /> is self-employed is a crook but business people and the self-employed are working extremely hard within the economy and will work the self-assessment system.  Last year, returns have proved this.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been made of BES scheme, which has been of tremendous value.  When the accountants discovered they could take the risk factor out of the BES scheme they adapted themselves to that and found schemes in which there was no risk for investors and there was no point in continuing.  The Minister was aware of this and certain restraints were enforced.</P>
    <P>In relation to inner city development, the scheme that was introduced to redevelop inner city areas was a most imaginative scheme.  Even though it will take away certain taxes and rates from local authorities and the Government for a number of years, nevertheless we see in the centre of various cities and towns throughout the country that regeneration has taken place.  This could not have taken place without the policies which this Government and the past Government adopted.</P>
    <P>There are problems in relation to housing and roads.  The new social housing scheme announced recently by the Minister for the Environment will be of immense benefit again in regenerating our housing stock.  For the first time it gives an opportunity to people to invest in older housing.  This was very much lacking in the past.  The joint venture scheme between local authorities and the potential purchaser is an excellent scheme because it gives somebody who might not have the means to fully purchase a house to use whatever capital he has in a joint venture project with the local authorities.  This will take quite a number of people off the housing list at local authority level.  That imaginative scheme is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the constraints on the Minister in terms of budgeting and I am satisfied in relation to the problem in my area of Kilkenny Hospital, where we have beds in the corridors on a regular basis, he will have a look at it.  If he does so he <Col N="1911" /> will see that it is catering for double the number of people it was built for.  It is catering for two counties where it was built for one.  A small amount of money invested over the next few years would be of immense benefit in the long term. I will never agree to throwing money to deal with a problem in the short term. We must seek long term solutions to the problems.  We can give the Government credit for a job well done in the past 12 months and, indeed, since they took office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal with some issues I am concerned with and bring them to the notice of the Minister for Finance.  I will refer to three areas. First, there is concern in my area about the condition of what is known as the Coast Road which has great potential for industrial development, the road between Limerick and Tarbert, the N69. Secondly, I would like to deal with the bad condition of schools in the area, especially the Rathkeale secondary school the need for an extension to the Kilcornan school and to ensure in general that the educational facilities along the coast of County Limerick are developed. Thirdly, I would like to deal with a study in July 1990, the Rathkeale Development Study by S. Mulcahy, MRIAI, and hope the Government will provide the necessary funds to implement the proposals therein.  Finally, I would like to ask the Minister to provide moneys through the IDA, and other authorities, to develop the industrial potential and industrial sites, especially in Askeaton and Rathkeale.</P>
      <P>In dealing with the N69, I regret that I have to criticise the Government for their failure to include that coast road from Limerick to Tarbert in their Operational Programme on Proliferality, 1989 to 1993.  The Government have failed to listen to the views of the public representatives of all sides and the people along the estuary on the need to improve that road.  The condition of this road is a turn off for potential industrialists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have failed to <Col N="1912" /> appreciate the industrial development potential of the estuary.  They have failed to give the area the chance it deserves to attract industry.  The Government should review their approach to the N69 and ensure that the road, which at present in a turn off to potential investors, is brought to an acceptable level.  They have missed an opportunity to include this development for benefit under the Community Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>The economic potential of the estuary is being choked because of this issue.  The area is serviced by two excellent ports, Foynes and Limerick.  We have an excellent international airport at Shannon but the road servicing the area is the one black spot that hinders development and turns off potential investors.  I would like the Minister to seriously look at this.  The potential for industrial development and job creation, which is very necessary, is great.  Aughinish Alumina, the development of Wyeth and Southern Chemicals in Askeaton and the development of Foynes Harbour are an indication of what is possible in the area.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the problem with schools in the area and ask the Minister to seriously look at the investment of moneys for the provision of a secondary school in Rathkeale.  In 1967 the Convent of Mercy proposed a school for the area and in 1983 a new community school was authorised for Rathkeale.  In 1985 a site was identified and in 1986 a schedule of accommodation was agreed.  Since 1967 the school has consisted of prefabricated classrooms, many of them in very poor condition causing extreme problems for staff and pupils.  Rathkeale deserves a new school and, hopefully, moneys will be allocated in 1991 for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote from what the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey said on the Adjournment debate on 7 June 1990 with regard to this.  The Minister referred to the demographic patterns and changes in those and said:</P>
    <P>When this review is completed and the pupil numbers to be catered for in the long term established, it will be necessary to prepare a new schedule <Col N="1913" /> of accommodation.  This, in turn, will necessitate some alteration to the plan and design of the project by the design team.  It will be appreciated, therefore, that any changes required will arise from a careful reassessment of future requirements and I am satisfied that the new school when completed will meet the needs of the community for the foreseeable future.  A full range of facilities will be available for the courses to be conducted and for the numbers of pupils who will enrol there. Every effort will be made to have the review of requirements completed as soon as possible so that planning can be proceeded without undue delay.</P>
    <P>Since then there has been a change from a community school to a community college. This is of no great concern.  We need a proper school, proper accommodation with proper facilities.  I would like to ask the Minister to make the funds available. I understand that the change from a community school to a community college is awaiting sanction from the Minister.  I urge the Minister to have this completed without undue delay and to apportion money in 1991 for the construction of this school and the necessary provisions for the pupils and teachers of Rathkeale.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the school in Kilcornan.  The Kilcornan primary school is in a deplorable state.  In 1976 the Department decided to erect a new school there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asking for money for the construction of a new school or an extension to the school in Kilcornan. Surely the allocation of moneys for the construction of a school is appropriate to this debate.  The Minister on 7 June 1990 promised that this would be taken in hand, a review of the pupil numbers would be completed and a new schedule of accommodation would be carried out which would necessitate an alteration to the plan and design of the project.  On <Col N="1914" /> the Adjournment Debate of 21 January on Kilcornan school the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>The Minister fully appreciates the genuine concern of the local interests and she will ensure that the remaining formalities will be concluded expeditiously.  In view of the Senator's interest in this the Minister will communicate with him about future developments.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister the up to date position with regard to this school.</P>
      <P>I will now turn to my third point, the completion, with the co-operation and encouragement of the Department of the Environment and the Department of Health of an urban renewal report on Rathkeale which was completed for Limerick County Council by S. Mulcahy, MRIAI.  This report makes 40 recommendations on the improvement of Rathkeale.</P>
      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to this report and ask him as a matter of urgency to allocate moneys for the proposals.  The report states:</P>
      <P>As Rathkeale is located between a major city and the county town and is comparatively close to each the commercial centre of the town is subject to greater competition than most towns of this size.  The commercial centre, therefore, must offer an alternative entitlement to both shoppers and visitors.</P>
      <P>Last year I drew the attention of the Minister to the proposal to have an urban renewal scheme in Rathkeale, I would now like to raise this again with the added fact that a specially prepared report published in July 1990 confirms that this should be the approach of the Department and money should be allocated by the Minister to do so.</P>
      <P>The report also states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social profile of Rathkeale differs considerably from other towns with the result that different factors must be taken into account in making proposals for urban renewal in the town.  There is a comparatively large <Col N="1915" /> travelling population resident in the town.  Of a town population of approximately 2,500 people, 18 to 20 per cent are travellers.  Many retired travellers live permanently in Rathkeale while younger families are seasonal residents. For any process of urban renewal to be effective it is vital to build on the qualities which a place has and which make it unique.</P>
    <P>The report highlights the difficulties in Rathkeale.  Limerick County Council have submitted the report to the Department of the Environment.  I would urge the Minister to consult the report and allocate moneys.  We might have a discussion on the Adjournment at a later stage on this issue.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the development in Foynes and in Foynes harbour in particular.  I would like to voice my disappointment that in the Operational Programme on Proliferality, Roads and other Transport Infrastructure, Foynes has not been included as a commercial port.  Its status has been reduced to that of a local port.  There is no port in the west designated as a commercial sea port. Foynes is designated as a local port.  This is very disappointing as it is the third biggest port in the country, the quickest developing port and one of the most successful ports.  Foynes has developed more rapidly than any other port on the estuary. The progress at Foynes far exceeds the development of any other harbour in the country over the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>The number employed by the port as port users, ship agents and stevedores has increased substantially over the past 25 years.  The number employed in 1961 on a permanent employment basis was approximately 25 people, the number presently employed on a permanent basis is in the region of 350 and it is also estimated that a further 100 other permanent positions are directly employed in spinoff services.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the financing of the developments over the past 25 years which has been £7½ million.  Borrowings accounted for £4.7 million, port users <Col N="1916" /> contributions £0.85 million, surplus revenue £1.38 million and State grant £0.57 million.  I ask the Minister when he is looking at the appropriation of moneys through the State and the Structural Funds to look at the development proposals which Foynes has submitted to the Department of the Environment.  I am disappointed at the level of grants of over £500,000.</P>
    <P>Foynes has played a major role in the welfare of the region.  It plays a significant role in the agricultural industry of the country and now provides the required facilities for the importation of all types of animal feed, molasses and fertilisers. Substantial quantities of meat, sugar, cereals and ores are also exported through the port.</P>
    <P>I would like to outline briefly some of the plans which I ask the Minister to take into consideration when allocating funds. The harbour authority plan to increase the capacity of the harbour to accommodate ships of up to 50,000 tonnes.  This will require widening and deepening in the western approach channel and central harbour areas and dredging.  A new berth is proposed to accommodate 50,000 tonne deadweight ships of the Panamex type.  New roads, water supply improvements, reclamation, dredging and additional berthage are also proposed.</P>
    <P>The cost of the total plan is £19.4 million.  Some of that work is on hand at the moment, such as the completion of the dolphins and the improvement of the handling facilities is also on hand.  These are the areas of concern I have.  We have listened to some of the areas of concern in Dublin city.  I would like the Minister to take into consideration also some of these difficulties in my region and look at the development of the estuary as an industrial base by providing the proper infrastructure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for Sport.  I would like to take this opportunity to ask him to convey to the Government the great appreciation of the people of Wexford for the work that has been done by the Government over four years.  It is <Col N="1917" /> regarded worldwide as an excellent job. It would have been difficult to believe four years ago that so much could be done in such a short period of time.  We have a very strong grip on the economy, public expenditure is under control and the national debt is stabilised.  Very few countries could boast of that in such a short period, particularly when things were so bad in 1987 following a period of poor Government.  Fianna Fáil were responsible for some of it.</P>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Taoiseach for the excellence of his handling of the situation and the very fine team he has in Cabinet.  I would like to include too, the Ministers of State, particularly Deputy Fahey, who has done tremendous work in the area of sport and education. We should not let the opportunity pass without paying compliments where compliments are due.  We wish them continued success in their jobs.  We confidently expect that they will be in Government for a long time.</P>
      <P>I have been a farmer all my life and I have never found so much doubt and confusion in agriculture.  I hoped to have an opportunity to speak on this subject last week but because of the large number of speakers I had to forego the opportunity. Agriculture at present is facing an onslaught from at least four different quarters: there is the demand for changes in the Common Agricultural Policy throughout Europe, the talks on GATT &mdash; The Uruguay Round &mdash; which are nearing completion, the war in the Gulf which has had devastating effects on agriculture, the repercussions of which will be seen for many years to come and, disappointingly, the general public perception of agriculture in this country.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Common Agricultural Policy, I suppose the consumer and those outside agriculture would see as a great problem the fact that agriculture is supported by several billion pounds each year from Europe.  That is understandable if account was not taken of what would happen to agriculture and to farmers if that support was not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to GATT and the completion of these talks, I remember some <Col N="1918" /> months back when the Agriculture Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry, proposed a 30 per cent reduction in price supports, there was an outcry.  Then, when the USA, acting in a bullying capacity, tried to impose a 70 per cent reduction in price supports, farm organisations and people in this House said that Mr. MacSharry was doing a tremendous job.  When the Americans backed off and it reverted to the 30 per cent reduction, Mr. MacSharry again became the scapegoat.  One thing we need in this country is consistency.  If we are to succeed in stabilising agriculture we must have consistency all round, from the non-farming sector, the farming sector and particularly the farming organisations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the war in the Gulf, it has affected our beef trade.  A new look will have to be taken at the intervention system.  Any beef farmer who has spent a large sum of money from his own resources is now very worried and I ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food to ensure that there will be unlimited intervention for beef in order to get us over this very difficult period.  I think all the Members of this House and people around the country will understand that the general perception of farmers in this country, be they big or small, is that they have plenty of money and no difficulty with income.  As one who is living among farmers, and as a farmer myself, I can say that things are anything but like that at present.</P>
    <P>I put down a motion in this House soon after I came in here and I was absolutely disgusted that the Labour Party opposed it, since everybody else in the country seemed to support the view I was putting forward which was a very reasonable one. I am sorry to have to say this, but I felt that the Labour Party were taking a very opportunistic stance.  They felt that they would garner the support of many people who do not understand the agricultural scene by opposing that motion.  Unfortunately we have had more of this since. Recently when I asked for a debate on agriculture, in light of changes in the Common Agricultural Policy and the GATT talks Senator Brendan Ryan said <Col N="1919" /> we should have a major debate on agriculture but he felt that the bigger farmers &mdash; and he claimed that about 50 per cent of farmers were in that category &mdash; should be nailed down, that the income should be taken from them and distributed among the smaller farmers.  Again that was an opportunity taken to have a go at a section of the community who are particularly weak.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour the issue but it has been said that farmers are inclined to cry wolf.  To anybody living in a country area it is very evident that the flight from the land at present is very substantial and unless there is continuation of price supports the flight from the land will continue. In one parish in my constituency at the side of the Blackstairs Mountains, there were 110 families making a living from agriculture.  In ten years that number has dwindled to 66 families.  The others who left the land have gone into the towns in County Wexford and County Carlow and are now competing for housing together with those who were already in need; they are now competing for social welfare from very scarce resources and they are now competing for jobs that are very scarce.  That creates a very bad climate.  If these people had been given price supports or income supports on their land, they would have stayed in their own parish and in their own houses, they would have employment and, most importantly, would have been able to live a reasonable life.  It is very hard for nonagricultural people to understand that you just cannot pluck a family from a rural area and put them into a town or housing estate.  The social consequences of this can be devastating for the families concerned and it is evident for everybody to see that this is the case.  For instance, my next door neighbour lives a half a mile away and it would be very difficult for me to see myself in a situation where I would have neighbours immediately to my right and left.  It is just not possible to expect a person to adjust immediately to that situation.  From a social point of view it is essential to keep the rural fabric of the country together.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1920" /> With the new emphasis on sport &mdash; and the Minister of State, Deputy Frank Fahey was responsible for much of that &mdash; most rural parishes are now building their own sport complexes.  There is a community spirit in parishes that was not evident before.  For instance, in my own parish, Fethard-on-Sea, a sports complex was built which cost £100,000, £90,000 of which was raised locally.  If that parish is denuded, that sports complex and all the other facilities in the area will become derelict.  When these people move into towns they find that the community spirit is far less evident than in rural areas.  In order to hold on to that community spirit, people should be allowed to live in relative comfort in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is the base on which they can be kept and a small income support, possibly £20 or £30 a week, could make the difference between these families staying on the land or moving out.  If they move out they will cost the State a new house, and dole payments of up to £100 per week for a family.  In general, it is a total loss to the Government and I would ask everyone in the country from a non-farming background, particularly the Members of this House, to understand that it would be far better for the country, socially and economically, if these people were kept on the land.</P>
    <P>There is a confusion and doubt about the future of agriculture.  This has to be cleared up in the immediate future.  The prices being offered by Commissioner Ray MacSharry for this year certainly will not do anything to help that.  I fully support the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, in his very strong stance on behalf of the farmers on this particular issue.  I would call on this House and the Lower House to adopt the same attitude because if there is not sufficient support for these people they will move from the land.</P>
    <P>I want to deal briefly with the various aspects of agriculture.  First, and probably the most important and more lucrative from a farmer's point of view, is the dairy element of the industry.  Milk prices have gone down by about 10 per cent over the past two years and it is anticipated that they will go down this year by a further <Col N="1921" /> 7 per cent.  The milk quota which was hard fought for in 1983-84 is expected to reduce by 2 per cent.  That will put milk farmers in one of the lower categories and it will be very difficult for them to survive.  It is now said by the banks &mdash; and they should have a fair idea &mdash; that it will take a quota of 35,000 gallons of milk to keep a farm family in relative comfort.  We all know that the average milk quota here is about 17,000 or 18,000 gallons.  That gives us an idea of the difficulties in which these people are living.</P>
    <P>As regards cereals, I am told by the CSO that in order to keep a farm family on the land they would have to have 300 acres of cereals.  The average farm size in this country is just short of 50 acres. Again, if a person is in cereals he is on the way out.  I mentioned beef earlier when I spoke about the Gulf War.  The beef farmer has expended an enormous amount of money to keep the environment right &mdash; I can honestly say that farmers are just as interested in keeping control and a watch on the environment as are any other section of the community &mdash; and to control the use of slurry, etc.</P>
    <P>Coming from County Wexford, I am concerned, especially about the environment and the marine.  Coastal erosion will increase in the next ten years if the experts are proved right and tide levels will rise by approximately two feet in the next 15 years.  If that will be the case, and there seems to be some evidence it may be, many areas along the coast of County Wexford will be under severe threat. Rosslare, a village barely above sea level, would certainly disappear.  While we do not have that difficulty yet, now is the time to see that the coast is protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On this occasion I am very happy to leave the commanding heights of the economy and of agriculture to my colleagues.  I would like to make some comments on other areas, including the Appropriation Act, which I either missed out contributing to in the recent past or may not get a chance again for some time.  I am very glad to use the Appropriation Act as is traditional in this <Col N="1922" /> House to make various reflections on particular areas.</P>
      <P>Under foreign affairs, I want to comment on Northern Ireland and on the appalling murders in recent days.  My own track record has been one of, some people would say, one-sided condemnation of the IRA atrocities, understandably so because these are the atrocities which are fuelling, and continue to fuel, the conflict and because they are committed in our name.  Let me also state, as Rhonda Paisley said about two or three weeks ago when she called for a ban on the UDA, that the list of atrocities carried out in the name of Protestant loyalism is no less hellish in the eyes of all right-thinking Unionists than those carried out in the name of the Irish Republican movement.  It is some kind of consolution to us that these unequivocal sentiments are being voiced by Ian Paisley's daughter and that she calls unequivocally for the banning of the UDA.  Her remarks are quoted in the present issue of <i>Fortnight Magazine</i>, page 21, March 1991.</P>
      <P>I am coming to the conclusion that condemnations are virtually useless.  We are faced with a dilemma here.  We have to keep making them.  If we do not our silence will be taken for consent or connivance. Terrorists are now beyond the reach of condemnation.  I have just finished reading a book called <i>Terror</i> by Connor Gearty which is an analysis of terrorism in Europe, of which the IRA are only a section.  He makes a very convincing case, beyond a certain point terrorists are no longer interested even in the professed objectives they set out.  Our attitude to terrorism should simply be that this is an evil which has to be dealt with.  There is no good falling down on your bended knees and asking them to reform, etc.  That is worse than useless. In that connection, the Christmas cease-fire of the IRA was outright hypocrisy.  I was surprised that some of my colleagues were taken in by it and welcomed it as a new dawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we should be urging, of course, as the people most agonisingly involved like Archbishop Daly are continuing to <Col N="1923" /> urge, is to get the politicians to live up to their responsibilities.  Mr. John Hume is frequently telling the IRA that the object now is not getting out the Brits, that the Brits are ready to go, but persuading the Unionists to come to some agreement.  It does not seem to me that he, himself, is pursing that logic.  I think he is evincing a certain reluctance to get into dialogue with his Unionist neighbours.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how these dreadful murders which happen in an intimate community can ever be dealt with unless the community as a whole feel responsible for policing and for security.  There is no point hoping that the security forces can handle the problem unless they have the confidence of both sides of the community, and they cannot have the support of both sides of the community unless there is some form of devolved government and some form of power sharing &mdash; I do not see how we can possibly get away from that and unless both sides of the community learn to live together in that part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw your attention to an interesting distinction here that Mr. John Hume constantly talks about &mdash; the need for Unionists to come to terms with living in Ireland, but Archbishop Daly, whose wisdom in certain respects I greatly admire, stresses rather that it is a question of this part of Ireland.  There is no problem here; we have no problem living with Unionists because they are up there.  They have no problem living with us.  There is no problem with sharing the island in that way.  The problem is the two sides of the community sharing that bit of the island and unless they face up to that there is going to be no real future.</P>
    <P>The role of our Government should be a supportive one and they should have no lingering, tribal claims about territory or vested interests in territorial unity. Their role should be to support and encourage and to be glad that they can do something to prevent or to help bring these problems to an end.  Unfortunately, I do not see that the Government are performing this clear role.  There is a secrecy and ambiguity about Government <Col N="1924" /> policy on Northern Ireland.  I hope that at the Ard-Fheis this weekend the Taoiseach will, as he has promised, clarify that policy.  I hope that clarification will not be a reversion to old catch-cries.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I must say I do not agree with blaming the Taoiseach for everything if these talks do not take place.  The accusation was made yesterday that he bears a heavy burden before the bar of history.  It is unfair and disproportionate to suggest that and, indeed, the Leader of the Opposition would do well to heed the advice of a Civil War general in America which ran as follows, &ldquo;elevate them guns a little lower&rdquo;.  His fire power at the moment seems to be rather indiscriminate.  I notice the media are given to depicting the Leader of Fine Gael in the role of a bull and the Taoiseach in the role of a toreador and that imagery suggests to me that the same gentleman would do well to heed Winston Churchill's observation about John Foster Dulles that, &ldquo;he was the only bull he ever knew who brought round his own china shop with him&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>While urging the Taoiseach to dissipate the mist of secrecy and ambiguity that seems to surround Northern policy, we all bear a heavy responsibility but, most of all, the politicians of the North.  I would hope they would stop massaging their egos and get around to filling the political vacuum.  It is nonsense for the Taoiseach to say that there is no wish for devolution in the North.  Séamus Mallon has no wish for devolution; John Hume has no wish for devolution and maybe many of the Unionists, but all the polls suggest that the great majority of the Northern community would welcome power-sharing and devolved government.</P>
    <P>Continuing under the heading of justice and foreign affairs, let me raise the question of extradition which is in and out of our concerns, if you like.  We have to brace ourselves in the next week or so, with the release of the Birmingham Six, for another assault by anti-extradition interests in this country on the principle of extradition.  While I would be the last to denounce supporters of the anti-extradition committee as fellow-travellers &mdash;<Col N="1925" /> and such an accusation was virtually made in respect of Deputy Garland's activities before Christmas &mdash; it is very important that people who join anti-extradition committees and parade with them and so on, dissociate themselves from the obvious IRA elements in these movements.  It is not my observation that they do so dissociate themselves, that they are quite content, if you like, to be in the same company as Provo apologists. They have an obligation to make that kind of dissociation; otherwise they are giving aid and comfort to the IRA in their propaganda battle for the hearts and minds of people in this part of the country.  Although that battle seems to be totally lost at the moment, remember the IRA will continue to fight that propaganda battle.  Therefore, I would suggest that those who prattle about ending extradition are naive and irresponsible. The principle of extradition must be maintained.  It is a matter of honour and obligation.  No matter how imperfect the situation in practice, it can be reformed, but the principle must be maintained.</P>
    <P>I would also refer briefly to another implication of the Birmingham six case and that is to remind ourselves that our own machinery of justice and arms and organs of justice are by no means perfect. We have a beam in our eye and even though we are very fortunate in our Garda Síochána and in the consensus they established at a very early stage in the history of this State, let us not fool ourselves that there are no bad apples in the barrel.  We, too, raised the spectre of an appalling vista to prevent civil actions on the part of those who feel they have been wronged, such as in the Nicky Kelly case.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to make some comments on the Gulf War since I was with the EC delegation the week before last when that was being discussed.  I have listened to some of my colleagues here on the whole matter of the Gulf War from the very beginning of the conflict and all I can say is that I wish I could be as sure of anything as they are of everything.  The Gulf War must have left us all in a state of agonising confusion.  For me, if I could be sure <Col N="1926" /> that it was a legitimate United Nations operation, I would have supported it from the beginning but I agonised about the way in which the allies &mdash; from the very early stages &mdash; went beyond that mandate.  The bombing of Baghdad violated the essential principle of the United Nations mandate.  We can only deplore the appalling things that have happened on both sides and among those &mdash; and I am one of those who deplore anti-Americanism and many of my connections are with the United States &mdash; was President Bush's blatant triumphalism, especially his almost vindictive assertion that they had kicked the Vietnam spectre at last. That seemed to me to be looking at the whole operation from the point of view of salving American pride in an old-fashioned jingoistic manner that is totally unaccpetable.</P>
    <P>I have sympathy for the way the Government dealt with the whole problem. The fact is we are no longer masters in our own house.  It would be grand if we could adopt that splendid and large independent foreign policy of which I am a foremost advocate but I am a realist at the same time.  We have to have regard to our membership of the Community and indeed we have to have regard to the realities of our links with the United States also.  I am not saying that is a justification why we should support murder, but it does expose the ambiguities of our foreign policy, of our so-called neutrality policy.  We have very little road left to travel in that respect.</P>
    <P>The consequence of the Gulf War, the feeling in the Community that a common foreign policy is more than ever necessary, will force us sooner or later to make the same kind of clarification that I would like to see in respect of Northern Ireland policy because, like our policy in the North, our policy on neutrality and foreign policy also is shrouded in secrecy and ambiguity.  My own hope is that we will make that vital distinction between security and defence.</P>
    <P>Of course, as a member of the Community we must participate fully in security measures, disarmament, anti-crime <Col N="1927" /> and anti-drug measures, a common European police force, perhaps, but if we are to retain any shred of our own personality and our own place in the world over 70 years we cannot join a European strike force, as I heard it frighteningly described in Luxembourg last week.  Our European partners should appreciate that we have that much distinctive policy to bring to Europe, that we have these other links with the world and that we should be allowed to retain, as it were, that credibility and that distinctiveness we have as a result of our post-colonial record and our independent foreign policy.  Under the heading of foreign affairs, both in respect of Northern Ireland and the European Community, I am looking for a clarification of Government policy beyond the present levels of ambiguity and secrecy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to join in the congratulations to our new Clerk Assistant of the Seanad.  It is a welcome appointment.  I would also like to join in welcoming once again to the Seanad the Minister with responsibility for sport.</P>
      <P>I would just like to make a few general comments, if I may.  The debate on the Appropriation Act is an opportunity to raise virtually any matter or to look at things in terms of general principles as opposed simply to a specific Bill or motion that happens to be before us.  It is an opportunity to think of where we are going, what we hope for this country, what have we achieved over the past year and what we are looking forward to achieving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a great deal to look back on with enthusiasm and some degree of pride and satisfaction, tempered by the fact that there is still a very long way to go.  Certainly, over the past year the essential financial foundations for further progress have been laid.  There are many things we would all like to do but unless we have the economic and financial base they are either pious hopes which we can never attain or, alternatively, we very <Col N="1928" /> rapidly run into the sort of appalling financial and economic situation which pertained a few short years ago.</P>
    <P>We have now made tremendous progress. From being horrendous inflation is now down to the lowest or second lowest in Europe.  Our national debt, although still very grave, is nonetheless at least stabilised and we are on the way to commencement of a solution.  There is quite a long way to go, but a start has been made with a very difficult problem.  Our interest rates, perhaps, give cause for some anxiety.  The true interest rates are still rather high; nonetheless, they have come down considerably and there is hope of further improvement.</P>
    <P>As regards currency, we can take a great deal of satisfaction and pride &mdash; and I do not mean just the Government alone but the whole community &mdash; in the fact that the Irish currency has been successful in maintaining its situation within the EMS in an independent manner.  Let us remember that not all that long ago it was thought it would be quite impossible for this state to have its own currency. This was a widespread view of economists, bankers and many other people. We have proved that is not the situation and we have got a very stable currency. Even more than this idea of a single currency in Europe, certainly in Germany and to some extent also in France the movement now is towards the establishment of a stable set of currencies in western Europe.  We are well placed to take our place among the stable currencies. This is considerable progress.</P>
    <P>There is so much still to be done to build the sort of state that we would all like to see &mdash; a modern state with the opportunity for prosperity spread right through the community, a state in which there is an even better educated people than exists at present, a state that environmentally and socially provides a good quality of life for all its citizens.  We may regard ourselves as very well off compared with so much of the world, but there is still a very long way to go. However, we have laid the foundations; we are moving forward.</P>
    <P>There are a number of things we need <Col N="1929" /> to do.  We talk a great deal about Europe. I have just mentioned Germany, which is the main country as regards the financial centre of Europe.  Perhaps it is more important now than the United Kingdom and it is certainly the major currency within the strong European Community of 300 million.  Yet, how few of us or how few of our children are learning German. It is a tiny percentage.  It is something like 7 per cent as compared with the numbers who are learning French. French is an excellent language, it is a beautiful and a very important language; but in practical terms for developing this country our children should be learning German, not French.  We already have the advantage &mdash; and, let us face it, it is a very major advantage &mdash; of having English as one of our languages. However, if we are going to play our part in Europe, the other language we need to know if we are to continue to be competitive &mdash; and it is essential for us as a small community to be competitive &mdash; is German.  That is an area where I hope more attention will be given in the future.</P>
    <P>Linked with that, I wish to say a few words about Irish.  Let us hope one of these days we will have a debate on Irish in this Chamber.  I am delighted with certain arrangements that have been made recently as regards translation.  We tend to forget perhaps that Irish is one of the three classical languages of Europe with Greek and Latin.  Perhaps we are a little inclined not to take sufficient pride in this magnificent heritage we have, a still living Celtic language which historically is much older than Latin.  As we move ahead with the modern necessary prosaic requirement of learning German, we should not forget our own first language.  It is appropriate that we should do so, even though we are moving, hopefully, in a modern sense.</P>
    <P>We have an often mentioned fact that the European Community had a population of 200 million approximately and is now over 300 million.  This is a great opportunity for us but it is also a situation in which we could become a backwater, <Col N="1930" /> just relying on subsidies from our wealthier neighbours or, alternatively a situation in which we could become relatively prosperous.  We have made great progress in this direction.  At times we are inclined to think perhaps of the golden triangle of south-east England, of Holland and Belgium and of north-west Germany. In fact, we have made a lot more progress than that area over the past ten years.  The gap has narrowed considerably. There is still a long way to go, but we are moving forward.</P>
    <P>We need to, and we can have, a very upmarket, export-orientated economy. We have already to some extent achieved this.  We have the most export-orientated economy, in terms of percentage of GNP or GDP, of any country in the European Community.  We are very successful. Again, there is still a long way to go; but if we get even a tiny percentage of this 300 million market we can do extremely well.  The idea of prosperity which so many of the pessimists and the doubters in this country seem to believe is impossible can be shown to be very much a reality, a feasible goal but we have to be very determined in what we are doing and very goal-orientated.  We have not many advantages other than our people and the conditions we provide for them. We have to specialise, we have to succeed, we have to be better than other people if we are going to get anywhere.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other points I would like to make.  While we on the one hand press forward with the necessary material and practical requirements for a modern state, I think it is very pleasing that at the same time we have the sort of Bill which is now before us in the Seanad, that is, the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.  There is more to life than just material prosperity.  There is quality of life and for that quality of life material prosperity is essential.  There is no use talking about the environment to somebody who cannot feed his children or his family.  Equally, it is no use thinking that we can bring in very stringent environmental regulations, and so on, unless we are in a position economically to afford these regulations.  But if we can provide <Col N="1931" /> the material, the physical and the financial underpinning, then it would be a great shame not to gain the full benefit of it by doing things in an environmentally acceptable manner.  There is no real reason whatever why any industry or work or any form of agriculture, cannot be conducted in a manner which is both efficient and at the same time environmentally acceptable.  It is excellent to see this coming through in the legislation at present before this House.</P>
    <P>The quality of life is not just confined to environmentalism in the sense of having clean air and pure water &mdash; important though they are &mdash; and these are great advantages we have.  The quality of life relates back also to the physical and social circumstances in which we live.  We have some very grave problems here in our social services and in our health services, both of which are enormous consumers of money.  We are fortunate that we have in this country &mdash; we do not always realise it &mdash; probably one of the best health services in the world.  That does not mean that we have not got all the problems of which all of us in this House are very much aware.</P>
    <P>It does not mean either that we are shielded from the enormous expenses which have already overwhelmed the health services in the United States to a very considerable extent.  Ten or 15 years ago the health services in the United States and the general standard of health care were the best in the world.  That is still the situation, but for a constantly diminishing proportion of the population; and we would certainly not like to see that happening in this country. Equally, the national health service in the United Kingdom is one of the great success stories of the post-war Labour Government there.  Now it is gradually running down in a different sort of way in that it is spread much more evenly, but the waiting lists grow longer and longer and longer.  This is something we are going to have to face up to: how do we balance the enormous costs of modern medicine with the sort of resources which are available to us?  There will have to be <Col N="1932" /> a lot of new thinking to ensure that these modern medical techniques, treatments and general care, which we in this country rightly expect, are balanced with the financial demands.  We certainly cannot go on as we are at present.</P>
    <P>We must also look at our social services. One of the tremendous things we have had in this country over the past few years and one of the great achievements of the Government over and beyond the actual financial and administrative changes, and not only of the Government but of the trade union movement and of other sections of the community, is the fact that they have been willing to get together to work for the overall benefit of the country.  I hope that this continues, whether it be under our present Government or any future Government, and that this sort of attitude of mind will persist. Certainly, in those countries where this is or has been the situation, such as, in very different ways, West Germany and Japan where you have a <i>de facto</i> working arrangement between the employers, employees, the government and the financial services sectors, they have had the opportunity to develop in prosperous manner; whereas if you have simply a confrontational situation of either the capitalists or employers or government on the one hand or employees on the other, it is a road to ruin.  This has been one of the great achievements not only of this Government but of the other social partners.  As I said, long may it continue because it offers us the opportunity of doing the sort of things we would like to do in regard to health, social welfare, the environment and the whole quality of life, which is already in many ways, very pleasant in this country, but which has a lot of room for improvement still.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>We are debating this Appropriation Act, 1990, almost three months since the Minister, Deputy Smith, was here with us, on December 20.  It seems strange to me that we are waiting until 6 March.  I checked with last year and it was February when it was debated then.  We have spoken already on the budget and we have spoken on <Col N="1933" /> the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  I wonder why there is such a time lapse between the debate from the end of 1990 to almost three months forward. Could anything be done to ensure that this could be debated at a time when it would be more relevant?  After all, the budget has been agreed and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has been agreed.  While it is an opportunity for us to look backwards I think we should focus our minds more on looking forward.</P>
      <P>Last year, the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy Smith, speaking about budgetary results for 1989, stated that for the third year in a row it was much better than had been originally expected and on 20 December he stated that 1990 had been another successful year for the Government's economic and budgetary policy with strong growth in output and employment.</P>
      <P>There were positive things in the budget and there were positive things throughout 1990; but the latest unemployment figures do not reflect this.  We had a figure of 243,000 last month, which was an increase of 2,300 for the month of February, which is generally accepted as a month when you would have an increase in employment, not a decrease. It should have shown a more positive picture generally because you have better weather and one would have expected more outdoor employment in areas like forestry, fishing and the building industry. Looking at emigration, I cannot see any great improvement except that we have the extra number of young people around still unemployed, those who did not return to the United Kingdom or the United States since Christmas because the prospects for them there were very bleak at a time when the economic picture in Britain is extremely gloomy.  Our young people are not getting employment and, of course, they are adding to the figure.  There is disillusionment right through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with great interest to Senator Cassidy who just painted a most exotic picture of Camelot in his area.  I would <Col N="1934" /> like to get a guided tour of this area where he says there is absolutely no problem as regards health cuts, that you could get a bed in the hospital any time of the day.  I am not quoting him accurately, but he said there was no health crisis in his area. He talked at length about the most magnificent Government we have and he castigated what happened between 1983 and 1987.  I would have liked him to have gone back to 1977, the year from which all our ills stemmed.  I did not expect him to talk in glowing terms about the Tallaght strategy, but it has to be accepted that it was with the support of the main Opposition party that things were as they were when the present Government took office.  Sowing the seeds for the Government to reap any rewards was something that happened during that period.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Senator Conroy, in his contribution, was more realistic.  Certainly, I would like to know whether Senator Cassidy has had any communications over the last few months with the increasing number of unemployed.  He should ask the parents of our young emigrants how they feel about this glowing Camelot.  He should ask the people in the lengthening health queues, which he says he does not have in his area.  Senator Kennedy in his contribution spoke with great sincerity about what is happening in the mid-west area.  Ask the farmers of the country.  Ask the people who are almost apathetic now in relation to having house repairs addressed in local authority housing.  They have given up, they do not ask any more.  Recently, I did a survey in the South Hill area, where you have 80 per cent unemployment.  I gave them five categories to tick off the areas of priority and the biggest problem in their area. They answered very truthfully and honestly. It was unemployment, obviously, with an 80 per cent unemployment figure but it was also house repairs.  People were waiting for ten to 20 years to have jobs carried out that they could not do themselves, because materials were not forthcoming even if they wished to do them themselves.  When I checked with Limerick Corporation, of which I am not a <Col N="1935" /> member, I was told there were two carpenters and, if one was out sick, the other had to do all the carpentry work within that area.  You are talking about cutbacks. You are talking about a local authority which is local but has little or no authority to do anything.</P>
    <P>As the people who have been asked to pay an extra 10 per cent for their car tax. Gay Byrne, in his morning programme, addressed the potholes issue once again. He will tenaciously address the issue of those potholes for the next number of months and will tour the length and breadth of the country producing more and more paddle ponds of potholes.  That does not happen because they are not there &mdash; they are there.  People are outraged at the fact that the appalling state of our roads is not being addressed.  At a recent meeting of Limerick County Council it seemed that EC funds for national routeways were on the basis 71/29 per cent, so it is obvious the Government would look to the fact that they would get the higher percentage from Europe, because for the county roads the rate is 50/50.  The question would be which would you opt for.  Would you opt for the system which would create less of a drag on your own finances? Having regard to the roads in this country, apart from our peripheral location and other issues I will address, to create the Camelot picture referred to by Senator Cassidy shows he is not living in the real world.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance stated yesterday that a married man with four children on the dole is better off than someone working and receiving an income of £12,000 per annum.  That fact is staggering, because the incentive to work is not there any more.  Did the Minister for Finance do anything in the budget to alleviate that problem to improve the area of taxation?  No, he did not, but he did make promises for further budgets with tax rate cuts in the next two years. If economic growth were to slow down &mdash; and, hopefully, it will not slow down &mdash; the whole basis of those plans would be threatened and it would not be possible to <Col N="1936" /> do anything with regard to our taxation problems.  The disincentive to work would still be with us.</P>
    <P>The tourist area is a growth area and has been spoken about over and over again by the Taoiseach during his Presidency of the European Community.  I would make one impassioned plea to the Minister, Deputy Brennan, who may today decide on whether to remove the special status of Shannon Airport when he is meeting a group from the mid-west to state their case.  If anything happens in that area we are throwing out two things. We are disimproving the employment situation west of the Shannon from Donegal to the south-west and we are ignoring the whole concept of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>If James Dillon had his way there would be rabbits running around it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not live in the past. I know the famous quote from James Dillon.  I am living in the real world and the decision I am worried about is today. We are so environmentally friendly in the mid-west that we still have rabbits running around.  Looking at the present situation in Shannon, if anything happens to remove the special status, more and more people will join the dole queue. Problems will arise regarding companies which set up specifically there because of the trans-Atlantic gateway.  Look at the investment in tourism and the huge hotels that sprinkle the whole mid-west, west and south-west.  There is nothing to show that the tourists will come in their millions through Dublin Airport if the special status is lifted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It shows again that the people outside the Pale have to argue, cajole and develop action committees.  Why?  We are supposed to be committed to regional development.  What we are saying is that we have jobs there but we are quite happy to put them in jeopardy.  The Minister has not made a decision.  What has been extremely worrying for our tourists and industrialists sited in that area has been this terrible sense of &ldquo;Will they or won't they?&rdquo;  There is a vulnerability, a sense <Col N="1937" /> of fear, that anything can happen.  Politically speaking, perhaps it would have happened, or perhaps the local elections have caused the Minister to desist from a decision which would be detrimental to any situation regarding the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I will link that into integrated rural development.  We hear of off farm enterprises, the second son enterprises.  If we want to keep our people &mdash; our farmers, people in the rural areas and people in the towns &mdash; we have to link integrated rural development with tourism.  I am worried about a lack of coherent strategy in relation to integrated rural development, the funding that is available and its future direction.  I will give an obvious example of linking tourism with integrated rural development, a simple little project.  I spoke about it last week in the debate on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  A European park with an agricultural basis in that area would do a lot to encourage tourists. Tourists are very interested in folk parks, particularly our North American tourists. In the American mid-west you see all sorts of tourist promotions in relation to farming, the history of farming, farming activities and so on.  It is a golden opportunity for regional development to have a similar tourist attraction there, a further development of the Bunratty Folk Park, and to ensure that the agricultural sector should have an input, a part to play in and an employment gain from that area.</P>
    <P>The rent an Irish cottage scheme will not get funding because of the abolition of the business expansion scheme.  I hope that will not be a negative factor when the sale of those cottages comes up fairly soon.  They needed the investment from the business expansion scheme to bring them into line with the standards that have to be reached in 1992.</P>
    <P>In regard to education, I will be honest and say that I know the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has helped the whole infrastructure of education and that parents, teachers and children benefited, but there are some areas that did not.  I am glad Senator Conroy brought up language development.  You can only <Col N="1938" /> have language development of a positive nature.  In this country, we have been seen as failures &mdash; we are failures if we cannot have our own language, having spent at least 15 years studying and we still are not fluent.  Resources have to be provided if we are to address French, German and Spanish, which are important as well.  I would suggest that the resources for language development do not mean just teachers; they mean language laboratories and the facility to learn languages must be available to all students throughout the country.  The numbers of children in this country who have access to German are very low.</P>
    <P>Turning to a recent survey done by Professor Michael MacGréil as regards the barriers to access to third level education for working class people, I was appalled to see that there has been little or no improvement in that area.  This is something that has to be addressed. There are still unacceptably high levels of illiteracy.  That again relates to inequality in relation to education.  Professor MacGréil showed that a huge percentage of adults who partake in adult education classes are those who already have second and third level education. Adult education is not being taken up by people who need it because of the lack of confidence and the fact that they slipped through the net some time earlier.  It is very hard to tune them in to second chance education.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister, Deputy Calleary, is with us, because I hope there will be continued increases in our ODA so that we will reach the United Nations' target of 0.7 per cent of GNP by the year 2000.  Unfortunately, the problems of poverty and starvation have been rather overshadowed because of the debate on the Gulf War.  I hope he will look favourably at that area.  Despite all the grants the farmers are so poor at this stage that there is very little they can actually do.</P>
    <P>With regard to local government, I am looking forward to seeing the reforms.  I am sorry that the finance aspect has not been addressed and it will have to be addressed in the future.  My last point is that poverty is still very widespread; <Col N="1939" /> emigration and unemployment are still with us.  I would hope that there would be an emphasis on those particular areas from now on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate a fellow member from south Tipperary at being promoted to the Seanad.  We now have two beautiful, very efficient Tipperary people looking after us here in the Seanad and I am very proud of that, as are many other people from south Tipperary.</P>
      <P>I would like to say a few words in connection with what Senator Jackman said about Shannon Airport.  I support Shannon Airport fully.  My party in South Tipperary and Tipperary County Council discussed this issue some weeks ago and we fully support Shannon Airport.  It is of great assistance and service to south Tipperary.  I would like to assure Senator Jackman that this Government will continue to support and develop Shannon Airport, both the airport itself and the vast amount of surrounding industry that has been built up over the years, employing thousands of people.  It is a new town as Senator Jackman knows quite well. We are all delighted about that and I am sure there is a great future for Shannon Airport in the years ahead.  To quote the late Jim Dillon: &ldquo;There will be no rabbits and down the road there will be fine fields of wheat and beet growing.&rdquo;  That will create jobs as well.  Senator Jackman need not have any worries about Shannon Airport.  The Government will continue to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised that Senator Jackman is on a spending spree here this evening because she is slightly at odds with her fellow county member in Dáil Éireann, Deputy Michael Noonan, who warned the Minister for Finance in his budget speech not to be too liberal in certain areas because it could create more problems in the near future.  I wonder what the Fine Gael Party's policies are.  We would all like to see a lot more done but looking back &mdash; and you have to look back in politics &mdash; one recalls the problem which this Government had to face when <Col N="1940" /> they took office in 1987, a people with no hope in themselves or no hope in the country but thank God, people have the incentive today to invest, to work to rear and educate families and to provide a proper health service.</P>
    <P>The present Government were faced with a terrible national debt.  That is now under control and they have set about generating the confidence necessary to create jobs.  That has not been easy because we were at a new low since the outgoing Government could not agree among themselves.  At Cabinet level we had a breakup between the partners some weeks before the last general election of 1987 when they could not agree on a policy.  That was a clear indication of what had gone on for four years during which time the national debt had doubled.  It amazes me to see responsible people in Labour and Fine Gael screaming all over the place as they will for the next couple of months before the local elections.  You would think we had a gold mine behind Leinster House.  I pose the question: do these people want to sink this country further in debt &mdash; not to mention keeping the debt of over £26 billion under control &mdash; and allow another generation to carry the can or do they want the Government to tax the people more?  We cannot borrow more nor can we tax people more because it is all at the limit.  They must be responsible.</P>
    <P>The Government have done an excellent job in the last three and a half years to rescue the nation and to get us back on course.  They have been very successful and I would like to congratulate the trade union movement and all the other organisations &mdash; the farmers organisations and the employers organisations &mdash; who sat down together in the interests of the people of Ireland and of the future of our young people.  These organisations got around a table in the last few years to get our priorities right so that we would not be like two goats going over a hedge, one going one way and the other going the other way.  It seems to be working quite well.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman mentioned the rising unemployment figures.  They are rising <Col N="1941" /> but she forgot to mention that many people who emigrated to the UK in particular, some years ago are now flocking back because there are no jobs for them in England.  That is making the situation worse here.  Nobody likes to see people unemployed; nobody likes to see people emigrating and we hope in the years ahead that the situation will improve.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about An Post. They published their plan recently in a nice glossy green book.  I wonder what it cost?  They intend to close 500 post offices and to lay off 1,500 staff.  That suggestion amazes me.  We have the second highest postal charges in the EC and the service could be improved.  I was speaking to a person today who posted letters in south Tipperary mid-day on Monday and they had not yet reached their destination in Dublin this evening.  That is not a satisfactory service.  It cost £20 million last year to pay overtime in the head sorting office in Dublin.  Must the service to the people of rural Ireland, town and country, be sacrificed because we need to get that figure right?  I say no.  Were it not for the fact that post offices down the country are being operated by families receiving very small salaries they could not operate at all.  They endure great risks at times of post office raids, yet the people operating post offices get no reward for that.  They provide an excellent service and have been doing so through the years.  The lay-off of so many people in the postal service is grossly unfair because the service to rural Ireland is something we have always been proud of.</P>
    <P>The postman did not always have a bicyle and yet an excellent service was provided.  Postmen knew the people they were delivering the letters to, and they had a few words with them every morning. If some old person living in rural Ireland needed a doctor or somebody to call on them, the postman always passed on the message.  That service will be cut off now.  We are going to have biscuit tins at the top of a roadway where there might be three or four families living within two miles and an old aged pensioner will have to go out in bad weather to pick up a <Col N="1942" /> letter from a daughter or son.  The delivery service is going to be privatised.  The postal service will not be the same as in the past and people will lose confidence in the system if that happens.  I would be totally opposed to this.</P>
    <P>The situation in An Post is chaotic at present and I think the proposals put forward are totally unacceptable to us in rural Ireland and to the people in general. We are entitled to a service in rural Ireland.  I would not be speaking here this evening were it not for some of the good people in the boreens of Ireland.  When the call came they were there and they made great sacrifices and took great risks. Their names are not on slabs of marble anywhere, yet they sheltered and fed people on the run when they had little food for their own families.  These are the people who will now be left without a proper postal service because it costs £20 million in overtime in Sheriff Street head office to cover up bungling by the management. Management personnel have been changed so much during the past four or five years that it is like doing the Lotto.  That cannot be tolerated and I am sure the Minister, Deputy Séamus Brennan, will sort that out.  It is proposed to downgrade many post offices which, in Clonmel and Cahir, would result in the loss of about 20 jobs.  If that happens the service will be very poor.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is at a crossroads.  Farmers' incomes have been dropping over the last year and a half.  Families will find it very hard to survive in rural Ireland because of GATT and CAP proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Bryne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to wish the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy O'Kennedy, every success in the weeks ahead when he negotiates on behalf of the nation, because it is not farmers' incomes alone which are at stake here but thousands of other jobs also.  I am sure with his experience as Minister for Foreign Affairs and as former Commissioner that he will see to it that the needs of all farmers will be properly looked after because with the drop in milk prices, <Col N="1943" /> grain prices, sheep prices and beef prices we are in a crisis and the Minister will need all the support we can give him in that battle.</P>
      <P>When the media mention agriculture they talk about farmers but they never mention the thousands of jobs that have been created downstream and if the farming community are in trouble all those jobs are put at risk, in creameries, meat factories and in the fertiliser, machinery and chemical industries.  I hope in the national interest the Minister will be successful.</P>
      <P>The Government do not have a gold mine behind Leinster House.  They will not borrow any more because they are a responsible Government.  They want this country to be a place where our young people can live in the future without carrying a national debt around their necks, or having to stay around until the taxes are paid to pay off that debt.  Direct taxation is high enough.  They are trying to reduce that burden.</P>
      <P>The Government have acted very wisely in the last number of years even though there was a very serious problem. I would appeal to people not to raise hopes during the couple of months leading up to the local elections by saying that we must plough more money into the health services.  The Government would be very popular if they opened the floodgates and borrowed.  However, they would make the country less attractive for industrial development in the years ahead because we had reached the stage where no one would start an industry here because of the financial mismanagement of the previous Government over four years.  Confidence has returned thanks to the Taoiseach and the Government and we appreciate that.  We must think of the next generation and not play party politics.  If the Government who were in office for four years from November 1982 to January 1987, had played less politics and thought more of what they were doing we could be making more progress here today.</P>

      <P>While I do not want to take Senator Byrne to task on various issues, I want to put on the record that the performance of the Coalition Government was not at all as the Senator has outlined.  We do not want recriminations as they are of no value at this stage.  We do not have to go any further than 1977 when the rot set in as massive reckless spending was embarked upon that set the economy on a downward slide.  The trouble began in 1977 with the removal of domestic rates and car tax and the very generous approach to the electorate which gave the present Fianna Fáil Party a majority of 20 seats in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the present position one cannot but be disturbed about the prospects. We had a debate recently on agriculture when we discussed the serious position that obtains now within the industry compared to what pertained in <Col N="1945" /> previous years.  I am extremely concerned about the years ahead because we must be more concerned about the future than the past and present.  We should be anxious to learn from the mistakes made by successive Governments in the past. Mistakes have been made by all parties and we must now rally together to make sure that we can salvage the situation. We must also acknowledge that many of the decisions in the future will not be taken in Dublin by the Irish Government but in Brussels and in other international centres.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to Shannon Airport. I am encouraged by the unqualified assurance from Senator Byrne from the Government side of the House that Shannon Airport will continue to be supported as it has been in the past.  I would take that as a guarantee that it will get the necessary funding as time goes on.  This is very reassuring to the mid-western region and nationally.  There are three areas in which we can hope to earn money in future and those are agriculture, tourism and industry.  The present prospects of earning much money from agriculture to help pay for the non-earning sectors are not great.  We rely on tourism and on industry to help pay for health expenditure, education, law and order, environmental control expenditure and so on. These areas are vitally important for the well-being of our people but they are not in a position to finance themselves.</P>
    <P>I stress the position with regard to health.  It is absolutely diabolical that no real attempt is being made to tackle the problem of the health services.  There is no point in referring the matter back to health boards as they do not have money. We should be talking about the Department of Health and how it might initiate a national health policy that would give all our people a meaningful and caring service when illness befalls them.  This is extremely serious and needs tackling urgently.</P>
    <P>It cannot be over-stressed how serious unemployment is both socially and economically. Regrettably, 17 to 20 per cent, and indeed 20 per cent to 30 per cent in <Col N="1946" /> some areas, of our people are unemployed. That situation must be redressed. Emigration alleviates the unemployment situation, but that is a very poor way of solving that problem.  Let us recognise that it is there and cannot be overlooked.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the MacSharry proposals. At present there is a lot of confusion about these proposals while the position in agriculture is very serious. Commissioner MacSharry, who I acknowledge has performed a good job in his portfolio as Commissioner for Agriculture, has claimed continually that only the top 10 per cent of farmers would be affected by his proposed new policies. This is totally and utterly untrue.  All farmers would be seriously affected. While farmers with less than 42,000 gallons might escape the quota cut, all farmers would be affected by the 10 per cent price cut for milk and by the 15 per cent price cut for beef.  For example, a 30,000 gallon producer would have his annual income cut from £9,252 to approximately £7,000 but could expect compensation of only about £263.  This would be a net loss to that unfortunate farmer in 1991 of 21 per cent of his family farm income.  A farmer with, say, 20 single suckling cows in a disadvantaged area, selling one and a half year old store cattle, which would be the general pattern for that type of farming, would have his annual income cut from £4,500 to £2,500, a cut of 43 per cent.  Therefore, it is ludicrous to attempt to tell us that only people at a certain level in agriculture will have their incomes cut.</P>
    <P>If we compare industrial incomes with farm incomes at present we will see a very adverse differential developing for farm incomes.  It is relevant to quote the Teagasc figures with regard to family farm incomes and the CSO figures for the industrial incomes.  In 1985 the average farm income was £4,882; the average industrial earnings for the same year were £9,162.  In 1986, farm income was £4,327 and industrial income was £9,861.  In 1987, farm income was £5,779 and industrial income was £10,322.  In 1988 the average farm income was £7,197 and the average industrial income was £10,854. <Col N="1947" /> In 1989, the average farm income was £6,907 and the average industrial income was £11,274.  In 1990, average farm income was £6,096 and industrial income was £11,025.  The average farm income as a percentage of industrial earnings, as can be seen from that, is dramatically low.  Going down through these years, the income gap would be 53 per cent, 43 per cent, 56 per cent, 66 per cent, 59 per cent and 52 per cent.  This is not to say that industrial wages are excessive but it shows how underpaid is the farming population.</P>
    <P>We are a small island on the periphery of Europe, severely disadvantaged, far away from the marketplace with a variable climate which is not always good for farmers.  Unless we get special help we are not going to be successful.  I have already stated that in 1990 &mdash; and the position in 1991 will be even worse &mdash; some farmers were faced with a nil income.  Things are that bad.  The only people who may have some future in the farming arena at this time are those producing milk or sugar beet.  Those producing beef, cereals and various other items are in serious trouble.  I appeal to the Government, through Brussels, to intervene and to make sure that it does stop the implementation of the GATT proposals.  Otherwise, Irish agriculture is going to be in serious trouble.</P>
    <P>The Americans &mdash; a nation I admired recently when I spoke on the Gulf War &mdash; are totally irresponsible in their efforts to apply world prices to our country. Neither the Americans, the Cairns Group countries or any South American countries are aware of our problems.  We must bear in mind that 97 per cent of the population of these GATT countries are not engaged in farming.  Only 3 per cent of the population are involved in farming so it is logical and obvious that the remaining 97 per cent will exert significant influence on those who take the decisions.  The situation is very serious. You, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, are very familiar with the position as is the Minister and, indeed, my colleagues on the right. It is going to require nothing less than a <Col N="1948" /> united effort from all concerned to ensure that, as a nation, we will survive economically and socially so that people can continue living in this country.</P>
    <P>Migration from the country to the city has always been a problem; people have gravitated towards Dublin, Cork, Limerick and the larger towns throughout the country.  Now, the destination is London if work is available there, or America, Canada or somewhere else.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to state that while this Appropriation Act is an appraisal of expenditure by Government over the last 12 months, we have little to be proud of at the present time.</P>
    <P>The areas of health, taxation, unemployment and agriculture need urgent and immediate attention from our Government through use of their full muscle in Brussels.  They should, when necessary and appropriate, call for input from persons of other political parties to help this country progress and survive into the future.</P>

      <P>Before I call on Senator Norris I would like to draw the attention of the House to a correction in the text of the amendment to the motion circulated on the supplementary Order Paper today.  The words &ldquo;in this regard&rdquo; should be deleted and I have arranged for this corrected version to be circulated in the House.  I call on Senator Norris. As the proposer of the motion, he has 30 minutes and each Senator speaking after that has 15 minutes.  Senator Norris has 15 minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad you have removed three words from the amendment and I wish that the Government party would find it in their heart to remove the entire amendment because I do not think it is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1949" /> I move:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann urges the Government immediately to set in train a review of the criminal law governing the sale of contraceptives in the light of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the judgment of 26 February 1991, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the implications of the judgment for the spread of HIV infection among young people.</P>
    <P>This motion is quite deliberately general and I do not think it should cause any problem on the Government side. Indeed, it is interesting that the Government have moved quite rapidly.  I placed this motion on the Order Paper the day after the judgment was made clear and before the Government had taken any steps to indicate, through a series of leaks, that they at last intended, as a reactive measure, to go some way to meet the concerns of the Irish public in this regard.</P>
    <P>I say again that this is a reactive measure and it is a great pity that no Government have ever grasped the nettle of the law governing contraception in a positive and realistic manner.  The indications I have are that the Government may still intend to tinker with the existing law and not engage in the radical change which is necessary in the light of human rights and of the necessity to remove any possible indication of sectarianism in our law.  I will return to that because it is quite plain that family planning legislation is grossly sectarian in its framing and in its application because it applies the ethical standards of one denomination exclusively. It is also necessary to protect the citizens of this country against a very dangerous, and so far incurable, disease. I am not sure that through these inspired leaks I have detected any significant change in the Government's attitude other than that of being reactive to the circumstances.  I hope I am wrong.</P>
    <P>I refer the House to the previous debate in 1985 when the Minister, then an Opposition Deputy, said:</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister <Col N="1950" /> has not changed the provision in the 1979 Act for support for natural methods of family planning.  Many people use these methods and find them very satisfactory.  It is only right that we should continue to support the promotion of natural methods of family planning.</P>
    <P>The question of natural methods of family planning implies the word &ldquo;natural&rdquo; in a way which clearly indicates it has derived from Roman Catholic theology. The Bill institutes and requires the Government to support in various ways, including financial, what is called natural family planning.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be contentious but the view outside that of orthodox Roman Catholic theologians would be that there is nothing natural about taking the temperature of the female generative organs and then plotting a mathematical graph to discover when the infertile section of the woman's ovulation cycle occurs. Many people consider this as unnatural as the use of a rubber barrier shield by the male.  The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the sale of non-medical contraceptives to those over 18 years of age.  This is a major departure from the principles of the 1979 Act which was, as I said earlier, to make contraceptives available only for bona fide purposes of family planning.</P>
    <P>Again, this is a phrase which recurs in thinking on this area and causes me some considerable concern.  What is &ldquo;bona fides&rdquo; purposes of family planning?  It would seem to exclude the use of a contraceptive as a prophylactic.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware of the fact that the condom has an honourable history of being used as a prophylactic that goes back at least to the time of comparable infection in Europe when the first adventurers to the American continent brought back, among other things, the dubious gift of syphilis.  Condoms were developed as a protection against infection. I put it to the House that this is a very important value for the use of contraception.  He continued:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1951" /> This has not very much to do with health.  This decision of the Government is causing concern throughout the country.  As we, the Minister and the Government know, and the people certainly know, it means that contraceptives will be freely available to any teenager.  It is not possible to enforce this age limit.  There is nothing to stop a young girl of 15 or 16 years of age from going into a chemist shop wearing high heel shoes and asking for contraceptives.  How is the chemist to know her age?  Equally, there is nothing to stop a group from going off for a weekend on holiday and someone over 18 years of age buying contraceptives.</P>
    <P>When Deputy O'Hanlon, as he was then, said: &ldquo;it means that contraceptives will be freely available to any teenager&rdquo;, I would have to say, would that it were so. That is precisely what the case should be and I would like to tackle head on the argument that it is dangerous to make contraceptives available to young people. It is dangerous not to make them available to young people.  Does anybody actually suggest that young people become sexually excited at the sight of a condom?  I do not believe this is the case. Children are not sexually excited by exposure to the sight of a condom. However, sexually active young people need and are entitled to this kind of protection, both from unscheduled and unwanted pregnancies and from the risk of infection.  I would like to state what the actual state of play is with regard to unwanted, unscheduled pregnancies and infection, because it is quite clear that a considerable number of young people, according to the Government's own fact sheets, become pregnant because of a lack of information about contraception. I refer to the fact sheet issued by the health education section of the Department of Health under the heading, &ldquo;Births To Single Mothers&rdquo; which states:</P>
    <P>The number of births to single mothers in Ireland is heavily concentrated in the younger age range of <Col N="1952" /> the fertility span.  In 1986, 31 per cent of births registered as outside marriage were to women aged between 15 and 18 years and 41 per cent were to women in the 20 to 24 age group.  In relation to the youngest women there is concern about both the physical aspects of childbearing at that age and the social circumstances of young mothers.  A greater than average number of physical complications is associated with adolescent pregnancies.  One recent study found that Irish adolescents who become pregnant are more likely to keep their children than to give them up for adoption.  However, the desire to keep their child often places young mothers under severe economic stress and many live close to the poverty line. This is in spite of the allowance for single mothers which was introduced in 1973.  Although the adolescent mothers in this study had usually been involved in a steady relationship for a period of time, 85 per cent of the pregnancies were unplanned and 58 per cent of the mothers had not even considered using contraception.</P>
    <P>Those are figures that would give any reasonable, decent person, certainly any caring family doctor or parent, grave cause for concern.  Thirty-one per cent of births registered outside marriage occurred to women between 15 and 18 years of age and these are precisely the people whom the prevailing ethos of Government has suggested should if possible be frustrated in their attempts to acquire access to contraception.  This is an absurdity and more than an absurdity, it is a moral outrage.</P>
    <P>The question of access to condoms is also important.  They should be freely available in dispensing machines, public houses, public lavatories and so on.  It is a particularly mean attitude of mind that would seek to embarrass and shame young people when purchasing these items.  That is what is intended by removing them from places like the Virgin Megastore.  It is much better to have them in an atmosphere where young people will feel comfortable having access to <Col N="1953" /> them rather than, for example, going into a middle aged chemist of prim moral views where they may not feel abashed but be abashed.  I do not think anybody is in danger from a condom.  People are in danger from unprotected sexual activity.</P>
    <P>I turn in this regard to what the Archbishop of Armagh, Dr. Cahal Daly, said in his radio interview on Sunday.  I found it very interesting.  It is obvious that the Roman Catholic hierarchy have begun to move.  The Archbishop acknowledged that condoms, properly used, could constitute an effective barrier against infection. This is a considerable advance from some years ago when they claimed that the only protection against HIV infection was monogamy, faithfulness within marriage and chastity outside marriage, which seemed to me to be ridiculous because I do not believe that a virus is capable of distinguishing between the married and unmarried.  At least there is an acknowledgment of the realities but I am afraid it is too late.</P>
    <P>I take up another point with which I agree.  The Archbishop said that anyone who cares for another person will not wish to expose them to even the slightest risk of infection.  I agree.  There is no question that this is the case.  Is one not exposing people to the risk of infection in what seems almost a deliberate, calculated and punitive way if one does not make contraceptives available freely to young people?  It is young people who are the most at risk.  The evidence seems quite clear that parents agree with this.  I have a report from the <i>Evening Press</i> of 8 December, 1986 in which a survey made it quite clear that a majority of parents believe there should be sex education which would include dealing with the subject of condoms.</P>
    <P>I would like to address another issue that was raised by Archbishop Daly.  It is frequently said by those who oppose advances in this area that the spread of AIDS through non-drug related sexual contact was not as rampant as it was in countries where condoms were available in almost every public place.  I am afraid the Archbishop has been grossly misled in this.  The figures are against him.  It is <Col N="1954" /> not true.  One could instance the Republic of China but one does not have to go as far away as China.</P>
    <P>I would like to place on the record of the House some facts which the Minister may find interesting.  I refer to statistics concerning the number of cases per 100,000 reported in 1988 as being full blown AIDS.  Ireland has one case per 100,000; Sweden, which might well be the kind of country which the Archbishop was thinking about, has also one per 100,000; Finland, another Nordic country, has 0.3 and Norway has 0.7.  It just simply is not true to say that societies in which condoms are freely available are societies in which the rate of transmission through non-drug related methods is higher.  In fact, the evidence seems quite clear that condoms are an effective method &mdash; 92 per cent effective &mdash; in inhibiting the spread of infection.  Those countries which make condoms available have a lower rate of infection than those which inhibit the sale of condoms.  For these reasons the current state of the law is quite unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister a few questions.  I will be able to return for the second part of the debate next Wednesday to comment on what the Minister says.  I would like to ask something about the background of this case.  I am a little worried about it.  I am worried about the way in which the prosecution was brought.  There is more than a possibility that certain groups who have appointed themselves the moral guardians of this State have been involved in this.  I do not believe that policemen walk into shops off their own bat and simply try to break the law by acquiring contraceptives.  A complaint must have been made.  I would like the Minister to come clean with the House and indicate, if he is aware of the information, from what source did this complaint come.  I am aware of this kind of activity in numerous areas, by small, unrepresentative groups who wish to frustrate the development of the law in this area.  I recognise there may be some difficulties for the Minister in dealing with his own backwoodsmen, as they would be described.  I would like to place on the <Col N="1955" /> record of the House that in my presence during the week a member of the Government party, who on one occasion represented&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the possibility of coming back next Wednesday so I will just simply place an extrapolation from the facts on the record and then return to the remark at the point where I was interrupted <Col N="1956" /> by this fire scare.  The point I would like to make to the Minister is that the latest available figures would suggest that there is a rate of infection in this country of one per 100,000 &mdash; I cannot remember the exact figure but I did some work on it.</P>
      <P>The latest available figures, which I will place on the record of the House next week, indicate quite clearly that one person in every 1,000 is HIV positive. The figures available suggest that it is one in every 4,000 but it becomes much lower because the internationally accepted multiplier is three or four.  The rate of infection actually in the population is three to four times that which registers in statistics.  That is a fact that ought to be placed on the record of the House.  In the flurry of the fire alarm the paper with these detailed figures got mislaid so I will place the figures on the record the next day.</P>
      <P>I was starting to talk about the attitudes of what I decribe as backwoods men with whom the Minister may very well have to deal in his own party.  I have indicated already that I felt his attitude in 1985 left a good deal to be desired.  I can sympathise with him now having to deal with people.  I started to indicate that a remark was addressed to me during the week by somebody, a member of his party and for some time, represented this country in Europe, &mdash; made, perhaps, in a slightly jocular fashion &mdash; that having sexual intercourse when wearing a condom was like washing your feet with your socks on.  This kind of attitude is juvenile and unhelpful and it suggests a kind of masculine bravado and insensitivity that is conducive to the spread of the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister also to turn his mind back, if he can, to some of the remarks I was making before the fire alarm went off.  I had indicated that I felt the application of the law tended towards the sectarian.  I would like to ask the Minister if he has funded family planning using contraceptives outside what was described as the natural family planning method?  If the Minister has not funded or grant-aided the schemes why has he <Col N="1957" /> not done so?  It is important that we know the attitude of the Government in this matter.</P>
    <P>The situation is that our Government health authorities refuse to inform married couples about the use of contraceptives for family planning purposes, although the use of contraceptives is a right established as such under Irish law. It is appropriate that the Seanad should once again discuss these matters because, as the Minister knows, the President of Ireland, Mrs. Robinson, in 1971 attempted to introduce a measure enabling the use of contraceptives and was denied even a First Reading.</P>
    <P>The situation was opened up in December 1973 as a result of the decision in the Magee case and a limited form of availability was introduced at that time. Again, it was a reactive situation.  I do not think there was any great generosity by the Government in that.  There is no law requiring a refusal on the part of the Government.  Nevertheless, the health authorities, especially the eight regional health boards, are not permitted to distribute any information relating to the use of contraceptives for family planning purposes, nor do the Government assist any of the private voluntary family planning associations to distribute such information.</P>
    <P>Instead, the Government allow only family planning information which corresponds to that regarded as natural by the Roman Catholic Church to be distributed despite the fact that freedom of conscience and of religion is permitted under the Constitution.  Similarly, the Government will only provide financial support for the distribution of family planning information, which corresponds to the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, to private voluntary associations. These decisions have been taken despite the fact that no law exists on the Statute Book prohibiting the distribution of information on the use of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>The decision not to do so is entirely the decision of the Government and especially of the Minister for Health.  In <Col N="1958" /> effect, the decision to prohibit the distribution of information on the use of contraceptives by married couples for family planning purposes is the result of an arbitrary decision which clearly imposes on citizens, a specific code of religious morality, that of the Roman Catholic Church.  Such a decision is contrary both to the provisions of the Constitution in relation to freedom of conscience, Article 44, and the citizens' rights, Article 40.</P>
    <P>I would like once more to refer to what Archbishop Daly said because it seems that the Government are too heavily influenced by what ecclesiastical authorities have to say in these matters.  The Archbishop, Dr. Daly, said:</P>
    <P>Legislation enabling the wider availability of contraceptives will have profound implications for the moral quality of life.  This must be kept in mind in the enactment of such legislation. It was a question of the legislators respecting the moral convictions to which people adhere which are influenced by the membership of their Church.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that the Archbishop did not restate what was said in the earlier debate by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, that was that despite the position that might be taken up by that group with regard to the morality of contraceptives it was the responsibility of legislators to legislate.</P>
    <P>That is a very important principle.  It is a principle, the Chair will recall from the debate on the Adelaide Hospital, that where there is a situation in which the State institutes a particular ethos, in this case the ethos of the Roman Catholic Church, it is not possible to do so without violating the consciences of all those who do not subscribe to the tenets of that Church.  However, the converse is not the case.  If you allow a pluralist ethos to be instituted through the law governing sexual matters, you respect the Roman Catholic ethos in as far as the institution of the Roman Catholic Church is capable of persuading its members that they <Col N="1959" /> ought to follow what is the moral orthodoxy of that Church.</P>
    <P>I believe it is important to recognise the question of choice, I have to say that it would not be satisfactory to me, or to many people from my background, to be placed in a situation where we were told that the rest of the community had to pay the penalty for the inadequacy of the Roman Catholic authorities in convincing their flock of the justice of their position with regard to the question of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly clear, it is observable, that there is now a divergence between the practice of the vast majority of Roman Catholic people on this island and the teachings of their Church in the matter of contraception.  I believe it is this window of opportunity that the Government have detected and that it is this opportunity which they are now following by indicating that at last they intend to alter the laws regarding contraception.</P>
    <P>I believe this question of choice is extremely important.  I would like to quote in support of this from the debate in February 1985 when this point was addressed by Deputy Desmond O'Malley now a Minister in the Coalition Government. Deputy O'Malley quoted the speech of a New York Governor, Mario U. Cuomo.  In a speech in the University of Notre Dame, which he describes as an American Catholic classic in terms of its wide-ranging dealing with issues he says:</P>
    <P>That speech dealt in depth with these issues and made it very clear where the duty of a Catholic legislator lies.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote the entire speech but it is 7,000 words long.  I will give two brief quotations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Acting Chairman (Professor Conroy) Acting Chairman (Professor Conroy)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Professor Conroy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Senator give us the source of the quotation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Dáil Official Report of 20 February 1985, columns 279 to 280, and it states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1960" /> The Catholic public official lives the political truth most Catholics through most of American history have accepted and insisted on: the truth that to assure our freedom we must allow others the same freedom, even if occasionally it produces conduct by them which for us would be sinful. The preservation of this freedom, the Governor argues, must be &ldquo;a pervasive and dominant concern&rdquo; in the complex interplay of forces and considerations that go into the making of our laws and policies.</P>
    <P>He then went on to quote the end of the Governor's speech where, the Deputy said, Governor Cuomo expresses an element of Catholicism which we do not often hear in this country:</P>
    <P>Catholics must practice the teaching of Christ...not just by trying to make laws for others to live by, but by living the laws already written for us by God. We can be fully Catholic; clearly, proudly, totally at ease with ourselves, a people in the world transforming it, a light to this nation.  Appealing to the best in our people, not the worst. Persuading not coercing.  Leading people to truth by love and still, all the while, respecting and enjoying our unique pluralistic democracy.  And we can do it even as politicians.</P>
    <P>That is the core of what I have tried to argue.  We need a genuine move towards pluralism in this country.  The Minister has an opportunity that he can be niggardly, he can merely cobble another couple of amendments to the existing legislation and increase the number of outlets and so on, perhaps even reduce the age.  I do not want to be cynical but with an Ard-Fheis coming up at the weekend it would not be at all surprising if some announcement of this kind were to be made.  There have been rumours of it already.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that this again is niggardly and parsimonious.  I have indicated that condoms are effective, not only in preventing unwanted conception, they are effective as a prophylactic against <Col N="1961" /> disease.  They are known to be so; they are demonstrated to be so.  The argument that the contraceptive mentality assists in the spread of disease has been shown by the statistics I read into the record earlier not to be the case.  Therefore, it is essential that condoms should be made available as widely as possible.</P>
    <P>There should be no age barrier.  I repeat what I said to the Minister earlier. People are always raising this spectre of children, that we must protect children. What child will be sexually excited by the prospect of a condom?  On the other hand, young people are at risk.  The figures I have read into the record make this quite plain.  A considerable number of the unwanted pregnancies occur between the ages of 15 and 18.  These are the people we ought to protect.  These are the people it is our responsibility to protect.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the legislation proposed by the Government will do this. I will suspend judgment until I hear what the Minister has to say, but I would remind him that I have an opportunity, in circumstances, perhaps, that will be less fraught by fire, to return and comment on what he has to say this evening.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;endorses the commitment of the Government as set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to review the operation of family planning services and their intention to amend the law as necessary to make non-medical contraceptives more readily available.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put the matter straight.  One would think it was Fianna Fáil who introduced the last Bill into this House.  I would like to remind speakers that it was the last Coalition Government of Fine Gael and Labour who introduced the <Col N="1962" /> Bill.  The way in which many people, through the media, and speaking politically, are either deploring this Government and Fianna Fáil, one would think that it was they who brought it in.  First of all, I want to correct that.</P>
    <P>Changes in laws are nothing new.  Certainly Fianna Fáil and the Government had decided in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to take this issue on board and bring it up-to-date.  Those things must be done according to a broad consensus of people, not just the whims or fancies of a few.  That is what democracy is all about.</P>
    <P>It is good to remind people that we have changed laws on drink and drinking hours.  We have changed laws regarding drugs and where they could be sold.  We changed all laws in regard to where animal drugs could be sold.  We have changed laws and regulations in regard to certain medicines.  We have changed the laws in regard to where poison can be sold.  We have changed the laws as far as tobacco and cigarettes are concerned, where they can be smoked and not smoked.  We have been updating various laws.  That is natural progression.  This did not come about because of the Megastore issue, because the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was well and truly sealed and signed before this case.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed to hear Senators condoning those who deliberately violate the laws of the land.  It is our duty to change them and update them but it is not our duty to praise those who violate them.  That is a sad reflection on people in high authority.  I am very disappointed at that attitude.  Whatever the laws may be, this is the place to change them.  We do not encourage people to break the law.  If that is what we are teaching our young people in our universities it is sad and it does not represent the views of the majority of teachers.  It would be a very small minority who would adopt that attitude. The previous speaker consistently implied that young people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is typical of the Senator to interrupt people.  He is consistently interrupting even on the Order of Business.  People engaged in professional teaching do not talk down to people all the time; they respect the people they are talking to.  Unfortunately, it is not a characteristic of the Senator.</P>
      <P>The implication is that young people today are promiscuous and implies they go on holidays to buy condoms in another country.  That is not far from the truth.  The majority of young people are very good, decent and respectable people and they do not live a promiscuous life as seems to be implied here.  They are more conservative now than they were in the thirties. We can see that from the attitude of most students and young people today. They go about their business and they go on holidays because they like to and not because there is something for sale.  They go for value for money, sun and various other things but not specifically for condoms as was implied.  I have reared a family, I never pass a young hitch-hiker without offering that person a lift and from talking to them I find them very decent, very conservative and wise.  They are not looking for condoms around every corner.  They are more interested in business and jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bishop Daly is entitled to use the media to speak to the large number of people he represents.  If the Senator had his way nobody with different views would be allowed to speak.  It is the right of the Bishop to say what he likes and I make no apology for anything he says.  It is up to legislators to legislate.  It must be based on a broad consensus of what the <Col N="1964" /> majority of people want and not just what one or two people, with access to the media, want.  The media highlight everything that makes a good headline to sell a paper, and good luck to them.  It is their business to sell papers and if they do not do that they are not in business.  It is hard to write an article praising something all the time but it is easy to write an article condemning something.</P>
    <P>I know the Government will study the situation and when they bring in a law it will be a good one.  We know there is need to liberalise the sale of condoms but I do not think the majority of people want condoms for sale in every corner shop.  I do not think they would like to see boxes of condoms beside childrens' comics in a paper shop, or in slot machines in every toilet.</P>
    <P>I must issue a word of warning.  The people who are talking now and interested in promoting condoms are the same type of people who not very long ago were criticising multinationals.  Now they are trying to make money for multinationals because that is what this is all about.  There were millions of condoms sold in this country last year and they intend to increase those sales.  It is making money for Virgin records.  It is making money for the agent for Mates.  That is what it is all about, money.</P>
    <P>If condoms were the answer to this problem there would not be AIDS in Scandinavia, Norway, Sweden, England or America.  They have all had condoms for a long time but it has not stopped the spread of AIDS.  We have fewer people with AIDS.  There could be a false security among people who might be innocent enough to think that condoms were the answer.  It was not a man who said that sex with a condom is like washing your feet with socks on.  I listened to that programme. It was a lady who said that on one of the morning chat shows.</P>
    <P>In 1989 there were 59 million condoms sold in this country.  It is not solving any problem.  Nobody can say that if condoms were freely available in every corner shop like lollipops there would be no sexually transmitted diseases in any country.  We are trying to encourage young people <Col N="1965" /> who may not be interested.  Soon we will have elaborate advertising telling us how good those things are.  I never had any reason to use them or my father or grandfather or generations before me.  I am delighted about that because they are completely unnecessary.  I do not think we need to have them everywhere.  There is a consensus that there is a need to liberalise the sale of contraceptives but not to the extent that they will be made available at every sweet shop.  If we are to increase the outlets this should be studied carefully and we should bring in a law that is satisfactory to the majority of people. There is no consensus for the unfettered availability of condoms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to set clear parameters for this debate and to set a clear position as a background to the debate.  The day has arrived when what goes on in private between consenting adults is no longer a matter for the State. That is the basic background position that we have to adopt in this debate.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the recent judgment and from subsequent discussion that the law is defective.  What is necessary is to amend this defective law.  I am very disappointed that the Government have not yet spelt out exactly how they propose to amend the law.  The Government have not yet told us what their exact position on the legislation is, what changes to the existing law are implicit in the Fianna Fáil amendment?  What will the differences be as a result of the Fianna Fáil changes? Where will condoms be available?  To whom will they be available?  In what circumstances will they be available? That is what makes this debate something of a misnomer.  That is what makes this debate almost a sad irrelevance because we are debating from a position of ignorance in that we do not have the Government's proposals on the table.  I would appeal to the Government to state their proposals immediately so that we can debate them.  Then this will have some relevance for all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the debate on condoms in this country is very much a hang-over from the sixties and the early seventies.  It is as <Col N="1966" /> if there is a lack of maturity within people who still go on debating yesterday's news and yesterday's realities.  The condoms debate is a non-reality now and at this stage it should be a non-debate.  I appeal to the Minister to put in place legislation that will wipe this debate off the agenda because it is by no means the most important matter in the eyes of people at the moment.  It is by no means the thing that occupies the concern of the people at the moment.  What does concern the people is the real health issues, the real social issues, the real economic issues behind the condom debate.</P>
    <P>In that context, I believe that there is justifiable concern in this country about the AIDS issue.  I am concerned at the number of health care workers who are involved in the AIDS area.  I am concerned about the facilities for dealing with the AIDS epidemic.  I want to know that people with AIDS are being looked after properly.  That is what concerns the people and that is why I want the condom debate off the agenda because it is a misnomer, it is yesterday's news, it is a sixties and an early seventies issue.  I want it off the agenda but I want the treatment of AIDS on the agenda.  I want hospital care on the agenda.  I want the number of workers involved in the AIDS areas on the agenda.  If I want AIDs on the agenda, I, as Fine Gael spokesperson, want sex education on the agenda.  I believe that we must introduce in our schools, in our youth clubs throughout this State a comprehensive programme of sex education.  That has to be a realistic part of our policy.  That must be what we are about rather than mucking around with irrelevancies.  Let us do the job in a businesslike fashion and let us get on to real issues like sex education.  If we have a good programme of sex education, it would be my contention that such a programme must improve the quality of life in the country, that such a programme must militate against a contraceptive mentality that could permeate this State.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael do not support a contraceptive mentality.  What we support is adequate sex education, adequate standards, adequate quality of educational <Col N="1967" /> and social experiences for young people that will militate against promiscuity.  If we need education facilities and if we need a consistent attack on the AIDS problem and a complete holistic programme for dealing with AIDS, we must also address in a very compassionate, supportive and very realistic way the question of unmarried mothers.  If we had a proper sex education programme in place and if we make the necessary amendments to the law, which I want clearly spelled out, then we might be able to limit the number of unmarried mothers, particularly among teenagers. But for those who are to be unmarried mothers, let us discuss as a matter of urgency how we can cope with these mothers, what we can do for these unmarried mothers, what kinds of facilities we have, what kind of support systems we have for their family units, what sort of educational and social back-up we have for those family units.  Do we condemn such a girl if she takes any unacceptable steps to deal with her pregnancy? These are the issues we must address.  When we look at the issue of the unmarried mother &mdash; and there is a hidden agenda here &mdash; we must look at the question of unemployment and social deprivation in inner cities, in urban areas and throughout the country.  We must give hope to the hopeless, we must give a sense of hope to people in black spots of unemployment.  We must correct our taxation system and our employment generating methodology so that there will be employment and so that there will be hope for people who are in a negative culture and who have a nihilistic feeling about life.  That is the kind of response to the condom debate that we need.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I would say let us obliterate the sixties and seventies news.  It was relevant then but now let the Minister tackle the issue and tell the House in very specific terms what he proposes. When the Minister gives the House this information, my party will be very cooperative with him.  We will act constructively in the national interest.  In other words, if the suggestion put forward <Col N="1968" /> by the Minister has a workable viability, is based on reality and has the potential to deal with the issue, it will receive the positive backing of the Fine Gael Party. We will respond when we know exactly what the Minister proposes because the onus is now on the Government to address this issue and to amend the legislation. Let us do that immediately and let us then address the real agenda which is how we treat our AIDS victims, how we provide a comprehensive sex education, how we provide support systems of a realistic type for unmarried mothers and how we can cope with the horrible spectre of unemployment which creates the kind of culture, the kind of hopelessness and nihilism that gives rise to rampant promiscuity and excessive numbers of unwanted pregnancies.</P>
    <P>On that basis I rest my case, and I do so in anticipation of a speedy, businesslike and intelligent response by the Government to this issue which will get the thing off the agenda because it is an irrelevance.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment put down by my party member and Leader of the Seanad, Senator Sean Fallon, that Seanad Éirann endorses the commitment of the Government as set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to review the operation of family planning services and their <Col N="1969" /> intention to amend the laws necessary to make non-medical contraceptives more readily available.  The Government and the Minister here present are to be commended for this decision.</P>
      <P>Modern times dictate modern practices and what was applicable in the seventies is no longer applicable today.  I am glad to see that our Government accept this and are taking steps to rectify and improve the situation.  AIDS, as we all know, is a major scourge worldwide today and it did not exist as far as we were concerned as a disease in the seventies. Accordingly, the same urgency which applies now was not relative then.  Our Government &mdash; the Minister will refer to this later &mdash; have undertaken a major campaign in relation to the AIDS crisis and anything that will help to alleviate and improve this problem must be commended. Any efforts we can make towards preventing the spread of AIDS or towards alleviating the situation is to be commended.</P>
      <P>As a doctor, I would have to refer to condoms as a factor in helping to limit the spread of other venereal diseases as well.  As was said earlier, we are now probably living in a more open and permissive society and we will obviously suffer the consequences of this if we do not take the appropriate action to protect our young people.  I would agree with Senator Willie Farrell &mdash; and I am not in any way critical or speaking in any way against our young people &mdash; that we must make every effort to protect them as much as we can.  It is also a medically proven fact that condoms reduce the incidence of cervical carcinoma, a disease that is probably a major killer in our female population.  It is one of the legacies the male conveys to his female counterpart.  That is another indication of why we should be, moving along these lines.  There is obviously no need for me or anybody in this House to talk about the problem of unwanted pregnancies and unmarried mothers.  They are a major burden on the State.  We shall do all we can to help, as we have done in our amendment to the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe, as some do, that <Col N="1970" /> because condoms are freely available it will lead to a more promiscuous society. I have more faith in our younger generation that that.  If the facility is available they will avail of it but I do not accept that because the facility is available our young people will become more promiscuous as a result.</P>
    <P>While I agree that condoms should be more readily available I have a problem with distribution, access and age.  I am not happy about what should be the ideal age limit or how we can control it and I await the Minister's response in relation to that.  My initial reaction when I saw this motion was that we should talk about the age of majority, 18.  That might be an appropriate age but then, young girls get married at 16, so perhaps 18 is too old.  I honestly do not know.</P>
    <P>I must say in my own hospital experience I have seen young girls at Inter Cert level becoming pregnant.  I can think of one occasion quite recently when the Department of Education had to make facilities available where a young girl of 15 was allowed sit her Inter Cert in private because she was about seven months pregnant at the time.  When I see situations like that I wonder if we should reduce the age limit.  I do not know. Whether we like it or not, young people of that age are experimenting with sex but I think that because they are so immature and have no idea of the consequences we should take a specific interest in this matter.  We should set a limit that would be a realistic one, perhaps 16.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has a lot more to say on this issue tonight.  I do not feel I need say any more save to say that as the amendment we put down endorses the commitment of the Government set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and as that amendment is very similar to the motion, I hope all sides of the House will accept the amendment in the spirit in which it has been put down and I hope the House will not divide on this issue.</P>

      <P>I have listened to Senator Norris and <Col N="1971" /> Senator O'Reilly and to my collegues Senator Fallon and Senator Ormonde and I think there is an opportunity in the Seanad for a worthwhile debate on family planning in this country.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Reilly is disappointed that the Government have not already announced the details of the legislation. I will not go into any detail tonight on what is in the Bill because, in accordance with protocol, that will appear in the Bill when it is circulated.  It is hardly necessary to tell the Members of the House that the area that has to be looked at is the availability through the various outlets and also the question of age.  These are issues that have to be addressed and this is what the Government will be doing.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris referred to a recent court case and suggested I should come clean here and say who was responsible for that case.  I want to assure Senator Norris that the case did not originate in my Department.  I do not know who was responsible for it.  I know, as I am sure Senator Norris knows and did not admit it here, that the case was taken by the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  He also laid stress on the fact that our family planning law is sectarian.  I could not agree with him on that.  After all non-medical contraceptives are available.  My colleague, Senator Farrell, has already referred to the fact that 51 licences for 51 million condoms were issued in 1989 and licences for another 40 million in 1990.  I do not think it is true to say that people are being denied them.  There is no sectarian basis in the legislation which, as the Senator knows, was introduced in 1979 and amended by the Fine Gael-Labour Government in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I respect Senator Norris' right to hold an opinion and I do not mind what the opinion is.  I respect his right, as I respect the right of every other citizen in this State to hold their opinion.  I am disappointed when I hear any Senator or any Member of any House of the Oireachtas, come in and address Members who hold an alternate opinion, an opinion shared by many people in the land.  There is a <Col N="1972" /> wide volume of opinion on both sides in this debate.  I am disappointed to hear Senator Norris come in here and refer to people who hold an alternate opinion to his own as backwoodsmen.  That is not the sort of language by which we should address each other.</P>

      <P>I want to put on the record the present position in relation to the sale and availability of non-medical contraceptives.  The sale of contraceptives, including condoms, is governed by the Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979 as amended by the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act, 1985.  Section 4 provides for the control of outlets permitted to sell contraceptives. These outlets are aimed at ensuring that contraceptives are available to those people who require them for family planning purposes.</P>
      <P>Condoms may be sold without a prescription to persons over 18 years by any of the following: certain pharmaceutical chemists or chemists and druggists, chemist shops, registered medical practitioners at the place where they ordinarily carry out their professional duties, employees of health boards acting as such and where the sale is made at a health institution, the service or agents of family planning services licensed by the Minister where the sale is made at the place where the family planning service is being made available and employees of maternity hospitals or hospitals providing services for the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases and the sale is made at that hospital. It is necessary to obtain a prescription or authorisation to obtain all other forms of contraceptives except spermicides, regardless of age.  Persons under 18 years of age require a medical prescription for all contraceptives including condoms and spermicides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1973" /> The Government, following consultation with the social partners, has indicated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that the operation of family planning services will be kept under review.  This review is ongoing and encompasses all areas of family planning including the extent, the adequacy and the delivery of natural family planning programmes which Senator Norris seems to object to.  For reasons of public health protection it is also necessary to have adequate mechanisms in place to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the issue of the Government's programme to prevent the spread of HIV infection amongst young people and the responses that the Government have initiated and propose to take to combat the spread of HIV AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. Indeed, as Senator Ormonde has already stated, when the first Family Planning Act was introduced in this country in 1979 nobody knew anything about AIDS.  Indeed, it was not identified until three or four years later.  I would also agree with Senator O'Reilly that when speaking about AIDS we want a much broader debate that just discussing condoms and AIDS because obviously we must be concerned about AIDS as a public health issue and we must be concerned to combat AIDS and to prevent AIDS.  The answer does not lie in just the use of condoms.  There may be one element that has a role to play in the prevention of AIDS but it is a much wider area than that.</P>
    <P>We have in this country a very comprehensive programme for the prevention, monitoring, diagnosis, treatment and management of AIDS and HIV in line with what is available in other countries, particularly European countries. This strategy consists of: the monitoring of AIDS and the trend in HIV infection; prevention through health education strategies aimed specifically at the young and at at-risk groups; the protection of the blood supply; the provision of services to reduce risk such as outreach and methodone maintenance; research <Col N="1974" /> into aspects of the disease; the care and management of people suffering from AIDS and HIV within an integrated framework of services including community services, primary care services, respite services, hospice services and acute hospital services and, finally, the co-ordination of policy and its implementation at national and local levels.</P>
    <P>Our strategy, as I have said, is in line with the strategies adopted in all advanced countries.  It takes account of and comprehends the recommendations of the major international bodies; and those which relate to improved surveillance of the disease and early intervention which I myself brought to the forefront in Europe during my Presidency of the EC Health Council.</P>
    <P>Prevention of the disease in uninfected people and secondary measures to prevent the infection from spreading from infected people are critical in the Government's strategy.  As a major part of its strategy, they have introduced a series of measures aimed at informing the general public and in particular young people and people in at-risk groups, about AIDS.  A priority of our prevention strategy is to educate young people about the disease and to ensure that no person would leave school without being informed of AIDS and the HIV virus and how it is transmitted. Senator Norris does not seem to be aware that we have such a programme. Our school programme is recognised as being one of the most progressive in Europe.</P>
    <P>It is also part of our strategy to inform health professionals to protect the blood supply and to inform people travelling abroad.  Again, as my colleague, Senator Farrell has already referred to, Ireland after Greece has the second lowest rate per million of AIDS cases in the European Community.  However, we are not complacent.  From 1981 to 1985 all HIV cases reported were people who were homosexual or who had haemophilia and the condition was considered to be a largely imported disease to this country. When sero-prevalence monitoring became possible in 1985 it became apparent however that the HIV virus was <Col N="1975" /> indigenous in the country and that a particular problem existed in relation to the spread of HIV infection in IV drug abusers.</P>
    <P>Since the disease was first identified we have had 190 cases of AIDS reported and 79 people have died.  In addition, over 1,000 people have been established as being HIV positive.</P>
    <P>The percentage of IV drug related cases is now increasing.  In Ireland almost half of the people at present infected with AIDS are drug related.  Almost 60 per cent of the people known to be infected with HIV virus are drug abusers.  This movement of the epidemic towards the drug abuser has led to an increase in the number of heterosexual cases.  In 1987 we had no heterosexual cases in Ireland. At the moment just under 5 per cent of Irish cases are heterosexual.  While condoms do not eliminate the risk, it is recognised that they do provide a degree of protection.  The progression of the disease from high risk groups to the community at large must be a factor in any consideration of the adequacy of the current legislaton which governs their availability.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health monitor the prevalence and incidence of sexually transmissible diseases, in conjunction with the health boards, under the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1987.  This monitoring shows that in recent years there has been an increase in the overall prevalence of STDs and in the incidence of new cases.</P>
    <P>In recent years the Department of Health have been developing a framework for the prevention, treatment and control of STD.  New STD clinics have been opened in Sligo, Limerick and Waterford.  These clinics, in conjunction with those already provided in Dublin, Cork and Galway are an important element in the control and monitoring of STDs and/or AIDS.</P>
    <P>An important recent development in this strategy is the creation of a second consultant post in genito-urinary medicine for the Dublin area, which will be based at the Mater Hospital and which <Col N="1976" /> will provide sessions in other locations on the northside of the city.  The second GUM consultant post will therefore rationalise the consultant GUM services in Dublin and in the process will provide a more even distribution of STD services for the area.  Consistent with the development of the services for the prevention, treatment and control of STDs, which I have mentioned, the role of condoms or prophylactics is obviously an issue which has to be addressed towards protecting the health of the public from diseases and conditions which are spread sexually.</P>
    <P>Condoms have a role to play in strategies to prevent the spread of AIDS and STD.  They do not fully eliminate the risk of infection of the HIV virus or other sexually transmitted diseases.  The most effective way of avoiding transmission of these viruses is to stay with one faithful partner and remain faithful to that partner.</P>
    <P>It is accepted, however, that for sexually active people who are not in a &ldquo;one partner&rdquo; relationship a good quality new condom, correctly used is a defence against infection.  Under our present legislation, the sale of condoms is governed by the Health (Family Planning) Acts and the range of outlets through which these may be sold are specified therein.  I have referred to that earlier.  The Government have examined the situation and have decided to amend the law to make non-medical contraceptives more readily available.  As I said earlier, a Bill will be provided with such amendments.  It will be printed and circulated in due course.</P>

      <P>I was not sure when Senator Farrell was speaking whether he was in favour of the amendment, which speaks about making non-medical contraceptives more readily available.  The thrust of his contribution would indicate otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Reilly.  This should be a non-debate.  In fact, if we observe the standards prevailing in the countries of our European Community partners on these matters we should <Col N="1977" /> forget about it and move on, as Senator O'Reilly has said, to more serious things. It is impossible, listening to some of the contributions in this debate, not to indulge in moments of levity.  Perhaps I might be pardoned one or two of these before moving on to more serious reflections.</P>
    <P>It occurred to me that maybe one way out of the solution is to have Roman Catholic condoms in one machine and State condoms in another, so that you would have a choice, rather like you would have a choice of education.  The State condoms would, of course, be standard issue; the Roman Catholic ones would be, let us say, somewhat pierced and would bear the ancient Latin legend <i>nihil obstat.</i>  I think that would satisfy the requirements of theologians.</P>
    <P>The mind boggles at the number of condoms imported over the last several years.  If you divide 50 million in 1989 and 41 million in 1990 over the numbers of sexually active people and, allowing for the fact that lots of people do not need to use condoms at all having made very precise calculations in what is called a natural way, you are left with an astonishing level of sexual activity involving the use of condoms.  The mind boggles at that.  How does that square with Senator Farrell's view that people are not really interested in that at all?</P>
    <P>It is true that people make money out of the sale of condoms, there is no doubt about that, but that is not the only reason they exist.  If people make money out of making condoms and if this has employment potential, why do we not avail of it?  Why do we have to import 50 million condoms?  Why can we not make condoms at home?  They must &mdash; I am quite serious &mdash; surely afford considerable employment.  We could make condoms with an Irish difference.  We could have quality condoms bearing the &ldquo;Q&rdquo; mark, if they qualify, of course, and we could have a thriving quality export to our European Community partners.  We could have condoms tastefully embossed with shamrocks and so on.  The possibilities are endless for the imaginative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Already my poor words have struck a show of fire from Senator O'Keeffe.  The possibilities are indeed endless.  Maybe that is the way we should approach this subject.  It is difficult to remain serious and solemn about it.</P>
      <P>I had not time today to look up the long debate in 1979 when the present Taoiseach sat in the Chair which the Minister is now occupying, the year of the famous Irish solution to an Irish problem. We discussed all of this matter at length. There is a strong sense of <i>déja vu</i> about all this.  I am not going to go into details at this time.  I remember in the 1979 legislation there was a clear &mdash; to borrow Senator Norris's word &mdash; sectarian difference struck in the approach in the legislation to natural family planning on the one hand and artificial contraception on the other.  That legislation certainly reflected the denominational differences. There is no doubt about that.  I would maintain, of course, that all contraception, all attempts to avoid conception, are artificial.  They are either all artificial or none of them is.  Mankind has always shown considerable ingenuity in seeking various devices in these matters. I will not go into all of that again.</P>
      <P>I notice that the Church spokesmen, including Archbishop Daly and Fr. Fall on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; the other night, are giving an interesting new twist to the old approach.  The old approach was, as Bishop Newman of Limerick quite bluntly said, that Catholics require a supportive State framework for their lives and for their moral standards, that Catholics are entitled to this.  The Catholic Church is no longer saying that.  They are saying the same thing in a more sophisticated way.  What they, are saying is that legislators must respect the moral quality of life, the moral convictions of the electorate, which is influenced by their religious beliefs.  It seems to me that this is simply a euphemistic way of saying the old thing, that they want their views reflected in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other Senators, I doubt very much whether availability is equivalent to <Col N="1979" /> promiscuity.  Fr. Fall spoke of this the other night, that the more contraceptives are available the more young people will be tempted to be promiscuous, the more they will find temptation iresistable.  Is this really so?  Is this not to confuse mechanisms with moral attitudes?  It certainly reflects the very poor view of young people that these clerics take if they imagine they are going to be subverted by more contraceptives or by vending machines and so on.  Senator Farrell has already told us of his high view of these young people, which I share indeed as someone who has had over three decades of contact with university students.  I have a very high regard for their morals.  I do not believe that young men and women are going to freely rush in a Gadarene swine situation to the vending machines. It just is not true.</P>
    <P>If that is so, what are we afraid of? Young people will take these things in their stride, rather like the Gay and Lesbian Society being recognised in UCC despite many misgivings on the part of some of the governors.  I predicted quite accurately &mdash; with due respect to my colleague here &mdash; that heterosexuality is of such perennial attractiveness that no one was going to be seduced into the Gay and Lesbian Society who would not belong there anyway, by sexual orientation.  It is the same thing with the availability of contraceptives.  They are making very heavy weather of all this.</P>
    <P>It is naive to assume that there was a former golden age of chastity, 30 or 40 or 50 years ago, when people did not do these things.  They might not have had the same access which is now being contemplated by Government legislation; but they were not, as Gladstone once said about British Government policy on Ireland, &ldquo;without recourse to the resources of civilisation&rdquo; and there was much ingenuity displayed in avoiding consequences of courting at that time.  Only a celibate, I feel, would go on with this kind of naive nonsense.</P>
    <P>As I said, I do not believe that there is really a distinction between natural contraception and artificial contraception.  Is it not very probable in the years to come <Col N="1980" /> that biological research will whittle down the unsafe period to a very carefully calculable number of days and that outside of that there will be no danger of conception? If that is so, are people who take advantage of that biological knowledge doing something natural or unnatural?</P>
    <P>In today's <i>Irish Times</i> a cleric expressed his anguish about the imminent floodgates being opened and he referred to condoms as &ldquo;these things&rdquo;&mdash; a giveaway phrase.  The distaste inherent in that is very eloquent, the idea that these things should not be, as St. Paul said, &ldquo;so much mentioned among you.&rdquo;  They are disgusting and distasteful and I suspect the real reason the clerics find these disgusting and distasteful is that they connote sex without responsibility, pleasure without burden, and that is some of the fundamental objection to these developments.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, what is ultimately at issue here in the Government's decision in the forthcoming days is whether they are finally going to grow up and say it is their business to legislate, that the Church told them that years ago, the legislators must legislate, and now they are taking the Church at their word.  Are the Government going to say that while it is the business of the Church to tell their flock how to behave according to Catholic moral principles, it is the Government's business to introduce liberal and progressive legislation and moreover, legislation that will in the long run indicate whether we are serious about building pluralism in Ireland?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to the House.  I congratulate the Government on their handling of the economy since 1987 and the great work they have done in clearing up the huge financial mess which the country found themselves in at that time.  Many commentators then felt we would never be able to stabilise our debt and the various other problems which we took on, but over that period the Government have not alone stabilised that debt but have brought inflation rates down to one of the lowest in Europe, have brought our interest rates down considerably, even though they have risen in the past 18 months.  Overall the Government have done a very good job on the economy and the budget is another step in the right direction to try to pull this country around.  We still have a major problem with unemployment.  Every party sees that as the main problem and I believe it is only a continuation of the present policies that will allow us in the long term to overcome that problem.</P>
      <P>I would like to mention one aspect of the budget which was not covered but which I believe is very significant, that is, the urban renewal programme in designated areas.  In 1986 the Urban Renewal Act designated a number of areas in Dublin and throughout the country for special tax incentives.  The areas designated in Dublin were along the north and south Liffey quays, the north inner city, Henrietta Street &mdash; a small Georgian enclave in the north city &mdash; and the Custom House Docks area. The Custom House Docks Development authority was set up to administer the Custom House Docks area and Dublin Corporation were given the responsibility of promoting redevelopment in the other designated areas of the city.  These areas were characterised by under-used and derelict land and run down buildings. They had very little prospect of being developed without the incentives.  For instance, in the 12 years prior to designation there had not been one planning application for development in the designated area of the Liffey quays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A problem that had to be overcome by <Col N="1982" /> the corporation was that only a 50 per cent capital allowance was available to developers in designated areas compared to 100 per cent in the Custom House Docks area and the other areas throughout the country.  However, despite this disadvantage, the city saw the incentives as a great opportunity to review the fortunes of the inner city and embarked on a major campaign to do so.</P>
    <P>As a first step, they advertised nationally and internationally the benefits of the incentives and advertised for sale sites in their ownership that qualified for incentives. The first major site sold for redevelopment early in 1987 was in High Street and the developers were Hill View Securities. That particular site was derelict for many years and used as a surplus car park.  On the site today stands the fine Christchurch Square development, which when completed will be a 80,000 sq.  feet development with a mixture of office and residential units.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the incentives 42 projects have been completed, 17 are in progress and 80 are at a planning stage in the designated areas, including the new areas designated in 1990.  These developments cover approximately a floor area of 3.3 million sq. feet, which represents a capital investment of about £230 million. The following are some of the developments that are taking place in the designated areas: Winetavern Street, Bridge Street Lower, Usher's Quay, Ormond Quay Upper, Arran Quay, Merchant's Quay, Marlborough Street, Sarsfield Quay, St. Michael's Close and High Street.  In addition, the new developments have many fine refurbishment works carried out on buildings under the tax incentive scheme, including the following: Kinley House, Lord Edward Street, Ormond Hotel, Virgin Megastore, 10-12 Ormond Quay Lower, 1-3 Parliament Street, 24 Merchant's Quay and these complement the magnificent renovation works carried out in Dublin Castle and Government Buildings.</P>
    <P>It is evident from these developments and from the high demand for property offered for sale by the corporation that the designated areas in four short years <Col N="1983" /> have been transformed from areas of dereliction and depression to areas where you can now fashionably develop, live, work or carry out your business.  To encourage development in the designated areas, Dublin Corporation set up a development advisory team which consisted of a town planner, property valuer, a road engineer, an architect and a senior administrator.  The team holds consultation on a regular basis with developers, architects, estate agents, property owners and other interested parties and makes planning and architectural advice freely available to those wishing to develop in the inner city.</P>
    <P>It is the city's policy to ensure that the developments are designed and built to the highest standard and the advisory team's consultation with developers and their architects have been instrumental in ensuring this.  The design of some of the fine new developments in the designated areas has evolved after many meetings between the architects and/or advisory team.  The feature of the new buildings is how well they blend in with the old adjacent buildings and, in fact, complement one another.  In addition to holding consultations, the advisory team have been involved in the preparation of feasibility studies for selected sites and corporation ownership and these studies have proved to be a great asset in marketing the sites and making developers aware of the development potential.</P>
    <P>The corporation have long realised that a major contribution to urban renewal in the city can be made by civic improvements and a number of major improvement schemes have been carried out over the past few years, such as the pedestrianisation of Henry Street, Mary Street, Liffey Street on the north side and the Grafton Street area on the south side and the upgrading of connecting thoroughfares. These improvements have been continued from Grafton Street through South Great George's Street.  Within the designated areas civic improvement works have been completed on the Liffey quays in the north inner city area around <Col N="1984" /> Mountjoy Square.  The civic improvement works are a major factor in promoting development as well as bringing major benefits to existing businesses by giving the area a better environment in which to shop, live, work or carry out business.</P>
    <P>The main type of development in the designated areas has been commercial, mainly office, and in this regard the double rent allowance and the rates remission were major factors.  In essence, a firm or individual paying tax at the rate of around 50p in the £ could get a new property rent and rates free for ten years. Concern has been expressed in some quarters that when the ten year period runs out tenants will move elsewhere.  I do not share that concern.  I am confident that the designated areas over the next ten years will become major commercial centres and that businesses starting up now will become well established in the areas and will not wish to move elsewhere in ten years' time.</P>
    <P>The designated areas scheme have been so successful that in May 1990 the Minister for the Environment announced an extension of the areas in Dublin and other parts of the country.  Four new areas have been designated in Dublin &mdash; south inner city, Dorset Street, George's Quay and Smithfield-Capel Street areas. These will provide further scope for the redevelopment of areas and sites that hitherto have been vacant and derelict.</P>
    <P>The city will continue to give every encouragement to commercial developments in the designated areas.  I am pleased to note the changes of emphasis to more residential development in recent schemes under consideration. That is why we welcome the changes in the budget concerning section 27 and the designated areas and also the announcement of refurbishment expenditure in relation to designated areas.  The 1991 budget announced that expenditure incurred in the refurbishment of property for rented accommodation within the designated areas could be set off against rental income from all sources for tax purposes.  In all other areas this type of expenditure can only be set off against <Col N="1985" /> rental income from the refurbishment property in question.  The budget also extends the scheme to the designated areas until 31 May 1993.  It expires in all other areas on 21 March 1992.  These changes should substantially increase the volume of refurbishment work and the creation of residential accommodation within the designated areas.</P>
    <P>This is one of the most significant things that has happened for many years as regards inner city renewal in any budget. There was an over-supply of office accommodation in the inner city and it was very worrying that the trend was almost exclusively towards offices. Because of the changes in the budget we will now see a huge move towards residential accommodation and we will really get what we want &mdash; the so-called living city back to the centre of Dublin. I would like to congratulate the Minister on these changes because in the long term they will probably be the most significant thing to have happened for inner city renewal for many years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Appropriation Act, with its rather wide scope, is an appropriate time very briefly to review the performance of this Government in certain areas, particularly in the spending area.  When I examined the record of this Government and of the last Government I found that in some areas it has shown refreshingly great strength and in others it has obviously great drawbacks.  It is fair and it is not so often that these sounds and noises come from these benches &mdash; to say that in the area of finance, in the area of looking after the country's finances, the Government have been extremely successful.  I do not think that that is something which is disputed very often by many people on the moderate opposition side in this country.  It would be wrong if from these benches, which are after all independent benches, we constantly carped at what the Government have done, especially in the economy area.  Since 1987 and up to recently, when there are obviously grounds for misgivings, the Government's performance in the economic area has been <Col N="1986" /> a highly successful one.  It was noticeable that for that particular policy from 1987-89 the Government, broadly speaking, got the support of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>That seems to have changed now, and has changed for reasons which are particularly relevant to this Bill in that the Government were opposed in their <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, as recently as last week in this House and before that in the other House, because there were real fears that Government spending was now going to get out of control.  There were real fears that the public sector is going to be paid too much, that much of what has been gained since 1987 and 1989 is about to be thrown away because of political cowardice and difficulties which the Government feel they are facing in the economic field.</P>
      <P>It may be that the Government strategy through luck, and only through luck, may succeed.  It may be that because the Gulf War has been so short and because the world recession may be shorter than anticipated a few months ago, the growth figures which the Government have thrown at us will be fulfilled.  I still doubt it, but I think it is possible.  It may well be that this will happen, but that will be a matter of luck.  It should be acknowledged that we are not economically masters of our own destiny and that the growth rate in this country really depends more on external factors than on internal factors.  But, having taken that away, it is only fair to say that Government policies on expenditure and tax have been successful and the Government should be commended for that.  There are dangers which lie ahead in certain areas, but so far the Government should be commended for what they have done in this area.  It was certainly more successful than the last Government was on the economy.  That is as far as I go in commending the last two Governments for their success in the last three or four years.</P>

    <P>As recently as yesterday Deputy Bruton raised a very important issue in the Dáil and was not allowed to discuss it at any length.

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it is appropriate because Government money is spent on Northern Ireland policy.  It you can persuade me that it costs the Government nothing to send Government Ministers to the North and to England to discuss matters I will accept what you are saying; but otherwise, with respect, I suggest that you are absolutely incorrect.</P>
      <P>By the Taoiseach accusing Deputy Bruton yesterday of being disloyal for opposing Government policy, he was stating that he was being disloyal to a party policy.  He was impugning his motives when he is opposing Fianna Fáil Party policy.  That is not disloyalty.  That is a very important and very vital function of democracy.  What Deputy Bruton was saying yesterday was absolutely correct. If the Taoiseach has no interest in devolution, which he has not, he is going to scupper these talks and he will be to blame for this and not the Unionist Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is happening on these talks is quite simple.  The Government here wants to talk about a united Ireland and the Unionists do not want to talk about a united Ireland.  That is the real problem which lies behind all the jargon and mumbo-jumbo with which we are fed from these talks.  The lack of information about what is happening is what is so disturbing.  It is a fair question to ask: what is wrong with devolution?  Surely the <Col N="1988" /> answer to the Northern Ireland problem must be that the people there solve it one way or the other among themselves.  If the Taoiseach does not like devolution and if the Taoiseach simply wants a united Ireland or nothing, he should say so.  He is sending out coded signals to his own troops which means this and he is saying something else in public.  It would be far more honest if he were to say that he only wants to talk to the Unionists about one particular matter.  There is a solution to the problem.  He can quite simply say that we will not enter into those talks until the Unionists and Nationalists in Northern Ireland have come to an agreement.  He can say that and then the talks will go ahead.</P>

      <P>It must be said that concessions have been made on the Unionist side in Northern Ireland.  I heard Deputy Bruton say on the radio today at 1 o'clock that the Unionists have given way on the issue of not speaking until the Anglo-Irish Agreement has been suspended. They have agreed to speak while the Anglo-Irish Agreement and Maryfield are still in place.  It is time this Government made the serious concession of taking a hands-off position and allowing the parties in Northern Ireland to get on with the dialogue.  I am sorry if the Acting <Col N="1990" /> Chairman finds that politically distasteful.</P>
      <P>I would like to say a few words about Government policy on foreign affairs. This also costs the Exchequer money because, if I am not incorrect, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been travelling around India recently.  Presumably I am allowed to comment on that.  The Government policy on foreign affairs in the last two years has been utterly disappointing and in certain areas has been grossly hypocritical.  It is right in the light of the Gulf War to say, first of all, that the Government took a correct pose but it took it late and reluctantly and not virtuously or voluntarily.  It was regrettable that there was no great desire or eagerness or indication from the Government at the beginning of hostilities that they were willing to back the allied forces or that they were willing to take what was perceived as a pro-UN line.  There was a lot of pussy-footing around and a lot of phoney references to peace by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  We had very little option, as it happened, but to back the UN and allied forces and the line taken by the EC.  It was very difficult for the Government, because of the political posture which they had taken on neutrality, to take that line.  I think the Government's attitude to neutrality was exposed by the fact that we were part of the United Nations.  Being part of the United Nations means that we are part of a military pact.  It was regrettable &mdash; I am open to correction on this point but not the other points on which I have already been corrected &mdash; that we should be the only EC country who did not positively contribute towards the UN effort in the Gulf War.  We were the ones dragging our feet.  We were happy to get on board that particular band wagon once the war was over but we dragged our feet while the war was on.  If we were not willing to send troops or military there we could have sent field hospitals or have sent people in a less hostile and less military capacity but we did not do this.  We went along with the allied effort and with the United Nations effort but we did so reluctantly and without any great distinction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1991" /> It would have been consistent and honourable of us to have announced immediately that Shannon could be used by the United Nations forces, whereas we delayed an announcement and equivocated about it.</P>
    <P>Our foreign policy for the last three years has been based not on any particular principles but has stumbled from one particular foreign policy to another, taking a different line in different crises. We should make quite clear the attitude which we as a nation are going to take in future to countries such as Iraq, or to any country run by tyrants or by governments who have absolutely no respect for human rights.</P>
    <P>I was very privileged last year to travel to South Africa where many wrongs have been committed against humanity and where many such violations have been documented.  I would have been delighted to have seen the Government leading the charge as it did in favour of the continued imposition of sanctions against South Africa if it had practised the same scrupulousness about human rights in other countries.  It is not very consistent to surround oneself with a virtuous halo about South Africa when one is simultaneously trading with one of the most wicked regimes in the world.  It was quite obvious to me that our foreign policy was based on pure expediency when I saw that we were happy to oppose the removal of sanctions against South Africa but to continue trading with Iraq. That is an exposure of the sort of double thinking which this Government have been carrying on for many years.  I hope that the contortions in which the Gulf War has left the Government will force us to improve our foreign policy and to have a consistent one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall run through some of the different Votes here in no particular order of importance.  First, I would like to bring to the attention of the House, under Vote 3, the urgent need for facilities for large-scale organic conservation and for conservation tanks for organic material generally.  I do this with one <Col N="1992" /> discovery in mind, although there are many others.  I have in mind the Monks boat which was discovered in Lough Léin in County Westmeath.  This is a discovery of international significance but because we do not have the conservation tanks in the National Museum, in the Office of Public Works or in the Wetland Archaeology Unit of UCD, we have no way of preserving this unique find.  It is equivalent to the Derrynaflan Chalice but it did not make the headlines.  We have the equivalent of four Derrynaflans or similar chalices.  We have one of these unique constructed boats dating back to between the 2nd and 4th centuries.</P>
      <P>The neglect of our heritage has to be deplored.  New conservation tanks were promised.  There was talk of building them in the old military billets at the back of the Department of Agriculture but those plans were shelved.  I would like to ask the Minister for Finance to indicate where they will be built and to promise immediate and urgent construction so that we can preserve some of the most important aspects of our heritage such as this Monks boat which is of international significance.</P>
      <P>Under Vote 6 I must question the present desecration of the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham.  I do not think many Members in either House are aware of what is going on but sections of the interior are being destroyed to make way for the Modern Art Gallery or to afford extra space to the National Gallery for hanging modern Irish art.  This is being done at the direction of the Taoiseach but, given the millions we spent on restoring and refurbishing the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham and the affection in which it is held and its important place in our heritage I would like to know from the Minister why the interior is being torn apart to provide facilities for the National Gallery.  It is not good enough that we would abuse one aspect of our heritage to preserve another.  There must be a better way to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to turn to Vote 7 &mdash; Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Finance.  I would like to raise a matter that I have previously raised on <Col N="1993" /> an Adjournment debate in this House but so far I have had no satisfactory answer regarding the position of Customs and Excise personnel given the imminence of a barrier-free market post 1992.  When will the Minister for Finance consider the thousands of Customs and Excise officers and indicate what future they will have? Will it be redeployment or voluntary redundancy?  Will there be an agreement with the Revenue section to absorb some of these very skilled men and women into that section of the Department of Finance?  They have waited for direction for years. 1992 is now but a year away and so far the Minister has failed to look after a section of his Department which provides an invaluable service. Will they provide some sort of customs service to ensure that drugs or contraband goods of one type or another are not imported into our country?  The length of time these people have been asked to wait without any direction regarding their future is unacceptable. They are a section of the public service that deserve to be treated with more dignity than the Minister is giving them at the moment.</P>
    <P>Customs clearance agents are another group who are going to be badly affected by the Single European Market.  I am giving some examples of the downside of post-1992.  We have a customs clearance agent network along our Border and at our ports.  Automated entry processing is being insisted upon by the Minister for Finance.  This would cost up to £5,000 per clearance agent company and it will add a cost of £4.50 to each customs entry.  If we will have a customs free Europe or a tariff free Europe post-1992, why do we now need to invest in hardware or software for an automated entry processing system and for the direct trader input system?  Will it be obsolete on 1 January 1993?  I would like the Minister to answer these questions.</P>
    <P>Why is it that the software is not yet available for the automated entry processing? It should have been up and running by 1 April 1991 on a pilot study basis, yet the software is not available <Col N="1994" /> because it has not yet been tested.  Confusion abounds among this section which will be adversely affect by our switch to the Single Market post-1992.  They deserve frankness and honesty and the Minister's time and attention.  He has met the Border clearance agents but I do not think they are now any wiser than any agents in our ports.  I want to know how they will be treated post-1992 and why AEP and DTI are now necessary if we will be in a Single Market with no borders and no tariffs post-1992.  It is hard to understand.</P>
    <P>Vote 21 deals with prisons.  We could not discuss the Appropriation Act without mentioning the urgent need for proper juvenile detention facilities.  The scandal of 15 year-old boys and girls being housed with hardened criminals in our main prisons is not acceptable or tolerable any longer.  Could we have an indication of Government policy in this area?</P>
    <P>Vote 23 deals with the Land Registry. The inordinate delays cannot have escaped the notice of any Member of the Oireachtas.  We have been asked in clinics around the country to resolve and speed up matters in the Land Registry. What is the explanation?  Do they need extra staff and resources?  Can the system be speeded up to give some semblance of efficiency, given the important service this section of the public service provides?</P>
    <P>Vote 25 deals with the Office of the Minister for the Environment.  A social housing policy was published recently. When you go through the fine print and the talk you find that the Minister has stated that six extra houses per local housing authority will be built this year.  When you divide the extra money available for new starts by the number of housing authorities it comes out at six extra per housing authority per year.  Those are the figures.  Seventeen new houses were built last year in County Wexford and we have 700 on our housing list which is an appalling neglect of our most important social requirement.</P>
    <P>Vote 26 deals with the Office of the Minister for Education.  Since 1986 plans for the vocational school in Wexford <Col N="1995" /> town have been in the Department.  They are now on the Minister's desk but she continues to ignore the plight of 700 pupils and their staff.  The school would want to be seen to be believed.  Dickensian conditions have been tolerated by all sections for years.  There are not even staff toilets in the school and no proper facilities for educating in the 1990s in this most important sector.  The Minister will not meet the Vocational Education Committee let alone the Oireachtas Members to hear the case.  It is not acceptable in this area.</P>
    <P>Vote 30 deals with the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Marine.  I would like to ask the Minister if any progress has been made in relation to the anomalies in the social welfare and income tax codes for share fishermen.  These arose out of the McLaughlin High Court judgment in 1986 and at the moment share fishermen find in most cases that they are not covered under the social welfare code. With the stormy winters we have been having and the lack of fishing most of them are not eligible for any social welfare benefits, social welfare assistance, medical cards or a decrease in their rent because they have no way of proving their income or their social welfare entitlements. The Minister promised to meet Frank Doyle of the IFO months ago to resolve the ongoing difficulties for this most important constituency.</P>
    <P>Over 2,000 fishermen, women and their families around our coastline have been affected by the McLaughlin judgment.  When will the Minister either seek a judicial review or go back to the Attorney General for a further interpretation of the 1986 judgment so that these people can have their basic entitlements under the social welfare code honoured? The confusion is not the result of the fishermen's activities or their skippers but extends from that McLaughlin judgment.  The salmon review group reported many years ago.  We continue to neglect the potential of inland fisheries.  It is an important environmental and tourism resource.  Are we going to implement <Col N="1996" /> the recommendations of the salmon review group or is the Government going to continue to ignore them?  What is the Government's policy in this area?</P>
    <P>Vote 32 deals with the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  The Minister has managed to stand over the decimation of the economic unit and the research section of Teagasc.  These are two essential areas for the future development of agriculture and for Irish farming and land use generally, given the environmental importance of making the right decisions in relation to farming and in relation to the use of fertilisers, pesticides and the need to be vigilant in regard to our water courses.  I am not going to go into the CAP and GATT areas.  We would need more than the short time allocated to us tonight to do justice to that problem.  The future of farming depends on the interpretations of the economic unit and on research from the research unit of Teagasc.  What are we going to do to rectify the decimation of these units?</P>
    <P>Vote 40 refers to overseas development aid.  We are still not making any attempt to live up to our UN obligations in this area.  I do not have to paint the picture of the problems in Sudan and Ethiopia.  Somehow the Gulf War pushed the story of the starving millions off the front pages and out of the media.  We cannot renege on our obligations in this area and it is up to the Minister to recognise that the people of Ireland have given him the mandate to do so.  They have done that through their own voluntary generosity to the non-governmental organisations.  The Minister continues to ignore the strong message and wishes of our people in this area.</P>
    <P>Vote 42 refers to the Department of Health.  It is now many years since a case was made for the provision of a full paediatric service at Wexford General Hospital.  I now quote from the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i> of December 1990:</P>
    <P>In a ten year review from 1980-89 of Wexford perinatal statistics particular emphasis was placed on neonatal deaths and transfer rates of normally <Col N="1997" /> formed infants.</P>
    <P>It has been shown that sick infants treated in units without paediatric skills have a threefold increase in their odds of dying and survivors could be expected to have a higher incidence of handicap compared to those treated in properly staffed units.  Wexford General Hospital is a medium-sized maternity hospital without onsite paediatrician.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable in the 1990s that a general hospital with a catchment area of over 100,000 as in Wexford's case, especially one with a busy maternity unit, be deprived of experts and support staff to care for sick children.</P>
    <P>The appointment of one paediatrician &mdash; and a post was advertised last week &mdash; would inevitably result in even more transfers when he or she is off duty or on holiday and is, therefore, unacceptable. Those are the views of the IMJ and of doctors who have researched this matter. At least two must be appointed to provide a continuous service.  That is the view of the Wexford paediatric action group.  It is the view of us across political boundaries who support the provision of a full paediatric service with the necessary nursing and medical back-up staff, accommodation and equipment.  One paediatrician would increase transfers to either Ardkeen or Dublin and would increase perinatal mortality over what it would be if the service was available where the maternity unit is situated, i.e., in Wexford General Hospital.</P>
    <P>In Cavan-Monaghan, which has one-third the birth rate of Wexford General Hospital, there are two paediatricians and the necessary staff.  Which Minister comes from Cavan-Monaghan?  Need I say any more?  The Minister for Health has also refused to meet the Wexford paediatric action group or to meet Wexford Oireachtas Members who can explain the situation.  He has agreed to one paediatrician but he cut back the South-Eastern Health Board's budget by £1.8 million.  Three into two does not go and we all recognise that.  I would urge the Minister to meet the action group and <Col N="1998" /> Oireachtas Members and to go that one extra step of providing two consultants. He has approved of one consultant.  The salary of one extra consultant would be a very small cost in terms of the overall cost of a full paediatric service at Wexford General Hospital.  I would plead with the Minister for the sake of the neonates and the young children in our 100,000 population catchment area to go that extra step of the road and to establish a full paediatric service with two consultants at Wexford General Hospital.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to deal with the increase in insurance premiums.  I would like to know if any report has come from the task force which was made up of officials from the Department of the Environment, the Department of Finance and the Department of Industry and Commerce in relation to insurance premiums? There is legislation promised in this area.  It is a very difficult area, particularly for young drivers who must drive to get to and from work, or to obtain work.</P>
    <P>I understand that time is against me and I respect your ruling, Sir.  I would like to put on the record that Fine Gael did not agree to a 15 minute restriction on contributions in relation to as important an issue as the Appropriation Act. Broad legislation like this, where one can address a wide range of financial and economic matters, should not be time restricted.  If necessary we can sit on Wednesday mornings and on Fridays to allow longer contributions because many areas have only been skimmed over because of time restrictions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the Appropriation Act has provided this House with an opportunity to present its views on overall economic performance and future prospects, particularly in regard to expenditure. Senators have once again taken full advantage of the wide scope of the debate to deliver constructive criticism of Government policy and to highlight areas where achievements are being made.</P>
      <P>Much has happened since this debate was adjourned for the Christmas recess and in the short period given to me to wind up the debate I would like to update the House very briefly on these developments, as well as replying to some of the major points made during the course of the discussions.</P>
      <P>On the economic front, 1990 was a good year for the economy which grew by about 5 per cent, repeating the performance of 1989.  We have had two years of strong growth back to back, for the first time in many years.  This shows what sensible national consensus combined with prudent fiscal management and declining budget deficits can achieve. Exchequer borrowing at £462 million, or 2 per cent of GNP, was closely in line with the budget estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a good year on the prices front also.  By November the CPI had fallen to only 2.7 per cent, one of the lowest rates in the EC and well below that of the United Kingdom, our largest export destination. Consumer spending grew steadily last year and investment continued to forge ahead, helped in the construction sector by an enlarged contribution from the Structural Funds.  Above all, employment, the ultimate test of the strength of the economy, and the ultimate vindication of economic policy, decisions and actions grew strongly.  Government <Col N="2000" /> borrowing is now at its lowest level in over 40 years and the debt-GNP ratio is on a firm downward path.  At the end of 1990 it stood at just over 111 per cent of GNP as compared to its peak level of 131 per cent of GNP in 1987.</P>
    <P>Since I last addressed the House on the 1990 Appropriation Act, the 1991 Budget has been introduced.  The objectives which underlie this year's budget are to ensure continued economic growth, to achieve a further enduring increase in employment, to improve living standards generally, to care for the weakest in our society.  We want to consolidate the progress made over the past few years in restoring economic stability and order to the public finances.  The budget will give us non-inflationary economic growth of 2.25 per cent this year, which is as good as the EC average.  It will maintain a healthy balance of payments situation.</P>
    <P>The process of tax reform is also continuing. Income tax rates have been reduced again, the standard rate to 29 per cent and the top rate to 52 per cent, and progress is being maintained in the restructuring of the VAT regime to prepare for 1992.</P>
    <P>We have again made it a priority to ensure that the disadvantaged in our society will benefit from the economic progress we are achieving.  The policy remains to give most to those who need most.  Weekly welfare payments will increase generally by 4 per cent from July and there will be special increases of up to 11 per cent for those on lower payments. The low paid will benefit from increases in income tax exemption limits, the particular focus in the budget on bigger families and the improved family income supplement schemes.</P>
    <P>Since the Christmas adjournment there has been a successful outcome to the negotiations with the social partners on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  The new programme provides us with the planning framework we need for stability and progress over the medium to long term.  It represents the first instalment of a ten year national enterprise.  What it means is that the Government have entered into a charter <Col N="2001" /> with the social partners to achieve agreed objectives.  We have a shared plan which can produce benefits for all.</P>
    <P>Central to this renewed consensus is the new pay agreement between the social partners and the Government.  This agreement should continue the good work of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  It holds out the prospect of three more years of industrial peace.  It provides for pay increases which, so long as we match international productivity performance, are affordable in competitive terms as well as being reasonable for both employees and employers.</P>
    <P>Equally important, the programme is fair to the unemployed in the sense that it is aimed at, and should produce, enhanced prospects for job creation.  The programme clearly reaffirms our commitment in relation to the public finances while indicating the key priorities for action.</P>
    <P>Turning to the prospects for 1991, most of the favourable factors which have helped our economy over recent years are still in place.  The exception is the international economy which is experiencing a slowdown, with the US and UK showing signs of recession.  Prospects for growth in other areas appear to be holding up reasonably well.  However, with a 2 per cent rise forecast for the OECD as a whole, a marginally better growth rate is in prospect for the European Community. The Gulf crisis poses obvious difficulties for forecasting but I remain confident we can match the likely EC growth rate.  Inflation should be even lower on average than last year at about 3 per cent.  We are adopting responsible fiscal monetary and income policies. These are our best insurance against the present international uncertainties.  As the Minister for Finance indicated in his budget speech, a more difficult world environment requires us to be more not less resolute in our adherence to the prudent stance which has been our hallmark in recent years.</P>
    <P>I would like to respond to some of the points raised by Senators at various stages <Col N="2002" /> in the debate.  In the debate before Christmas, Senator Upton spoke rather gloomily about the prospects of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare being implemented.  Since then a number of important developments have taken place.  The first of these occurred in January when the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was negotiated by the social partners.  This programme commits the Government to ongoing reform of the social welfare system broadly within the framework outlined by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Specifically, and most importantly, the programme commits the Government to move by 1993 to the priority level of rates recommended by the Commission and thereafter to increase social welfare rates further and progressively in accordance with the recommendations of the commission as the resources of the economy grow. These commitments represent a major initiative and underline in the clearest possible manner that the care and protection of those dependent on social welfare remain a top priority of Government policy.</P>
    <P>This year's budget represented the first phase in the implementation of the new programme's social welfare objectives. It contained a package of improvements which will bring gross expenditure on social welfare to over £3 billion a year. As I have already mentioned, weekly payments will be increased in general by 4 per cent from July and there will be a special increase of up to 11 per cent for those on the lowest payments.  Significant improvements in child income support for those on social welfare and those at work on low pay were also announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole was disappointed to find no provision in the Estimates for the cost of implementing the report of the Review Body on Primary Education. Since the first part of the debate on 20 December he will have been gratified by the many developments in this connection which have been initiated under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  A substantial improvement will <Col N="2003" /> be effected in the pupil-teacher ratio. Generous provision is being made for the hiring of caretakers and clerical assistants and the free books scheme is being improved.  He will welcome these and other developments which move further in the direction which the review body has recommended.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton raised, among other things, the question of access to third level education.  The Government share his anxiety and that is why the programme emphasises the need for further measures in favour of the disadvantaged. Special provision is being made for mature and second chance students and moves are being initiated to encourage young people from a disadvantaged background to stay on at school and improve their chances of going to third level education.</P>
    <P>Senator Avril Doyle asked a question in connection with educational development, particularly in her constituency. The Senator will understand that there will always be some areas where, for the time being, resources are not available.  I do not have the details with regard to the specific project but she will know that we have, proportionately speaking, more people in primary, second level and third level combined than any country in the western world.  We have one million young people at school, representing almost 30 per cent of our population.  The total amount this year for education is £1,450 million.  It is the highest ever and in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> some major advances are proposed not least in the pupil-teacher ratio but also in a range of recommendations from the primary review board and other sectors.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat unfair of the Senator in the context of choosing a particular school &mdash; I do not know the detail &mdash; that may not be listed as one for which there is adequate finance at the moment.  I will certainly have a look to see where it lies in a priority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The health services came in for much critical comment particularly the issue of waiting lists.  Waiting lists are a feature of all health systems throughout the world.  To some extent, they are a symptom of success as medical technology allows for the treatment of previously incurable conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the areas referred to was orthopaedic surgery.  We would certainly like to be able to deal almost on demand with elderly people who suffer from authorities and are in so much pain.  In the course of the last year the number of operations for orthopaedic patients was 300 more than the previous year.  We are not saying that is adequate but, as you know, orthopaedic services have developed in a way which was unimaginable ten years ago. Younger patients are being treated now and the range of services has been extended.  We will concentrate as many resources as possible in all these areas. The waiting list for most specialities is not excessive but it is accepted that there are some areas which need to be addressed, particularly orthopaedic and ear, nose and throat procedures.  Steady progress had been made over the past two years in significantly reducing long waiting lists.  The number of hip replacements performed nationally increased from 1,624 in 1987 to 1,904 in 1989. Similarly, the ENT waiting list at Temple Street hospital fell from 1,228 on 1 November, 1989 to 550 on the same date in 1990.  These are specific tangible results which have been achieved as a result of initiatives taken in 1989 and contained <Col N="2006" /> throughout 1990.  They are part of a continuing drive to reduce waiting lists.  The Minister for Health proposes to continue to build on this progress.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach to the care of the mentally handicapped is concentrating on moving mentally handicapped persons from an institutional setting to an environment which is more suited to their needs.  However, the need for residential care facilities is recognised. The provision in the 1990 budget of an additional £2 million for the mentally handicapped allowed, among other things, for the opening of a number of additional residential places at Cheeverstown House.  The Government have provided a level of funding for mentally handicapped services which has ensured that this sector is fully protected.  This is reflected by the 40 per cent increase since 1987 in allocations for voluntary agencies dealing with mental handicap.  The 1991 provision continues this policy of protection for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>It is part of the Department of Health's policy that preventive medicine be promoted and developed.  In 1990 an estimated £8.480 million was spent on the prevention of infectious diseases, including vaccination programmes for measles, mumps, rubella and hepatitis B.  A further £1.08 million was spent on health promotion at both national and local level.  Of particular importance in this field is the development, in conjunction with the Department of Education, of an AIDS education pack.  A national policy on alcohol is also being developed under the aegis of the National Health Council. A further £14.515 million was spent in 1990 in respect of other preventative health services including child health examinations, food hygiene and standards and the drugs advisory services.</P>
    <P>For the total health estimates this year the Government will provide in excess of £1,550 million &mdash; over £100 million greater that that provided last year and the largest amount ever spent on the health services in the history of the State. Yet in spite of that increase, we have claims being made of cutbacks.  Senator Doyle referred to a cutback of £1.8 million for the South-Eastern Health Board.  An increase has been given to <Col N="2007" /> that health board.  The fact that the increase has not met the estimate sought, which is what the Senator is referring to, not a cutback, by the South-Eastern Health Board is not the true position. The Minister for Health has made further changes which, in the light of experience this year, will help to ease any problems that are facing health boards generally.</P>
    <P>As far as the paediatric services for Wexford are concerned, it is a detailed matter and I will communicate the information to the Deputy.  A fairly substantial amount of money is being spent on Wexford hospital.  We are glad that the South-Eastern Health Board have given priority to the developments in that hospital.  I have had some experience of the services there.  I am sure the Senator will agree that it is an excellent hospital.</P>

      <P>Time does not permit me to go into the details but the Senator knows what they are.  Many Senators raised the question of social housing.  We have now, with the support of the parties to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, decided to introduce a range of new measures to diversify the traditional approach to housing needs. The new strategy will embrace all sectors of the housing market, public, private, rented, owner-occupied and voluntary housing.  While local authority house building and rental programmes will continue to be an important element of housing policy, there will be a new focus on community based and self-help housing initiatives backed by new Government funded schemes.  Tenants in the private rented sector will have new safeguards and residents in local authority estates can look forward to continuing improvements in their housing conditions and have a greater say in how their estates are run.</P>
      <P>I refer to Senator Doyle's remark that there will be only six additional local authority houses provided this year.  The figure for last year was something like 1,500 houses completed in the country. There is a similar figure this year as well as the new provisions in voluntary housing. Each year something like 3,500 to 4,000 houses become available in the normal way to the local authority.</P>

      <P>Senators McDonald and Upton both painted a bleak picture for the agricultural sector.  It must be acknowledged that 1990 was a difficult year for farmers.  The outlook for the current year is also uncertain.  The outcome of the GATT negotiations and the Commission proposals for CAP reform will be awaited with concern.  I assure Senators that my colleague, the Minister <Col N="2009" /> for Agriculture and Food, will vigorously defend the interests of the Irish farm sector.  The need to maintain a viable farming sector must be accepted by the Community.  I would not, therefore, be as pessimistic as the two Senators about the future prospects for Irish agriculture.</P>
      <P>The position on the extension of the disadvantaged areas is that the case put to the EC Commission by the Minister for Agriculture and Food is being actively pursued and the necessary Commission proposals are expected shortly. However, as announced in the budget in order to support farm incomes it has been decided to bring forward to this year the increases in headage rates scheduled for 1992.  This decision taken with the expected increase in the disadvantaged areas will be worth an extra £19 million to farmers this year and £27.5 million next year.</P>
      <P>There are one or two other specific areas which I will touch on.  I thank Senator Ryan for his compliments in relation to decisions taken by the Government over the last four or five years in terms of inner city renewal.  He is obviously very familiar with and understands how necessary these developments are.  I thank Senator Ross &mdash; I seldom have the opportunity of doing so &mdash; for complimenting the Government on their success on the economic policy front.  He was good enough to compare this Government's performance since 1987 with any previous administration's and to say that we come out tops.  He fears public expenditure will get out of control.  I would like to allay his fears on that front.  He referred to the Government's foreign policy.  This is not an occasion on which to debate these matters. He had quite a simplistic view of the developments that are taking place not only in the context of Northern Ireland but also in the Gulf.  He will be and should be aware that this Government are giving painstaking attention to the Northern problem.  We have nothing to apologise for in terms of our efforts or our stance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As regards the protection of our heritage and the enhancement of our architectural and archaeological landscape and peatlands, I must say that as far as this Government and their immediate predecessor are concerned the investment in renewal and development of many of our old architectural buildings, the involvement of young people, and the support for voluntary groups has been without parallel.  We could come on certain matters that have not yet been resolved.  In relation to the queries raised by Senator Doyle, I will have them examined.</P>

As these matters affect personnel they will be dealt with through the normal channels.  There is no point in suggesting that the Government should solve problems which have not yet arisen.  I assure the Senator that these matters are being examined and that the Government are concerned to find suitable alternatives and employment for the staff involved.  These matters will be the subject of negotiation between the interested parties, their unions and representatives.  The whole thrust of policy in terms of the national programme has been to reach a consensus. We will treat matters in that area as well as we can.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2011" /> Juvenile detention has been mentioned. We are conscious that we do not have all the answers.  Great efforts have been made in recent years to find additional space and provide community work but when it comes to very young offenders and admission to psychiatric hospitals, etc. there are accommodation problems.  They do not necessarily involve new structures in the sense of the State being totally committed all the time to finding solutions.  This is part and parcel of where society is going.  We have to try to work together, bring in voluntary organisations and liaise with and support the family in such cases.  It is not all about structures and new buildings.  I am very conscious of the number of those cases that have arisen in recent months.  We must see to what extent the Departments of Education, Social Welfare and Justice can help to find solutions.</P>
    <P>I have tried to cover the points raised. I hope I have allayed the general concerns expressed on these topics by Members of the House and that I have demonstrated that many of the specific concerns have been addressed by the Government in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Senator Honan who is equally concerned about this issue.  I will be happy to give her at least five minutes of my time or perhaps longer.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming in to respond to this matter this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overcrowding in the General Hospital at Ennis is simply another crisis in an ongoing series of crises at the hospital since the acute bed complement was reduced from 130 approximately to 78 two years ago.  Ennis General Hospital serves County Clare which has a population of over 93,000.  The present number of beds are totally inadequate for <Col N="2013" /> the needs of the county.  During November and December, overcrowding at the hospital occurred on 24 nights.  From Christmas through to mid-February over-crowding was regularly of the order of 20 people per night.</P>
    <P>Monday, 11 February, was a typical day at the hospital.  On that day I visited the hospital at the request of a distraught parent whose child was on a trolley in the casualty unit.  In a hospital that is staffed to accommodate 78 beds, the casualty emergency unit was full, the two beds were occupied, the five trolleys were occupied and a child who came in as an emergency was being treated on a table. No further beds or trolleys were available that day in the casualty unit.</P>
    <P>On that day also, the day unit had 17 patients, male and female.  They shared that day unit which has accommodation for six patients.  Therefore, there was virtually three times the capacity of the unit there that day.  The intensive care unit was full and the three available wards were full.  The fourth ward with 26 beds was closed.  It has been closed for over two years.  Elective surgery has been cancelled since early February.  The waiting list before then for elective surgery was four to six weeks delay.  I do not know how long it is as a result of that cancellation but I am sure the Minister has that information on his file.</P>
    <P>Since November 1990 the Ennis General Hospital has been functioning as a 100-bed hospital.  Enormous problems are being created for the nursing, medical and other staff there.  I want to put on record that these staffs are performing a duty far beyond the ordinary call of duty. That relates to doctors, nurses and the general staff there.  I believe the situation there is an abuse of their dedication and integrity and we are putting demands on them that are quite unreasonable.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, the situation there does not allow the patients the dignity they deserve.  Males and females share the same wards, the same toilets and the same washrooms and this deprives them of the privacy and dignity that is their right.  A system that enforces such conditions on the sick, the old and the people who suffer great pain is a disgrace in a <Col N="2014" /> civilised society.  Unfortunately, the Minister presides over this system.</P>
    <P>We have overworked nurses and staff who are hassled and harassed by concerned relations of patients because there is no one else there on whom they can vent their outrage.  Sick people are being put into a day unit that is equipped and staffed to accommodate but one-third of their number on many days.  Tonight &mdash; I have checked out the situation &mdash; there is one male accommodated in the middle of the female ward and there are three male patients accommodated in a room off a full female ward and they have to share the toilets and washrooms.  As long as there are only three wards operating in the general hospital men and women will have to be accommodated in the same ward.  The opening of the fourth ward is absolutely essential there because by having the fourth ward you would have two medical wards and two surgical wards.  Therefore, it would be possible to accommodate men and women in separate wards.</P>
    <P>During the crisis of February 1990, the Minister promised that a geriatrician would be appointed for the Clare area with ten additional beds at the Ennis General Hospital and the opening of Unit 7 in St. Joseph's Hospital on a permanent basis.  One year later, on 22 February 1991, I understand the post was finally sanctioned.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the 1991 financial allocation to the health board does not include funding for the appointment of the geriatrician and the back-up staff required there.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister responded to the situation at the Ennis General Hospital in reply to a question in the other House on 12 February.  In relation to the mixing of male and female patients, he said that from time to time with the extra demand for beds, male and female patients may have to be accommodated in the same area, but that every consideration is being given to provide them with privacy.  That is simply not true and I do not wish to be told the same story again tonight.  As I have outlined, there is not privacy.  The dignity and privacy of patients is being continually infringed upon by this situation there.  It is an <Col N="2015" /> unreal, unnatural and unacceptable situation. At the end of the day, the Minister has responsibility in the matter and I look forward with interest to his reply.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that the number and type of beds to be provided at the Ennis County Hospital are matters for the Mid-Western Health Board.  That is irresponsible of the Minister, I might even go as far as to say it is cowardly of him because by putting across that message he is simply sheltering behind the health board.  At the end of the day responsibility for an adequate health service in this country rests with the Minister alone.  The buck stops with him and the provision of a hospital service in Clare has to be his responsibility alone.  I cannot accept that the Minister can just stand back and pass the buck, as it were, to the health board when this indignity, pain and hardship are being inflicted on patients who attend the Ennis General Hospital.  If the health board in general are found to be incapable or incompetent in providing an adequate hospital service in this country the responsibility comes straight back to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce said earlier tonight that something like £1,550 million would be spent on the health services this year.  How long more does the Minister intend throwing money at a system that cannot deliver?  Why do private hospitals, and indeed private health care, appear to be growing more prosperous while public hospitals and public health care appear to be at the point of disintegration?</P>
    <P>There is a further reason the Minister cannot dodge responsibility in relation to the Ennis General Hospital.  Through his party written guarantees were published in the local paper.  They were in documents handed in to every house in County Clare during the 1987 general election, guaranteeing a 100 bed complement for the Ennis General Hospital.  The Minister went further.  His party ran a Fianna Fáil hospital candidate based on that pledge.</P>

The question is, will the Minister deliver on his pledge to the people of Clare to provide a 100 acute bed hospital in Ennis? Will he ensure that the patients who attend the general hospital have adequate facilities available to them?  Will he ensure that the excellent staff who work there are enabled to discharge their duty to their patients in suitable and satisfactory conditions?  Will he direct that the closed ward in the Ennis General Hospital is opened or will he, on the other hand, and I hope not, again seek the cover of telling me that the responsibility is not his but that of the Mid-Western Health Board?  At the end of the day, the responsibility for an adequate health service in this country rests with the Minister and with him alone.  I await his reply with interest.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Senator Howard for giving me a few minutes of his time.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay a tribute to the staff of the Ennis General Hospital for their extraordinary dedication and commitment at this time, and indeed always. I regret the maternity unit was moved out of Clare General Hospital.  When people in recent times &mdash; I am not referring to Senator Howard &mdash; decide to play politics with a hospital it is very dangerous.</P>
      <P>A meeting took place recently between all parties on the panel and all the nurses of the hospitals.  It was the most responsible meeting that I have attended.  The attitude of the nurses in the general hospital and in St. Joseph's Hospital was extraordinary.  No politics were involved. I would like to put that on the record of the House.  In fairness to Senator Howard and other people there are sensible people serving in public life and one does not play politics with health.</P>
      <P>When one talks about £1,550 million in respect of health that is taxpayers' money a colossal amount of money.  I agree with Senator Howard.  Perhaps the Minister will have to consider this.  That is the kind of money the Government are allocating to health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2017" /> We have a problem and the geriatrician has been appointed.  I accept that the delay with the Comhairle should not have happened when the Minister had cleared the geriatrician for us but he is now in place.  Let us take a look at what that means.  Nobody recognises this better than the staff in the general hospital. With a geriatrician who may be in place immediately or in a very short time on a temporary capacity, comes the ten beds we all want and the ten to 12 extra nurses. The Minister has given that commitment. I believe him when he says something. Senator Howard has acknowledged that the geriatrician is in place now,.</P>
    <P>The public have a tendency to go on a rampage in response to the downgrading of a hospital.  I had my two children in that hospital 34 and 32 years ago.  We have now lost that maternity service.  I was worried when this matter was being hyped up politically one and a half years ago.  Senator Howard will know the time I am talking about.  I am a long time serving in public and a long time associated with health boards.  I met a certain person in the car park one day who said to me that if somebody belonging to him was ill in the morning he would not let that person into the general hospital. That was the day I worried about the general hospital.  Certain people were creating that atmosphere at the time and they were not politicians.  There may have been some but they were not the politicians present here.</P>
    <P>For years temporary nurses have been working in our hospitals and they cannot be appointed.  Nurses who go on maternity breaks, career breaks and job-sharing breaks are not being replaced. Ennis General Hospital is short of four permanent nurses at the moment.  I would like the Minister to take a look at why we have nurses in temporary positions for eight to ten years, some with unbroken service.</P>
    <P>I hope the hassle of the general hospital is behind us.  I agree with a lot of Senator Howard's sentiments which relate down onto the corridors of these hospitals. Senator Howard stated that the money has not been put in place for what has been cleared by the Comhairle.  I ask the Minister to see that that is corrected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2018" /> I would like to pay tribute to the extraordinary dedication of the staff of the general hospital.  We are talking about a service for 91,000 people.  While I am alive, no Minister will downgrade or close the general hospital in Ennis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to come into the Seanad and speak about the situation in Ennis hospital.  First, I would like to refer to the point made by Senator Honan about the sheer size of the allocation for the health services in the current year, almost £1,550 million, the largest sum ever provided by an Irish Government.  I agree with Senator Howard that it is very important that we get value for money. The Senator will be aware that the Government have laid great emphasis on value for money over the last number of years.  We are eliminating any waste that might have been there.  The health boards have made a major effort over the last number of years to come to grips with the fact, which is a fact in every developed country in the world, that there is not sufficient money to meet demands.</P>
      <P>When I came into Government in 1987, 18.7 per cent of what the Government were spending was on health.  This year it is 22 per cent.  That is an indication of the Government's commitment to ensure that we maintain a very high standard of health.  It is disappointing to hear Senator Howard undermine his own hospital in Ennis.  I agree with him and with Senator Honan about the great staff in Ennis hospital.  That can be applied to our health care staff generally in Ireland. We are particularly fortunate in the quality of our nurses, doctors, para-medical, catering, administrative and all the staff that go to ensure that a hospital functions effectively.  We can be very proud of that in Ireland.  Ennis is no exception.  I have been down there and have seen it for myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level and scale of services to be provided at Ennis hospital are matters, in the first instance, for the Mid-Western Health Board.  The Health Act 1970, spells that out quite clearly.  As regards responsibility, Senator Howard had a lot to say about my shirking responsibility and being cowardly.  I am delighted to <Col N="2019" /> say &mdash; I will be Minister for Health for four years this week &mdash; that there is not one day that I walked away from my responsibilities in any way.  If I had to take unpopular decisions in the interests of the nation I did.  My predecessors did not.  As a member of a party that was in Government before us Senator Howard should not talk too much about responsibility in the health services.  The first problem that plagued me was an overrun of £55 million that was incurred by that Government.</P>

      <P>In March 1988, the Mid-Western Health Board adopted the policy that Limerick would be the regional hospital for the area with St. John's hospitals at Ennis and Nenagh, providing complementary and supplementary roles in continuing to provide acute hospital services for the region.  That is what we are committed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board considered in detail the question of hospital services and decided that Ennis General Hospital should continue to provide acute medical services for its present catchment population.  In determining that level of service the board took into account the population of the area, its characteristics, the number of patients who travel outside the area for hospital services and the <Col N="2020" /> relationship which exists between Ennis General Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital.  Following assessment of all the relevant factors the board decided that the appropriate number of beds for Ennis hospital was 84.  These beds are divided as follows: general medical 40, general surgical, 32; intensive care 60 and day beds 60, a total of 84, not 78 as Senator Howard says.  He also referred to the fact that the night of 1 February was a typical night.  It was not a typical night.  The first time there were 100 patients in the hospital during this year was 11 February.</P>
    <P>A total of 3,957 in-patients were treated in 1990 and 17,383 were treated in the casualty department, an increase of 9.6 per cent on the previous year.  In addition, there were 13,414 out-patient attendances and 1,359 day patients treated last year.  They got good treatment in Ennis hospital and it is a tribute to the staff.  It does not become anybody to come in here and tell this House that it is only private patients who get service in this country.  That is not fair to either the staff or the patients of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Private hospitals are thriving as a result of this.</P>

      <P>At present there are seven consultants employed in the hospital. These include two physicians, two surgeons, two anaethetists and one radiologist. There are also 12 non-consultant hospital doctors working with the consultants. Over the last five years, £1 million has been spent on a range of important improvements to the facilities at Ennis General Hospital.  These schemes include a new X-ray department; operating theatre refurbishment and the new equipment for the intensive care unit.  The male surgical ward was operated at a cost of approximately £70,000 in 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Howard raised the issue of over-crowding in Ennis General Hospital. I understand from the board that there has been a degree of over-crowding at Ennis General Hospital in recent weeks.  The Mid-Western Health Board have taken a number of measures in order to cope with the increased demands being made on the hospital.  Non-urgent <Col N="2021" /> planned admissions have been postponed and I understand that additional beds have been opened and extra nursing staff have been employed.  Furthermore, some patients, where appropriate, have been transferred to the Limerick Regional Hospital and St. John's Hospital.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the health board have responded effectively to this temporary increase in demand and that patients are receiving the necessary care and treatment they require.  I do not think it should be necessary to point out in this country or, indeed, in any other country, that changes in the level of demand at different times of the year are a feature of all acute hospital systems.  This country is no exception.  There is no way you can predict the number of patients who will turn up for admission to hospital today, tomorrow or the next day.  Hospitals must be flexible and respond.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard referred to value for money.  I would expect him to be the very first Senator to come in here talking about value for money and criticising any Minister for Health who would have 20 beds opened, fully staffed and allow nobody into them on the off chance that there might be an emergency.  That is not how a hospital system works.  We have to ensure that we get the best value for money.</P>
    <P>Certain periods during the winter months tend to be busy periods for the acute hospitals, just as summer months tend to be relatively quiet.  The patients being admitted to Ennis General Hospital are mainly elderly.  The trend is in line with other areas in the country, because elderly people account for a very large proportion of admissions to acute hospitals.  This is particularly true during the winter months.  The characteristic of elderly admissions to acute hospitals is that they often have a longer length of stay than the average patient.  In this context, the Mid-Western Health Board have indicated that the length of stay in Ennis hospital for medical patients was ten days in January 1991.  This was longer than the average length of stay in other hospitals in the region during the same period.  That is an issue.</P>
    <P>I have already outlined the measures taken by the Mid-Western Health Board <Col N="2022" /> to deal with the recent problem of over-crowding at Ennis General Hospital.  As part of a longer term strategy the board are focusing attention on improved discharge planning and the development of a specialised geriatric service.  Planning for the discharge of patients from hospital is of crucial importance in the case of elderly patients.  For example, the home circumstances may not allow an elderly patient to be discharged quickly so that some intermediate step-down facility may be required.</P>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board are, therefore, taking action to ensure that there is effective liaison and co-ordination between the acute hospital services, their long stay services and their community care services, so that patients do not remain inappropriately in the acute hospital setting.  Of course, I accept that there are problems in the service and problems that have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan referred to the fact that there are a number of temporary nurses. It is important to point out that over the last two years we increased the number of staff working in our public health services by 2,500.  We have 59,000 people working in the services at present.  The point that Senator Honan raised will be looked at and investigated immediately, the question what might be done about the number of temporary nurses.  It is a matter between the unions representing the nurses and the health board, but in the past posts have been filled by open competition.  We will look into the question raised by Senator Honan.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Defence, has pointed out to me on a number of occasions the value of having a geriatrician in Ennis hospital and the effect that that would have on the use of beds, where so many of the patients are elderly and there is a longer than average stay there at this time of the year.  We have looked at that.  We have sent an application to Comhairle na nOspidéal and they have responded recently and given the go-ahead&mdash;they have statutory responsibility for appointments, we do not have that &mdash; to appoint a geriatrician.</P>
    <P>The Government gave an additional £5 million in 1990 to strengthen the services <Col N="2023" /> for the elderly at home and in the community. The Mid-Western Health Board received £455,000 of that.  That helped them to make considerable progress towards implementing the recommendations of the policy report on services for the elderly.  The Mid-Western Health Board are using this increased funding to expand and develop the home help and home nursing service.  Speech therapy services have been made available and the operating costs of the day centres for the elderly at Limerick and Ennistymon are also being funded.  The payment of additional subventions to nursing homes has also been undertaken as part of the implementation of the Health (Nursing Home) Act, 1990, which is due to be commenced later this year.</P>
    <P>A sum of £182,000 has been allocated to the development of facilities for the provision of a consultant-led geriatric service at Ennis General Hospital and St. Joseph's Hospital, Ennis.  This development will result in an increase of ten beds in the bed complement of Ennis General Hospital, thereby helping to alleviate the problem of overcrowding being experienced there from time to time.  As I said, the post of consultant geriatrician was approved recently by Comhairle na hOspidéal and the post will be filled by the Local Appointments Commission at the earliest possible date.  In the meantime the board intend to fill the post in a <Col N="2024" /> temporary capacity and will be advertising in the Irish and British press for a temporary appointee.</P>
    <P>Again, I would like to take issue with Senator Howard.  It is not true that funding has not been provided.  The reality is that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The health board denied it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;funding has been provided for the geriatrician appointment. I want to assure the Senator that when the Department and I make a commitment we honour it.  When we committed ourselves to providing a geriatrician in Ennis hospital we also took account of the fact that he would have to be paid.</P>
      <P>I am confident that this new development of a specialised geriatric service will greatly enhance the service provided by Ennis General Hospital to the patients in County Clare.  Again, I would like to pay tribute to the staff in County Clare for the manner in which they run an excellent hospital.  I can assure Senators that as long as Fianna Fáil are in Government they will continue to provide acute medical and acute surgical services of a very high standard for the people of County Clare.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10 p.m.  until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 7 March 1991.</P>
