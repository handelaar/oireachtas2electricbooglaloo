      <P>I have notice from Senator Paddy McGowan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food in view of the serious plight of Irish potato growers, to press for an EC potato policy to protect the industry.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Mary Jackman of the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Social Welfare to allocate part of the £500,000 provided in the 1991 budget for Women's Aid to the women's refuges, particularly Adapt House, in Limerick city.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Avril Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for a paediatric unit at Wexford General Hospital.</P>
      <P>Tá fógra agam ón Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chun a fhiafraí den Aire Comhshaoil an mbeadh sé sásta leasú caoi a chur i gcrích len a chinntiú nach bhféadfaí cearta vótála a bhaint go héagórach de <Col N="1374" /> shaoránach cáilithe i bhfianaise a tharla i gceantar Carna i mbliana nuair a baineadh breis is 200 ainm de liosta na gClár Toghthóirí go mídhleathach.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Dan Neville of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that the extension to the Girls' Primary School at Adare, County Limerick, is constructed in 1991 and thereby alleviate the present overcrowded conditions.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Michael Howard of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to take immediate action to alleviate the severe overcrowding of patients in Ennis General Hospital because of acute shortage of beds.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to hold a public inquiry into any proposed infill and housing development at West Pier, Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Tom Raftery of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to make funds available for the repair of the pier and breakwater in Ballycotton Harbour, which are now in a dangerous condition and deteriorating with every storm.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators McGowan, Jackman, Doyle, O Foighil, Neville, Howard, Ross and Raftery as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator McGowan's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Jackman, Doyle, Ó Foighil, Neville, Howard, Ross and Raftery may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Item <Col N="1375" /> No. 3 followed by Items Nos. 4, 73 and 5.  In regard to Item No. 3, it is proposed to take all Stages.  If we find we have time we will move to Item No. 4.  There will be a sos between 6 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. and from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. we will take motion 73.  From 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. we will take Item No. 5 &mdash; Statements regarding the Gulf War.  That is a two hour debate and Senators will be limited to ten minutes in their speeches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I would like to ask the Leader of the House two questions.  First &mdash; and I know I have raised this before, as other Members have &mdash; will he give serious consideration to a series of statements on Northern Ireland in the next couple of weeks?  The time has been reached where it is important that things be said and issues be questioned on that subject.</P>
      <P>Secondly, there is the question of the local elections and the proposed legislation on the reform of local authorities. Members would like to get some indication from the Leader of the House &mdash; perhaps he cannot give it today but could inquire from the Government &mdash; of the progress of this legislation and when we may expect to see it introduced.  Further, I ask him to make every effort to see that it is introduced first in this House because Members here have a particular expertise and a special interest in the reform of local government.  It is an issue on which we are all agreed on the need for reform and I ask the Leader to do his best to see that the legislation is initiated in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put on record that I am grateful to the Leader of the House for making time available for the discussion on the Gulf to start this afternoon. We would have preferred perhaps an earlier time and more time, but we recognise there is a pressure of business. We would just like to put on record our appreciation for making the time available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning in his call for a debate on Northern Ireland.  We have called for it on a number of occasions, most recently last week, and we ask that it be broad enough to cover all the areas of concern.  In the context of the talks that are taking place and of the developments recently in relation to extradition, we should be able to deal with the whole messy situation that has developed where we do not seem to have got our act together properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, I wish to ask, as I have asked before, that we have a debate on the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  Here we have a situation where a debate is going on today in the Lower House.  It started yesterday and tomorrow there will be a special delegate conference of the trade union movement to vote on that programme. Yet there has not been&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There has not been a peep out of this House.  I would say to the Leader of the House that, when we have a programme that is going to dictate social and economic progress for the next three years, it is totally unreal that we should not have the opportunity of discussing it.</P>
      <P>Finally, I wish to ask whether the Leader of the House will allow us time to discuss the new proposals to increase the VAT on ESB, particularly since for old age pensioners and for people who have difficulty in making ends meet the benefits given in the budget and being paid in July will almost contemporaneously be taken away by the new VAT increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to strongly support the matter raised by Senator Manning. I do so because I think it is important to have a voice and to allow the democratic system to contribute rather <Col N="1377" /> than have the paramilitaries dictating the pace, with no other voice apparent about what is happening in the name of the Irish people.  I think it is totally unacceptable. There are many people who want to have a voice and who want to condemn the atrocities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I ask the Leader to please give time to this matter, which is of paramount importance.  It is basic and should be before everything else.  I want to strongly support Senator Manning and I am certain members of my own party will understand that this is a matter of grave concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>First and briefly, I concur with Senator McGowan in relation to the atrocities done in the name of the Irish people.  But I rise primarily to ask the Leader of the House to convey to the Government our increasing concern about the shortfall of finances in the health boards which will, no doubt, be manifested in a shortage of hospital beds, in diminished care, and in increased waiting lists for the sick.  This is of such gravity that I appeal to the Leader of the House to convey the great anxiety of my party on this to the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A question to the Leader of the House, Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is: would the Leader of the House be agreeable to convey this to the Government as a matter of urgency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the request made by Senator Manning and Senator McGowan for a debate on Northern Ireland.  I will say no more than that, just to say that I support and join in that request.</P>
      <P>I would like also to rephrase a question I asked the last day, because either I did not express it correctly or the Leader of the House slightly misunderstood it.  It was about Item No. 13, which is the &ldquo;Bill entitled an Act to amend and extend the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956.&rdquo;  I asked whether the Leader would consider representing to the Government that the provisions of this Bill should be looked at in conjunction with the Bill that is being referred to a committee in the Dáil to deal with Romanian adoptions. The reply I got from the Leader was that he did not intend to take Item No. 13, but that was not precisely what I asked &mdash; I realise there may be some difficulty with that &mdash; but would it be possible to see if the ideas contained in that could be looked at by this committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the very positive remarks of Senator O'Toole about the granting of an opportunity to make statements on the Gulf, I would like to ask the Leader of the House, if he would consider extending this time in order to give an opportunity to all Members, or at least a greater number of Members, many of whom wish to make a rational statement on this issue?  I do not believe that with two and a half or three minutes to each Member it is possible to address a really complex situation and one that is probably the most important item of foreign import that has come before this House.  I appeal to the Leader to extend this time.  It is, as Senator O'Toole indicated, not the very best time to discuss the matter but if we take ourselves seriously as a House of the Oireachtas <Col N="1379" /> we must give an appropriate time, and an appropriate length of time, for these matters to be discussed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise again to speak on the issue of agriculture.  The Leader promised us last week and the week before that we would have a debate on this matter.  As time passes confusion grows and this House should have an urgent debate on this topic.  My question is: when can we have the debate and, through the Minister for Agriculture, let Mr. MacSharry know what the real situation is on the ground?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I, like my colleague, Senator O'Toole, thank the Leader for giving us the opportunity to speak on the Gulf.  We can put it on the record that we are having something that has not so far happened in the other House; we are actually having a debate in which Members have time to contribute on the issue of the Gulf War.  That is a small achievement for this House, for which the Leader in particular deserves credit.  I could, of course, argue about the time; but I am happy enough to have a short debate and to have us show the sort of concern we should have.</P>
      <P>May I ask the Leader a very specific question about the statements in the debate on the Gulf?  Will there be a Minister present?  Will the Minister be making a statement and, if he is making a statement, can he ensure that the Minister keeps his statement somewhere within the same time limits as the rest of us, because two hours is very short? Ministers can make a long statement that could take up 45 minutes out of two hours.  I am not going to attempt to suggest that a Minister who speaks for 12 minutes should be curtailed like the rest of us, but a word in the ears of the wise could perhaps persuade a Minister to deal with the issue and not with a lot of other issues in the course of a speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support particularly what Senator McGowan said and ask the Leader to have a debate on Northern Ireland. Senator McGowan made it very clear. <Col N="1380" /> There is nothing wrong with democracy. It is the best government system that humanity has so far devised.  To have the organs of democracy silenced while other idiots attempt to use other ways, which are&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I must remind you to put your question, Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My question, as I thought I was making clear, was to ask the Leader yet again to allow a long, open-ended debate in this House on the whole question of and the variable multiple dimensions of the problems in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to say to the Leader, not in an attempt to trip him up but simply as a reminder, that we have not forgotten that he did commit himself to allowing a debate on the prison system. May we have some indication of when he proposes to have that debate?  Is it in terms of weeks or months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to say I am pleased to note we are going to have an opportunity of a debate on the Gulf War.  I hope we are late with our debate and that it will be all over by the time the debate is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it is and I am sure anybody else hopes it is, too.  Sometimes we underrate ourselves in small countries and assemblies such as this.  If every assembly and every small country in the world spoke out about atrocities and asked people to sit around tables and talk, it would be done.  It is never a waste of time for any group of people to raise their voices, whether they be condemning the invasion of Kuwait, or the bombing in Baghdad, or indeed in the North of Ireland.  I am not going to make a speech on the North of Ireland, I understand what is required of a Senator on the Order of Business, but let me say that it is very important for our own fellow countrymen living in Britain that every Irish voice and every body and every <Col N="1381" /> group, official and unofficial, in this country be heard condemning the bombing that took place against innocent people a few days ago.  It was horrific.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like, with your permission, a Chathaoirligh, to propose a vote of sympathy to the family of the late Patrick (Fad) Browne who was a Senator in this House for a number of years.  It is very disturbing for me and causes me a great deal of concern to have to propose this vote of sympathy.  I served in the Seanad with Fad Browne and it is always sad when you hear or read of the death of somebody with whom you served.  I am particularly sorry about Fad Browne.  He was a very splendid man. He loved all things Irish, he hurled for his native county and he represented the Waterford people in this House and in the Dáil.  I would like to propose that the sympathy of this House be extended to his family.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, may I ask the Leader of the House if he would convey to the Minister for Finance and other Ministers our concern at the proposed VAT increase on ESB bills, which is going to be felt by consumers and in particular by the many social welfare recipients who are least able to bear any increase.  It is very important and I echo what Senator Costello said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support asking of the Leader of the House for a debate on agriculture that would give us an opportunity to commend Commissioner MacSharry on the tremendous job he is doing for the small farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Leader on his response last week to my question on the introduction of legislation to correct the situation regarding crime committed by people with diminished responsibility and ask him if he has made any progress with the Minister for Justice with regard to <Col N="1382" /> introducing such a Bill to this House.  I would also like to concur with the request for a debate on Northern Ireland and express my horror at the events in Britain over the past few days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I add my voice to the request for a debate on Northern Ireland?  I also join in the condemnations of the appalling events which took place in London earlier this week.  Finally, I express my concern and join with the Members of the Dáil who voiced their concern about extradition and how it is working at present, particularly in the case that is at present before the courts in the UK.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Hugh Byrne and call for a debate on agriculture.  It is most important for the small farmer.  Agriculture is our greatest industry and its future is in the balance now.  A debate on agriculture is much needed.</P>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the vote of sympathy proposed by Senator Hanafin to the family of the late Patrick (Fad) Browne.  I would also like to know what is the procedure regarding votes of sympathy in this House.  You often see in the Official Report votes of sympathy for former Members.  There is one former Member who died and I do not remember an expression of sympathy to his family, that is the late Senator Joe Lennon with whom I served.  We must be consistent in our procedures regarding expressions of sympathy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal practice, and the practice that should be adopted with regard to votes of sympathy, is that Members should communicate to the Leader of the House votes of sympathy in which they have an interest and he will move the vote of sympathy before the Order of Business.  If that happens, in so far as the Leader of the House wishes to move it, we can pay a suitable tribute and stand as a mark of respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to lend my support also to Senator Byrne and other <Col N="1383" /> Senators who have asked for a debate on agriculture.  I ask the Leader to make available to us urgently an opportunity in order that the serious plight of farmers may be highlighted to the maximum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I noted is that we should pay tribute to the former Senator Patrick Fad Browne and send appropriate sympathy to his family.  I must confess I was not aware of the death of former Senator Joe Lennon.  I would also like to express the sympathy of the House to his family.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning and a number of Senators asked about statements on Northern Ireland.  In the knowledge that there is a great deal of legislation before us, I have no plan at this time for a debate on this important matter &mdash; and I accept it is a very important matter.  I will have discussions with the Whips regarding it and if anything can be done then it will be done.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning also asked about the local elections and legislation on local government reform.  My understanding is that there is continued ongoing preparation of the legislation.  It was indicated in the Dáil yesterday that legislation would be introduced in Easter &mdash; summer, session; I hope it will be as quickly as possible after Easter.  With regard to initiating the legislation, it is something I will endeavour to do and will continue to do at every opportunity.  I have noted Senator O'Toole's comments.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello referred to statements on Northern Ireland and asked for a debate on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  That is important and will be taken for debate in this House, almost certainly next week.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello also raised the question of VAT on electricity.  I have no plan for a debate on that, but it seems to me that it is suitable for discussion on the Adjournment or in Private Members' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator MacGowan referred to Northern Ireland.  Senator O'Reilly spoke about the funding of the health boards.  I <Col N="1384" /> can say to him that the Government are aware of our concerns on this.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris asked for Item No. 13 to be taken and also mentioned the question of a debate on Northern Ireland.  I am sorry if I took the wrong meaning from what the Senator indicated.  I will see whether this legislation can help in any way in the recognition of Foreign Adoptions Bill that is at present before the other House.  He also asked for extra time for a debate on the Gulf War.  It was mentioned, in a different context perhaps, that 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. was a suitable time for a debate and this is the time that, has been agreed by the Whips.</P>
    <P>Senator Hugh Byrne, not for the first time, asked for a debate on agriculture. He has been quite consistent on this.  This is something that will be dealt with very soon &mdash; I am not certain, but hopefully next week.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan asked for a debate on Northern Ireland, on the prison system and related matters.  That is being pursued actively.  I gave Senators, including Senator Ryan, an assurance that we will have a debate on those matters as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Hanafin referred to the Gulf War and expressed a hope, which we all share, for an end to the war.  He also frankly condemned the IRA bombs in London.  My reply to Senator Cosgrave on the matter concerning the ESB is the same as my reply to Senator Costello. Senator Lydon asked for a debate on agriculture which I dealt with previously. I have made no progress with regard to the point Senator Neville made.  It is something I will pursue.  The Senator also referred to a debate on Northern Ireland. Senator Upton's question was not appropriate to the Order of Business.  He referred to the question of extradition. Senator Rory Kiely referred to agriculture, as did Senator Hourigan.  I have already answered these queries.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh. The purpose of the Bill is to approve the terms of the agreement establishing the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and to enable this country to honour the financial and other obligations associated with membership of that bank.</P>
      <P>The agreement to set up the new bank had its origins in a French initiative at the end of 1989 which called for a Community response to the dramatic developments then taking place in central and eastern Europe.  The initiative was endorsed by the Heads of State and Government of the European Community in December 1989 and the agreement was signed on 29 May last.  This was a very short timescale for the negotiation of such an agreement and it is evidence of the degree of co-operation which has been forthcoming in response to the remarkable developments in eastern Europe.  While membership of the bank will cover a much broader international spectrum, it will have a special European character because of the scale of European involvement in it.</P>
      <P>The whole tenor of East-West relations has been transformed as a result of the far-reaching reforms taking place in central and eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.  The changes in central and eastern Europe mean that it is no longer appropriate to think in bloc-to-bloc terms.  The newly-emerged democracies &mdash; and in particular Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary &mdash; carry out independent foreign policies which are based on similar premises to those of western European countries such as respect for human rights and for international law, and which reflect their particular national concerns.  They are anxious to increase their links with western Europe in general and in particular with the Community, which they see as a powerful support for democracy and for economic reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it must be acknowledged that the degree of progress in introducing reforms is uneven.  For example, Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia are <Col N="1387" /> most advanced while the situation in Bulgaria, Romania and Yugoslavia requires careful monitoring.  The position in the Soviet Union is much more complicated. This is partly because of its size but recent uncertainties surrounding the extent and the pace of the reform process are also a factor.</P>
    <P>The Community has been in the vanguard in providing and co-ordinating economic assistance in support of reform in central and eastern Europe.  A wide range of measures to assist the transition from command to market-oriented economic structures has been agreed.  Priority areas in fields such as agriculture, trade, investment, environment, energy and training have been identified in line with the real needs of these countries and projects are already under way in most of these sectors.  In addition, various instruments at EC level have been put in place, for example, European Investment Bank and European Coal and Steel Community loans.  In all, assistance to the region, including grants, loans and credits, committed since June 1989 by the major donor countries known as the G24, amounts to the impressive figure of $31 billion.  That amount includes the roughly $13 billion of capital for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</P>
    <P>The economies of eastern Europe must go through a fundamental process of restructuring from inefficient production and distribution systems, based on central planning, to the market system which we take for granted.  It is difficult for us to grasp fully the scale of change that is required when whole nations have been conditioned for the past 50 years to a rigid system of planning that stifled initiative and individual enterprise.</P>
    <P>One of the perverse consequences of the economic reforms that are now taking place is that output in these countries will stagnate or decline in the short term due to the impact of the adjustments that are required.  New structures and new institutions must be put in place and the changeover to world prices and payment <Col N="1388" /> in convertible currencies will put an extra strain on financial resources.  The elimination of widespread subsidies, with only partial compensation for consumers, and the threat of unemployment add further to the difficulties that arise.  There is also a distinct risk of mounting inflation.</P>
    <P>For the longer term, however, the outlook is much more optimistic and economic performance should improve significantly provided these countries adhere to sound economic policies during the process of integration into the free market economy.  The early indications are that the authorities in these countries generally understand the importance of this but they will have to withstand pressures as people's expectations are not being realised quickly.</P>
    <P>Help is needed from the West during the difficult period of transition and help is being provided in a number of ways. International and European Community institutions are organising assistance and a number of countries have bilateral arrangements for special aid.  Much has already been achieved in a very short period.  The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development can have a powerful influence on the transition process. There are many projects waiting for assistance and it is most important that no time is lost in providing the necessary resources for the new institution to enable it to fulfil its mandate.</P>
    <P>The objective of the bank is to promote private and entrepreneurial activity in those central and eastern European countries which are committed to multi-party democracy, pluralism and market economics and to foster their transition towards open market-oriented economies. The bank will have a broad range of functions.  It will provide loans, guarantees and technical assistance, make equity capital investments and underwrite the issue of securities.  It may also accept special funds and deploy them in accordance with whatever agreement is reached with the donors of such funds. Its activities will also cover such areas as management education, marketing, training and assistance in setting up the structures which are currently lacking in <Col N="1389" /> eastern Europe.  These include legal structures to underpin private ownership and financial structures in banking and capital markets.</P>
    <P>The bank's financial assistance will be directed towards specific projects.  It will not lend to Governments to support programmes of economic adjustment or to finance balance of payments deficits. These will remain areas for the continuing attention of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Community itself.  The main emphasis in the bank's operations will be on the private sector and on State-owned enterprises which are being privatised.  The bank's operations will not be confined to the private sector and it will be able to assist the State sector for certain purposes, such as infrastructure, subject to a limit of 40 per cent of its operations both in the individual countries and overall.</P>
    <P>Central and eastern European countries meeting the conditions set out in the agreement are eligible for assistance.  It is possible that the entitlement of any recipient member to the bank's funds be limited under Article 8 where that member is judged to be implementing policies which are inconsistent with Article 1 of the agreement.  Any such limitation would require the support of two-thirds of the Governors representing three-quarters of the total voting power.</P>
    <P>The sheer size and potential demand for resources of the USSR raised the question, at an early stage of the negotiations, of the extent of this member's access to the bank's funds.  The difficulty was finally resolved by the USSR limiting voluntarily its access to funds over the first three years.  The relevant request from the Soviet authorities is reproduced on the last page of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The effect of this arrangement is that the USSR will not be able to receive funds from the bank in excess of what it will have already paid in for its shares in the bank over this three year period.  The limit on the amount of funds involved is in the order of IR£80 million.  In addition, the range of activities qualifying for assistance in the USSR will be more restricted than for other recipients.  Any <Col N="1390" /> decision at the end of the three year period to widen USSR access will have to command a majority of 85 per cent of the voting power of members.</P>
    <P>The initial capital of the bank will be 10,000 million ECU, 3,000 million of which will be paid in and the remainder subject to call.  Broadly speaking, this will set a limit of 10,000 million ECU on the bank's operations over the next five years.  Of this, 3,000 million will be funded from the paid-in capital of members and the balance of 7,000 million will be borrowed on the international capital markets.  It is only in the event of things going drastically wrong that there would be any question of a call on the balance of 7,000 million of members' subscribed capital.</P>
    <P>The prospective founder membership of the bank and the allocation of its initial share capital are set out in Annex A to the agreement.  The main points of interest are as follows.  When the agreement was signed there was 42 prospective members of the bank, comprising 40 countries and two institutions, namely, the European Community and the European Investment Bank.  The articles of agreement specify that membership is open to European countries, non-European countries, members of the IMF, the European Economic Community and the European Investment Bank.</P>
    <P>The European Community holding, if we count the shares of the member states, the Community itself and the European Investment bank, amounts to 51 per cent of the shares of the bank.  This does not, however, secure control of the bank in all circumstances as most of the non-routine decisions require majorities of two thirds or over.</P>
    <P>The US has the largest individual country share at 10 per cent; other major countries each have 8.5 per cent; the USSR has 6 per cent and the remaining shareholdings vary generally in proportion to a country's resources, with Ireland having 0.3 per cent.  The breakdown of share capital between Community member states is broadly on the lines of their shares in the capital of the European Investment Bank.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1391" /> Since the agreement was signed, the two Germanys have been reunited and the German authorities have indicated that they will not be taking up the shares allocated to the former German Democratic Republic.  Germany will, therefore, continue to have the same proportion of shares as the other large Community members.  The former GDR shares will remain unallocated for the present and will be available for allocation either to existing founder members or to any new members the bank might decide to admit when it is up and running.</P>
    <P>On becoming a member, Ireland will subscribe 3,000 shares.  This will represent 0.3 per cent of the bank's total subscribed capital.  While the cost of these shares is about 30 million ECU the actual paid-in element will be 9 million ECU or IR£6.9 million at current exchange rates, payable over five years. This will amount to 1.8 million ECU or approximately IR£1.4 million a year and will be paid from the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>Payment of our subscription will become due after sufficient members have ratified the agreement to allow for its entry into force and after Ireland has ratified the agreement.  It is expected that the agreement will enter into force shortly and a first meeting of Governors is planned for April.  Assuming speedy ratification by Ireland, the cost to the Exchequer of IR£1.4 million per annum will arise in each of the years 1991 to 1995.  Up to 50 per cent of each instalment of paid-in shares may be made in promissory notes which will be encashed by the bank as needed for its operations. Ireland's maximum liability to the bank will be the unpaid share of its subscribed capital.</P>
    <P>The new bank has a number of unique features in relation to other multilateral institutions and I would like to mention a few of these.  Its statutes contain express political criteria in relation both to membership and beneficiaries.  These cover a commitment to multi-party democracy, the rule of law and human rights.  Its activities will span both the public and <Col N="1392" /> private sectors and it will have a wide range of instruments at its disposal.  It is unusual in having Soviet, eastern European and United States participation as founder members.  It has a majority Community, and even bigger majority European, shareholding and its capital is denominated in ECU.</P>
    <P>In the course of the negotiations a number of candidates for the location of the bank were put forward, including Dublin.  It did not prove possible, however, to get a Community consensus on a single location and the wider negotiating conference eventually decided that the bank's headquarters should be in London.</P>
    <P>Overall control of the bank will be exercised by a Board of Governors.  Each of the members will appoint a governor, normally the Finance Minister.  Governors will meet annually to review progress and decisions on particularly sensitive issues will be reserved for them.</P>
    <P>The day-to-day running of the bank will be delegated to the Board of Directors. This board will consist of 23 directors. Eleven will be elected by the Community, its member states and the European Investment Bank.  Of the remaining 12, four will be elected by recipient countries of central and eastern Europe, four by other European countries and four by non-European countries. There will be an equivalent number of alternate directors.  Ireland will share a directorship and an alternate with Denmark on a rotating basis.</P>
    <P>The bank will not be in competition with any of the existing international financial institutions.  Rather, it sees itself both as a complement and a catalyst. It will complement the activities of the existing multilateral institutions in undertaking co-financing with them and in concentrating on individual projects where some of the other institutions take a more global approach.  It will work in close liaison with, and benefit from the experience of, the European Investment Bank which is also one of its own members.  It will co-operate closely with the European Commission which is co-ordinating a <Col N="1393" /> broad range of multilateral aid to eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Bill itself, section 1 defines various terms and section 2 provides for the approval of the terms of the agreement.</P>
    <P>Section 3 contains the financial and other provisions.  In particular, subsection (2) provides for the payment out of the Central Fund both of our initial subscription, and of any subsequent subscriptions which might arise if the bank's capital were to be increased and we were to participate in that increase.  Subsection (3) provides for the issue of promissory notes.  Subsection (4) provides for the disposal of any moneys received under the agreement, for example, under any distribution of net income that might be decided on.</P>
    <P>As is customary, the Central Bank will act as depository for the EBRD and subsection (5) makes provision for this.  In addition, this subsection also provides that the Central Bank may advance any moneys required for subscription payments. Under subsection (6), the servicing costs associated with any moneys thus advanced will be charged on the Central Fund.  Section 4 contains the short title to the Bill and the terms of the EBRD agreement itself are set out in the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill to the House this afternoon, I can assure the Minister of full co-operation in its speedy passage.  We have agreed to take all Stages here this afternoon, time permitting.</P>
      <P>The Minister has outlined quite comprehensively exactly what is behind this Bill.  Its purpose is to allow for ratification, on behalf of our country, of the agreement establishing the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development or the EBRD and also to enable this State to comply with financial and any other obligations of membership of the EBRD.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has pointed to the major changes in central and eastern Europe, <Col N="1394" /> particularly in the past 12 months. Extraordinary changes have taken place in this part of the world.  Yesterday's dictatorships have been replaced by today's reborn democracies.  The centrally planned economies of communist states, as the Minister said, which stifled initiative and enterprise, have given way to the opportunities and, hopefully, the disciplines of the free market.</P>
    <P>The Minister also adverted to the fact that some of the disciplines of converting to the free market may bear heavily on the ordinary people of the countries involved.  They may not quite appreciate the sacrifices, and indeed the problems with unemployment and redundancy which would effectively be new problems to them.  Those of us who have experienced life in the free world, particularly in what we refer to as the West, have reacted very quickly.  Certainly, central and eastern Europe and the Soviet Union are aware of the considerable goodwill that exists in the West to help them in their very difficult task of transfer from a centrally planned economy to the free market type situation.</P>
    <P>We must continue to help and we must continue to influence events because it is very much in the interest of the countries concerned.  However, economic stability is as much in our interest as it is in the interest of the states who will be recipients of the funding from the EBRD.  Our speedy ratification of this agreement is one tangible way of showing our long term commitment to the countries involved.</P>
    <P>The whole concept of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is based on the same principle of international multilateral development banks, for example, the World Bank which operates itself in the public sector but its offshoot, the International Finance Corporation, operates in the private sector.  Indeed, the World Bank has many regional offshoots which we can look to as template for what we are talking about.</P>
    <P>The EBRD is similar in operation and structure but will operate in what has been referred to as the European theatre, with particular emphasis on central and <Col N="1395" /> eastern Europe and indeed the Soviet Union.  It will be funded according to Annex A in the Bill by the list of countries, a very interesting amalgam of countries. Fifty one per cent of the shareholding will come from the European Community, both the states and two major institutions involved, the Community itself and the European Investment Bank.  The two institutions, the European Economic Community and the EIB, will hold 6 per cent of the capital subscription with 30,000 shares each. Forty five per cent of the shares will be held by the rest of the European Community, divided in different proportions among the states.  The main economies in Europe seem to have about 8.5 per cent each.</P>
    <P>I cannot quite figure out what was the formula for dividing up the shares.  I presume somebody sat around a table and hammered out an agreement but it does not seem to reflect GDP or any specific criteria that is apparently obvious at any rate, maybe there is a formula.  It would be interesting, if the Minister was in a position when replying to Second Stage, to indicate how the proportion of shares was actually allocated to each of the member states.  Perhaps it is not scientific; perhaps it was purely an agreement that took place during the conference in France when this whole concept was being developed.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, the French were the initiators of the idea; the genesis of this development bank came from the French.  There will be 42 different participants.  One of those still listed in the Bill as a participant is the GDR, the German Democratic Republic. Time has moved on and since the initial concept the unification of Germany means that the GDR is not a separate entity from Germany as such any longer.  I understand that the united Germany is not taking up the GDR's 15,500 shares.  Perhaps, when the Minister is replying, he could indicate why that is so or what indeed will happen.  Will these just be unsubscribed, will these shares <Col N="1396" /> not be taken up by anyone and what exactly will be their status?</P>
    <P>I understand the reason the united Germany is not taking up the GDR shares is that it would upset the balance of the major economies in Europe having 8.5 per cent each.  If Germany, as we now know it, was to take over the responsibility for the GDR subscription they would then have the highest number of shares of any individual country in the Community.  Perhaps it is only to prevent that happening that Germany has not taken up the GDR shares.  It is an interesting point, if not a major issue, and perhaps the Minister could expand on the thinking behind it.</P>
    <P>The decision to give the European Community a majority &mdash; they have 51 per cent of the shares &mdash; as made by the European Council in December 1989.  It is, after all, a European bank even though the members of the bank are drawn from far afield, including the US, South Korea and various other interesting contributors, but mainly it is a European bank. On that assumption and because its genesis was European, and as it is the European Community who are spearheading the whole operation, that is why the majority shareholding is held by the Community.  It has been referred to as an inter-governmental agreement plus support from the EIB and the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>Annex A lists the individual members who will subscribe to the initial authorised capital stock.  Interestingly, there are only two institutional members.  I would like to know from the Minister if there was a deliberate decision taken to confine the number of institutions that could become part of the bank to these two, whether others were looking for membership as well or whether there were only two knocking on the door in terms of taking a shareholding.  There is a large number &mdash; I believe it is something like 42 &mdash; of different members only two of whom are institutional members. Could the Minister expand on that and explain whether the two institutions mentioned in Annex A were the only two interested or whether there were others <Col N="1397" /> which were not considered or were refused?</P>
    <P>The Minister explained at length the aims of the bank, to facilitate a transition to market-oriented economies and to help the private sector mainly and the public sector to privatise in the recipient countries.  This is all dealt with in detail in Article 1 of the agreement which states:</P>
    <P>The basic purpose of the bank is to foster the transition towards open market oriented economies and to promote private and entrepreneurial initiative in those central and eastern European countries which are committed to, and are applying the principles of multi-party democracy, pluralism and market economy.</P>
    <P>It is straightforward.  We all support the aims of the bank.  The interesting aspect, &mdash; and the Minister referred to this in his speech &mdash; is that this is the first time any bank or financial institution has specific political aims as part of its terms of reference. That deserves underlining from our point of view.  Article 8 is designed for the Soviet Union to be sure one recipient country would not get the maximum amount of the resources.  There are certain conditions and political considerations that must be in operation in each recipient country before funding can be considered.  This is the first time this has ever been considered.  It is patently obvious to us all why it is an essential consideration in relation to lending from this particular institution.</P>
    <P>This will not be a bank involved in concessionary funds.  As the Minister said, it will not get involved in underwriting national debts and major structural funding in that sense.  It will give technical assistance and take equity in firms.  It will lend also, mainly to the private sector.  There will be a balance of 60:40 in terms of its lending, private versus public sector, 60 to the private sector, 40 maximum to the public sector, with the main focus on the private sector and the sector in need of privatising which may at this time be part of the public sector but public sector bodies that want to privatise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1398" /> The World Bank is also operating and indeed is investing very heavily in central and eastern Europe at this time with an emphasis on public sector investment. This bank will give loans, equity, guarantees, technical assistance of many kinds. That will include feasibility studies, management education, as in the list before us and indeed in the Minister's contribution here this afternoon.  It will not be in the business of giving loans for broad sectoral reform.  The money will be directed to specific investment projects.  It will be more equivalent to the type of funding the European Investment Bank is now involved in and that type of approach rather than the present World Bank approach.</P>
    <P>There are discussions ongoing in relation to debt forgiveness and rescheduling of repayments with the IMF at the moment, particularly in relation to Poland.  The European Reconstruction and Development Bank will have specific country strategies.  This will probably be the most complicated end of its brief because there is a wide variance at this point in the stage of development of the different countries.  The Minister said there is almost a two-tier structure there in relation to the stages of development of the recipient countries.  He said:</P>
    <P>Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia are most advanced &mdash; this is in relation to the degree of progress in introducing reforms &mdash; while the situation in Bulgaria, Romania and Yugoslavia requires careful monitoring.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that he considers Poland most advanced.  I read an article at the end of December in one of the national newspapers quoting Dr. A.J. O'Reilly and his views of the Heinz Corporation and potential investment in central and and eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. He was quoted as saying a visit to Poland was a traumatic experience even though they have enormous requirements for food products.  He stated they were at ground station zero when it came to reform and their transition for a free market.  That is one man's personal view. <Col N="1399" /> I am not in a position to contradict it or support it.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is saying effectively that Poland with Hungary and Czechoslovakia are in the fast lane in terms of their progress, and international business enterpreneurs reckon that they are at ground station zero.  I really do not know how much work there is to be done on Romania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.  It paints a very bleak picture of the enormous job that has to be done.  The bank will require strategies for individual countries and they will have to consider the ability of each country to repay.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the Polish situation broadly.  My facts come from an article by Helen Shaw which I read in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 18 February.  She wrote a very interesting article on the Polish moves to a market economy and highlighted aspects of the progress they are making there that perhaps we might not have been very aware of.  Perhaps Doctor A.J. O'Reilly was unaware of them too when he stated that Poland was at ground station zero when it came to progress and to the transfer from a centrally planned economy to the free market.  The Finance Minister &mdash; Mr. Balcerowicz &mdash; is credited with being the intellectual force behind the economic reform programme in Poland at the moment.  He has been named European economic politician of 1990.  I hope, behind that title, hangs a man of true genius because that is what is needed.  Each of the recipient nations will need a Balcerowicz to sort their problems out, apparently.  Although the Polish public are now facing high food prices, unemployment and redundancy, which are all new to them, at least they no longer have major food shortages or major queues for basic foodstuffs.  Their problem now is their inability to pay rather than availability.  Inflation is still at about 5 per cent per month there and industrial production has fallen sharply as unemployment has risen.  Their biggest problem has been the lack of foreign investment to help them in privatising. <Col N="1400" /> Privatisation of Poland's 7,000 State companies is an urgent priority of the Government. A new privatisation ministry has been established.  I presume it will be this Minister who will have the task of drawing up the Polish strategy and of liaising with the bank we are lending our imprimatur to here today.</P>
    <P>The central problem for Poland, as for many other emerging democracies, is attracting foreign investment.  There are over 3,000 companies with foreign capital registered in Poland at the moment, with foreign equity of around $400 million, but only 1 per cent of the ventures registered involved investments of over $3 million; so there are lots of small amounts of money going here, there and yonder but there is no major investment programme. One of the big disincentives up to now has been the restrictions on transferring their profits out of Poland once they have invested in the companies.</P>

      <P>Rest assured that they will probably appear at some stage of the afternoon.</P>
      <P>A new foreign investment law is now set to address the situation.  Having referred to Poland's attempts to change their situation I would love to know from the Minister if other recipient countries will have the same difficulty in relation to the repatriation of profits and dividends, etc. as Poland have had or would have had if they did not change the law.  In other words, are there disincentives to investment in the other central and eastern countries as there appears to have been in Poland up to now, albeit for small once off very risky-type investments?  For major investments you must have peace of mind in the donor company, or in the bank involved, to ensure that any profits can be repatriated if and when necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a Mr. Piotrowski in Poland who is President of the Foreign Investment Agency; apparently that is modelling itself along the lines of the IDA. Maybe I flatter it by saying that, or maybe I flatter the IDA, I do not know because <Col N="1401" /> I do not really know what the structure is.  They have been liaising with the IDA and have, if you like, plagiarised &mdash; and I mean that in the best sense of the word &mdash; a lot of the practices of the IDA in terms of attracting investment and in giving incentives to invest.  Indeed, the IDA, if you like, have been the role model for the Foreign Investment Agency in Poland.  The Foreign Investment Agency see the new legislation as a major breakthrough.  It would be possible now with the change in law to repatriate all profits, dividends and capital gains and to liquidate investment immediately. From the point of view of substantial investors it is a real incentive.  Those are the views of Mr. Piotrowski.  The new law will provide guarantees against potential losses in the event of nationalisation or expropriation and unsuccessful ventures can be liquidated immediately.  Apparently the three-year tax holiday for investors in Poland is being abolished but it will be replaced by other incentives which, according to Mr. Piotrowski, will be more equitable.</P>
    <P>The attraction of foreign investors through joint ventures is still the main emphasis for the Polish Foreign Investment Agency but they are beginning to explore green field investment projects generally.  The legal procedure for setting up a joint venture is also being eased. There were fairly cumbersome legal procedures in Poland for getting into a joint venture and, with the exception of the strategic sectors of energy and defence, foreign companies will be allowed to create joint ventures with private Polish firms from now on without seeking the permission of the Foreign Investment Agency.  Up to now, they needed permission and it was a fairly bureaucratic procedure to get it.</P>
    <P>Already in Poland there are big names like ICI, Coca Cola and Hyundai testing the water.  Coca Cola registered a Polish subsidiary in mid-January of this year while the British firm of Pilkington announced a $140 million investment in a glassworks last December.  The Japanese corporations Sony and Mitsubishi, Johnson and Johnson and Proctor and Gamble <Col N="1402" /> all have investment projects in the pipeline for Poland.  I wonder why the Heinz Corporation take such a bleak view of investment in Poland even though there is a huge need in Poland for food products. Maybe they will change their minds too.</P>
    <P>The Polish admit that it is proving very difficult to create a competitive market despite the gains there.  It is a painful process and the ordinary people, as the Minister pointed out in his speech, did not realise how painful the transition would be from the centrally-planned economy to the free market.  That apparently is the Polish situation.  While my information comes mainly from Helen Shaw's research on Poland, I would be interested to hear from the Minister what the comparable problems and structures are in the other recipient countries.  If those are the problems in Poland, what is the situation in Hungary and in Czechoslovakia which are considered, along with Poland, most advanced in terms of their progress in introducing reforms?  Indeed, if that level of problems exists in the countries that are advanced along the trial of reform, what problems face this European bank in Bulgaria, Romania and Yugoslavia?  A few details in relation to the present obstacles to investment and free trade in these countries would be very interesting particularly if we can compare them with countries of which we know a little more.</P>
    <P>The European Investment Bank is very heavily involved in eastern Europe, in transportation, rail, electricity and communications projects generally.  If we can top up our commitment towards helping these nations transfer to a market economy with this specific move today I think it would underline our commitment to them and our promise of help in the very difficult job before them.</P>
    <P>I mentioned Article 8 briefly.  This deals specifically with the requirements of the Soviet Union.  It is included to ensure that no one recipient state would be in a position to garner too much funding at the expense of the other states. The extent of the problems in the Soviet Union and the extent of the reform job to be done there is hard for us as a small <Col N="1403" /> state to comprehend.  We as a nation are giving 0.3 per cent in terms of shares. For all of our willingness to help on the assumption that the political conditions will continue to be met in the Soviet Union, one must ensure that we give as much as possible to the Soviet Union but not at the expense of the other central and eastern European countries.</P>
    <P>We must register our concern at recent moves in the Soviet Union.  Only a year ago we were rejoicing at the positive political fallout at the ending of the Cold War and we were hailing President Gorbachev's contribution to the ending of German partition and indeed the emergence of the post-Communist states of central and eastern Europe.  This contribution was enormous.  It is amazing how, in one year, the situation has changed for him.  It is strange on the international scene but more so on the domestic scene.  One can only look with increasing concern at developments within the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>While there was a tremendous positive political fallout at the ending of the Cold War, there is a deepening economic and political crisis in the Soviet Union which has profound implications for us in the West and for all the post-Communist states and for their relationship with the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>One can be thankful for the harmonious reunification of Germany and for the prospect of a relatively painless integration into the European Community of the new Germany.  There will be problems.  West Germany is in a position to bear most of the costs involved.  The Community will have to help but, relatively speaking, its integration into the Community will be painless when one measures it against the extent of the job to be done in the rest of central and eastern Europe and against the enormous economic and political difficulties that become more and more apparent in the Soviet Union as time goes on.</P>
    <P>The political conditions to which the Minister referred and are mentioned <Col N="1404" /> briefly are unique and are worth underlining. They are very necessary given the specific job that this bank will have to do. We can only hope that money will not be refused for any project in any of the central and eastern European countries nor, indeed, in the Soviet Union because of lack of fulfilment of the political conditions. There may be a question mark in relation to democratic procedures, or in relation to human rights' violations or some interference with the transfer to a free market economy.  Let us hope that they do not arise.  If the political conditions are never breached, progress will continue as we would expect and wish in the recipient countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the headquarters of the bank is to be located in London.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not even bother mentioning Wexford at this stage but I thought that the Financial Services Centre might have had a look in.  Apparently it was suggested.  I would like to know from the Minister to what extent the viability of locating this bank in the Financial Services Centre was investigated and why it was turned down.  We would like to know.  It would have been a tremendous boost for our new Financial Services Centre if we could have caught a big fish like this.  There are logistical reasons perhaps that it could not be there. I do not know but we would love to have the reasons it was not considered on the record from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister explained the method by which capital will be subscribed and, indeed, our net commitment which will be £1.4 million over five years.  It is a modest contribution and one we give very willingly, given the enormity of the terms of reference and the job to be done by the bank.  Last September there was a debate in the House of Commons.  We have moved quickly in this instance unlike our record on the ratification of many other matters from Europe which have been sitting on desks gathering dust <Col N="1405" /> in various Departments, or with the Parliamentary Draftsman.  The agreement was only signed in May 1990; it is not quite 12 months ago.  I understand and support the reasons.  Let it be a reminder of how we can move when the will is there to do so.</P>
    <P>The United States was being offered 8.5 per cent along with France and Germany and other major economies in Europe.  They requested 10 per cent and have now got it if my facts are correct. Could we have an explanation for this? What are the implications?  Perhaps there are none.  Obviously those drafting the original breakdown of the shares reckoned that 8.5 per cent was the proportion that would be due to the US, but now they have requested and got 10 per cent.  Has another nation taken a smaller share holding as a result or was there a proportion of shares unallocated at the time?  I would like to know the implications, if there are any, of the increase from 8.5 per cent to 10 per cent of the US shareholding.</P>
    <P>The US is now the largest single shareholder even though the European Community has a majority of 51 per cent.  The Minister referred to the Soviet Union's agreement to voluntarily limit their call on the bank.  Article 8 (4) (i) allows for this &mdash; any potential recipient country may request that the bank provide access to its resources for limited purposes over a period of three years, etc., page 10 of the Bill refers to this.</P>
    <P>There is a very interesting letter here from Mr. Victor Gerashchenko who is Head of the Soviet Delegation present at the Conference on the Establishment of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  He wrote to the chairman, it is on page 42 of the Bill, and I quote:</P>
    <P>I would like to inform you that my Government is prepared to limit its access to the Bank's resources pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 8 of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank for a period of three years starting from the entering into force of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> Also in that letter Mr. Gerashchenko said:</P>
    <P>Certain difficulties largely stem from fears of a number of countries that due to the size of its economy the Soviet Union may become the principal recipient of credits of the Bank and therefore will narrow its capacity to extend aid to other Central and Eastern European countries.</P>
    <P>Mr. Gerashchenko is accepting fully the concerns and needs for Article 8 to be included in the Bill.  I think the assurances indicate that the Soviet Union understands fully the principle of the establishment of the bank and indeed will not make unnecessary or undue demands which could limit the bank's ability to aid other central and eastern European countries.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to develop his views of what the position would be in relation to the Baltic states if their present quest for independence is achieved in the near future.  It is, perhaps, more relevant in some states where they are making a virulent effort to acquire independence, than in others.  I understand that this Bill and, indeed, the bank's terms of reference only deal with the Soviet Union and with central and eastern Europe and that the Baltic states <i>per se</i> are not considered in any of the present situations.  If the agreement had to be amended in some way, what would be the procedure?  Would it be the responsibility of each national parliament of the individual donor countries to amend the agreement, or would it be a matter of a European amendment or the governors of the bank amending the agreement as each governor will represent each member state?</P>
    <P>The Governors will be the Ministers for Finance of each state, if I recall our Minister's reference to this a short while ago.  Will it be the governors who have the amending power, or what will be the procedure for the amending of the agreement, if and when the Baltic states attain independence?  If they do not attain independence, there will be major implications for the Soviet Union's ability to <Col N="1407" /> call on funds for this bank because it would appear that the only way the Baltic states will not attain independence will be if some of the political considerations that are pertinent to this Bill are not met by the Soviet Union.  These include the use of procedures or methods to quell problems in the Baltic states which are anti-democratic in any way and failure to accept the results of referenda and other parliamentary procedures that may be used to give expression to the views of the people in these states.  It is interesting to consider the development of the Baltic states and how it would impinge on the ability of this bank to fund the Soviet Union and how, if ever, the Baltic states would be able to become recipient countries in relation to this Bill themselves.</P>
    <P>The president-elect of the Bank at the moment is Mr. Jacques Attali.  He is the president-designate, to give him his correct title and I assume that he will be ratified or elected by the governors at this first meeting.  He will be obliged to base his recruiting and staffing for the bank on as wide a geographical representation as possible.  I take it then that, apart from our governor representing the Central Bank and the Irish people on it, there will be opportunities for many Irish people in the financial world to gain experience in this particular bank.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is an interim team operating pending the ratification of the agreement in all the different countries and the actual establishment of the bank. They are negotiating the headquarters' agreement which appears to be for London.  They are looking at different projects in eastern Europe so that there will not be an undue lead-in time in terms of actual help with funding of projects. Once the agreement has been ratified they will be ready to issue money towards projects once the green light has been given.  At the moment we have one person on secondment from the Department of Finance working with the interim team, but it would be interesting if the Minister could indicate to us how, in fact, the staffing on as wide a geographical <Col N="1408" /> representation as possible will be implemented.</P>
    <P>I fully support the Bill before us.  This Bill will ratify the establishment of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and I welcome Ireland's participation.  In one year, since the ending of the Cold War, we have gone from a euphoric situation in relation to political implications to one of deep concern regarding the economic problems that accompany transferring from the centrally-planned economies of central and eastern Europe and of the Soviet Union to a free market situation.  We can help them by ensuring that there is foreign investment available to make this transfer as smooth and as easy as possible. It is in our interest that the transfer should not be bumpy or difficult because if the economic impact upon the recipient countries is such that the ramifications and the ripples from these countries are felt throughout the developed world, and throughout OECD countries, we, along with the other countries in the West, will suffer enormously.  For both selfish and unselfish reasons we wholeheartedly welcome the Minister's contribution here today and will be supporting this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the Bill and the Minister to the House.  I am delighted, particularly, at the part played by the Government in the negotiations which took place mainly during the Irish Presidency of the Community.  The fact that the agreement was reached between a broadly-based worldwide group of members is also significant.  Obviously, compromises were necessary along the way, but the agreement reached bears witness to the willingness of all the parties concerned to meet half-way and must also augur well for the people of Europe, a Europe that will be based on mutual understanding and reconciliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of overall expenditure, the amount of money involved from Ireland's point of view could be said to be negligible. With regard to the Minister's speech, I understand we will be spending something like 0.3 per cent of the total cost and that that works out at £1.4 <Col N="1409" /> million per year over a five year period. This certainly could not be regarded as excessive or significant given our overall spending in the recent budget.  What are significant, however, are the dramatic changes that have taken place in eastern and central Europe since 1989.  How pleasant it is that we no longer need to think in bloc-to-bloc terms and how pleasant to note the emergence of democracies in Czechoslovakia, in Poland and in Hungary.  What is more significant still is the fact that their foreign policies are based on similar premises to those of Western Europe, which are founded on a respect for human rights, something we have been calling for many decades.</P>
    <P>It is also pleasing that these countries are anxious to increase their links with Western Europe, which they evidently see as a powerful support for their own democracy and also for economic reform. One must also be aware of the uneven degree of progress in introducing reform. Again, the Minister in his speech has instanced Bulgaria, Romania and Yugoslavia and said that they require particular and careful monitoring.  Given the recent events the position is more precarious still in the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>Some of the Members of the Dáil referred to this in their debate and I agree with Senator Doyle regarding the example of the Polish experience.  If Poland was regarded as a leading light in the emergence from eastern Europe, it begs the question of what the situation is like with the others?  Some of the Members in the Dáil were concerned about the progress towards democracy and human rights.  What would be the position of the bank relative to a return to centralised control?  The entitlement of a recipient member to bank funds is limited under Article 8 where the member is judged to be implementing policies which are inconsistent with Article 1 of the agreement. It states: &ldquo;Where such limitation exists it would require the support of two-thirds of the Governors representing three-quarters of the total power&rdquo;.  One can safely assume, therefore, that the basis on which any such judgment would <Col N="1410" /> be made would also take account of the sentiments expressed in the preamble, particularly with regard to human rights.</P>
    <P>Transition for many of these countries, from a command economy to a market economy is extremely painful.  Yet some economists, for example, in Poland, have described themselves as being like a lab mouse going through an experiment in social and democratic change.  Senator Doyle has described fully the Balcerowicz programme which has had a certain success in Poland in that it has kept away hyper inflation.  It has given a certain stability and buying power.  Since that happened the number of unemployed has risen from an artificial zero to one million people.  Senator Doyle pointed out that privatisation has been particularly slow and that they are having a massive problem in paying back their foreign debt.  She mentioned the fact that there were 7,000 State companies waiting to be privatised or become involved in joint ventures.  She also mentioned that of 3,000 companies 1 per cent have investments of over £3 million from foreign-based concerns.  She pointed out that the disincentive to investors is the restriction on the transfer of profits.  They are changing that law to ensure that the disincentives are removed and that tax exemptions are put in place to make it attractive for outside investors.</P>
    <P>That article is proof of the major difficulties of an emerging democratic, open economy such as Poland.  On the one hand there is the euphoria of freedom, getting away from centralised rule, and on the other the expectations of people living in the country.  Now they know what stagnation is all about.  They have experienced widespread unemployment. They have seen the elimination of subsidies with only partial compensation for consumers.  That brought a dramatic end to their euphoria.  The problem for any incoming Government is that since people's expectations are not realised, they must withstand more and more pressure from the people.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle, while mentioning Poland, wondered how badly matters were in other economies.  The position <Col N="1411" /> of Bulgaria was referred to in the Dáil. There is a complete scarcity of petrol and the economy is shattered, living standards have fallen and there is enormous need for reconstruction there.  The Romanian situation is well known to all of us.  There must be a genuine fear that there might be a reversal to the old centralised position if a glimmer of hope is not seen in the not-too-distant future. Support is needed from the West during this transition period.  I was glad to hear the Minister state that G24 assistance to the region which includes grants, loans and credits, committed since June 1989 amounts to an impressive figure of £31 billion.</P>
    <P>The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development can have a powerful influence on the transition process. Given the objective of the bank to promote entrepreneurial activity, it is of interest to note the other functions of the bank in that financial assistance will be directed to specific projects and some would be of immediate interest to us. Having moved away from bureaucratic and central planning, the concept of what people need, what those with a choice can buy and how it is packaged will loom large for them.  Managerial, marketing and distribution skills must be in short supply and if that is the case, then our experience with Aer Rianta in Moscow must stand us in good stead.  There we have a company offering a professional service, integrating extremely well with the community, showing a good profit and showing Ireland in the best possible light.  We could not have better word of mouth advertising in an eastern European context.  There is the fear that as we are a small nation, or what one would call small fish in a big pond, we may lose out on some of these projects and contracts.  Can the Minister give an assurance that there will be open advertising of projects and open and free tendering, with no favours out of court, for any projects undertaken by the bank?</P>
    <P>I wish to congratulate the IDI.  Senator Doyle referred to the IDA and the Polish connection.  IDI is an associate company <Col N="1412" /> of the IDA in that it is tied up with Coras Tráchtála and SFADCo.  The three groups came together to form the IDA. Originally in the seventies, it was put together to play a role in developing countries particularly with Africa in mind.  It is now appropriate, in the light of the professionalism available in the IDA, Coras Tráchtála and SFADCo, that it would play a role in the emerging democracies that are gearing themselves towards a market economy.</P>
    <P>The other question which arises is how to address the issue of privatisation in these countries.  In the Dáil the gradual process or, as Deputy Dukes termed it, &ldquo;the big bang&rdquo; theory was referred to. Eastern and central European countries should be guided in respect of the need to export.  If we were to look for a lesson we would have to look at Taiwan and Korea.  If one looks towards an export-oriented market, one must be competitive and efficient.  The likelihood is that by reason of being able to sell one's product abroad, by definition, one must have an efficient economy on the home front.  The experience in Ireland, and indeed in their own countries, shows that the principle of price supports, which in many instances in the past led to inefficiency and wide scale job losses, should be avoided at all costs.  The development in Taiwan has been achieved with scant regard for the environment.  In that country GNP stands for garbage, noise and pollution.  While significant economic progress has been made they have major difficulties with regard to their environment.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle spoke of the bank in the context of a political first, but we now have an environmental first, in Article 2.1 the bank is obliged to promote environmentally sound industry.  This is the first time an international bank was given a clear mandate under its charter with regard to the protection and restoration of the environment.  We have many examples of dead lakes and effluent being pumped into rivers.  In many instances, the deterioration has reached such alarming proportions that even the <Col N="1413" /> most basic necessities, such as uncontaminated drinking water, can no longer be taken for granted, and that is not to mention the word &ldquo;air&rdquo; at all.  Given that 40 per cent of public projects can be funded by the bank, is it the Government's intention to emphasise this Article in regard to environmental standards? Given our Green Presidency, I exhort the Minister to ensure that this Article readily invoked.  ISO 9000 is internationally recognised.  Is it the intention of the bank when giving aid to the private sector to ensure that international standards are achieved by the private sectors operating there?</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions of sophisticated rip-offs.  With regard to the negotiations on loans, is there any room for investment protection agreements within those contracts?  Will the Minister elaborate on the interest rates that are likely to be charged by the bank and also comment on the total banking sector in eastern Europe and how he feels this would need to be improved?</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I do not think anyone could object in principle to this proposal. Those of us who highlighted the abuses of human rights in countries like Romania when it was unfashionable and when many of the Governments of western Europe were making a hero out of the tyrant there, and giving him awards in the name of left wing politics, were painfully aware of the outrages that were being carried out in the name of socialism.  We cannot but be delighted with the collapse of that appalling sacrilege to the good name of left wing politics generally which was the system of bureaucratic dictatorships in eastern Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The record of my views on eastern Europe is clear and long established. It goes back a long time.  Long before the suppression of Solidarity in Poland I was under no illusion about the nature of the system in eastern Europe, and I have not been since.  It is important to remember that what characterises a State is not the name it gives itself.  After all, East Germany called itself the German Democratic Republic and nobody suggested that the collapse of that state represented a collapse of democracy.  We know what democracy is.  What characterised all those States was a dictatorship based on the interests of a privileged few, which operated on the basis of protecting the interests of the privileged few.</P>
      <P>You cannot have any experiment in public ownership, control or planning of an economy which is based on secrecy because that means that democracy cannot extend into the areas from which it is currently excluded, particularly in areas of economic activity, anymore than in the long term you can have successful, vibrant democracy without considerable public accountability by those who control wealth and power in a society.  Therefore, let us not get involved in too much empty rhetoric about eastern Europe. The collapse of dictatorships in eastern Europe is to be welcomed.  Indeed, the degree to which these dictatorships were nothing more than repressive shells dressed up in meaningless rhetoric is well illustrated by the emergence of problems that were claimed to have been solved, for example, problems of nationality, minorities, religion, etc.  These issues will need to be addressed both by the rich countries who will be participants in the new arrangement and also by the client states &mdash; to use an unhappy but, nevertheless, true phrase &mdash; who will hope to benefit from this new arrangement.  What is undoubtedly true is that eastern Europe will need an enormous amount of support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amused by the Minister's speech, <Col N="1415" /> not that there was anything wrong with it in principle, but there are certain phrases that could not but be interpreted with a certain degree of irony.  There is a phrase &ldquo;a whole nation conditioned to a rigid system of planning that stifled initiative on individual enterprise&rdquo;.  Coming from the head of the Irish Department of Finance which maintains a level of centralised Stalinist bureaucratic control over every activity in every patch of the nation, that is a bit rich.  We have the most centralised system of political administration in the whole of the western democracies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what is wrong with us.  Unaccountable bureaucracy is dictatorship by another name. Public ownership and secretive bureaucracy are not synonymous and never were. What we have is bureaucratic secrecy with the quite willing acceptance by many of our political leaders because it enables them to exercise a degree of patronage. What we need is open democracy decentralised to the maximum possible extent. I do not mean unaccountable power in the hands of people who control large amounts of money.  I mean accountable democracy, I mean the old-fashioned Roman Catholic principle of subsidiarity: that things can be done best at the lowest possible level of decision-making by those who are most directly affected by the decisions that are taken.  Contrary to what we should have learned from eastern Europe, our country is moving in the opposite direction.  We are increasing centralised power.  We are among the most frighteningly centralised countries in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have the ridiculous situation in the city where I live that if the corporation want to put two yellow lines on a street they need the permission of the Minister for the Environment and the head of the Garda both of whom are based in Dublin. When you have a simple proposal to deal with the crossing of a river and whether it should be a bridge or a tunnel and you <Col N="1416" /> presume there is some level of expertise in Dublin that can deal with a technical problem like that, you are running into bureaucracy gone mad.  When one realises the resistance Ministers for Finance of various political persuasions have put up against truly participative structures for developing, for example, a national plan based on real regional devolution, on real power and decision-making in the regions, it is a bit rich to hear a Minister for Finance giving sanctimonious lectures about centralised bureaucracy to other countries.</P>
    <P>There is a certain irony about the Minister's speech when he spoke about the structures and institutions that must be put in place to deal with, among other things, the change-over to world prices, the elimination of widespread subsidies, etc. given the howls of pain that have come from our largest industry, agriculture, because somebody suggested they should move in the direction of world prices and that certain subsidies should be eliminated.  There is a certain irony in suggesting that the idea of avoiding world prices for products and subsidising production is somehow an exclusive characteristic of the decaying bureaucracies of eastern Europe.  It is a bit rich.  It seems that when these things fail and do not reward your own they become unacceptable but when you have a system, as in the Common Agricultural Policy, of precisely that, of denying the existence of markets and of world market prices and of meaningless subsidies which do not do much good for ordinary producers but make certain people enormously rich, you ignore it and pretend it is somehow different.  There is an enormous irony in the way fingers are pointed at other failed systems without lessons being drawn from them that would be relevant to our own problems, particularly in the area of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>I am glad Senator O'Keeffe mentioned the role of the bank in insisting that environmentally friendly industries should be set up.  It is a matter of regret that the Minister in his speech did not advert to the environmental disaster that <Col N="1417" /> prevails all over eastern Europe and which will not be changed simply by an aspiration to have future industries made environmentally friendly.  There is an environmental rescue job to be done in the countries of eastern Europe on a scale that is without precedent.  I could not offer an estimate as to the cost.  I do not know if anybody knows the scale of the cost that will be involved in rescuing it or whether it is physically, scientifically or biologically possible to rehabilitate the environment of eastern Europe.  Other than a reference to some infrastructural investment, it seems that most fundamental of requirements &mdash; the restructuring of the environment in eastern Europe &mdash; is still being left more to aspiration than to reality.</P>
    <P>One of the most fundamental needs in eastern Europe is the restoration of half decent environmental qualities.  Water, air, land, etc. have been destroyed.  The environment was not destroyed because of some sort of Stalinist socialism; it was destroyed because of secrecy and of what was being made.  It is as true of large bureaucracies in this part of the world as it is of large bureaucracies in that part of the world.  What destroys and conflicts with the interests of ordinary people is secrecy and non-accountability.  Whether it happens in the name of socialism, State security or democracy, it is always wrong and inimical to the interests of ordinary people.</P>
    <P>There is only one way to run a successful democracy, that is with the maximum possible degree of openness. That should be defined independent of the Executive and independent of bureaucracies.  It is an issue that must be resolved in the people's favour which is why, not so many years ago, I endeavoured to introduce legislation in this House dealing with freedom of information. We had an interesting debate on it and we were given nice promises but the Bill was defeated and the Government forgot about the issue because Governments are not very keen on freedom of information.  Governments in Britain are not very keen on freedom of information nor are they in the United <Col N="1418" /> States but they had so many scandals that Congress imposed freedom of information legislation on the Executive because of public concern.  If we had the scale of freedom of information of a country like the United States with far more to lose in terms of open government, many of our politicians and those in senior administrative positions would be profoundly unhappy with the amount of information at the disposal of the public on a range of issues.</P>
    <P>The most profound lesson to be learned from eastern Europe is that democracy is a superior system to any other; that however limited, inadequate and incomplete our system of democracy may be &mdash; and I regard it as a very incomplete system because of the exclusion of huge areas of power from any proper public accountability &mdash; it is a superior system to any other which restricts the freedom we have, particularly the freedom to choose a government, a freedom that is fundamental.  It is not sufficient but it is a far better system than any other that has been tried.  I have never attempted to say anything different; it is a fundamental principle of mine.  I resent institutions whether they be in the State or in the ecclesiastical area which deny the superiority of democracy over any other system of rule.  I believe in democracy. I believe people are by far the best judges of what is good for themselves and for the country.  No expert is better at that than ordinary people.  An expert can advise people and they can make the decisions that are best.  It should be left to them.  That is why I believe in decentralisation.</P>
    <P>I am a little unhappy about the slightly tub-thumping ideological tone of this legislation.  There is no superiority or virtue in privatisation.  As any simple accountancy-based analysis of privatisation will tell you, if a company is profitable then the price at which it should be privatised should mean that there would be no net benefit to the State from privatising it as opposed to not privatising it.  Unless you believe there are inherent efficiencies in privatisation, <Col N="1419" /> which in my view is as much an ideological judgment as it is a demonstrable fact, then the price you should sell at should be the price which is based on future profitability.  If future profitability is already guaranteed or reasonably to be expected, then all you are doing is sacrificing future profitability for an immediate sale.  That suggests that, in the long term, the State would be no better off from selling a profitable State enterprise than it would be if it did not.  It would simply be getting money one way rather than the other.</P>
    <P>There was a fairly detailed study done for one of the consultancies on the question of privatisation.  Their conclusion was that there would be net benefit.  What has happened in most countries is that privatisation is done on the cheap so that the actual sale is well below the real market value in order to entice investors. That is not realising assets for the State, that is selling assets on the cheap because the real value is the value based on potential profitability.  That is what should result in the market valuation of the share capital of a country.  Senator Conroy would know far more about this than I, particularly about the good days and the bad days of certain companies and the way the market assesses them.  The share value of a company is based on the market's assessments of either its existing or potential profits.  If the price at which a State company is sold off is based on that, then there is no net gain for the State.  The assumption is that a level of efficiency will emerge from it, and that may well be true.</P>
    <P>I have no desire to have a State monopoly in the production of any consumer goods, from televisions to vacuum cleaners.  I have no reason to believe there is any reason the State should have a monopoly, or indeed a controlling interest, in the production of white goods or any other of the vast array of consumer goods.  I believe that in the area of those with the capacity to manipulate powerful resources or limited resources like land, money and wealth, the role of the State is of far greater importance than the market <Col N="1420" /> itself because the interests of those who operate in the money market do not coincide with the interests of those who are victimised by the money market in the way that the interests of consumers will almost inevitably benefit from free competition in the consumer goods market place.  In this country where we have had successful State enterprise and where, if the market continues the way it is at present, it is likely that we will end up with only one airline serving the country in 12 months' time and that airline will be State owned.  If Ryanair's unfortunate position continues and if British Midland choose to leave, we will be left with only Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>It is a bit of an ideological tub thumping job to have this huge emphasis on privatisation. The emphasis ought to be, and deservedly so, on reconstruction and reconstruction ought to be based on what works, not on what is desirable according to some sort of ideological or political agenda.  It is quite right that the agenda should include democracy, human rights and pluralism.  Coming from this country, with its recent history, to give other people lectures about the importance of pluralism is a bit rich.  We are not very good at it when it gets difficult and to start giving lectures to other people about it is a bit rich.  Nevertheless, I suspend my scepticism on that and say that it is a good thing.</P>
    <P>To suggest there is an inherent advantage in moving large areas of activity from the public to the private sector in all countries of eastern Europe, irrespective of the performance of the company and their future prospects, is carrying reality beyond the bounds of what is pragmatic and practical, and into the area of ideology, and whether it is done by the Left or the Right, that is not the way to do it.  You do what works; you do what is practical; you do what is sensible, and that is the basis on which it should be done.</P>
    <P>The proposals and the plans are fine. There is a certain irony in all this, that is, according to the Minister's script and roughly according to my calculations, the total maximum commitment the country <Col N="1421" /> is undertaking under this proposal both in what is initially drawn down and what may well be drawn down in the future would be about £30 million.  It is somewhat ironical that at a time when we insist that we do not have the money to even maintain our existing level of commitments to the part of the world that are utterly and totally impoverished, even by the standards of eastern Europe, and when we do not have money to deal on a generous and imaginative scale with the prospect of 15 million people starving to death in sub-Saharan Africa, when Europe does not have, either inside or outside the EC, the resources to deal with that nor does the United States, we can create a bank to reconstruct and develop a less impoverished and a less threatened area of the world.</P>
    <P>Am I wrong in suspecting that this bank has more to do with strategic interests and politics than with any sort of altruistic benevolence that has suddenly attached itself to the governments of Europe and North America?  What we are talking about here are politics, and that may be why there is this ideological bias in the Bill.  I regret that.  It is also a matter of great regret that the resources that will have to be available for both Eastern Europe and for sub-Saharan Africa will be dwarfed into insignificance by comparison with the enormous resources that are being consumed in the useless slaughter of thousands of Iraqi civilians in the interests of I do not know what in the Gulf at present.  It is a lesson in the need for ordinary citizens or ordinary politicians to be profoundly sceptical about governments, particularly when governments start to claim high moral motives for things that are obviously being done in their own self-interests.  I enjoyed it when governments explained that realistic decisions have to be taken. In some article about the war one particularly sceptical journalist quoted somebody from the last century who said: particularly when governments start talking about the need for realism or eminent men start talking about the need to be realistic, it is almost inevitable that <Col N="1422" /> they are about to do something very nasty.</P>
    <P>The principle and the values that underlie this legislation are to be welcomed but the ideological bias that had been tied on to the end makes it suspect. The apparent way in which resources can be conjured up to achieve development that is politically necessary for the future of Europe and politically desirable for the political interests of Europe is absent when you talk about the resources needed not to prevent disorder in Sub-Saharan Africa, not even to develop the environment in Sub-Saharan Africa but, simply, to guarantee that 15 million people who are alive today will not die from starvation in the next nine months. A lack of political will, an unwillingness to confront some of the world's more spectacular problems and the apparent selectivity of our view of where we can afford to spend money, devalues the good intentions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is hard for us to imagine the changes which are happening now in eastern Europe but as one American economist said recently we would have to go back about two centuries to find anything that would compare to the changes now under way there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have committed .3 of 1 per cent to the total capital being allocated to this bank.  Overall, it is a very small amount when one looks back on our recent budget but what is significant is what we are here today discussing a European Bank for reconstruction, which has as its main objective the establishment and development of the states in eastern Europe committed to the fundamental principles of multi-party democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and market economics. Recently in an interview with the new President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Mr. Jacques Attali said that his priorities while President will be agriculture, housing, communications, energy, tourism and the development of chemical industries. He also mentioned education and <Col N="1423" /> training as vital in the future development of these countries.  I am sure we all hope that the bank is successful.</P>
    <P>We have seen great changes in eastern Europe reported on our television screens.  It has become abundantly clear that the centralised socialist economies are not working.  They were not delivering to the people the kind of living standards they expected and they were certainly not delivering on the hopes and aspirations of their people.  Because of the changes we have seen recently in the Soviet Union, we may have to wait some years before we get the changes in eastern Europe which we believe are correct. This time last year there was a wave of optimism throughout the world.  Changes were taking place everywhere in eastern Europe and also in South Africa.  These changes which are taking place will not be easy and we know of the great difficulties in countries such as Poland, Bulgaria and Romania.  They have shown that the changeover to a free market economy will be long and painful.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the planning and structuring of this Bill is based on a commitment by the countries that have set up the bank and on the perception of a commitment in the countries that will benefit from the development of democratic structures and market economies. It is right that it should be so.  I hope we will insist that this should be tied into democratic structures or parliamentary democracies with freely functioning market systems.  That is not to say that these countries will not have a wide range of choices as to how they will manage their economies or enjoy their democratic systems.  I do not believe anybody has anything to fear with regard to the kind of parliamentary democracies which we will see in eastern Europe.  I do not believe they will be any less free or less mature than western Europe.  Of course this will involve these countries in enormous changes.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned some of the inconvenient consequences which we can foresee in the short term.  There is no <Col N="1424" /> doubt that there will probably be stagnation or even decline in output but the long term outlook can be very positive. It is inevitable that in the changes from a command economy to a free market economy great changes will have to take place in the short term such as very high inflation &mdash; which we are already seeing in eastern Europe &mdash; but the free market economy needs free formation of prices to get them where those countries are now, basically command economies, to the free formation of prices.  It is a fundamental change in the nature of the economy and of the way it works.</P>
    <P>The early indications are that the authorities of these countries generally understand the importance of the kind of change that will happen but they will have to withstand the pressures as people's expectations are not realised quickly. One of the great needs of these countries in eastern Europe will be of training and management skills.  The kind of management skills which are at present in eastern bloc countries will have very little relevance to a market economy and the more rapidly we can extend training and management skills to the eastern European countries the more easily they will be able to make the transition.  There could be great opportunities for Irish businesses to train and sell their skills in these countries.  We have already seen some good examples of this in the Aer Rianta-Aeroflot link.</P>
    <P>I would agree with Senator Brendan Ryan that there is indeed a great need in the eastern bloc countries to work on their environment.  The environmental damage over the past 50 years is very hard to calculate.  The great Danube River is polluted totally from one end to another. I recently saw a programme on it and the effect of the damage throughout the whole area was quite alarming.  In eastern Europe the bill for environmental damage stands at about £24 billion which is our total national debt and that is just to clean up about four of the worst polluters in East Germany.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan mentioned the elections. Indeed he is correct.  People here have a choice.  I would not agree with him that <Col N="1425" /> there is a lack of freedom of information. People have a choice here.  They have always been able to choose between the various parties the sort of Government they want and long may it remain so.</P>
    <P>At one stage I thought Senator Ryan was speaking to a Fianna Fáil group meeting because he was talking about us not having any hang-ups about privatisation. Fianna Fáil policy has always been that we will not have any hang-ups on privatisation. If it is worth doing we will do it and we will not rush gung-ho into privatising everything.  Our record on that stands.  We will only privatise what we see as being suitable to privatise.  We recognise that the semi-State sector has done enormous amount of good for the Irish economy over the years.  In fact, it was Fianna Fáil who originally set up the semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also discussed the ODA programme.  One has to remember that the ODA programme is only one of many contributions which Ireland makes to the Third World.  I will not go into them here because we had that earlier but it would be wrong for us to say that the only money Ireland gives to the Third World is through the ODA programme.  The list is endless and there are many organisations which collect money here and do great work in the Third World.</P>
    <P>I would like to wish the bank well.  The hopes and aspirations for the future of millions of people lies in the success of this bank.  The political future of many of these countries lies in the success of this bank as long as the people can get in some sort of structural way the social and economic progress they wish.  I would like to welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to welcome the Bill and to support it.  I would be concerned as to whether the funds involved are adequate for the enormous needs of the countries of eastern Europe.  It is very easy for us to casually refer to eastern Europe as such, without fully appreciating the enormous size of the area, the enormous variety of countries involved, the extraordinary differences between their economies and <Col N="1426" /> between their stages of social development, the almost complete lack of infrastructure in most of the countries involved and the limited infrastructure even in the more relatively developed countries of eastern Europe.  Added to that there is the enormous debt burden which all of these countries, without exception, are endeavouring to carry. There are problems of relationship, there is the question of the cohesion of a country such as Yugoslavia, where Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia and various other constituent states of that country are rapidly moving away from one another on economic, ethnic, social and nationalistic grounds.</P>
      <P>Let us take the case of Czechoslovakia. Before the invasion in 1938 and the Munich situation Czechoslovakia was one of the more developed and wealthier countries of Europe and many of its firms were international and very important firms.  Quite apart from the war situation they suffered more than 40 years of almost total stagnation.  Their factories are hopelessly uncompetitive.  Their labour practices are extremely archaic, and their labour forces are far too great. They have a lack of training, and a relative lack of sophistication or expertise in marketing.  Their computing and communications systems are primitive by western European, north American or Japanese standards.  As well as that, they have their own major internal division between the Slovaks and the Czechs. They are in an extraordinarily uncompetitive situation.  They are going to have the greatest difficulty in managing their economy and this difficulty will be compounded by the very high expectations which have been raised by the onset of democracy.  We sometimes equate democracy with economic progress and to some extent that may be true but it is by no means the whole story.  Democracy in itself does not necessarily guarantee economic progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all these disadvantages Czechoslovakia is by far the best possible state for development in eastern Europe.  The only other state which is comparable is Hungary and it has horrendous problems <Col N="1427" /> compared with Czechoslovakia, and perhaps Slovenia if it gains some degree of independence, might be competitive. These states have even indicated that they wish to join the European Community. We know the problems we had in joining the European Community; the great problems which Spain, Portugal and Greece have accommodating to the situation within the Community, and the problems for Czechoslovakia and Hungary would be far greater than for any of the countries I have mentioned.  This is the measure of the ground which these countries have to make up.  Yet they are the very best of the eastern bloc.  I do not think we in western Europe fully appreciate the extreme backwardness of the greater past of eastern Europe.  Poland may be a major State, but it is an extremely backward State in today's terms.</P>
    <P>Many people at quite senior level in financial and business circles are, to some extent, assuming that Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary are, in some degree, equivalent to western European states. Some of those companies and executives who have been there thought about setting up businesses there, and doing business with these countries not on a developing or even third world country status but attempting to treat them as equals, have retreated in horror and dismay.  I think we have a major banking problem here.  We have an enormous crisis in the banking industry at the moment, a crisis which possibly had its origins in the lending of the petro-dollars in the seventies and the lending to countries in South America and eastern Europe on the basis, which one heard the most eminent people repeating, that a country or a state cannot go bankrupt. Many bankers today look rather wryly when they hear that phrase.  This is having pretty enormous effects on the banking system.  Allied to that you have, of course, the extraordinary difficulties which the North American banks, particularly the US banks, are now encountering in relation to lending on property, etc., which are turning sour.  Add to that <Col N="1428" /> a mounting recession and you have an extraordinarily difficult financial situation.</P>
    <P>Looking at this Bill and hearing some of the comments, I wonder if, even today, the financial sector fully realises what an enormous extra burden the modernisation of eastern Europe will impose on it.  I think it is a very serious situation and I am glad we have this Bill which is attempting to tackle it.  There are many very sanguine assumptions and a great deal of learning still to be undergone, and the simplistic ideas with the introduction of a market economy, infrastructures, social systems and ways of working which are totally unused to these systems are rather optimistic.  I hope it works out but I have the greatest reservations.</P>
    <P>This particular institution will in a sense, attempt to be a venture bank and if it works out in that sense, it is very much to their good.  It is certainly a very brave attempt and I am delighted we are playing a significant part.  However, I am sorry the headquarters will not be in Dublin but we have something to offer in this respect.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very heartened by the tone of the debate on this innovative element in the Community's and, indeed, the wider western world's assistance to central and eastern Europe in their pathbreaking and painful transition to a market economy.  Ireland has played a part in the negotiation of the agreement setting up this new institution in the course of the first half of 1990.  We presided over the EC Council at this critical period in the modern history of central and eastern Europe and we signed the agreement on behalf both of our own country and of the Community.  I would like to stress the necessity for a speedy ratification of the agreement on our part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initiative for this bank came from within the Community.  The Irish Presidency played a constructive and unstinting role in bringing about agreement on the statute of the new bank and there were times when the negotiations were difficult, and this to some degree <Col N="1429" /> reflected the innovative nature of the task being undertaken.  In the course of achieving agreement among such a broadly based worldwide grouping of members, some compromises were necessary and the statute of the bank is probably a little different from the seminal idea of the late 1989 concept matured in the course of the negotiations and the agreement reached.  It bears witness to the willingness of all the parties concerned to meet each other half way.  It augurs well for the future of a Europe based on mutual understanding and reconciliation.  I will now briefly deal with the points raised by Senators in the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Avril Doyle asked how the capital was shared out &mdash; was there any specific rule for breaking it up or not?  I want to say that within the EC a minimum of 51 per cent was reserved for the Community member states and their own institutions; 6 per cent was allocated to the European Investment Bank in the Community; the remainder was divided broadly in proportion to member states, contributions to the EIB share capital. For the non-EC countries relativities between the size of the members' contributions to other international institutions were taken into account along with the geographical proximity and the expressed wish of the members themselves. At the end of the day, the shares are not the result of any automatic formula but they are broadly as a result of a very rational approach to the whole idea.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle also asked if the shares that are set out in agreement for the former GDR, the eastern part of Germany, will be put into the unallocated category and will be available for existing or future members.  Senator Doyle is correct in saying that Germany will not take up those shares as this would disrupt the balance of shareholdings between the major Community member states. Senator Doyle also asked about institutional membership.  The institutions mentioned were specifically chosen as EC institutions given the origins of the bank with the Community.  In the course of <Col N="1430" /> the negotiations there was pressure to remove the institutions as this was an innovatory feature of the bank.  The EC Presidency, then held by Ireland, held the line and this new feature was preserved. There was some talk of the Nordic Investment Bank during the negotiations but this was resisted on the grounds that it would lead to too large and diffuse a membership.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the general question of east European indebtedness. I would remind the House that this bank is only one of the players in the field, albeit an important one.  Others are providing, for example, humanitarian aid and grants in areas such as training.  The overall foreign debt of the countries in question is a broader issue than the making of loans for specific viable projects which is what this new bank will be all about.  The broader question is being dealt with in other fora though the new bank will take account of the overall debt position of a country in making loans to it.</P>
    <P>Of the eastern European countries, Poland is the one with the most significant debt overhang.  About 80 per cent of this debt is official debt and Poland is expected to enter into discussions shortly with the Paris club of creditor countries on how its debt might be reduced.  These countries are trying to build up their exports in the face of rising import bills, including bills for essential capital development.  They will be helped by an injection of foreign capital and more particularly so when it is designed to contribute to their development and enhance their future export earnings.  There is an emerging reluctance on the part of some private banks to make loans to eastern Europe and there may be a change in emphasis in private capital towards direct investment.  In this new situation the new bank could play a significant role in channelling capital into these countries.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle has pointed out the importance of investment and measures to encourage it to the economies that are in course of transition.  The promotion of investment is, of course, a recognised priority in the programme of economic <Col N="1431" /> assistance being implemented by the EC and by the Group of 24.  Technical assistance is being offered to the agencies involved in privatisation in Poland and indeed in the other countries.  Particular emphasis is being placed on the negotiation of investment protection agreements which would give investors a greater degree of confidence, for example, in the area of profit repatriation.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle also referred to the location of the bank in Dublin and why we did not get it.  The reason is simple. We did put forward Dublin and would have been glad to have it here, but it was clear in the full conference that even the 12 members could not agree themselves on where the location would be.  We knew that when it went into the wider fora we had a much lesser chance of getting it here.  The fact is that we were not able to muster the type of support that London was able to get in the much wider international fora.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle also asked about the US share.  The only implication of the US share rising from 8.5 per cent to 10 per cent is that it is the largest single shareholder. This seemed to be a question of status for the US and has no significant implications.  The negotiating conference conceded this increase without any major discussion.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle also referred to the recruitment of staff for the bank.  The wide geographic staffing of the bank, of course, will be subject to the efficiency of its own operations and, as Senator Doyle rightly says, the responsibility of the president.  Ireland is in constant touch with the bank in this area.  Recruitment is expected to begin soon and we are aware that a number of Irish people are in contention for positions in the bank.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle also raised the question of amending the agreement and what the position might be.  The agreement may be amended by the members on a proposal from the governors, subject to strict limitations under Article 56.  Amendments modifying the following areas require unanimity: the right to withdraw from <Col N="1432" /> the bank: the right to purchase capital stock, as set out in Article 5, paragraph 3; limitations on liability provided for in Article 5, paragraph 7; and the purpose and functions of the bank as defined by Articles 1 and 2.</P>
    <P>Amendment of Soviet access &mdash; Article 8, paragraph 4 &mdash; requires the agreement of three-quarters of the members having 85 per cent of the voting power.  Any other amendments require the agreement of three-quarters of the members having 80 per cent of the voting power and including at least two countries from central and eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>The question of the Baltic states as members of the bank is, of course, quite speculative at this stage.  Before dealing with the question of possible new members in the bank and amendment of the agreement, I would like to underline our concern at events in the Soviet Union, some of which suggest that the pace of reform may be slowing down.  We have made clear, bilaterally and through the EC, our disquiet at Baltic developments and we have stressed the unacceptability of the use of force to resolve the questions there.  We have urged dialogue with the elected representatives of the Baltic peoples with a view to satisfying their legitimate aspirations.  The situation in the Soviet Union is, therefore, being closely monitored and dialogue maintained with the Soviet authorities.</P>
    <P>In particular, Senator Doyle referred to membership changes.  Regarding changes in membership of the bank, new members may be admitted with the agreement of two-thirds of the governors having three-quarters of the voting power.  An existing member which fails to fulfil any of its obligations to the bank may be suspended by two-thirds of the governors having two-thirds of the voting power.  A suspended member automatically ceases to be a member of the bank one year after suspension unless the governors decide otherwise.</P>
    <P>Senator Batt O'Keeffe referred to procurement. Article 13 stipulates the bank:</P>
    <P>Shall place no restriction on the procurement of goods and services from <Col N="1433" /> any country from the proceeds of any Bank financing, and,</P>
    <P>Shall, in all appropriate cases, make its loans and other operations conditional on international invitations to tender being arranged.</P>
    <P>The agreement therefore, enshrines the idea of completely open procurement, and not procurement open only to members.  This would be based on international tendering, where appropriate, and would be genuinely competitive in line with the GATT agreement and Government procurement.  Private sector enterprises with which the bank was involved would be encouraged, though not obliged, to use international tenders to obtain goods or services efficiently and economically.</P>
    <P>This approach was designed to give the less developed countries who might not become members the opportunity to tender for bank contracts on equal terms with bank members as a means of assisting their development process and of reassuring them, through this original gesture, that the interest of shareholders in the new bank did not mean reduced interest in their traditional partners in development.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Keeffe, and indeed Senator Brendan Ryan, raised the very important subject of the environment.  Article 2.1 obliges the bank &ldquo;to promote in the full range of it activities environmentally sound and sustainable development.&rdquo; The interim team at the bank and the prospective shareholders are currently putting together a very strong environmental policy.  This will not only involve the environmental implications of development projects assisted by the bank but will involve projects directly aimed at improving the environment itself in central and eastern Europe.  The bank will also make an annual report on the environmental implications of all its activities.  These environmental issues are strongly supported by Ireland in the bank.</P>
    <P>Also on the environment, I can certainly agree with Senator Ryan about the enormous scale of the problem and the <Col N="1434" /> needs there.  The bank approach in this area is but one of the instruments being availed of.  There is also economic assistance available in other programmes through the Group of 24 and the EC have also as a priority focus projects in the environmental area.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to the focus of this new institution, which is on the private sector.  This is clearly because the countries concerned do not have a private sector and are trying to develop one.  I stress that the countries themselves are trying to develop the private sector because they have seen that the centrally planned state system, which was foisted on most of them, has not worked.  The new bank is not purely a developmental bank; it is a combined merchant and development bank and one of a number of players in the field.</P>
    <P>The EBRD is not confining its activities purely to the private sector.  Some 40 per cent of its activities can be directed towards the public sector.  This is not the public sector in transition to private ownership and control: that will effectively count as part of the private sector; it means what we normally understand by the public sector, namely, national and local governments, their agencies, and enterprises owned or controlled by any of them.  Assistance with this sector will normally be directed towards infrastructural projects.</P>
    <P>There are also other bodies in the field. The European Investment Bank, the EC Commission and, of course, the Bretton Woods institutions, namely, the IMF, the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation, are also now operating in central and eastern Europe.  The World Bank concentrates entirely on the public sector and is not confined to dealing with &ldquo;individual projects&rdquo; as this new bank is. The International Finance Corporation deals with the private sector.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on the new bank to co-ordinate its activities with these bodies and it is likely that it will undertake a substantial amount of co-financing with the World Bank and the IFC. The International Monetary Fund is a slightly different case in that it does not <Col N="1435" /> finance projects as such.  However, much aid to eastern Europe is conditional on the countries concerned agreeing a macro-economic strategy with the IMF, the EBRD will have due regard to the analysis and activities of the IMF in its own operations; indeed, it is obliged to do so.  This does not mean, however, that it would completely subordinate its own judgment to that of the Bretton Woods institutions.  Each of these institutions will have its own niche in the overall effort to assist the transition of the recipient countries to market economies.</P>
    <P>There was also the question mentioned during the debate of development aid to the Third World.  In response to Senator Brendan Ryan there is no question of any diminution in the funding we are devoting to development aid because of the contribution being made to the EBRD.  The position in relation to development aid in 1991 is that a total of £43.7 million has been appropriated.  This compares to a figure of £34.4 million for 1990.  The percentage of GNP represented by ODA this year will rise from 0.16 per cent to 0.18 per cent.  The major reason for the increase is the provision of assistance to countries most affected by the Gulf crisis, particularly Egypt.  Aid has also been increased to our priority countries in Africa.</P>
    <P>The long term importance of the provision of assistance to the economies in transition in central and eastern Europe cannot be overstated.  To neglect the demands from the area would, indeed, put at risk the stability and growth of the whole European economy and that would be against the interest of all developing economies.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That in view of the requirement placed on An Post in its memorandum of association to meet the social and household needs of the State, as well as its industrial and commercial needs, <Col N="1437" /> and in view of the decision of the management of An Post to implement certain changes particularly the closure of 550 post offices, Seanad Éireann instructs the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to issue a direction to An Post under section 110 of the Postal and Telecommunication Services Act, 1983, to refrain from changes which would have the effect of damaging the social fabric of rural life and increasing the isolation of individuals and disadvantaged groups in society, until such time as it has prepared and published a revised viability plan which the Minister certifies to Seanad Éireann is fully in compliance with the social obligations of An Post under the said Act.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and with no disrespect to him I hope the Minister will be here later in the light of a possible announcement on an earlier briefing.  One of the most striking features of the recent announcement of this viability plan was the manner in which it was published and announced. It was done in a most high handed and insensitive way having no regard for the many real human factors involved.  The problems did not arise overnight.  I would like the Minister to indicate what discussions he, his predecessor, or Department officials had with the management of An Post prior to publication of the plan.  If the Minister had discussions with the management it appears nobody else had any.  This is an entirely unsatisfactory state of affairs.</P>
    <P>Before any plan is put into operation an essential element is to have a full assessment of the difficulties which have evolved, and which did not start only a couple of weeks ago.  The problems will have to be looked at in the light of the services which An Post provide throughout the country.  This service has a rural dimension which cannot be addressed totally in a bookkeeper's mind, in a figures adjustment.  It is important that the social and community aspect of An Post be fully examined.  It is imperative that a full discussion of the problems takes place <Col N="1438" /> with the unions, management and various interested people, including postmasters and postmistresses.  It is only after a full examination of the difficulties that we can transform An Post and bring what has been termed a 19th century institution into the 20th century, and ready for launching into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement that either NESC or some other agency will examine the problem to see how matters can best be resolved.  An announcement on the television earlier this evening seemed to indicate that any decision had been frozen.  One could be cynical and ask if it has been frozen until after the local elections in June.  I hope the Minister will take note of my remarks and that this is not a cynical vote buying exercise with the June local elections in mind.</P>
    <P>I recall when the Minister was in another position about 14 years ago and we had the most cynical vote buying exercise this country has ever seen with the buy all and sell out manifesto, and the country has been paying for it ever since. I hope the Minister who is new to this job will not go down that road again buying votes in the short term but selling out rural Ireland for the future.  While I would welcome whatever report will be produced, I ask the Minister of State to indicate the Government's commitment to some investment in An Post.</P>
    <P>Obviously a certain lack of planning in relation to how An Post is to be run is part of the problem we have to deal with. This problem did not happen in the last couple of weeks.  What were the Minister and the Department doing about the situation which evolved in 1988-89 when there was a turnaround from a profit of £1.6 million in 1988 to a deficit of £3.6 million 12 months later?  Who was managing the books?  Who was there to say problems were arising and that action was needed?</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is only a couple of weeks in his present portfolio, but there was another Minister there since 1987 and it is important that he puts on the record what questions were asked, what discussions took place and how he was taken by surprise a couple of weeks ago <Col N="1439" /> in the Dáil when the plan suddenly emerged. The Minister tried to find touch and get rid of the ball.</P>
    <P>The 1,500 possible job losses, the 550 subpost office closures and the various changes which have been mentioned have to be examined in full.  Who will be singled out and told they are no longer wanted?  What criterion will be used to identify these people?  Who will be told they may never work again?</P>
    <P>Five hundred of the 550 post office closures will be in rural areas and the remaining 50 in urban areas.  From his first-hand experience, Senator Naughten from Roscommon will be further outlining the situation regarding rural post offices, how their closure will affect rural life and how it is not just a simple matter of some bookkeeper at the GPO looking at dots on a map and saying: &ldquo;We can rub some of those out without regard to the rural communities, to the old, to pensioners or to the infirm&rdquo;.  I recall a note in a Monday newspaper which said: &ldquo;If one of her pensioners does not show up by early evening on pension day then Julia Mannion, the Ballygoolan Postmistress, will invariably telephone the nearest neighbour to check that the pensioner is all right&rdquo;.  That is one aspect of the service provided by rural post offices. It is not just a case of pushing forms, pension books or postal orders in one direction and collecting money.  The whole fabric of rural post offices has to be looked at.</P>
    <P>So far, this matter has been dealt with in a rather highhanded and insensitive manner.  This is disturbing.  It does not augur well for future industrial relations that so far no discussions have taken place with the unions, but, suddenly, a plan comes on stream which has rocked the country, in particularly rural Ireland.  I am sure the Members opposite would admit that they have had many representations about the fact that what has become part and parcel of parts of rural Ireland has suddenly been taken from them by closing post offices.  It is the death knell to many parts of rural Ireland <Col N="1440" /> which are already suffering tremendous hardship, particularly from emigration.</P>
    <P>It is important that the whole question of rural post offices and any possible closures be looked at.  The sudden change in the company's finances between 1988 and 1989 has not been adequately explained. Why is that one year they were doing reasonably well and the following year the rot had set in?  I do not think the difficulties have been fully explained or outlined.  Proper proposals have not been suggested and there is no indication how the company will be turned round.  Part of the problem goes back to the time when An Post were separated from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the promised injection of £50 to £70 million did not materialise.  It was very hard to hand over something which, in certain areas, resembled not much more than the Pony Express but was suddenly expected to come up to provide a service like the Concorde.  That could not happen without a commitment and there has not been a commitment over the last number of years with the result that we now have this situation.</P>
    <P>Telecom have done a tremendous job over the last number of years.  Now we can get a phone within a reasonable time. I remember getting letters from Ministers telling me that within a couple of years, if we were lucky, a phone would by provided for one of my constituents.</P>
    <P>It is important that matters relating to An Post be fully discussed.  The question of job losses has go to be looked at, how many jobs will go and where.  In the report of the plan there seems to be fierce criticism of management.  Earlier today we learned that there are nine levels of management: this is another recipe for passing the buck.  I remember a recent programme where a post office worker phoned in and said that on the Sunday before Christmas in one of the central post offices there were 19 people sorting and 11 supervising them.  What sort of system is that?  These are the problems which have to be addressed.  We learned today that there is a problem in the operation of the Sheriff Street sorting office. We understand that there are people <Col N="1441" /> there on overtime earning two and three times their basic wage.  That is unsustainable and indefensible and I am sure all the Members would agree with that. That has to be looked at and changes introduced.</P>
    <P>There is the question of how An Post run their affairs.  Does it make sense to post a letter in Donegal, bring it to Dublin and then up to Sligo?  It does not.  The whole question of how post is sorted, divided and spread out into the various areas has to be looked at.  There must be regional offices.  There should not be this albatross around the neck of An Post, which is partly Sheriff Street.  This matter has to be looked at.</P>
    <P>The unions have put forward certain proposals, some of them are probably realistic, others not.  The unions have to look after the welfare of their members. This matter needs to be resolved for the benefit of long term industrial relations in An Post.  We all remember the 1979 strike which crippled us and we do not want to see a similar situation developing. This problem will only be sorted out if there are full discussions following the report.  In relation to the report which apparently the Minister has requested from NESC, will he act on it?  If it does not suit him, will he act on it?  He has to take decisions.  I ask him to make it clear in his reply that this report will not be put on one of these merry-go-round committees which will not report back for many a year.  This has been the way with other matters which have been kicked to touch, given a good old Garryowen and kept up there for quite a while.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Senator Cassidy's concern for the subpost office in Castlepollard is similar and I am sure he will be defending its right to remain there, and to help him out in June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, how post is delivered around the country has to be looked at. There are advantages in using the railways in certain areas but there are other areas where if a train arrives late, the bus meeting it will have departed and that <Col N="1442" /> post can be delayed for a day.  Obviously that is not satisfactory.  There has to be co-ordination.  We had mail train robberies here in the past.  Is the Minister satisfied about the security aspect of lorries of articulated trucks bringing post because there are valuables such as money, parcels or cheques in these trucks.  It is important that matters such as the security and confidentiality of An Post be addressed.</P>
    <P>Another question which has arisen is the roadside boxes which are to be introduced in various places particularly in rural areas.  Is there any feedback on their viability or suitability so far because in this country we vandalise phone boxes, write graffiti on walls, vandalise public toilets and toilets in public houses.  Will these boxes be interfered with?  Will the security of post be interfered with?  It is important that the operation of these boxes be considered.</P>
    <P>An Post have got to change and look ahead at their costs and how they are competing.  They have to be financially viable and withstand competitive pressures.  They have to look at new systems like the box and other telephone systems.  Postal systems may be redundant. There has to be an investment programme and a commitment to bring An Post into the 21st century.  Costs must be looked and also the fees paid to postmasters for payment of bills.  They have got to think of themselves as a bank. The building societies are going in that direction and there is no reason why An Post cannot do so as well.  These matters will have to be addressed in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The matter of overtime has got to be looked at.  Before definite decisions are made full discussions have to take place with the unions because it appears from the plan so far that every matter has not been taken into account, that An Post are pushing a certain line.  Job losses have got to be looked at.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed to provide for investment so there has been little incentive for An Post to get into other areas.  We have had the debacle in relation to the collection of TV licences <Col N="1443" /> and An Post are talking about contracting that out.  I would have thought if that was done properly and if they fought their corner with RTE that should be a profit-making exercise.  I would also have thought that with the number of people fined in the District Court for not paying their licences there should be extra money there.</P>
    <P>Matters such as the closure of rural post offices and the difficulties that will pose for the old and infirm, who may not have other means of transport to go to another village, five, six, eight or ten miles away, the security of post, the vandalism of the boxes all need to be examined. For many people in rural areas An Post is their main link with their emigrant son or daughter in Kilburn, Sydney, Boston or San Francisco.  If the Minister is postponing decisions prior to an indepth examination it is important that he states specifically that he will have a report back by a certain date and that there will be a commitment from Government. I hope it is not being done in an attempt to buy time before facing an electorate in June.  I know some of the people opposite are getting more nervous as June gets nearer.  The electorate will eventually catch you, Senator Cassidy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator and the Minister should remember that while they may be able to run they will not be able to hide when eventually the electorate catch up with them.  It is important that lessons be learned as a result of what has happened in the past few weeks.  The development of An Post should be looked at, the social impact, the job losses and the effects on rural life and on business.  An Post have a future with the right approach but they will need a commitment from the Government in relation to cash.  There is talk about a computer system at a cost of £20 million. The figure of £14 million will come from social welfare and An Post will provide the balance.  The Government should be <Col N="1444" /> able to come up with the balance to ensure that we have a postal system we can be proud of and one that will be used. Why are people employing couriers, and other methods?  If one posts a letter in Donegal to an address in Sligo it does not make sense that it has to come to Dublin.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister when replying not to think he can get out of this situation by kicking the ball to touch and hoping that the ball will not come back into the field of play prior to June.  If he is sincere in relation to his commitment to An Post and his statement that he was surprised with what had evolved I ask him to talk to his predecessor and to the officials in his Department and ask them what knowledge have they about the matter, what plans were brought forward and what discussions took place.</P>
      <P>This is a very important motion and debate.  In the Minister's constituency he must have had representations on the matter.  I ask him not to ignore the problem, to be frank with this House in his response and come back with a plan that has been fully discussed and which can keep An Post as a viable service in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion by Senator Cosgrave.  We are dealing here with a very serious situation which will have widespread implications for vast sections of the community, but particularly for the rural community.  We have heard Senator Cosgrave outline the difficulties experienced by An Post and the drastic changes which they wish to introduce. I would be the first to acknowledge that major changes are needed within the organisation.  Any organisation which is losing money at the rate An Post is losing it &mdash; and I have their report here which states that their loss for 1989 was £3.6 million, the estimated loss for 1990 was £9.8 million, the loss forcast for 1991 is £16.1 million and the loss forecast for 1992 is £15.3 million &mdash; has a cancer within it.  I do not believe however, that the rural communities should be the people to pay for mismanagement, whether it occurs now or goes back over a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" /> Senator Cosgrave has very clearly outlined the ludicrous situation where you have 19 people working and 11 supervising.  The Department of Post and Telegraphs together with An Post have failed to break the grip of the unions in some of our large sorting offices.  Let us recognise that and recognise also that there was a major problem there which the Department of Communications were unable or unwilling to deal with.  I remember as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts that the Comptroller and Auditor General drew the attention of the committee to equipment which was purchased for Sheriff Street sorting office; three years later that equipment was still lying in stores in London being paid for at the taxpayers' expense because it could not be brought in or put into use. That was a scandalous situation.  We seem to have continued on the merry go round since An Post took over and hence the problems that we face today are major ones.  I regret the way An Post and the Minister, who it appeared at one stage was prepared to go along with this programme, have attempted to deal with this situation by eliminating 550 subpost offices and by regarding district and post offices in our towns and villages down to subpost office standard or district standard. There will be huge job losses in many of those small towns where people will be unable to be re-employed.  In many of those towns like Boyle, Loughrea and Ballinasloe, many of the people concerned will be married with a mortgage, and they will not be able to get another job in that town and will be faced with the prospect of unemployment for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>It is no reflection whatsoever on our Minister of State, whom I respect, that I state my belief that this House has been treated with discourtesy by the Minister regarding this very important debate.  I was watching the 6 o'clock news and I heard the Minister make a statement with regard to this particular motion before the House.  The Minister is treating this House with discourtesy by not coming in <Col N="1446" /> and listening to this debate.  I want to put that on the record.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. McKenna) Acting Chairman (Mr. McKenna)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. McKenna)</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Minister will be coming in. He has been delayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>He has not been here for the start of the debate and the fact that he went on the news earlier today pre-empting this debate is somewhat regrettable when he is not here to listen to the debate.  I also pointed out the lack of technology and the inability of An Post to adopt new procedures and new technology.</P>
      <P>Senator Cosgrave highlighted the situation where a letter posted in Donegal must come to Dublin to be sent to Sligo. That is a disastrous situation and one would have to ask whether it was within the powers of the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications or An Post to have this situation changed long before this.  It seems as if industrial relations procedures are unknown in this particular organisation and in that report one sees quite clearly that top management recognised that there are too many layers of management and yet they are not able to implement a good industrial relations programme.  There are supervisors, managers and other grades. It is physically impossible to operate an efficient service in this way.</P>
      <P>The courier service has crept into this country over the last four or five years. Daily we see their vans going from east to west and from south to north.  Why was an organisation like An Post not able to cash in on that market?  Why were they not able to compete with private enterprise?  They were set up and had the structures yet private enterprise came in and were able to provide a service which the postal authority were unable to provide. The practices over the years have been diabolical.  They are now about to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut and they are approaching the issue very wrongly.  It would appear that it is the rural community which will suffer as a result of mismanagement and bad managerial practices over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1447" /> We are faced with a price increase of seven per cent, which is far above the level of inflation.  We have the increase in ESB charges and in telephone charges but they exist for another reason.  Postal orders will increase in cost by 10p in some cases and by up to 85p in other cases. I would like to know what percentage increase that is.  I would hazard a guess that it is far more than 7 per cent.</P>
    <P>We must all recognise that in rural Ireland the postman was part and parcel of rural culture.  It was the postman who brought the cheques from whatever source, whether they were headage payments, unemployment assistance or whatever, and he became a weekly visitor to many rural homes.  He provided many social services to elderly people living in remote rural areas.  That service is now unfortunately going to be cut away. There was an attempt by An Post two years ago to instal green letter boxes.  We were told that it was voluntary, but if you did not refuse the letter you got stating that the green box was put in, it became mandatory, and they were put in in certain cases against people's wishes.  They will now go in.  Services will not only be removed from many of the remote rural areas, but the report states that as a general rule An Post employees will not traverse private roads, lanes or avenues, or minor public roads which are sparsely populated.  In other words, most of rural Ireland will be deprived of a postal service and instead of having the postman call, we will have these little green boxes on the sides of roads.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave asked how anybody can guarantee the security of the green letter boxes.  Will people have to travel two miles down a county road to wait for the postman to come to the little green box?  Nobody can guarantee what time he will come.  My postal service has improved somewhat over the last 12 months but prior to that I could get the post at 4 o'clock in the afternoon or at 11 o'clock in the morning.  Will these people have to stand by the green box to collect their post or will somebody have taken it <Col N="1448" /> by the time they got there?  It is a ludicrous situation.</P>
    <P>In that area we will have huge redundancies among the people providing that service.  Postmen will be more affected by the redundancies than any other single group.  If you eliminate the service of the postman delivering letters to a private driveway or cul-de-sac.  I can see a situation where one postman will deliver to the green boxes the same volume of post that four men are dealing with now.  You are going to have a vastly inferior service and there will be a risk to security.</P>
    <P>We come then to the rural sub post offices dotted throughout the country which were providing a service for the old age pensioners who went there on a Friday morning as a sort of social visit. They met their friends there, they visited the local shops in the local villages and bought their groceries.  Now that service is going to be eliminated from many of our small rural villages and they will have to go to the towns to collect their old age pensions.  The same will apply to the people on unemployment assistance who, up to now, went to the local Garda station, signed on and went to the local post office and collected their money.  Now, in the absence of the local post office, they will have to go to the local employment exchange and instead of signing on at the local Garda station will have to go further afield with the humiliating prospect of queueing for three to four hours. These are not people who are permanently unemployed, it never stated such in the terms of the scheme.  They are people whose income is not sufficient to maintain them.  I am talking about those who are drawing farmers' unemployment assistance.  They will have to queue up for three or four hours and wait to get their money.  It is going to change the whole scene in our rural towns and villages.  All that business is going to be lost to the small towns and villages and people will be obliged to go to the bigger towns to collect their money.</P>
    <P>I must refer to the Minister's reply in the Dáil.  I want to quote from the Official Dáil Report, column 2136:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1449" /> I do not see a need to direct An Post to provide any lossmaking service as provided for under section 51 of the Post and Telecommunications Service Act, 1983.  That Act gave An Post a commercial mandate and I am satisfied that the course of action suggested by the Deputies is not warranted.</P>
    <P>These were the Deputies who asked the question.</P>
    <P>My statutory involvement in the operation of the plan is, therefore, limited to the approval of price increases and borrowings provided by An Post. Implementation of the plan is a matter for An Post and I do not propose to interfere with the company in that regard.</P>
    <P>Let me first congratulate the Minister on his about-turn and, of course, congratulate the Government backbenchers for forcing him to take an about-turn.  If it were not for the stand taken by some of the Fianna Fáil backbenchers and indeed by Senator Cosgrave in putting the motion before the House here tonight, I know the Minister was not sure he could have got the amendment carried without making this announcement today.  We welcome the about-turn by the Minister, but one has to ask the question: is it buying time for local elections? That question must be asked and that is an answer I want from the Minister when he is replying.</P>
    <P>What is going to happen with this report the Minister has sought?  Is he going to accept it?  How different will it be from the report which we were told took a lot time to prepare and which involved careful and detailed study; it was the bible on 7 February?  Now we see the whole thing being re-examined.  One cannot blame us for asking the question: why is this examination necessary now? If, on 7 February, that document was as good as it was supposed to be, what alternatives can we have now?  These are questions I expect the Minister to answer when he comes back to reply.</P>
    <P>I believe that the closing of our sub post offices &mdash; 550 of them throughout <Col N="1450" /> the country &mdash; will have serious social implications for many rural areas, apart from the economic implications of people drawing their pensions elsewhere and not doing their business in the local village. It has also been pointed out, very forcibly, by Senator Cosgrove that, if an elderly person did not draw their pension, the postmistress or postmaster, would ring up to find out if that person was all right or ring a neighbour in the area.  That service is now gone.  Nobody will know whether that person is sick or whether that pension has been collected.</P>
    <P>Again, you have the issue of the green box, the aspect of security and the right of people to have their post delivered to their homes.  Do not forget that in what we were led to believe were the bad old days, the postman came on his bicycle and delivered the post to the person's door.  One of the things for which An Post and the Department must take a lot of blame was the old system whereby the postman did three or four hours per day, running his own car and getting a small allowance for that.  After regarding was introduced, those people were let go and the permanent postman was brought in. He had a van from An Post at great expense to the State and we had the motor service which we now see collapsing.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the time difficulties and I will conclude by asking the Minister to explain why, first, he changed his mind on 7 February, secondly, what he is going to do with the NESC report when he receives it, and thirdly and most importantly, if this is not a holding operation until the local elections are over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann supports the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications in his recent decision to engage in talks with An Post in relation to the Company's Viability Plan and urges him to take full <Col N="1451" /> account of the economic and social role of the sub-Post Office network.</P>
    <P>I realise the seriousness of the situation and recognise it here in this motion that comes before the House.  As a former employee of An Post I know the situation behind this proposal.  An Post is a viable national asset which provides both economic and social services to all.  It has many important functions to carry out.  It collects our TV licence payments, pays social welfare payments, operates savings services and forms the nucleus of most rural villages and towns.  In our major towns it is one of the central institutions where people have met since the foundation of the State.  Now everyone has to look into the day to day costs of running all its various operations.  An Post finds itself in its present position as a result of changing technology.  We have only to look at the fax machine to realise how it has helped industry and has resulted in a three minute delivery of a letter.  It has enormously affected the business post as we knew it in the past.  It has many pluses for speeding up business.  It must bring in extra income through its use of telephone lines and that is a plus for An Post also. We have speakers on the opposite side who are very concerned about the future of An Post.</P>
    <P>I must compliment An Post on the way that they are marketing the St. Patrick's Day card at present.  There is a whole new emphasis within An Post and there is a whole new marketing plan very evident to us all.  Only last week on one of the major TV programmes, it was noted how well they marketed the St. Patrick's Day concept in their postcards.  While we are having a look at the whole set-up of An post, it is only fair to acknowledge that fact with the national feast day to hand.  They are doing an extremely good job.</P>
    <P>The proposals before us in the document which was presented to us by John Hynes have far-reaching implications.  As one who comes from the rural constituency of Westmeath-Meath it is very sad to realise what effect a saving of £1.5 <Col N="1452" /> million is going to have on rural Ireland in particular.  In country villages where there is a church, one or two shops and a school, the post office may be the only place in that area giving both a service and employment to a family.  I question whether that is costing £1.5 million because these people are more or less self-paid agents on turnover and self-paid agents on turnover only make enough to get by with a few hour's employment per day.  I would be totally opposed to anything happening to any of those rural post offices.  That would be a sad day for rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Members will have heard my namesake, Bishop Cassidy, testify that rural Ireland is being decimated by emigration. As legislators, we should be doing all in our power to preserve the life of rural Ireland which has been near and dear to most people down through the years by maintaining employment in these areas rather than coming up with silly proposals which are going to save £1.5 million. Under no circumstances could I go along with the proposal and I cannot see it getting through any of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As much as I respect the two Senators opposite, their suggestion that it could be a cheap ploy for a local election, does not express the policies or ethos of Fianna Fáil, who have proven how responsible they are over the past 60 or 70 years at running the affairs of the State.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of a spate of breakins over the past number of years.  People were afraid in their own homes.  Various groups pooled ideas at community level to protect people living alone in homes where they had been born and bred.  To suggest that we would have a box collection to deliver the mail to these people is absurd.  I would not mind if the suggestion was for all Ireland.  Is there going to be one standard for rural Ireland and another for the big cities and towns?  I think that is unconstitutional and anyone who suggests the like had better think again.  I do not care whether they are Ministers; it is totally unacceptable.  As one who used to visit people in those areas and has first-hand experience of the <Col N="1453" /> situation I am aware post people are the only people they might meet once or twice a week.</P>
    <P>The person or accountant or team of advisers who came up with this suggestion does not understand the day-to-day operation of postal delivery in this country. They are looking at it only from a financial aspect and as a book-balancing exercise. I remember back in the sixties that the post office was known as a company who paid badly and the postmen down through the years got poor financial reward for going out in all kinds of weather and giving a service.  It is good that standards and facilities have improved and that the service in general has improved.  We have a first-class door-to-door service at present.</P>
    <P>What I am saying here this evening is, leave it alone, take your hands off, it is not for sale and it is not for auction. Under no circumstances as Members who are elected by people from rural Ireland, are we going to accept this no matter where it takes us.  That may be strong language coming from the Communications spokesperson for the Government in the Seanad but I think it has to be said loudly and clearly.  For the saving of £1.5 million this great national asset is not going to be taken away from us.  I can tell you that there are certain projects in this town that are costing An Post £10 million, £15 million and £20 million in the year in comparison with the £1.5 million cost of the door-to-door service.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Minister.  I have known him for many years as a very efficient man and as one who is dedicated to the office he holds.  He has been a public representative.  He was not one day in his present portfolio when this was presented to him and he has taken instant action.  I want to congratulate him for coming in and for calling for this study which I hope is going to take place.  There has to be an alternative.</P>
    <P>We heard Senator Naughten point out the major inconveniences it would cause in rural Ireland if the rural post office were not there.  A number of jobs would also be hit.  If a family in a rural post <Col N="1454" /> office lose their job, what happens?  They will go on unemployment assistance which is known as the dole.  It is absurd that anyone should have to do that.  It is going to cost the State far more than £1.5 million if those people go on unemployment assistance.  This proposal will do away with a service that has taken us years to perfect.  It is going to cost us more to take it away and to pay people to do nothing.  This is an insult to the intelligence of legislators here representing the people.</P>

      <P>I support this important motion before the House.  My colleague Senator Cosgrave, proposed it and I wish to support his excellent contribution. Coming from rural Ireland, I have a particular interest in this and all issues dealing with rural areas.  Over a number <Col N="1456" /> of years, we have seen the destruction of the rural fabric of society.  We have seen mass emigration, migration to our capital and the growth of services in our capital to the detriment of rural areas.  I know there are proposals to close railway stations and connections.  Iarnród Éireann have on hold, although not yet published, a decision to close some of the railway links between various towns.  Just some weeks ago we saw, without any fuss, the removal of some goods rails services.  This trend is endemic in rural Ireland.  We have seen the closure of many ESB offices or sub-offices.  I can instance one very close to me in Rathkeale.  We have, hanging over us, the GATT negotiations and the decision by Commissioner MacSharry to introduce policies which will seriously affect farmers' incomes.</P>
      <P>It has been indicated to me that it is acceptable to give five minutes to Senator Cullen.  Is that acceptable to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite amenable to that.  If the House agrees, that is quite in order.  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed closure of rural post offices is another chapter in the dismantling of rural life.  The post office is a social centre.  It gives a service that draws people into rural towns.  The activity and the commerce that was generated in small villages will now go to the larger towns.  This is one of the more serious effects of the decision to close rural post offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most small rural post offices are in areas which are not served by public transport.  It is important to state that the closure of such post offices will put pressure on people dependent on social welfare and on pensioners who have served our State and paid their taxes their working lifetime.  Now they will have to obtain transport to the bigger towns.  I know of one place where people will have to travel four or five miles to the post office in the nearest town.  They will be dependent on their neighbours and relatives for transport.  They will lose their independence because they will now be obliged to depend on others to help them <Col N="1457" /> get their pensions and social welfare payments. This is unacceptable.  I recognise the Government's dilemma in trying to head off An Post's decision.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will categorically state tonight that the long term survival of the rural post offices will be guaranteed by him over a period of years rather than postponing the event under the cover of new reports, different ways of obtaining cost reductions, and so on.  What we need is a firm long term commitment that rural post offices will remain open.  If their intention is to delay this move until after the local government elections or for any period An Post will be obliged to cut even deeper when introducing their proposals.</P>
    <P>The social dimension of An Post is enshrined in legislation.  We cannot ignore that.  In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> it is stated in relation to commercial State companies that non-commercial obligations are to be clearly defined and taken into account in assessing company performance.  The performance of An Post must take into account &mdash; and this includes the financial performance &mdash; the cost of providing the social service.  The EC Commission Green Paper, which is due to be published soon, states that the Community will investigate whether it would be appropriate to make Community funds, or other funds, and support available in order to help certain regions which at present do not have the advantage of a fully adequate postal service but which do not have the resources to invest to achieve them.  If the Government make a proper case to the EC for funds to retain rural post offices and a rural service, such funds should be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I object to the proposed roadside post boxes.  As somebody who will be directly affected by this, I know the advantage of a daily service, and appreciate it.  If I had to travel half a mile or a mile to collect my post, I would not be getting the same service as my brothers in urban areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Neville for sharing his time with me and for giving <Col N="1458" /> me an opportunity to speak on this important debate.</P>
      <P>I support the Government's amendment. It is right and proper that the Minister who has just taken over this portfolio should have discussions at all levels to arrive at the proper way forward for An Post.  Mr. John Hynes, the chief executive of An Post, is to be congratulated for bringing forward a viability plan in the first place.  It is the type of discussion document necessary for the development of An Post and that, in itself, is important. Every plan that is produced leads to discussion.  I hope that out of the discussions that will take place the way forward for An Post will emerge.</P>
      <P>What we are faced with is the classic example of a company which failed to revolutionise their operation.  Modern technology was not implemented in this organisation over the years.  What has happened is that instead of having a phased implementation of modern technology married with the traditional methods for the last decade and a half the company is now faced with implementing modern technology in one go.  This will lead to major difficulty and trauma for all those involved in An Post.</P>
      <P>It is tragic that this debate is dominated by the closure of sub-post offices.  I, as a rural Senator, see this as an important issue, but the whole debate on An Post and its future is being focused on one issue.  This is a sorry and tragic situation for all those involved in An Post, both on the union and management sides.</P>
      <P>With regard to sub-post offices, I do not accept that their closure threatens the fabric of rural Ireland, and I mean that in the best sense.  It is wrong to use that type of argument.  Fine Gael are being mischievous in using that kind of emotive and outlandish language which does nothing to serve the purpose of a very important company that is at the heart of our economic development.  There is room for the retention of a certain number of sub-post offices, but time will tell how many.  I will await deliberations in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made of the social aspect of post offices, for example, the lady in <Col N="1459" /> the post office who rings the pensioner if he or she does not collect their pension and looks after things for them.  That is marvellous but there is a sense of transferring to the postmaster or postmistress responsibility for the aged.  This is a commercial company and must operate in the real world.  They are not responsible for anybody's social conscience.</P>
    <P>It is being put about that there will be no postal service in rural Ireland; that is another ludicrous statement.  It does not enter into the argument at all.  The people will receive the efficient and modern postal delivery service to which they are entitled.  If there are social questions they should be debated, and rightly so. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that An Post must develop in the interests of all.  It has more of a contribution to make than just delivering post.  If we look at the development of these services throughout Europe we will see the need for An Post to compete not alone in national terms but in international terms.  The debate then moves into the arena that I believe John Hynes tried to take it before it was hijacked for political reasons which were not for the benefit of An Post or the people.</P>
    <P>I thank my Fine Gael colleague for allowing me time to speak.  I am sorry I did not have more time but I hope the Minister, whom I am glad to see has arrived, heard some of the points I made and I hope that is the way he will approach the position of An Post.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan) Seamus Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators who participated in the debate.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Lyons, has told me very briefly of the Senators who spoke.  I appreciate the points made and will study them very carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I would like to put the facts before Senators, as presented to me <Col N="1460" /> by An Post.  The company is in a serious financial position and there is a need for urgent action to restore the company to profitability.  The company lost £3.6 million in 1989 and an estimated £10 million last year.  On current postal rates, An Post would lose £16 million this year and incur accelerating losses in the years ahead.  Unless remedial measures are taken, An Post will be insolvent in 1992. The main reasons for An Post's problems are increasing operational costs, low mail volume growth and competition from modern telecommunications services and couriers.  Overall costs will have risen by 21 per cent between 1987 and 1991 while revenue will have increased by only 11 per cent in the same period.  It is clear that An Post face a financial crisis.</P>
    <P>An Post considered this crisis and announced proposals to redress the situation and return the company to financial health.  The programme which the company announced has the objective of achieving £24 million savings by 1995. The main features of An Post's cost saving proposals include the following: single daily deliveries nationwide; rationalisation of the sub-post office network by closing 550 sub-offices &mdash; there are, 1,955 sub-offices in the current network; the provision of 200,000 roadside letter boxes; retitling and redundancy at some 50 of the company's own 95 post offices and closure of the central sorting office and its replacement by a new modern mail processing centre.</P>
    <P>As regards retitling and redundancy at some 50 of the company's own 95 post offices, I heard on radio recently a list of 25 areas.  It would be a pity if the view was formed that these offices were to be closed down.  I want to state quite openly and solidly that these 25 post offices are not being closed.  They are being retitled but there will be some redundancies.  The offices will be operated on a contract basis in a more commercial way than is currently possible.  There will not be any closures.  This is the list I heard on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;; Athenry, Ballinrobe, Ballyhaunis, Ballymote, Belturbet, Boyle, Cahir, Caherciveen, Carrickmacross, <Col N="1461" /> Cashel, ,Castleblayney, Clifden, Clonakilty, Clones, Cootehill, Curragh Camp, Kildare, Kilrush, Kinsale, Loughrea, Macroom, Muine Bheag, Rathluirc, Roscrea and Youghal.  I want to make it quite clear that that is the list I heard on radio.  It would be a pity if there were any proposal from An Post to close these offices.  They propose to have redundancies in the ordinary way and to change their method of operation to a contract basis.  I want to make that clear because there was considerable misinformation on that point.</P>
    <P>These proposals reflect An Post considerations that if rationalisation is to be effective substantial savings will have to be made in the area of mail delivery as about 75 per cent of the company's business is in the mail service and delivery is approximately 65 per cent of mail costs. Unfortunately, a feature of rationalisation and modernisation is a reduction in the workforce and, in An Post's proposals, would result in 1,500 job losses or 19 per cent of its total workforce.  I understand that £20 million is paid in overtime by the company.  I know that the company plan, as I do, to have a very close look at that.  Early retirement and severance terms will be negotiated and it is expected that these job reductions will be effected voluntarily.  An Post's proposals will involve capital expenditure of £64 million over the next five years.  This figure includes the capital expenditure that the company would incur in the normal course, such as vehicle replacement, computers and buildings.  Capital expenditure specific to the proposals is mainly for the provision of roadside letter boxes and a new letter mail processing centre at Naas Road, Dublin.  The company would have to borrow some £50 million to fund this capital programme. According to An Post, with full implementation of its proposals they would expect to be back in financial health by 1995.</P>
    <P>An Post simply must return to financial health and it is clear that significant savings and some paid are required to do this.</P>
    <P>I had discussions with An Post on its <Col N="1462" /> recovery proposals.  I have instructed the company to continue its negotiations with staff representatives with the clear objective of effecting a recovery in the company's financial position.  However, I am seriously concerned about possible social effects on rural communities of the proposals to close sub-post offices and the provision of 200,000 roadside letter boxes.</P>
    <P>I have, therefore, instructed An Post to review these aspects of the company's proposals in the light of a study which the Government are asking the National Economic and Social Council to conduct of the socio-economic implications of the proposals, including an examination of alternative possibilities for increased revenue at the sub-post offices, hardship alleviating measures and other options. Pending the outcome of this study and its consideration, I have required An Post not to proceed with these two aspects.  I will, of course, continue to monitor these and other aspects of An Post's recovery proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Most parliamentarians had the same view when they received from An Post the recent proposals to tear apart the service of An Post as we knew it.  Members of the Communications Workers' Union have outlined to me their very real concerns.  I have not had time to assess in detail the Minister's proposals but I have one very serious concern about them.  I share the Minister's anxiety and concern about the closure of sub-post offices and the provision of the 200,000 roadside letter boxes, but I am worried about the Minister's thinking in asking An Post to consider implementation of cost saving proposals. I would like a guarantee from the Minister that this will not result in An Post looking for savings in the area of additional job losses.  I am glad the Minister has indicated that that is not the case. Many workers in the communications area and An Post will be very relieved to hear that.  There is a clear understanding that we need to create savings and many workers will be concerned about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Politically it would be an unsavoury <Col N="1463" /> decision to close the sub-post offices and it would have a detrimental effect on the social fabric of rural Ireland.  Nevertheless we do not want them to turn around and say since we have not been able to make the savings by closing sub-post offices we will now try to achieve the savings by eliminating jobs in An Post. The Minister has indicated that that is not the thinking but I would welcome a guarantee from him in that regard.</P>
    <P>The proposals have been a slap in the face for workers in An Post.  I do not know of any group of workers who have been so pliable and amenable to proposals to change and so ready to make a sacrifice in favour of their company.  They have, over the last number of years, had agreements on job losses and voluntary redundancy schemes.  They went along with proposals which were unacceptable to many of them but they accepted them in the interest of creating a viable, profitable company.  The way this plan was thrust upon them so suddenly was utterly unacceptable.  I want to put on record that I welcome the Minister's intervention and the fact that the main thrust of the proposals has been set aside. I hope we do not think that the financial health of the company can be achieved at the cost of the jobs of those workers who are committed to making An Post viable.</P>
    <P>In this day and age we must consider their position in a European context and in the context of our huge emigration. We will always have more inward than outward mail.  This is the reality and because of that it will be very difficult to get our costings correct.  We are on the extremity of Europe and, in that sense, we are disadvantaged.  The Minister will be aware of discussions which have taken place recently at European level and of the consensus for a uniform postal service. There can be no question of a lesser service being available or a service which does not have the same quality in one country as opposed to another.  Where one country might be more disadvantaged than others, perhaps Europe should be prepared to subsidise their <Col N="1464" /> postal service.  I did not hear the earlier part of the Minister's speech and I wonder if that has been addressed.  There is a consensus in Europe that in disadvantaged areas the postal service needs to be supported and subvented through European Funds in order to ensure that there is a quality uniform postal service available through Europe.  I think that is <i>sine qua non.</i>  We need to address that fact.</P>
    <P>I am glad we have not allowed what would have been a catastrophic set of proposals in terms of our social fabric and of the morale of workers in the postal service.  I welcome the Minister's intervention and the fact that he has indicated that he does not see the savings which An Post hopes to achieve being achieved through further redundancies; by that I mean more than those outlined in their set of proposals.</P>
    <P>In these kinds of negotiations nobody puts the real deal on the table at the beginning.  The question must be asked: did An Post intend implementing this set of proposals?  They were so utterly unrealistic that I do not think they had the slightest notion of implementing them.  We should not feel we can sit back now and take it easy because the implementation of the reduced set of proposals will create serious hardship for the workers who have given generously to help An Post retain some level of financial viability.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say if he believes the postal service can become profitable? How much of it is a social service and how much of it is a profitable business?  Are we not moving more and more towards electronic mail?  The more we move towards electronic mail and towards instant communications the more we take from the potential business development of An Post.</P>
    <P>I hope the changes which are proposed, and which I welcome, do not mean a deterioration and a worsening of the proposals which had already been on the table in regard to job losses and redundancies.</P>

      <P>Time wasting by Senator O'Toole is nothing new.  We should get to this substantive debate even if it is a short debate.  Statements of ten minutes will not resolve any of the problems in the Middle East or indeed throughout the world.  I am disappointed that there is not even one reporter here this evening to listen to what should be of major importance to the media.  Of course, the media are more worried about getting foreign experts to discuss the war in the Middle East than they are listening to people in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am disappointed at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This short debate is taking place at a time when we hear the media gurus talking about the land war.  One would swear they were just going to drive through a desert and that there would not be carnage.  They speak about the ground <Col N="1466" /> war as initially the American generals spoke about KIAs.  It was not until people inquired what a KIA was that they discovered it meant &ldquo;killed in action&rdquo;, in other words a human being was killed. They were referring to tanks, guns and KIAs in the same breath and with the same emphasis.  Now when they speak about the ground war they are not talking about the horrific consequences that would ensue should there be a ground war in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia or Iraq.</P>
    <P>There are people in this country who, for many years, have criticised the wearing of the poppy and there are others who have worn the poppy with pride.  The poppy was worn because of the hundreds of thousands of people who were killed in the poppy fields of Flanders &mdash; this was an area of muck and dirt in the 1914-1918 War.  What happened in the poppy fields of Flanders would be miniscule in terms of the carnage that could occur on the deserts, hills and valleys of the Middle East over the next couple of weeks.  In the short time we have here this evening all we can do is appeal to those who have power to give every chance to the peace proposals that are on the table at present, which are made in good faith by the USSR to Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, who relayed them to Saddam Hussein, the President of Iraq.  Initially the response from the British and the Americans was that these suggestions of a peaceful resolution did not go far enough but, hopefully, now they are beginning to realise that unless they are given every chance there will be carnage in that area, the likes of which the world has never seen before.</P>
    <P>This is a short debate and we have no real power, we have no means of conveying to Saddam Hussein that now is the time for him to get out of Kuwait. There must be unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait and it is time we suggested to the Americans and the British that they do not start the ground war before every effort for a peaceful resolution to this terrible conflict is pursued to the bitter end.  Unfortunately the United Nations has been eliminated from the peacemaking process in the region in the <Col N="1467" /> future, and it would appear that the running is now being made by two member states of the United Nations &mdash; the US and Britain.  Unfortunately the United Nations did not insist that every person who went into that area under United Nations resolutions, did not wear the green beret and the khaki uniform of the United Nations and that they would be the direct responsibility of the United Nations as we saw in Lebanon when Major-General Callaghan, an Irish soldier of renown, who wore the United Nations uniform with pride, controlled forces from all over the world in a peacekeeping role.</P>
    <P>It is different now in Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.  We no longer hear the American generals saying they are carrying out precision bombing any more.  We do not see the precision bombing where things go wrong but they are now admitting that mistakes are made and that civilians can be taken out &mdash;&ldquo;taken out&rdquo; means killed &mdash; but they will never forget the carnage.  They have suggested that bombs have gone astray and that civilians have been killed.  They have suggested that air-raid shelters have been bombed, but they were not air-raid shelters; rather they were places for information gathering and information divulgence.</P>
    <P>In the short time that is available here to us tonight I appeal to anybody who has power in that area to give as much time as possible to the latest proposals on the table, particularly the proposals from the USSR, and to give them a chance to work.  People have written off the USSR in the last couple of months because of internal problems, but we must not forget that the USSR played a very vital role in the politics of the Middle East over the past number of years.  The USSR is probably the only major country that has not poured arms, chemical or otherwise, into the area.  There is not a western nation, except Ireland, that has not poured arms or chemical weapons into this area.  Give the USSR peace plan a chance.  We can do no more here tonight than ask the people in power to consider the carnage <Col N="1468" /> that will ensue from the ground war if the allies go into Kuwait or Iraq.</P>
    <P>We also must look to the future.  Very severe difficulties will confront the world if Iraq or Kuwait are over-run.  The Kurds will not be satisfied.  That could bring Turkey, Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran into conflict and the Shi'ites as against the Sunni's.  What is the position of Jordan? Jordan lies in between and is in a very difficult situation.  The Palestinians are suffering in this Middle East conflict.  The Israelis are playing a major role by not confronting anybody in the area and while they are looking for a resolution to the problems of Iraq and Kuwait and talking about the illegal annexation of Kuwait by Iraq, they are invading Southern Lebanon; they are invading another country.</P>
    <P>You cannot start a war against a noncombatant nation without having the nations of the world saying you are wrong.  This House has addressed the situation in the Middle East more than any House of Parliament in Europe, and we should appeal to everybody in this area to give the current peace initiative a chance and not escalate this war into the carnage Europe faced in 1914-18.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Our position is very simple.  We have subscribed to and we support the United Nations Charter and all its resolutions.  That is all we, as members of the United Nations and as a small nation, can do because unless we have an international rule of law that is respected, upheld and supported world order will not survive and our future will be murky.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should have had a debate on neutrality before we signed the Charter in 1955.  However, it is not relevant at this stage and it can only be looked on as a red herring.  It is important that we confront the major issue of whether we are part of the United Nations and if we want to uphold the Charter and the ideals of the United Nations.  Those who would now like to have consciences find a vehicle for their anti-American expressions and, in doing so, become part of the band of Saddam Hussein who, <Col N="1469" /> some people would lead you to think, was one of the angels as white as the driven snow.  That is an extraordinary situation because if you read the newspapers today you will see horrific accounts of the on-going torture, and brutality to which the population of Kuwait have been subjected since 2 August 1990.  It is not sufficient to say that the Americans or the 48 nations who make up the allied forces are a very significant addition to the region.  A small token force from a small country in that region which has not got great power, waged war against Russia for a number of years.  It is important that the rights of small nations are protected and the only way to do that is through the EC.  There is no point saying that all this brutality and inflicting hardship and death on the civilian population is one-sided.  In a war nothing is one-sided.  It is unfortunate that so many defenceless citizens who do not have a say in the policies of their Governments are affected.  I am struck with horror at the prospect of so many innocent people being subjected to such organised terror by the regime of Saddam Hussein over the last number of months.</P>
    <P>This is the first time since the United Nations was established that a member state marched in, annexed a neighbouring state and called it their nineteenth province.  That is the first time a member of the United Nations had the effrontery to take over a smaller nation. We have indulged in the double think in many areas and we seem to be able to present this conflict as the result of United Nations action.  It should go out loud and clear that we, as a small country, are prepared, in so far as resources allow, to support the ideals of the Charter.</P>
    <P>When the EC was established the underlying philosophy of the founding fathers was that they should have an association so that problems could be talked out without the necessity of going to war which was the traditional way of solving either border disputes or economic problems.  The United Nations should be seen to be able to solve this problem by more discussion and negotiation and the invaders persuaded to <Col N="1470" /> withdraw in accordance with the UN resolutions of 2 August 1990.  That is important. If we are to have a civilised world order there must be a body such as the United Nations to monitor the situation and present the world with a forum through which disputes can be ironed out without having the ordinary populations of different states inflicted with such hardship, carnage and loss.</P>
    <P>I hope we will see a very early solution. I hope the Iraqi Government, even at this late hour, will decide to withdraw or surrender or whatever is required to comply with the United Nations Resolution. Clearly, there must be very few people in the world who can support the action of a large and powerful nation like Iraq in annexing a friendly neighbouring country in such fashion.  I hope the view of this House would be that we uphold the Charter of the United Nations and we support it to the best of our ability in accordance with the terms of Resolution 678 of 29 November which asked the member states to support the effort and the call for peace and the withdrawal of invading forces from Kuwait.  I lend my voice also to a plea to the President of Iraq to bring about a situation where there can be an end to the unfortunate suffering and the hardship that obviously is being inflicted on so many innocent civilian population in those countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Since our debate on this subject a few weeks ago events have moved on.  I think the visual images we were all so attracted to some weeks ago are perhaps fading in our memory and we are not as all attracted on an hour-by-hour basis to see people maimed and bombed, albeit in a very abstract way where we do not actually see the flesh and blood of the people who are killed and injured in war.  We tended to view it on our television screens on cross wires and saw no real result except in terms of physical buildings etc being blown apart without really seeing what must be devastating injuries to the people on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the figures last night I was <Col N="1471" /> surprised to learn that some 85,000 sorties had up to them been flown by allied bombers into Kuwait and Iraq.  If one looks at the volume of bombs dropped, if one person per sortie was killed, that represents something like 85,000 people. I would suspect that the devastation on the ground in Iraq in numbers of people who are already dead and maimed must be absolutely horrific.  I do not believe the figures emanating from Iraq, show us the type of devastation in terms of human life.  Nevertheless the answer to this problem rests with Saddam Hussein and his grouping in Baghdad.  On the basis of the plan that is proposed by Moscow, and the response by the Americans and the British in particular, it seems unlikely that the Russian peace plan will be accepted, and I think that is correct.</P>
    <P>My view is that Saddam Hussein is a brutal dictator who has no regard for the lives of the people of any country, not least of his own people.  His track record over the past number of years in the decimation of the Kurdish people in Iraq and putting his own country through the war with Iran speak volumes.  It is not necessary to elucidate the type of individual we are trying to deal with.  I believe he cannot be seen to gain any possible victory in any shape or form out of this because if he did, it would make him a rallying point if he were to remain in power in the event of any troubles that may exist down the line.  If at this stage some back-tracking was to take place and some agreement was made that allowed him and his army to remain largely intact, I would have no doubt that it would only store up a problem which will have to be dealt with the in the future.  That would mean that the allied forces on the ground, in particular the American and British forces who make up the bulk of the non-Arab forces in the Gulf, will remain there for the next two, three, four or five years. There is no way in which they will be able to withdraw from the area given that threat that Saddam Hussein and his army will pose to his neighbours.</P>
    <P>We have seen his attempts in the launching of missile attacks on Israel to <Col N="1472" /> try to bring them into the conflict for the sole purpose of extending it throughout the whole Arab region, to involve and embroil every single Arab nation in this war, this holy war that he wants to see in the area.  The restraint from the Israeli point of view to date has been extraordinary and very commendable.  If there is to be some sort of a middle-of-the-road peace formula that falls short of the UN Resolutions agreed, I do not see Israel at that stage sitting back and not proceeding to retaliate against Iraq for the atrocities committed against their people in the past few weeks.  Where will that leave all of us throughout the world, and in particular throughout the Gulf area and the entire Arab region?</P>
    <P>I cannot believe that anything short of the removal of Saddam Hussein as the leader of the Iraqi people is the way forward. He is the one, in my view, with whom the buck stops, not the generals or the captains or whoever is carrying out the atrocities against the Kuwaiti people. It is Saddam Hussein who must be tried for the war crimes committed.  I have no doubt about that and I believe that must be the way forward.</P>
    <P>The Palestinian question has been bubbling under the surface throughout this war and this is something that will have to be addressed by the UN.  I do not think anybody in the world denies that but it cannot be seen in the light of giving Saddam Hussein a victory, linked directly to raising the Palestinian question.  That is not the way forward in terms of international diplomacy, of the international rule of law and the international standing of the UN.  It is paramount that the UN emerges from this conflict in a strengthened position.  That will be the greatest deterrent to any country in the world that may hold aggressive designs on smaller nations for whatever reasons, be they strategically important militarily or strategically important economically.  The best way of enforcing that deterrent is the strength of the UN as a structure.</P>
    <P>Once the war is over and it is clearly seen to end on the terms of the UN Resolutions, there is a will throughout the world &mdash; certainly in Europe, and in <Col N="1473" /> that context Europe can be the forum to assert itself to bring the Palestinian question to the centre table &mdash; to have this problem sorted out once and for all. The European Community and the Ministers involved should keep a close watching brief and should be ready to move in this area at the end of this war. That must happen if there is to be stability in the region.  There would be movement in that area if we were to see some serious addressing of this problem once and for all to end the tensions that exist in those regions.  If they are not addressed we will only limp from one major crisis in the Middle East to another.</P>
    <P>There are many issues running in tandem in this debate.  The outcome of the war and the making of the peace will be as difficult as the fighting of the war itself.  I reject out of hand and regret the anti-Americanism that seems to emanate in this country.  I do not know and I cannot satisfy myself what is its basis.</P>

That is my view.  In particular this country more than any other country, has a great debt to the American people, in particular in the last decade, for the way Irish people have been looked after in that great state and the attempts by American Congressmen and Senators to extend the quotas to this country in their efforts to give Irish people legal status in America.  It is not a simple solution.  It is not a simple problem.  Where do we turn to if we do not turn in some direction?  I am not saying that all American foreign <Col N="1474" /> policies have been perfect throughout the world, but there are a number of areas where we must realise that without America we would not today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thought you were going to tell me I had three minutes left.  I conclude, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, by saying that the American forces are the largest force in the Gulf in terms of people.  They are the ones who will suffer. Unquestionably, they are going to have the greatest casualties if a ground war breaks out.  In my view they have much more right than most people to want to bring an end to this conflict.  They will face the biggest casualties and they are the ones who have most to lose in defending the position on behalf of the UN and the British forces in that context as well. My wish is that Saddam Hussein sees the light and unconditionally withdraws from Kuwait and abides by all the UN resolutions to bring a speedy end to this war.</P>

      <P>In the last month we have learned a lot of new terminology.  We have learned many new euphemisms for war, death and killing.  We have AAA and KIA, target rich environments, collateral damage, and everything except blood and gore and what is really happening out there.  It is an obscenity. Everybody with whom I have discussed the matter sees it as an obscenity that the killing and deaths of thousands of people has been turned into an arcane game on our television screens.  That is all it has been.  Who would ever have believed we could sit in our livingrooms and hear a reporter tell us: &ldquo;I have just seen a Cruise <Col N="1475" /> missile go down the street&rdquo; or that horrific scene where a senior army officer of the so-called allied forces, who are supposedly fighting in our names, points out &ldquo;the luckiest man in Iraq&rdquo;&mdash; the one who missed being bombed at that time. I would like to put on the record of the House that there are no lucky people in Iraq.  They have lived for years and years under the rule of one who is no more that a monster, a man who has been responsible for the deaths of as many of his own people as people outside.  I oppose this war but that does not mean I support this man who claims to be an elected leader and who annexed a neighbouring friendly state.  I want to make that clear.  America does not enter into it as far as I am concerned at this time.  I have plenty of views to offer but I do not have the time at this stage.</P>
      <P>When we discussed this on the previous occasion I pointed out my objection.  My objection is not against the use of force. I accept that there is a time for the use of force.  I said then, and I say now, we were pre-emptive in the UN &mdash; and I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; because we are part of the UN &mdash; in taking that decision.  I said that, if we had a UN force under UN control with a UN decision-making process, then I would support it.  Of those people who said to me the last time that this was a UN force, may I remind them about what has happened in the meantime.</P>
      <P>We have seen the incredible scene of the Secretary General of the UN, Perez de Cuellar, asking that certain things not take place, that certain things not be done in his name and in the name of the UN. We are looking at an army out of control and it is out of control because it is not being controlled by those whom it is supposed to represent.  There is no UN control in this army.  The UN Resolution is merely being used as an attempt to brutalise further those unlucky people in Iraq and other places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make no case for Saddam Hussein.  I do not need anyone to stand up and tell me how bad he is.  I do not think there is anybody in this House who would make a case for the man or what he stands for, <Col N="1476" /> how he got into power or how he retained power.  I will not go through all the support he got in the western world over a long period of time.  The fact is, he is there.  The fact is that the allied forces are out there supposedly working in the name of the UN and supposedly working on our behalf.  I would like to put on record that what is happening is not happening in my name.  We should say it is not happening in our name.</P>
    <P>This war was unnecessary when it took place.  This war is now continuing in a way that shortly we will be seeing the body bags being used.  Is it not extraordinary that despite all the sorties, thousands and thousands of bombing raids, and with all the information available to us, with the satellites in the sky, with all the information flow, nobody has been able to hazard the most remotest guess as to the level of killing, of deaths and maiming in Iraq?  In our name we see the support structures of ordinary civilians being destroyed.  They are unlucky enough to have probably the most brutal ruler in the world at this time, but we now punish them further by bombing their water supplies, sewage treatment plants and in a sense making their lives worse than ever they have been before. Did we think when we discussed this before that we were going to have those forces in our name go forward and bomb civilians, because that is what is happening? We are killing civilians and we are destroying their support services.  We need to speak out on that.  It is not an anti-American thing at this point; that is a debate for another day.  This is about people.  This is about dying.  This is about killing, and this is happening in our name.</P>
    <P>I have to conclude at this point to hand over to Senator Norris.  I would like to place on the record that I find it an obscenity that we have made an arcane game of the deaths of hundreds, perhaps thousands, at this time that we do not know.  I find it a further obscenity that this is happening in our name and that these so-called allied troops are an army out of control inasmuch as it is not controlled by the UN.  We should be the ones to shout stop, to end this madness once <Col N="1477" /> and for all and to reassess where we are going, to put in place structures we can all support and in that way seek the implementation of the UN resolutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first of all, to agree with what my colleague, Senator O'Toole, has said.  I start with the observation that war is always a confession of failure.  It is a failure in which there is no question of doubt we are involved, no matter what is being said from various sections of this House.  Of course we are involved.  We were complicit in the regime of Saddam Hussein, although people from this side of the House warned about it.  I remember challenging, for example, the beef deals.  I remember being told on numerous occasions that what was being suggested might be a moral point of view in terms of foreign policy but it was not practical.  I would like to ask the Government side how practical they see their support of Saddam Hussein now?  Fat chance they have of getting their £174 million back. If they pursued the moral line we would be £174 million richer today, and I recommend that observation to the House for consideration in future.  Let us as a small country really be neutral and let us pursue for the first time a really independent and moral line.</P>
      <P>I would have to say also that Senator O'Toole is right when he talked about the obscenity of war.  A few short weeks ago people were very gung-ho.  I remember thinking at that time of a poem that came from the First World War.  I cannot remember it exactly but it is where the poet says, if you could hear the breath come gargling from his forth-corrupted lungs you would not tell to boys ardent for some desperate glory, the old lie, <i>Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori,</i> but this is the kind of line that we were being fed a few short weeks ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have to say that our complicity in this and the fact that planes are being refuelled at Shannon makes it very difficult for some of us to stomach the oily hypocrisies of the Department of Foreign Affairs and in particular our Minister.  It is perfectly clear that Saddam Hussein <Col N="1478" /> was supported.  The people who are being punished are the people of Iraq who had very little say in electing this man.  They are being flattened, they are being bombed into dirt.  We have seen on our television screens on the one hand army personnel allegedly of the United Nations, but we really know they are of a small group of power hungry nations who are involved in this, talking about it being a party, but at least thank God for Ramsey Clark, a distinguished American public servant, who has pointed out what kind of party it is.  We have seen people howling like beasts on the television screens, but their cries are the cries not of animals but of human beings grieving for people flattened into pulp in air raid shelters.</P>
    <P>We are implicated in this.  I would like to suggest that perhaps the Government would take a decision to send relief supplies of medicine into Iraq to help these people.  I say that despite the fact that I take issue with a number of my colleagues here this evening who have spoken about Israel.  Are the Israelis really so unique?  Are they to be the only people on earth never to be allowed a homeland, driven out 2,000 years ago from this part of the world, persecuted in every single country, including this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to point out that the Israelis at least have been restrained and I hope they continue to be restrained.  I sincerely hope that they do not yield to the temptation to go in now.  I hope this message gets back to Jerusalem and Tel Aviv: for the Israelis to go in now to humiliate Iraq and flatten it even further would be an obscenity and would lose them the measure of respect they have obtained.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1479" /> I would like to ask a couple of questions. Will there be an investigation after this war is over into those firms who supplied the materials to Saddam Hussein, who armed him?  Will there be any investigation into the firms that helped him to manufacture their super gun?  I know that the firm of Sheffield Forgemasters has to a certain extent been exonerated because they drew to the attention of the British Government precisely what they were doing.  They did this through their local MP and a year later he drew it again to the attention of the Department of Trade and Industry, and the British Government turned a blind eye to it.  This gun, taller than St. Paul's Cathedral, 1,000 millimetre gun is pointed at Tel Aviv.  It seems to me extraordinary that they can get away with this kind of thing.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a final point.  It shows with what a catastrophic lack of seriousness we take this issue that speakers are reduced to five paltry minutes.  We talk rubbish, we bleat daily in this House, yet we fail to confront probably the most important issue this House has had to deal with in the last ten years.  We are facing into a possible third world war with nuclear implications and here we are bleating away.</P>

      <P>It is inevitable whenever I follow Senator Norris, or sometimes precede him, that I find myself responding or perhaps anticipating.  He opened his remarks by talking about the amount of money this country had lost and that it was a matter that should be addressed.  I think a number of developing economies have lost money as a result of the Gulf War.  In fact, two of the biggest financial losers are two emerging eastern European countries, Poland and Czechoslovakia, Poland particularly, who took a very painful decision to support the UN resolution.  I was in Poland in September at the time this whole question was being debated and I can assure the House, and the Senator, that it was an extremely painful decision for them, a fledgling democracy, a country that is on the verge of bankruptcy.  I do not think it is fair to <Col N="1480" /> single out some of the better off countries and suggest that there was something wrong about them.  There were countries that took very painful economic decisions.</P>
      <P>The second point, and I think it should be firmly stitched into the record of the House in this debate, is that the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs has been a source of moderation throughout this debate, a man who has built up a fund of goodwill towards this country.  He has built on the relationship there is between many of the countries in the Arab world and this country.  I do not think it is accurate or true to suggest that the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs has in any way been contributing to the mass murder that is going on in Iraq or that we are in any way acquiescing in it.</P>
      <P>As we speak this evening 500,000 men are poised on the border of Kuwait waiting for the political word, as it is put.  I do not want to diminish the seriousness of this debate.  When we spoke some weeks back on this very subject, there were Members, particularly on the other side of the House, who said that, in the event of another debate, there would be an about-turn, that people would be pointing the finger and that there would be suggestions of I told you so.  I said then, and I say it now, that Saddam Hussein has to be stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are periods in history where men such as Saddam Hussein refuse to listen to all logic, all argument, all discussion, all negotiation.  For a long time I supported the idea of extending sanctions. Of course, he was bound at some stage in the future to realise the folly of his invasion of Kuwait when he saw his people and his economy being slowly drained dry by the UN sanctions.  He has seen God knows how many thousands of his own people bombed into kingdom come over the last couple of weeks and he did not really make any great moves towards peace until 24 or 48 hours ago. I believe those developments are to be encouraged.  For the first time Saddam Hussein and his revolutionary council referred not to the nineteenth province of Iraq, but to Kuwait.  They stated, <Col N="1481" /> admittedly with a lot of conditions attached, that they were now prepared to withdraw from Kuwait.</P>
    <P>In that context, the Soviet initiative, which has been referred to here, should be encouraged; it is to be applauded. These peace moves by the USSR are an attempt to secure long term stability on their southern border rather than any suggestion of Soviet expansionism of the type experienced in the Cold War.  I think they are admirable aims and objectives. Iran, similarly, has been attempting to negotiate a peace with its most bitter enemy, an enemy with whom they fought eight hard years of war.</P>
    <P>When we were discussing whether we should have a debate of this nature, I said that war aims change in the course of war, and this war is no different.  I asked the question which has been raised by many of those on the anti-war side &mdash; and I refer to that loose coalition which is in every country now and its representative of the broadest possible spectrum.  I do not necessarily believe that people who are against the war are to be derided.  We are all against war.  Are we to accept that the coalition forces are covertly extending the objectives of the original UN Resolution 678, that they are not content with the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait but that they intend to push on into Iraq and, allied with their bombing campaign, reduce that country to medieval times and topple its leader?  I must say that, having asked a rhetorical question, I find it impressive that the Arab members of the multinational force have not yet tumbled to this subterfuge, if subterfuge it is.  I must accept that the coalition forces are adhering, at least up to the present, to the letter and spirit of the UN Resolution.</P>
    <P>It is important that we on this side of the Atlantic should realise that America's aims are not Europe's aims in this conflict. The legacy of bitterness which this war will engender, and is engendering among Muslims, could have severe repercussions for Europe and indeed for this country in any post-war settlement.  It is salutary to remind the House that all the acts of terrorism that have taken place, <Col N="1482" /> that have been directed at America and have been anti-American in character have not taken place on American soil but on the European continent.  The most vivid and appalling example was the Lockerbie disaster.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is vitally important that Ireland, as a member state of the European Community, being conscious of the growing relationship developing between Muslim countries and Europe and the relationship that will develop even further in the light of immigration laws that are currently being debated for implementation post-1992, should be cultivating a stronger relationship with the Arab countries than heretofore.  Here I believe Ireland, with its proud record, a record that is similar in many ways to that of many of the Arab countries &mdash; a history of oppression and colonialism &mdash; would find sympathy in many Arab countries. In fact, I believe this is the case already; and I would like to think that this awareness of Ireland's history helped in some small measure to effect the release of Brian Keenan and also to ensure that the employees in the PARC Hospital and the Irish hostages generally were looked after.</P>
    <P>This House should address the reality of Saddam Hussein's status among the disenfranchised and disadvantaged in the Arab world.  It is a question that has been shied away from.  We have heard from all sides of this House about the despotic nature of Saddam Hussein, about how he has sat passively by while his underlings have killed the Kurdish people by poison and chemical gas, how he has sat passively by, along with his revolutionary council, and permitted the kind of figures being quoted in relation to air missions that have obviously resulted in civilian casualties.  Yet, for many thousands of Arabs and Muslims, Saddam Hussein is a hero.  Sometimes we on this side of the world do not always understand or empathise with the Arab psyche.  A man who in western eyes is akin to a monster, who engaged in an eight year war, which he started, and then gave back everything he had gained at the end of it despite the loss of life and economic damage to his <Col N="1483" /> country, yet this man can still generate frenzied demonstrations on the streets of Amman, Tunis and Morocco.</P>
    <P>My main aim in making a contribution tonight was to put on record that, as we hopefully move towards a post war settlement, we in Ireland should consider strongly identifying with the difficulties that are going to face many of the countries in the Middle East and that we, as a small country, non-aligned but within the European framework, can be an influence for good.  Finally, I can only pray, like all the Members of this House, that the peace initiatives, which have now started shakily, will flower into something more positive and that we will see peace in the Middle East.</P>

      <P>In many ways this war was predictable.  It was clearly signalled long before it took place.  It was made possible because of the arming of Iraq and because of the development of the economy in Iraq.  Many countries, including this one, made their contribution to that development. I imagine that Senator Norris was part of a very small minority who objected to dealing with Iraq in those days.  The developments which have taken place since, of course, have proved how right he was; but he certainly was in a very small minority.  I would imagine he would not have got very much support from the public for the very far-seeing position he adopted at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today is the 35th day of the war.  Whole areas of Baghdad have been pretty well totally destroyed.  Innocent civilians have been killed and the world economic outlook has been seriously damaged by the events that have taken place during these past 35 days.  I want to say at the outset that I believe Iraq's behaviour in this whole matter has been totally outrageous. Their behaviour in the lead into it has been absolutely appalling.  The way they treated the Kurds has been terrible. The way they moved in and invaded Kuwait, the way they have carried on in that country since they have invaded Kuwait and indeed the manner in which they have tried to grab at anything they <Col N="1484" /> could to try to involve other countries in this whole business has been appalling.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the reality is that, as we speak, the ground war seems just about to begin &mdash; at least that is the very clear impression coming across from the news bulletins this evening.  It is a terrifying prospect.  I believe that if the ground war starts the Americans will win it.  I believe there will be terrible casualties. I believe that many more innocent civilians in Iraq will be killed, there will be heavy casualties on the allied side and, of course, many of the Iraqi army will be killed.</P>
    <P>In addition to that there is an appalling threat to the environment.  The consequences for environmental pollution arising from the damage and destruction of this war are certainly poorly understood by many people.  Indeed, I suspect that many people do not want to contemplate them for reasons one can easily understand.  I believe Iraq has an obligation and should now withdraw immediately from Kuwait.  That is one solution. The consequences of not doing it, given the way the thing is developing, are frightening.</P>
    <P>However, it is no harm for us to remind ourselves that the UN resolution simply talks in terms of Iraq leaving Kuwait and that is the size of it.  It does not give a mandate for the allies to go in and get involved in the destruction of Iraq and to set about removing Saddam Hussein from power.  I am beginning to form the impression that that is now, as it were, being taken on slowly in bits and pieces onto the agenda.  That is what I read between the words in the news bulletins coming into this country.  That is something that we should be very clear about and should leave nobody in any doubt as to our position in relation to that eventuality taking place.</P>
    <P>At this late stage &mdash; we are really on the brink &mdash; diplomacy should be used to the fullest extent and we should use every little bit of influence we have.  I certainly agree with what Senator Lanigan said earlier, that our influence in this matter is fairly minimal but to the extent that we have influence we should use it as far as <Col N="1485" /> possible at the UN and in the European Community to try to give diplomacy a chance.  That is the last hope of averting a really appalling prospect.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the adoption of high moral grounds or higher moral attitudes will do anything to help provide a solution.  Our first emphasis should be on trying to provide solutions not trying to apportion blame.  For that reason I have no ambition to involve myself in anti-American rhetoric.  I have my own reservations about the way the Americans have carried on in many different areas, but I do not think it serves any useful purpose for Irish people at this stage to begin American-bashing.  The whole emphasis now should be to try to find a solution: that should be our number one priority.  I cannot see how attacking Americans can contribute to a solution.</P>
    <P>The world will exist after this war. There will be a future for the Middle East.  Now we should think very hard what the effects of the various options are likely to be on the future.  If we are talking of a wholesale destructive war with enormous numbers of casualties, the world community and the Allies should ponder long and hard on what will be the effect of that over the next ten to 20 years.  We should remember the lessons history has taught us when it comes to wrongs; we known a bit about that.  The destruction which now seems likely will have a terrible effect in the longer-term on Middle Eastern politics.  That is something to which we should give a lot more attention.  The reality is that the Middle East is unstable at the best of times and what now seems likely to happen there will make a very poor situation a good deal worse.</P>
    <P>I accept that in this House there have been more debates on Middle East and world affairs than in the other House and in a number of other parliaments. However, I still feel that the Irish have very little interest in foreign policy and world affairs.  That is true of Irish poliiticians; I am as good an example of this as anybody else.  I do not want to go around dishing out blame about this.  The <Col N="1486" /> reality is there are not any votes in foreign affairs, but they have tremendous implications for all of us.  We are all part of the world community and it would be a great mistake if we were to forget that.  I know we will be setting up a foreign affairs committee, and that is to be welcomed. The sooner it is established the better and I hope this House will have an involvement in it.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that we might go a bit further and perhaps invest money in providing for a study of peace, to see how peace can be generated and maintained and why the long term considerations are so important.  There are very valuable and important lessons to be learned from the rise of the peace movement in the North of Ireland and, more importantly, from the manner in which they have disappeared from the public eye in a very short period.  I support the Government investing in that kind of study and making contributions to develop ideas and structures which will help make the world a more peaceful place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to emphasise that the Government believe that the most urgent priority is to bring this war to an end on generally acceptable terms.  This priority arises from our concern, which is widely shared, that the loss of human life should be minimised.  At the same time, it is essential that Iraq comply with its international obligations as set out by the Security Council.</P>
      <P>The end of the war will not, however, come about simply because we wish it to be so or because we or anyone else appeal for a ceasefire.  There is only one way of ensuring that the war is ended and not postponed for a few weeks or months to be resumed later with even greater ferocity and even greater casualties.  That way is the compliance by Iraq with the relevant Security Council Resolutions, including, in particular withdrawal from Kuwait.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principles underlying Ireland's approach to the Gulf crisis were set out clearly in the Taoiseach's speech as well <Col N="1487" /> in the Dáil on 18th January last and in the speech by the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Seán Calleary, in the Seanad on 24 January last.  Ireland believes in the peaceful settlement of disputes between nations, and looks to the United Nations to maintain the rule of law in relations between states.</P>
    <P>We had hoped that the unprecedented international consensus against the invasion together with the implementation of sanctions would have been sufficient to secure a peaceful solution to the crisis.  In discussions within the European Community, Ireland has emphasised the priority of ending the war but that the crisis can be resolved only on the basis of the Security Council Resolutions. Frankly, I can see no room for negotiation on the substance of the resolutions. Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait and the Government of Kuwait.</P>
    <P>Ireland supports any initiative which has a reasonable chance of ending hostilities on the basis of full compliance by Iraq with the Security Council Resolutions, including withdrawal from Kuwait.  For any initiative to have a reasonable chance of success a necessary prerequisite is a commitment by the leadership of Iraq that it is prepared to implement Security Council resolution 660 adopted on 2 August 1990 and the subsequent resolutions.</P>
    <P>Let me remind Senators of the terms of that resolution.  Determining that there had been a breach of international peace and security as regards the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the Security Council:</P>
    <P>Condemned the invasion;</P>
    <P>Demanded &ldquo;that Iraq withdraw immediately and unconditionally all its forces to the positions in which they were located on 1 August 1990&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>Called upon Iraq and Kuwait to begin immediately intensive negotiations for the resolution of their differences and supported all efforts in this regard and especially those of the League of Arab States;</P>
    <P>Decided to meet again as necessary <Col N="1488" /> to consider further steps to ensure compliance with the resolutions.</P>
    <P>As we all know the Security Council adopted a further 11 resolutions culminating in Resolution 678 on 29 November 1990 which authorised the use of all necessary means to ensure compliance with Resolution 660 if Iraq had not done so on or before 15 January 1991.</P>
    <P>Ireland, with its partners in the Community, made every effort to persuade Iraq to draw back from the confrontation it had provoked.  However, every successive Community approach was rebuffed. Every other attempt to secure Iraqi compliance with the Security Council Resolutions before the outbreak of hostilities was equally rebuffed.  It is this obduracy on the part of the Iraqi leadership which has made war inevitable.</P>
    <P>Senators, with all Irish people, will have experienced the sense of relief which greeted the first reports from Baghdad last Friday containing the specific statement that Iraq was now prepared to co-operate in the implementation of Resolution 660.  There was no question about the joy of the people of Iraq itself at the announcement as we saw later that day on our television screens. However, almost immediately after those first reports came the news that the Iraqi proposal seemed to link withdrawal to a number of conditions.</P>
    <P>It is not clear exactly how many conditions have been attached to the declared readiness to withdraw.  I have counted eight.  Some are old, such as Israeli withdrawal from the Occupied Territories, some new, such as the cancellation of all debts owed by Iraq.  These conditions led to the rejection of the proposal by the leaders of the multinational forces since they were clearly not in conformity with the terms of Resolution 660. I know of the deep disappointment felt by Irish people; I can only guess at the feelings of the Iraqi people.</P>
    <P>Since 15 February there has been speculation that perhaps the Iraqi conditions are not really conditions at all. Perhaps, it has been argued, they are <Col N="1489" /> statements of the type of agenda or programme which Iraq would wish to see once withdrawal from Kuwait has been effected and the crisis has been settled. Unfortunately, at this stage such speculation is just that, speculation, and it would be difficult to offer an interpretation of Iraq's motives and intentions. The key to resolution of this issue, as indeed to resolution of the conflict as a whole, lies in Baghdad: the Iraqi leadership can make it perfectly clear that it agrees to full and complete withdrawal from Kuwait without asserting this with any conditions.</P>
    <P>In this context, the initiative taken late last week by the Soviet authorities is of potentially great interest.  Iraq's Foreign Minister, Mr. Tariq Aziz, visited Moscow on 18 February and had discussions with, among others, President Gorbachev. While we do not know the exact tenor of the appeal made by the Soviet Government to Iraq, we do know that President Gorbachev has again appealed to the Government of Iraq for a full and unconditional withdrawal of the Iraqi troops from Kuwait and the re-establishment of the sovereignty and legitimate government of that country in conformity with the relevant Security Council Resolutions. This appeal by President Gorbachev is welcome.  I hope Iraq heeds it.</P>
    <P>The Soviet Government have spoken of a &ldquo;serious diplomatic process&rdquo; rather than of &ldquo;loud and spectacular initiatives&rdquo;. Mr. Tariq Aziz was due back in Moscow today to convey President Saddam Hussein's reaction to the Soviet initiative.  He did not in fact travel.  The United Nations Security Council is awaiting these developments.  The Irish Government clearly support the appeal to the Iraqi Government for full and unconditional implementation of all the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council thus putting an end to the conflict and sparing new sufferings to the peoples of Iraq and Kuwait.</P>
    <P>The Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the European Community yesterday made a similar appeal.  The Twelve have reaffirmed their commitment to the sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity of all the countries of the region.  As regards the need to respect <Col N="1490" /> the territorial integrity of all the states of the region, there is, I believe, a need to remind some Members of this House why we are today considering the matter of a conflict in the Gulf.</P>
    <P>This crisis did not arise with the air attacks launched on Baghdad on the night of 16-17 January 1991.  It began on 2 August last year when Iraqi forces marched into Kuwait and less than a week later announced to the world that Kuwait no longer existed but should henceforth be regarded as the 19th province of Iraq. The war began with Iraq's invasion and purported annexation of a small neighbouring country.  The primary need therefore, I would repeat, is for Iraq to reconsider its defiance of the international community for over six months and its flagrant disregard for 12 Resolutions passed by the Security Council, whose decisions, as a member of the UN, it is obliged under the UN Charter to accept and carry out.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that dwelling on the effects or consequences rather than the roots of the crisis will contribute to the search for genuine peace.  These roots lie in the Iraqi aggression of 2 August last year and the Iraqi leadership bears full responsibility for the consequences of the crisis which it has provoked.</P>
    <P>Like all Members of this House the Government are saddened and concerned at reports of civilian casualties and at the risks to which civilians have been exposed.  The Secretary-General of the United Nations has pointed out that the physical dangers from the bombing attacks are compounded by the hazards to public health that are daily growing more acute in the absence of electricity and the shortage of clean water.  The implications for the innocent and especially vulnerable groups such as women, children and the elderly, are particularly disturbing.</P>
    <P>When this House last debated the Gulf on 24 January, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Seán Calleary, expressed the fervent hope of the Government that the conflict under way in the Gulf would not be prolonged and that efforts would be made to keep casualties to a minimum.  The longer the war goes on the greater becomes the <Col N="1491" /> danger that more civilians will be caught up in the violence.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that I share with all Members of this House and with all Irish people the profound sense of regret at the effect of this tragedy on the peoples of Kuwait and Iraq.  I believe that the best way to help them is to bring the war to a conclusion as soon as possible. It is, as I have said, in the hands of the Iraqi leadership to spare their own people and the other peoples in the region further misery and destruction by agreeing to withdraw from Kuwait in accordance with the Security Council Resolutions. The tragic deaths of Iraqi civilians last Wednesday only show the urgent necessity of such compliance.</P>
    <P>While I share the Secretary General's concern at civilian casualties which have resulted from bombing attacks, I think it is important to be clear that there is no reason to believe that civilians are the specific targets of such attacks.  We have heard assurances from the leaders of the multinational forces that the pilots engaged in the bombing attacks are under instructions to ensure minimum civilian casualties when carrying out their missions. We welcome these assurances. Naturally, we deplore the casualties and the damage that have occurred and hope that an early end to the war will minimise additional losses.</P>
    <P>The Government have set out very clearly the reasons they have decided to provide facilities at Shannon, if requested, to military aircraft of countries acting in pursuance of Resolution 678. In that resolution the UN Security Council repeated its earlier demands that Iraq comply fully with Resolution 660 and all subsequent relevant resolutions which, <i>inter alia</i>, required Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.  Paragraph 2 of the resolution authorised &ldquo;member states cooperating with the Government of Kuwait ... to use all necessary means to uphold and implement&rdquo; these resolutions and &ldquo;to restore international peace and security in the area&rdquo; unless Iraq complied on or before 15 January.  Paragraph 3 of Resolution 678 &ldquo;requests all States to provide appropriate support for the <Col N="1492" /> actions undertaken&rdquo; in pursuance of these aims.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach made clear in the Dáil on 18 January, our approach to any request for facilities takes account of this very specific request made by the UN Security Council, whose decisions, in accordance with the UN Charter, member states of the United Nations have agreed to accept and carry out.  The basis for the Government's approach to this question has not changed and we will continue to provide refuelling facilities and overflight permission if requested to aircraft of the multinational forces acting in pursuance of Resolution 678.</P>
    <P>In summary, this armed conflict could have been avoided entirely if Iraq had taken a decision to conduct its international relations in terms of the purposes and principles of the Charter. During a period of 5½ months after violating the Charter, by complying with the Security Council Resolutions, it could still have avoided the conflict.  The key to its ending even today lies in Baghdad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great pity when one makes a statement on the situation in the Gulf, labels are attached to whether one is pro or anti-United States or pro or anti-Israel.  I firmly believe that in their hearts, the sympathy of the majority of the Irish people lies in the same direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not for the first time a member of the United Nations has invaded a neighbouring country; on St. Patrick's Day, 1979, the USSR invaded Afghanistan; and Israel occupied the West Bank in the Gaza Strip.  Great atrocities were committed on these occasions.  United Nations Resolutions were passed requiring those countries to withdraw from those lands but there were no major debates on this issue in any of the European Parliaments.  However, that situation did not escalate, as is now happening in the Gulf.  The reason for this is that neither land was a major oil producing country.  If Kuwait was not a major oil producing country we would not have the war in the Gulf today.  It is an extremely strange war, with generals more qualified in public relations than in military operations.  I believe the media <Col N="1493" /> have a terrifying responsibility to bring to the ordinary citizens of the land the truth in so far as they can tell it.</P>
    <P>May I say to the Chair that I wish to share my time with Senator Naughten if that is in order.</P>
    <P>It would appear now that some of the allied forces are insisting that before the easing of hostilities Saddam Hussein must be removed from power.  The general impression is given that the United Nations forces are now on that line, but I do not think so.  That is the opinion of the United States and it seems to be the opinion of Great Britain.  It is certainly not the opinion of France or the USSR.</P>
    <P>I believe the world would be a better place if Saddam Hussein was not in power in Iraq or indeed in any other country, but I believe the United Nations forces should not await the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq.  I believe a peaceful settlement could be arrived at now because it would appear Iraq feel they are a beaten nation and they are now grasping at straws to try and come to some arrangement to sit down and discuss the matter.  If we had a cessation of hostilities, I suggest we could have a United Nations arms monitoring team sent to Iraq, just as we have the United Nations peacekeeping forces in other parts of the world.  In that way we would ensure that Iraq would not in the future do the same to any of its neighbouring countries.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator McMahon for sharing his time with me.  I know the time is very short for all of us and I appreciate very much the time he has given me.</P>
      <P>We all share the great sorrow of the punishment the Iraqi people are going through at present and the desperate loss of life.  Many of us visit hospital wards and see people fighting for their lives and we come along and see a television programme where people are just slaughtered and butchered in a very regrettable war.  We must extend our sympathies to the people who are suffering in Iraq.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past number of weeks we have all become very familiar with words like &ldquo;sorties&rdquo; and all the other war <Col N="1494" /> phrases which we hear on television daily. It was the night after the war began that we heard a commentator stating that there was a missile going down the street. It was so unreal and so unbelievable that it was very hard to grasp.  We have become familiar with words such as Scud missile and Patriot missile and all that goes with such weapons of war.  They are now a fact of life.</P>
    <P>As a country, we are right to support the stand taken in the UN and are right to support every effort to free the Kuwaiti people from the invasion by Iraq.  In listening to media commentators one would nearly be forgiven for thinking that it was the Americans who started this war.  May I remind the House that this war started in August when Kuwait was invaded by Saddam Hussein.  That is something people should not forget.  We should not forget that this man is a tyrant and can only be classified as a second Hitler.  Everybody seems to forget that he invaded Kuwait, that for quite a long time he referred to it as another province. Recently he has come to the idea that they will get out of Kuwait in certain circumstances; in other words he is recognising now that he cannot win this war. Regrettably, he could not recognise it last August before all these atrocities against his own people were committed.</P>
    <P>Need I point out to this House what has happened to the Kuwaiti people, and the cruelty and hardship they have suffered at the hands of the Iraqi forces since the invasion of Kuwait?  Need I point out the cruelty to prisoners of war held at strategic points so that if those places are attacked they will be killed?  That is what this man has done.  Again, need I remind the House that there were 3,300 foreigners held there against their will for four months and only released at Christmas?</P>
    <P>That is the type of tyrant we are dealing with and we should not be afraid to say the sooner he is exterminated the better. That is my belief and I do not apologise for it.  While he is there and has the power he has, he will be a danger to world peace.  God knows, 12 or 18 months ago we all admired and looked forward to the changes taking place in Russia and eastern Europe.  We all thought we were <Col N="1495" /> in for decades of peace when countries could spend their resources on eliminating poverty.  Instead of that, we see the tragedy of what has happened in the past 34 days.</P>
    <P>We all sincerely hope that President Gorbachev will be successful in his effort to obtain peace.  We have to recognise the difficulties, we have to recognise what this man has done and the way he has tried to provoke Israel into entering the war.  That cannot be forgotten.  He has attacked the Israeli people, hoping to bring them into the war to split up the alliance.  When one examines all the countries that have come together to ensure that the Iraqi forces pull out of Kuwait, they have a very good reason to do this.  We are right to facilitate and back up the United Nations on that.</P>
    <P>We have to recognise what is happening. We have to recognise that we are part of the United Nations and that we must back the United Nations Charter.  I have no difficulty whatever with extending facilities to American planes flying over this country to refuel at Shannon. We are part of the United Nations and we must recognise that if we had not the United Nations, and whether we like it or not the American army to back up the UN Charter, then peace would be in jeopardy.</P>

      <P>We all recognise, perhaps to varying degrees, that war means violence.  It is very easy to be carried away by the exigencies of a situation, by the enormity of Saddam Hussein's wrongdoings, both to his own people and the people of Kuwait.  Yet, at the end of the day war is violence.  On many occasions we in this House have said quite rightly, that violence is no way to settle any dispute, and any violence becomes very difficult to justify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United Nations Security Council passed certain Resolutions.  We in this country and our Government have fully backed and are fully committed to those Resolutions.  Indeed, I heard some criticism earlier of our Minister.  He has distinguished himself, as he has on many previous occasions, in his efforts to show a balance, to try to do the right thing and <Col N="1496" /> to induce others to do the right thing in what is an appallingly difficult and horrible situation and in which it is so easy to take sides.  It is very easy to condemn, it is less easy to decide what to do and to do it right.  As the Minister said, this conflict could have been avoided entirely if Iraq heeded the United Nations Resolutions. As he said, the key to its ending, even today, lies in Baghdad.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about the UN Resolution. It is that Iraq should leave Kuwait.  That is the kernel of the appropriate United Nations Resolution and of the successive resolutions.  We all agree in this House that the President of Iraq is an appalling person and that he has carried out appalling atrocities on his own people aided by western technical assistance. We all know of the appalling losses inflicted on his own people in a senseless, useless war with Iran and he is now visiting a further series of atrocities on the people of Kuwait.  Kuwait city, which I visited on many occasions, is now a ruined shell with very few people living in it; there are virtually no Kuwaitis remaining, just a handful of Palestinians, Jordanians and a few others.  This has been caused largely by this individual, whom few people were willing to condemn until six months or so ago.  People praised him and, unfortunately, there are many other tyrants and evil people in this world who may well deserve to be removed, and good riddance to them.</P>
    <P>However, that is not what was decided by the United Nations.  They decided that he should be ejected from Kuwait.  This may be necessary for peace in the Middle East, and certain people will make it virtually impossible.  I have never hesitated, even though at times it was not awfully popular, to remark on the difficulties of Israel and on the folk memories of the Jewish people, and at times, we have in this House tended to ignore their situation, their peril, their hard emotions and feelings, particularly when gas is mentioned.</P>
    <P>We are trying to do what is best in relation to this country as we see it.  We have made it clear on both sides of the House that we condemn violence, that we wish to see disputes settled by peaceful means.  That is the attitude we take, and <Col N="1497" /> which we should take.  We are not out there to exceed the United Nations mandate. We are there to see that the United Nations rule of law and order is upheld and that nobody, not even a monster like Saddam Hussein, and no other state will take advantage of the United Nations Resolutions: I am not singling out any one state that may take advantage of these resolutions to further their own policies or objectives.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to talk of the Middle East.  I know how hard I find it, and I am sure many of us in this House do, to listen to people who have been here for a week on three or four visits give us lectures on how our problems should be solved and what should be done or not done.  I have great difficulty when I think of the Middle East and of the infinitely more complicated situation that exists there.  There is one basic principle which we in this House have reaffirmed over and over again and that is the settlement of disputes by peaceful means and our abhorrence of violence.  That is the principle which we must maintain.</P>

      <P>I would like to share my time with Senator Ross.  I would be grateful if you would remind me when my five minutes are up.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the entire western world has had a collective dose of anaesthesia of conscience.  We have had pusillanimous distortions from government after government regarding who is responsible for what is happening, for the destruction of the water supply in Iraq, for the destruction of all of Iraq's electricity supplies. They all say that if Saddam Hussein had not done what he has done, then this need not have happened.  That is true.  It is not, however, a moral answer to a moral question because the question is not whether it would have happened if Saddam Hussein had behaved himself but whether it is right to do it because of what he has done.  The entire western world has forgotten that fundamental moral difference. The fact that he did something wrong does not suddenly give our collective consciences <i>carte blanche.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This hair-raising statement was issued by our Government about landing rights and over-flights &mdash;&ldquo;the basis for the <Col N="1498" /> Government's approach to this question has not changed and we will continue to provide refuelling facilities and overflight permission if requested to aircraft of the multinational forces acting in pursuance of Resolution 678.&rdquo;  If they announce that they were going to nuke Baghdad, if they began and we then discovered wholesale slaughter of civilians, do we as a nation, as a society and as a western world, decide that morality no longer counts?  In two Houses of the Oireachtas that has been treated to many lectures about morality, about individual morality and private morality, to suddenly discover the jettisoning of the question of morality on this issue is among the most horrific and frightening deteriorations of our standards I have encountered in ten years.</P>
    <P>It is not right to treat the civilian population of Iraq as they have been treated and no amount of hiding behind the skirts of dubious legality can separate our Government and Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats from that fundamental moral choice.  The question is not whether it is legal or lawful; it is whether it is moral, and that is the question that has been addressed only by spiritual leaders.  Every political leader of every state in the western world has hidden, ducked, bobbed and weaved and refused to confront that question.  The question is not whether Saddam Hussein is a tyrant.  We are all agreed on that.  The question is not when the issue started, but whether what is being done in the name of the western powers and of their Arab allies is justified by what he has done. The vast majority of the Irish people now say that it is not justified.</P>
    <P>There cannot be a moral basis for bombing the poor, misfortunate population of Iraq who have suffered more under Saddam Hussein than the people of Kuwait, Israel or Saudi Arabia.  To bomb them back into the last century in the name of liberating Kuwait is immoral. It is wrong and I would invite somebody in this House on the Government side to stop hiding and to stand up and say Yes or No.  Is it moral regardless of its legality, or does anybody in our Government understand the difference between law and morality?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words about the policy of the Government in regard to this crisis.  Many assertions have been made about what is happening, about who is right, about morality and about the detailed policy which our Government are supposedly carrying out in the Middle East which does not have a great deal of influence on what is going on out there.  Our role this time round happens to be approximately right, but it is approximately right only by luck because if you have a foreign policy which is not based on principle but purely and utterly on self-interest, or on the basis of the line of least resistance, you are going to be right some time.</P>
      <P>It should be recognised by Members of this House that Deputy Gerard Collins, Minister for Foreign Affairs, for whom we have heard predictable praise from that side of the House, is the Minister who never raised his voice against trading with Iraq one year ago.  The same Government who are taking a moral stand on that regime today were happy to take profit or supposed profit from that country and to trade and support that regime less than one year ago.  I have had no satisfactory response to that accusation. There were some of us who said at the time that what was happening in Iraq was immoral and was far worse than in other countries in the world about which this Government were pontificating so loudly.  The reason for the silence was self-interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it very difficult now to take the Government's posturing about the wrongful wicked invasion of Kuwait when they did not give a damn about the people Saddam Hussein was torturing and killing in his own country at the time. This Government, typically, makes a great virtue of countering territorial ambitions but does not mind about an individual and tyrant when he is offending human rights.  It is no accident that not a voice was raised when genocide was committed against the Kurds.  I do not remember blame being apportioned or a voice being raised about the fact that a million people died in the Iraq-Iran war but yet we indulge in major posturing about the invasion of a small country and the territorial integrity of that country. <Col N="1500" /> That may come as a genuine objection from some countries but I do not think it comes as a genuine objection from us since we tolerated that regime for so long. It is rank hypocrisy and it is something we have to examine for future foreign policy.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with the Minister's speech because I think it is time that we did not simply say we believe in the minimum UN Resolutions that are being passed and that we support the United Nations.  We should decide and state quite clearly what the war aims of the United Nations are and what war aims we will support in the future.  We should say not only whether we believe the Iraqis should be removed from Kuwait but also whether we support the continued existence of this man in Iraq after the war is over.  It is quite conceivable in the sort of peace arrangement being discussed now that the same man will be in charge of Iraq after he has been removed from Kuwait.  Will we in Ireland go back to trading happily with him?  Will we open diplomatic relations with him?</P>

      <P>Yes, we probably will because that would be consistent with our selfish foreign policy in the past.  The Minister should have given us some clear indication of the war aims.  It would have been far more refreshing if he had said it was unacceptable to us that that man should remain in power afterwards because of his appalling criminal record not only in Kuwait during this war but in previous times and that there were some levels of behaviour we will not tolerate as a nation.  However, our morality is retrospective and applies only after it has been endorsed by the United Nations or by somebody else.</P>

      <P>I want to put on record the fact that I abhor the taking of human life whether it is as a result of a terrorist bomb, of the shoot-to-kill policy of the British army in the Six Counties or as a result of the action of an abortionist; all killing is to be deplored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we would be discussing this issue at the moment if we had not <Col N="1501" /> been treated to it every night on television and, as Senator Ryan said, we have become almost inured to the spectacle of civilians being bombed to pieces.  That is what sparked off this debate.  When we spoke here on the matter just a short time ago, did we really think we would have a war without deaths and is there any difference between a civilian in Baghdad and a poor conscript soldier in Kuwait? If we sanction war then we must expect death.  I agree with Senator Ryan about the poor people of Iraq.  I cannot justify this killing of innocent people.  However, I do not know how we can have a war to get Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait without bombing his supply lines and his water supplies and everything else.  This is going to affect the civilian population, unfortunately.</P>
    <P>I spoke of the prevailing degree of hypocrisy during the last debate on this matter.  At the moment we are saying nothing about Assad of Syria who has a terrible record on human rights.

      <P>I am in conflict at the moment because everybody agrees that this man has to leave Kuwait and we have listed all the crimes he has committed against the Kuwaitis and yet the only way they seem to be able to get him out of there is by bombing his own people, people whom we saw rejoicing on the streets of Baghdad recently when they thought the war was over.  The Americans, the British and the other allies as they are called say this is the only way it can be done.  If that is so I would have to support it even though I do not want to see anybody killed no matter where or for what reason.  If we leave this man in possession of Kuwait and if we leave him <Col N="1502" /> in power he will just go back to doing what he did before.</P>
      <P>It is not enough to say we condemn this dictator only.  We should condemn them all.  I condemn American action in many countries.  I condemn Russian action.  I am not afraid to condemn any of them but at the moment we are dealing with this issue only and we should confine ourselves to it.  If we want Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait then we have to use all the means at our disposal to do so.  I hope the war will not go on very long; I do not like war.  The Minister and all Senators hope the war will end quickly and that we can save as much human life as possible.</P>
      <P>I see in the paper this evening that Iraq has again resisted all attempts at peace. Saddam Hussein is locked in a bunker somewhere.  He is a bit like Hitler at the end of the war; he does not seem to care very much what is happening to his own people.  This is a very sad dilemma for us. I hope the peace initiative will be given a chance and that we can continue to talk rather than initiate a ground war which is going to embroil many nations of the Gulf and further beyond.  I would like to see the peace initiative getting another chance before we march into such a war.  I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; because we have been involved since the moment we granted landing rights at Shannon.  We are involved because we are a member of the United Nations and are part of the allied forces. We may not be sending arms there but we give support indirectly.  I think the Minister has been effective and if we can exert any influence which would support the peace process and stop the war then we should do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, at the outset of my remarks, to agree with those who have condemned this war totally. There is no justification whatever for this development which was caused by the invasion of Kuwait on August 2 by Iraq, led by Saddam Hussein.</P>
      <P>Under no circumstances could any formula or form of words be found to justify that action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the free world are fortunate to have a power as mighty and as strong as America to lead this fight.  It was obvious <Col N="1503" /> that counteracting Iraq would be a major problem with its very high level of armed forces on both land and in the air.  I, therefore praise the part played, first, by the United Nations in the adoption of Resolution 660 on 2 August and secondly, the magnificent and valuable contribution made particularly by America and the other allies, but especially by America.  There would be a different position now after 34 days of war if America were not part of the allied forces.  Thankfully &mdash; and as indicated by the Minister here this evening &mdash; we do appear to be coming to the end of this war thanks to the might and power which confronted Saddam Hussein and the Iraqis generally.  I agree with the persons who said that we should not stand idly by and let any tyrant or dictator, whether in Iraq, Cuba or anywhere else, massacre or ill-treat one million persons.  We have a definite moral responsibility, small nation though we are, to raise our voices loudly and clearly to make certain that there will be no repetition of that.</P>
    <P>I am very fearful about the post-war period.  I believe that this war will be over soon.  The Iraqis will have been taken care of.  I would hope that Saddam Hussein will be taken out of the equation.  I do not believe that he is fit to lead any people.  I believe also that many of his accomplices who have worked closely with him in the past and who have been responsible, as some friends behind me indicated a few moments ago for the murder of vast numbers of the Kurdish people in recent times &mdash; are also totally unfit.</P>
    <P>After the war we must make certain that there is a peacekeeping force in the Gulf area to make certain that a proper situation develops and that we do not ever again resort back to the very animalistic situation that existed before this war.  This war started on 2 August. It was a catalyst in one sense but it was also a boiling point after a very severe period.  We must all condemn this war. We must be high in our praise for the United Nations for the valuable contribution they have made to putting manners on the Iraqis and on Saddam Hussein.</P>

      <P>I welcome this debate here tonight.  I cannot go along with the general thinking that this dispute started on 2 August.  The problem we have to address now is that Saddam Hussein would never have existed nor would he have had the fourth greatest army in the world if the developed countries had not supplied him with arms and used him and bolstered him for their own ends.</P>
      <P>At this stage we have to address the serious issue that people say that this is a just war while at the same time countries that are involved in the war are supplying arms to other dictatorships throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>As a small independent country I think we have to look that issue straight in the face.  We have to decide whether we row with the tide or, as we did in previous times under Fianna Fáil Government, once again call for disarmament, but this time for disarmament on a scale never seen before.  This present war could escalate easily into a third world war.  It is something I feel very deeply about.  Decisions should never be made under pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A long time ago I came to the conclusion that there is no such thing as a just war.  In any war the people who really suffer are the ordinary people and in modern warfare as we have seen, there is no way one can say that only military personnel suffer.  Everybody suffers but particularly civilians.  I would hope that we would once again return to those methods that two years ago seemed to be paying such rich dividends worldwide. Those are the methods of persuasion, of <Col N="1505" /> sanctions.  We have seen them work very successfully towards dismantling dictatorships in eastern Europe as mentioned earlier today.  We have also seen their success in going further than we would have dreamed a few years ago towards dismantling the apartheid system in South Africa.  It is the slow way.  It is the hard way and the way that requires great patience, but it is the way that causes least suffering and the moral basis of the Christianity that most people in this country profess is behind it.</P>
    <P>I feel that we must address these issues. There is great talk about Saddam Hussein but I would have no truck with his type of regime. People talk about Hitler as the perfect excuse for defeating tyranny but we were warned, long before Hitler came to power in the thirties, that socioeconomic conditions created after the First World War would facilitate the rise of popularly-supported dictatorships. The solution is for the democratic system to be adopted worldwide.  The free nations of the world must encourage the growth of democracy in all countries where possible.  There must be very strong regulations regarding the sale of arms to non-democratic countries.  If we start by eliminating the sale of arms and chemicals to non-democratic countries we would be nearer bringing peace to this troubled world of ours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording of my question is: The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food in view of the serious plight of Irish potato growers, to press for an EC policy to protect the industry.  The Minister has been trying <Col N="1506" /> hard to bring order to the potato industry and I thank him for his commitment to the industry.  The fault does not lie with the Minister or with the chief executive officer and the special adviser, Mr. Sean O'Shea.  The Minister has tried to bring the potato industry under control and to develop it but he has not been successful.</P>
      <P>With the establishment of An Bord Glas the Minister made provision for the development of the potato industry and the seed potato industry.  The industry is in a sad state and this was admitted in the Horticulture Development brochure issued some time ago.  The Chairman of An Bord Glas recognised that.  Following an examination of the report which An Bord Glas furnished, the board noted with concern the considerable steady decline in the Irish seed potato acreage and production.  The area of seed potato certified which averaged 6,000 hectares in 1960 was down to 4,000 hectares in 1970 and 3,500 hectares in 1980.  It is estimated that the number of hectares has been under 3,000 since 1989.  The direction taken by the Department in looking after a few producers is misguided.</P>
      <P>I have hands-on experience of the potato industry.  I come from a county where the economy and income of many small holdings depends on the production and sale of potatoes.  How will the economy be put in a good healthy state when we are importing a large tonnage of potatoes?  Our climate and soil are ideal for growing potatoes.  We are disease-free and can produce good quality seed and ware potatoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been very good support for grading potatoes and for forming cooperatives. However, the efforts being made at the moment to support grower groups will never succeed.  The farming organisations have failed to put forward sensible policies to the Minister and An Bord Glas.  What alarms me is a proposal by the IFA to advise the Minister to establish the growing of potatoes on a quota basis.  This would devastate the industry.  If the Minister for Agriculture and Food adopted the recommendation of the IFA and introduced a quota system, it would be very short-sighted. The quota system in Ireland does not <Col N="1507" /> present a happy picture.  There is no quota system in Europe for war potatoes.  How could we embark on a quota system when our borders and frontiers are open to imports?  It would be the death-knell of the industry here.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to give a clear indication that he will not under any circumstances embark on a quota system for growing potatoes in this country.  A quota system might be helpful to the few people who are already doing well. Unfortunately the industry will not survive and progress if the Department and the Minister only look after a few people. Recently, the Minister announced extensive support for growing potatoes and for buildings to house potatoes especially in disadvantaged areas.  That applies to my county.  The Minister should look at the value of funding grower groups because they have not worked.  I have watched the potato industry for a long time and watched the North County Dublin growers form a co-op.  One must ask why that co-op failed.  The answer is quite simple: there has never been a successful co-operative growers group.</P>
    <P>Recently in Donegal, outside the town of Raphoe one producer has been successfully established with EC aid.  In reality that is not a co-operative and it is not a producers group.  That is a one-man effort and it does not reflect progress in the industry.  The Minister should recognise that the best and most effective contribution he can make is to help individuals, first, with proper grading facilities and, secondly, with proper storage facilities.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have a feeling for the industry and who would dearly love to see it survive went to Holland to look at the Dutch storage facilities.  They have cooling systems which maintain potatoes up to the month of July.  Potatoes are imported here in June and July that have been properly stored while our growers have no such facilities.  They cannot compete and, therefore, cannot survive much longer.  The Minister's intentions and those of his Department are quite good. It is right and proper to ask for a change in direction at this time.  The funding and support that is available should be <Col N="1508" /> channelled to individual growers.  There should not be any question of a quota. That would not be entertained by the mass of people who have commitments and intend staying in the industry.</P>
    <P>On small holdings the potato was the traditional crop.  A number of senior people in the EC have paid tribute to the small family farm in Ireland.  I am not one to make gloomy predictions but the small tillage farm will find it nearly impossible to sustain any members of the family who work on it.  The individual must be helped.  The Minister comes from a farming background and that is his strength.  He knows what tillage is about. That is important.</P>
    <P>We should press the EC to establish a potato policy but that will be difficult because the Dutch, Belgians, French and others who are successful and have the industry on a firm footing will oppose any such policy.  I cannot see the Dutch being too anxious to support such a proposal. Since all other forms of agriculture and horticulture are controlled and supported by the EC, I cannot see how the potato industry and potato growers will be excluded.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to continue to look for a potato policy even though it might be a hard uphill fight.  That is basically what I want to say.  I want to be brief and not repetitious.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's efforts and the encouragement he has been given. Support should be available to individual growers to provide proper storage and grading facilities.  There are many potato inspectors, some from the Department of Agriculture and Food and some from An Bord Glas, who have a wealth of knowledge but they are nearly redundant at the moment because the industry has failed.  I call on the Minister to take the potato industry by the scruff of the neck and save it.  If he does not do so, then we are in serious danger of losing what was a traditional industry.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to respond positively and not to allow the IFA to persuade him to adopt a quota system, and I say that as a fully paid up member of the IFA. That would be the death knell to the industry.  I confidently hope the Minister will not respond to that request.</P>

      <P>I am well aware that from time to time potato producers can be badly hit by low market prices.  However, although producer prices have been on the low side during the current season, the situation is not quite as serious as the Senator would suggest.</P>
      <P>Yields of earlies were at an all time high, the crop having been planted and grown in ideal conditions.  Despite worthwhile levels of exports having been achieved, the market was over-supplied to the end of the year.  Arising from this over-supply, prices became depressed and have been slow to recover, though a recovery has been noted in recent weeks. This over-supply continued despite repeated appeals to producers to regulate supplies to the market.  Following the dry summer, main crop yields were about average and quality was generally quite good.</P>
      <P>On the question of an EC potato policy, the position is that potatoes are the only major agricultural product in the Community not governed by a common organisation of the market.  However, protection is afforded by means of customs duties on imports from third countries, ranging from 15 per cent to 21 per cent.  There are also EC agreements with certain early potato producing countries, for example, Cyprus, etc., which allow imports of quantities, or quotas, at preferential rates of duty during certain specified periods when they do not have a significant impact on the domestic market.  In addition, imports from third countries must comply with EC plant-health requirements.</P>
      <P>In addition, EC grant aid is available and, indeed, has been widely availed of by the Irish potato sector over a number of years, for potato projects involving processing, marketing and storage facilities. Limited grant aid is also provided to the potato sector under the farm improvement programme.</P>

    <P>The question of establishing a common organisation of the market for potatoes <Col N="1510" /> was considered in Brussels back in the seventies.  The main provisions included marketing standards; measures encouraging the setting up of producer groups; measures aimed at keeping the market stable, composed essentially of a stabilisation fund for the withdrawal of excess produce from the market and measures for the regulation of trade and nonmember countries incorporating a reference price system for new potatoes. However, there was insufficient support in the Community for this measure.</P>
    <P>The matter was raised again in 1987 but there was no progress.  The main stumbling block, as I understand it, would be the cost of supporting the market.  More recently, the farm organisations COPA-COGECA were reported to have submitted proposals to the EC Commission for what they describe as a &ldquo;lightweight&rdquo; regime and I understand that these proposals are being considered by the Commission.</P>
    <P>It is true that the total area under potatoes in this country has declined steadily over the past 15 years and now stands at 26,000 hectares with production in the region of 700,000 tonnes. However, improved methods of cultivation and storage mean that the market demand can be met by a lesser area planted.  This also explains the reduction in the number of producers over the years.</P>
    <P>Potato production is now tending, although gradually, to be concentrated more in the hands of commercial growers. This shift from the smaller fragmented growing pattern is paralleled by better cultivation practices and an improvement in quality and should facilitate efforts to bring better organisation to the sector in the future.  There will continue to be room for the small grower who is prepared to keep pace with consumer demands for quality produce.</P>
    <P>While the organisation and rationalisation of the potato industry is primarily a matter for commercial interests, Government policy as a reflected in the appointment of a Minister for Horticulture and the establishment of An Bord Glas, is to create a framework in which the sector can develop its potential and encourage this development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1511" /> The Senator, and indeed all other interested parties, will by now be aware of the two programmes published by An Bord Glas for the development of the ware potato and seed potato sectors. Real progress has already begun.  Potato imports for the three year period 1988-90 averaged 54,000 tonnes per annum, whereas imports for the preceding three year period averaged 64,000 tonnes.  A marketing co-ordinator has been appointed and is being co-funded by An Bord Glas and the IFA.</P>
    <P>An EC Producer Group Regulation has recently been extended to potatoes. Under this scheme aid is available towards the formation and operation of potato producer groups over a five year period.  The aid is paid on the basis of 5 per cent in the first year, 5 per cent in the second year, 4 per cent in the third, 3 per cent in the fourth year, and 2 per cent in the fifth year.  Those percentages are based on turnover.</P>
    <P>In the past month I launched a scheme under the operational programme for rural development.  This new scheme is aimed at potato growers and enterprises with investments above £5,000, that is, smaller scale projects than catered for under the existing FEOGA aided scheme for projects in marketing and processing. This scheme will provide financial assistance in respect of approved investments for storage and storage related equipment; ventilation and insulation for existing stores; packing, weighing and related items; de-stoners; sulphuric acid sprayers and seed fumigation equipment.</P>
    <P>Applications for aid under the first <Col N="1512" /> round of this scheme are to be made to my Department before 31 March.</P>
    <P>I find cause for concern in regard to the seed potato sector.  Seed exports have declined over the past two decades from upwards of 30,000 tonnes in the late seventies to about 10,000 tonnes at present. Seed production is located largely in County Donegal where prevailing climatic factors provide a suitable growing environment.  In addition, there exists there a long tradition, technical experience and equipment for seed potato production.</P>
    <P>I have already referred briefly to the programme which An Bord Glas has drawn up for the development of the seed potato sector.  I can assure the Senator that I am taking a strong personal interest in the seed potato scene and I am anxious to ensure that the problems of the seed sector will be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>In relation to the point the Senator raised on the question of the establishment of a quota regime, I dealt with that comprehensively at the recent potato conference organised by Teagasc and the IFA.  I clearly set out the difficulties I would envisage with the establishment of such a system.  I see very obvious difficulties, particularly in the number of growers we have and the free movement of produce within the Community.  It would create obvious difficulties in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 21 February 1991.</P>
