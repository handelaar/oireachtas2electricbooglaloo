      <P>I have notice from Senator Liam Naughten that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>If the Minister is aware of the concern among many electors in regard to the manner in which third level students are being registered on the Register of Electors now prepared and if he proposes to take any action in the matter.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Mary Jackman of the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Social Welfare to allocate part of the £500,000 provided in the 1991 budget for Women's Aid to the women's refuges, particularly Adapt House, in Limerick city.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Avril Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for a paediatric unit at Wexford General Hospital.</P>
      <P>Tá fógra agam ón Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chun a fhiafraí den Aire Comhshaoil an mbeadh sé sásta leasú caoi a chur i gcrích len a chinntiú nach bhféadfaí <Col N="1514" /> cearta vótála a bhaint go héagórach de shaoránach cáilithe i bhfianaise a tharla i gceantar Charna i mbliana nuair a baineadh breis is 200 ainm de liosta na gClár Toghthóirí go mí-dhleatheach.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Michael Howard of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to take immediate action to alleviate the severe overcrowding of patients in Ennis General Hospital because of acute shortage of beds.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Dan Neville of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure the continuation after 1995 of the post primary school at Mount Trenchard, Foynes, County Limerick.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Batt O'Keeffe of the following matter:</P>
    <P>In view of the widespread concern at the change in policy regarding Visa charges by Allied Irish Bank, the need for the Government to monitor interest and bank charges, especially when reviewing legislation on consumer credit in line with EC Directive 87/102/EEC.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Paddy McGowan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Environment to update the law and provide for more severe penalties for criminals who steal and vandalise cars as it has come to the stage that no car is safe in any part of Dublin city.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Naughten, Jackman, Doyle, Ó Foighil, Howard and Neville as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Naughten's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Jackman, Doyle, Ó Foighil, Howard and Neville may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have to rule the matters raised by Senators O'Keeffe and McGowan are <Col N="1515" /> not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment &mdash; Senator O'Keeffe's on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility and Senator McGowan's as it advocates legislation.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take item No. 3 &mdash; the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990 &mdash; and to conclude Second Stage today, the Minister to reply at approximately 12.45 p.m.  There will be a sos between 1 and 2 o'clock.  At 2 p.m. we will commence a debate on Second Stage of the Child Care Bill, 1988.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, if we examine the records we will see that approximately 40 speakers have spoken on it.  I think that is an excellent performance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of us on this side are very concerned about the conflicting reports about the future of An Post which have arisen from yesterday's events.  The Minister told the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party as reported by their chairman, that the whole matter was now put on ice but the Minister gave a very different version of events here last evening.  I ask the Leader of the House if he can clarify the plans for the future of An Post.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Leader of the House if he will provide time for discussion of Item No. 13 as soon as possible. That is the Sixth Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, Report No. 4, Life Assurance and Motor Insurance.  I raise the matter this morning particularly in view of a report in today's newspapers that a substantial increase in insurance premiums is imminent.  If we were to have a discussion on this item this morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Order of Business, I would point out that while we have had consultation on the time the Environmental Protection Agency Bill is to conclude, there was not a definite agreement that it had to conclude.  There is one Member in possession.  A few more are offering on our side and I understand there are some Members offering on the far side.  Some of these Members have put in quite a bit of preparation on their speeches they have been waiting a long time.  It signifies the interest in this measure that debate has gone on so long. It affects Members from all parts of the country and those of us who are members of local authorities have an additional interest.  I ask that these Members be given an opportunity to contribute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Leader would tell us if it is intended to finish Second Stage of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill today in order to make sure that we have a reasonable interval between Second Stage and Committee Stage.  It is a very long and complicated Bill.  I anticipate, without having discussed it with anybody, a considerable number of amendments.  In the interests of the Members and the Minister there should be a reasonable interval between Second Stage and Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>There is a section in the Environmental Protection Agency Bill which refers to noise which is so loud, so continuous, so repeated and of such duration as to cause a nuisance.  Every morning about 10.30 the noise in my office, when two conflicting noises emit themselves through the loudspeaker, could only be described as loud, continuous and annoying.  I wish we could find some other way of calling us to assemble.</P>

      <P>Would the Leader of the House indicate what we may have on our <Col N="1517" /> agenda for next Wednesday and Thursday, subject to the Whips agreeing?  I am particularly concerned about whether we will reach the day long agricultural debate.  Many Members from all sides of the House have been requesting that that debate take place.  A little notice is often helpful to Members before they head to the country so that they can prepare and bring the relevant documents with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the comments from Senator Manning on what he described as conflicting reports about the decision of An Post, I imagine the decision outlined by the Minister would be the definitive decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will investigate the matter further and have discussions with the Senator.  Senator Howard asked about item 13 on the Order Paper.  I am particularly interested in this.  My colleagues on this side of the House have been suggesting a debate on motor insurance in particular.  We will examine this question and bring it forward in some form before the Easter recess.</P>
      <P>Senator Cosgrave raised the question of the Environmental Protection Agency and the conclusion of Second Stage.  We understood it would be possible to finish this morning, but if there are extra speakers we would extend the debate. We think it may finish but we may be wrong.  We will try to make extra time available.  Senator Brendan Ryan asked about Committee Stage.  That is a matter for the Minister and her officials.  There will be a number of amendments.  There has been a great deal of interest in Second Stage.  I may be wrong, but I believe that the Minister would want about three weeks before taking Committee Stage. However, that is a matter for her.  The question of noise does not figure in this business.</P>
      <P>We are actively pursuing the possibility of having a debate on agriculture next week.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I aim to assist the House by compressing what I have to say as much as possible and by attempting to restrain my natural verbosity.  I understand there is a general desire that the Second Stage of the Bill should draw to a conclusion today.  In all the briefings I have received from various environmental organisations they have stressed that they hope this Bill will have a speedy passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I indicated on the last day on which this Bill was before the House that I had some concern about the implementation of sections of the Bill by ministerial regulation. This is not confined to this area. There is another Bill that will probably come before the House today, that is, the Child Care Bill.  I have similar reservations about this Bill, because the broad outline of the legislation is contained in the Bill but, once more, important powers are reserved to the Minister by regulation.  It is important that Bills of this nature should be given teeth but that those teeth should be examined here in this House.  I note the Minister, in her speech, said that the agency would have wide ranging powers.  One welcomes this. I hope these teeth will be very clearly retained by the time the Bill has passed and that there will be no dilution of these powers &mdash; the power to prosecute summary offences, the power to hold inquiries to publish reports on pollution incidents and the necessary powers and functions of the Air and Water Pollution Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that these matters of air and water pollution were so extensively dealt with.  I notice that a very considerable emphasis in the Bill is on industrial pollution. I would like to shift the emphasis a little towards a broader environmental concern.  I am not going to go on at great <Col N="1519" /> length about this because I am sure the Minister has access to a considerably greater variety of documentation than I have.  I would refer the Minister to the Green Paper on the urban environment, a communications from the Commission of European Communities to the Council and Parliament.  They deal with the urban environment in ways that are outside the principally industrial application of pollution legislation.  They point out with regard to traffic management &mdash; this may appear to be broad but I hope to be able to link it in &mdash; that the urban environment has always had problems in this regard, including noise and traffic.  This can be traced back to ancient Rome.  Paris in the 18th century had traffic jams.</P>
    <P>One of the problems we have is that every time there is an improvement in life there is a compensating disimprovement. For example, when we improve the roads system we bring more vehicles into the city and we increase the pollution as a result of exhaust fumes.  Up to the 18th century there was no central organised sewerage system.  There were receptacles placed in special little cavities behind shutters.  The contents were fired out on the streets, which was not very pleasant for the inhabitants.  Mainline sewerage systems were produced principally in the 19th century.  That certainly affected hygiene in the home and in the immediate environs of the city.  It also created a very considerable problem in terms of pollution of the sea.  When you solve one problem in a small arena, you very often create a downstream effect on further concealed pollution.  I hope that this will be taken into account by the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>With regard to the pollution by motor cars, and so on, the effects of these pollutants are very often long term.  Very often they are more easily observed in their secondary effects than in their primary effects.  They can be detected in long term health damage and also in the deterioration of buildings.  One has only to look at the outside of this building to see the effect of chemical corrosion.  The same applies to Trinity College.  Many of <Col N="1520" /> the great 18th century buildings in this city are affected by the secondary results of not just industrial pollution but of the pollution from auto-motive exhausts. Hydrocarbons resulting from incomplete combustion react with other pollutants in the presence of sunlight.  This results in reaction products causing eye irritation and respiratory system damage.  It is also the fact that the exhaust fumes of cars in dense urban traffic lead to a situation where carbon monoxide builds up in tunnels and in underground garages.  This can cause respiratory system damage.  It can inhibit oxygen absorption by haemoglobin and it can actually cause brain damage in the elderly.  Again, some years ago there was very considerable public concern about lead pollution from automobile exhausts and its impact.  For example, it could have a bad effect on children in inner city playgrounds and this was a cause of very considerable concern. Again, this is an area in which I hope the Environmental Protection Agency will take particular interest.</P>
    <P>Before I leave this report, I would like to turn to another area that is of very particular concern to me, that is, the question of revitalising the existing inner city areas.  This may appear to be a little bit wide of the Bill, but when I place on the record just a few paragraphs from this important report I think it will be seen how this ties in to the operations of the Environmental Protection Agency.  I quote from page 41:</P>
    <P>Revitalising existing housing areas within the city is also important.  The quality of life in such areas can be dramatically improved by carrying out environmental improvements and, specifically, by reducing the noise and pollution from traffic.  This requires local strategies that give priority to the needs of pedestrians and inhabitants rather than to drivers passing through an area.  Such environmental improvements may well provide the impetus for private investment in improvement of housing stock.</P>
    <P>The need for revitalisation is not restricted to areas within the city. <Col N="1521" /> Many urban peripheral housing estates, particularly those constructed as social housing, are showing symptoms of urban decline more traditionally associated with rundown inner-city areas.  In London and Marseilles, the Commission is already involved in pilot projects, aimed at improving economic and social development in such areas.  The problems experienced by their inhabitants are often aggravated by their physical isolation from the economic, social, commercial and cultural life of the city.</P>
    <P>Expanding the uses and activities of these areas, and thus the opportunities available to their residents, is part of a strategy aimed at integrating these housing estates into the city, and improving their environment and the quality of life of their inhabitants.</P>
    <P>Traffic management is an important aspect of environmental control and, indeed, pollution control.  Here we have a clear answer to what the city of Dublin is doing in terms of running motorways through the centre of the city.  This makes it perfectly clear that it is at the heart of a pollution debate in terms of the environment. It also indicates that the Environmental Protection Agency could, and ought to, be involved in this because of the environmental impact assessments, for example, and also because of what the Minister said on the record of this House.  It is clear that she sees the Environmental Protection Agency as fulfilling some role in the shaping of policy.</P>
    <P>It is important that here in the Seanad we should indicate that we see the formation of policy through the Environmental Protection Agency in this area as being an important element of its work. This, of course, will mean that one relies on the Minister's statements with regard to the independence of the Environmental Protection Agency.  I hope it will be fully independent but I have some slight concern in this area.  Despite that, I am sure, is a valiant fight by the Minister to retain as much independence and as much environmental glasnost as possible, I am sure that there will be other tensions <Col N="1522" /> intended to retain the environmental agency within the general ambit of governmental influence, and particularly the influence of the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>I would have to underline to the Minister that I and many other people believe that the strength of the Environmental Protection Agency will, in fact, largely rely upon its independence and upon its perceived independence.  I have to say that a number of people to whom I have spoken have suggested to me that there is still too great control by Government of the structures of the Environmental Protection Agency.  For example, look at the structure of the appointment committee. The Government approve the appointment committee's choices.  There are two direct Government appointees, senior civil servants in the Department of the Environment, Government secretaries, and so on.  There is a chief executive from the IDA whom one could also classify in a sense as being in the Government camp.  There are also the general secretary of the ITGWU, a chief executive from the Council for the Status of Women, and the chairperson of An Taisce.  It seems also that the advisory committee could be fairly tightly controlled by the Minister.  I may have adverted to this and signalled that I hope to put an amendment down on Committee Stage on this matter.  The Minister can remove from office a member if his or her removal appears to the Minister necessary or desirable for the effective performance by the agency of its functions. It is a very strong power for the Minister to have.  It raises the question of what chance we have of getting a really strong environmental protection policy, driven by a technically sound director general and only four other directors.  I wonder why there is no representation from regional areas.  County managers are increasingly isolated and estranged from central Government.</P>
    <P>I would like also to make the point that I think it is very necessary that the lines of communication between the Environmental Protection Agency and local authorities are very clearly defined and the <Col N="1523" /> responsibilities of each should be clearly defined.  There is a fear that as it begins to operate, whether the aspirations of the Minister and her goodwill &mdash; which I think we all take for granted &mdash; there may well be a tendency for the Environmental Protection Agency to become almost a kind of additional Government Department because of the direct impact of the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>I have to point out that the proposed European Environmental Protection Agency will be semi-autonomous and answering directly to the Parliament.  I would like again to recommend to the Minister that she follows her own instincts, which I have no doubt are in the direction of perestroika and glasnost, and take back to the Government the strong support for this approach from environmental bodies of various kinds, as expressed through public representatives in this House.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention briefly the question of appeals procedures, oral hearings and so on because, once again, this is a constant element in all the briefing submissions I have received.  There is concern at the lack of a proper appeals procedure and mechanism which really is seen as a serious defect.  It is recognised that there are two classes of appellants.  In my earlier speech I indicated the different elements in the equation that need to be taken into account &mdash; the central State authority, industry, the individual and so on.  One recognises that there are two different classes of appellant, one who wishes simply to protect the environment and the other that may be frustrated by a decision limiting commercial enterprise. I would have particular feelings and I would be inclined to be more suspicious and more hesitant in terms of commercial development which I thought was threatening to the environment but both of these could, in fact, be quite genuine.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that there is, for example, no automatic provision for an oral hearing into objections against licences issued by the agencies.  I would remind the Minister that oral hearings <Col N="1524" /> held by An Bord Pleanála have played a crucial role in ensuring that controversial issues are properly aired and sometimes result in significant improvement in planning conditions.  There is a fairly general consensus that there should be provision for oral hearings.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention one other matter which concerns me, that is the question of environmental impact statements. I recognise that these are regulated by certain statutory instruments &mdash; there is Statutory Instrument No. 349 of 1989; European Communities Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations, 1989 &mdash; and that such documents, which form part of the planning application, are filed with this, held at local planning authorities and publicly available for purchase. However, since one of the functions of the Environmental Protection Agency, as I understand it, is policy-making and educative, it would be a good idea, if possible, that copies of environmental impact assessment statements could be made available to the copyright libraries.  If we want to have some kind of feed into the third level educational system it is very important that these kind of materials are deposited strategically in the place where they will make the most impression and impact.  I have a couple of them here.  They are very detailed.  I have here a thick, copiously detailed and illustrated book of several hundred pages, An Environmental Impact Statement Concerning Redevelopment Strategy for Bord Gáis Éireann land in Grand Canal Quay, Dublin, and a non-technical summary, which is a small document. This is the kind of material that I believe should be deposited as a matter of course with university libraries.  They are not covered by the Copyright Act, I wonder if the Minister would have a look at the possibility of including some provision in the Environmental Protection Agency Bill to ensure that all the third level institutions receive copies of this kind of highly significant material so that they can be more relevant to the life of the country.</P>
    <P>I would like to express some concern in relation to the analogies that are so <Col N="1525" /> frequently drawn including, by people who briefed me, with An Bord Pleanála. As an aside, in parenthesis so to speak, in the light of recent and current developments and of the historic performance of An Bord Pleanála, I am not at all satisfied that this is a particularly happy model to choose.  I am sure the Minister will be as aware, as I am, of the defects of that body and take into account our unhappy experience with An Bord Pleanála in drawing any analogies or in setting it up as a model.</P>
    <P>With regard to the pollution control licence, at present the planning permission and environmental impact assessment will be done by the local authorities and not by the Environmental Protection Association.  Again, I feel the Environmental Protection Agency should be the authority looking after this area, particularly in the light of the direct interest local authorities would have. They are not disinterested parties in many of these areas.  It is impossible for them to take a fully objective view.  It is important that this be brought directly and clearly under the operation of the Environmental Protection Agency. There is not any satisfactory delineation of the areas of responsibility that are to be divided between An Bord Pleanála, on the one hand, about which I have just expressed reservations, and the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>I have already suggested when I was talking about the urban environment, traffic management, noise and air pollution control in the urban developed areas that I thought there was a concentration on industrial pollution.  I believe it would be correct to say there is a perceivable limitation in the scope of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill; for example, it does not deal with land use in the areas of forestry, mari-culture and agriculture as comprehensively as I believe it should.  These are all areas that have an impact upon the environment.</P>
    <P>The system of ministerial control itself is a complicated one and the very fact that it is complicated is likely to slow down the whole process.  If I can give an <Col N="1526" /> example to the Minister &mdash; and perhaps she will be able to consider this and respond to my difficulties in this area &mdash; mariculture licences, as I understand it, can be supervised by the Environmental Protection Agency but this is only done if the Minister for the Environment asks the Minister for the Marine for permission. There is a rather convoluted mechanism by which the Environmental Protection Agency is brought into play. This is a problem and perhaps it is one that can be resolved.  Again, we want a direct clear intervention by the Environmental Protection Agency, not clogged up by masses of red tape which would inhibit the effective operation of the agency.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, it is proposed &mdash; or at least it was certainly initially proposed &mdash; that funding should be on an annual basis.  The Minister has very kindly corrected my misunderstanding of the Bill on an earlier occasion.  Perhaps this has been changed, I wonder if it is still the case that it is on an annual basis?  If it is, I am not sure it would not be better if the Minister could give us a much longer-term commitment to the continuation of the agency.  We have seen a number of agencies operating generally within this area that were wound down rapidly and arbitrarily.  I would like some indication from the Minister that it will not be funded on this annual basis, that there will be a long term commitment, and that we can really put a very practical degree of support behind this Bill.</P>
    <P>In summary, I have tried to keep my remarks condensed, although there has been a very wide range of information to be digested and placed before the House because of the very remarkable interest there has been in this Bill both from individual members of the public and from a considerable number of statutory and voluntary bodies operating in the area of the environment.  I have placed on the record of the House some reservations, but I would not wish the Minister to think that I did not give a strong welcome to this Bill which I think is very important and forward looking.  I hope that at least some of the reservations and <Col N="1527" /> doubts I have expressed may be met by the Minister in her speech.  I congratulate her and the civil servants in her Department for producing what is potentially very fine legislation, from which I have no doubt whatsoever the country will benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill. I also welcome the fact that the Minister decided to initiate this legislation in the Seanad.  The Bill provides for the establishment of an Environmental Protection Agency.  This, we are told in the explantory memorandum, is the Bill's primary purpose.  The agency will have a wide range of functions, all relating to the protection of the environment.  These will include the control and regulation of all the activities which are listed in the First Schedule to the Bill.  It will also be the responsibility of the agency to provide support, back-up and advisory services to public authorities as well as promoting and co-ordinating environmental research and implementing an environmental monitoring programme.</P>
      <P>To put it in a nutshell, the agency is intended to be an independent, powerful and effective environmental watchdog.  It is small wonder then that this Bill has been welcomed by everyone with an interest in environmental matters. Indeed, I believe most people would accept the point made by the Minister in her speech introducing the Bill, that this is the most important and comprehensive piece of environmental legislation since the planning legislation of the early sixties.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister state that there had been extensive and wide ranging consultations in relation to the role and functions of the agency before the Bill was drafted.  The Minister implied that she considered that these consultations were worthwhile.  I suggest that the Minister should continue this consultation process in relation to the orders and regulations which she will be making under the legislation when it is enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1528" /> I accepted that the environmental committee, which will be established under the advisory committee under, this Bill, will have a role advising the Minister. However, I feel there should be an opportunity for representative bodies and groups to have their views taken into account regarding the orders and regulations which will be made under the legislation.</P>
    <P>The need for this legislation and for the establishment of an Environmental Protection Agency is widely acknowledged. Although this country has not suffered anything like the degree of environmental damage which some other countries have suffered, nevertheless the situation has not been improving in recent years.  The environment in Ireland is coming under increasing pressure from development.  There have been some very serious incidents of pollution of rivers and lakes and some significant fish kills have occurred.  There is a growing litter problem mainly due to the increasing use of non-biodegradable containers and packaging.  Indiscriminate dumping appears to be on the increase in many parts of the country.  Indeed, it is not unusual to drive along a main road in a scenic area and see two, three or more plastic bags of refuse dumped at the roadside.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, the serious smog problem, in Dublin has been largely resolved mainly due to the efforts of the Minister of State but there still remains the problem of traffic fumes.  In this regard some of the public transport and heavy vehicles on the streets of this city leave a lot to be desired.  In recent years there have been reports from various parts of the country of air pollution problems which have been caused or associated with industrial projects.</P>
    <P>The marine environment has suffered as a result of dumping industrial waste and sewage sludge at sea and also allegedly, as a result of the number of fish farming projects which have been established around the coast.  One of the country's finest and most important tourism resources is the River Shannon and it, too, is at serious risk from a number <Col N="1529" /> of quarters.  While we seem to be making some effort to come to grips with the problems posed by sewage inflows from towns and villages adjacent to the river, there is the growing problem of the direct discharge of waste from the increasing number of cruisers and other craft which are using or are moored on the Shannon waterway system.  In addition, there is the threat to the river from the build-up of peat silt which is being carried down into the river from the various Bord na Móna operations.</P>
    <P>In spite of these problems, however, I agree with the Minister that we have a relatively unspoiled environment.  The priority must be to keep it that way and, where possible, to address those areas in which there are problems at the moment and try to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>The existing environmental legislation, namely the Planning Acts, the Water Pollution Act, the Litter Act and the Derelict Sites Act, must be strictly enforced and the necessary resources must be made available to local authorities to do this.  The fact that adequate resources have not been available to local authorities in the past has created considerable difficulty.  There is little point in handing down environmental legislation to local authorities unless we provide them with the resources to implement that legislation.  In addition to implementing the legislation to which I have referred, local authorities are also made responsible in recent years for the implementation of various European Community Directives which were designed to protect the environment. Again, additional resources were not provided to enable them to do so with the maximum degree of efficiency.  It is small wonder then that to quote the Minister, difficulties began to arise.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said environmental protection in the area of licensing has become increasingly complex and specialised.  A high level of expertise and very sophisticated equipment are required to do the job properly.  A perceived lack of uniformity in the application and enforcement of environmental <Col N="1530" /> protection standards has led to growing public unease and disquiet.</P>
    <P>Controversies which arose in various parts of the country in relation to proposed and existing developments received wide publicity in the media.  All these factors have contributed to a growing lack of confidence in the existing procedures and have brought about the demand for a single expert independent body which would have the competence and the expertise to deal with the complex environmental and pollution issues associated with modern industry and major economic development.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House provides for the establishment of such a body which will be known as the Environmental Protection Agency.  This is a substantial Bill by any standards.  It contains 109 sections and two Schedules and it is divided into six parts.  The sections in Part I deal with such matters as interpretation, regulations and orders, offences and penalties and other standard provisions of a general nature.</P>
    <P>A couple of questions occurred to me when I read through Part I.  Section 6 confers on the Minister the right to make regulations and section 7 provides that the Minister may make orders under the Bill.  However, the procedure for the making of regulations differs from that for the making of orders.  In the case of orders the Bill provides that each proposed order shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and that the order shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by both Houses.</P>
    <P>Regulations, however, come into effect by default.  The Bill requires that regulations made under the Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas but each regulation is effective from the day on which it is made unless a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either House within the next 21 sitting days.  If such a resolution is not passed the regulation continues in existence.  Perhaps when the Minister is replying she might outline the reason for the differing procedures in the case of orders and regulations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1531" /> Section 10 in Part I deals with fines imposed under the Bill.  The section provides for the payment of such fines to the agency but in each case there must be a prior application by the agency to the court that the amount of the fine imposed be paid to the agency.  I wonder why this provision is necessary or why it was not considered possible or perhaps desirable that all fines imposed under the Environmental Protection Agency legislation would automatically be paid to the agency.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with the prosecution of offences under the Bill and it provides that the period of exposure to prosecution can be anything up to five years. There are two references in the section to the date on which the offence was committed.  The phrase &ldquo;the date on which the offence was committed&rdquo; is used twice in the section.  I believe some cases will arise under this legislation in which it will be very difficult to establish the exact date on which the offence was committed. Is it possible the use of the phrase &ldquo;the date on which the offence was committed&rdquo; may make it exceedingly difficult to prosecute successfully in such cases?</P>
    <P>Part II deals with the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency, its organisational structure, staffing and financial arrangements.  The agency will be managed by a director general and four other full-time directors.  The proceedings which must be followed in the appointment of the director general and the four other directors are provided for in this part of the Bill.  I understand that these procedures are similar to the procedures which obtain for the appointment of the Chairman of An Bord Pleanála or the Director of Public Prosecutions. I would like to welcome this proposed system of appointment because it will make a major contribution to ensuring the independence of the agency. In relation to the remuneration of the director general and the directors, the only point I would like to make is that I hope the salary scales will be at a level which will make the positions attractive <Col N="1532" /> to the best and most highly qualified candidates available.</P>
    <P>The only other proposal in Part II, on which I wish to comment, is the provision made for the establishment of an advisory committee to advise the Minister and the agency in relation to a range of matters which are outlined in section 28.  This will be a 12-person advisory committee and the majority of the members will be appointed from representatives nominated by community, environmental, professional and other organisations.  I support the recommendation which has already been made to the Minister during the course of this debate, that the General Council of County Councils should have at least one nominee appointed to the advisory committee.</P>
    <P>In her introductory speech the Minister acknowledged the contribution which local authorities have made to environmental protection because of their role in implementing existing environmental legislation.  Even after this Bill is passed they will still continue to have a central role to play alongside and hand-in-hand with the Environmental Protection Agency.  In view of this, it would be most desirable and essential that local authorities through the General Council of County Councils should have direct representation as of right on the proposed advisory committee.  Indeed, it would be my view that the county managers through their association would also have representation on the advisory committee. The county managers have a vast amount of experience and expertise in relation to environmental matters which would undoubtedly be of considerable benefit to the advisory committee.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill sets out the functions of the agency.  The general functions are listed in section 51 and there is provision that the Minister may make regulations giving it additional functions in the future.  In carrying out its functions the agency is obliged to ensure that there is a proper balance between the need to protect the environment and the need for infrastructural, economic and social progress and development.  The licensing mechanism, which is provided for in Part <Col N="1533" /> IV of the Bill, will be the key instrument available to the agency to enable it to ensure that this balance is achieved.</P>
    <P>The integrated licensing system which will replace the existing system of separate air, water and waste disposal licences will have a number of advantages. All the environmental impacts of a proposed development will be assessed at the same time.  This approach, which is referred to in the Bill as integrated pollution control, will result in a simpler and, at the same time, more efficient procedure which should be of benefit to the developer, the agency and to the environment.</P>
    <P>Section 82 sets out the procedures to be followed in processing applications for licences or in reviews of licences. However, there should be a recognition in this part of the Bill that not all objections will be motivated by a genuine concern for the environment.  Some will be vexatious or frivolous.  There should be a mechanism in the Bill to discourage objections of this nature.  If, for example, each objection had to be accompanied by a modest fee which would be refundable except in the case of objections found to be vexatious, this would have the effect of reducing the number of such objections. This, in turn, would speed up the operation of the agency and reduce the time involved in processing applications and genuine objections.</P>
    <P>It will be very important to have applications under the Bill processed as expeditiously as possible.  In this connection I give a particular welcome to section 82 (7).  This subsection states:</P>
    <P>It shall be a duty of the Agency to ensure that a decision by it to hold an oral hearing, and a decision by it on the application for a licence or on the review of a licence or revised licence, whether or not an oral hearing has been held, shall be given as expeditiously as may be and for that purpose the Agency shall take all such steps as are open to it to ensure that in so far as is practicable there are no avoidable delays at any stage in the consideration of objections.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1534" /> This is a very reassuring provision in the Bill.  The only major reservation which I have in relation to this part of the Bill is the fact there will be no appeal from a decision of the agency other than to the courts and there is no time limit on such an appeal.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that the Bill provides for public access to environmental information held by public authorities and, in particular, to the results of monitoring carried out by the agency. These provisions will have a very positive impact on public confidence in the operation of the agency and on the role which it will play during the years ahead in the protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the provisions in the Bill relating to the prevention and control of noise.  These provisions will be generally welcomed. Regulations controlling sources of noise and specifying maximum limits for noise may be made by the Minister and there is also provision for improved powers for local authorities to deal with local noise problems as well as for a District Court to become involved in situations where there are problems of neighbourhood noise.  These provisions relate to what, in my view, is a very important environmental matter.  I compliment the Minister on having incorporated them in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are many other points which occurred to me as I read through the various sections of the Bill, but I feel that these may be more appropriate to Committee Stage debate.  I will conclude by complimenting the Minister on having brought forward this very excellent and most important Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister, when she referred in her speech introducing this Bill to this House, to the protracted discussions she has had with many agencies and representatives, did not anticipate as lengthy a debate and such lengthy contributions as we have had so far.  However, I do not propose to add to that to any great extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the contributors, if not all of them, welcomed the Minister to the House.  I go further and welcome the <Col N="1535" /> Minister to the Department and, if she will excuse the pun, as one coming from the Dublin area, she brought a breath of fresh air to that Department and to the Dublin area.  This has been referred to by the previous speaker.  Her efforts to eliminate smog from the city were not totally successful, but it has been much easier to live in Dublin this winter than it has been for many winters past.  Much remains to be done in that regard and, indeed, Senator Mullooly referred to the traffic to which I also wish to refer, and particularly bus traffic.</P>
    <P>It would be no harm if the Minister had a word with the bus companies to see what contribution they could make to reducing air pollution in the city.  I do not often travel by bus, but when I do, and if I have to stand at a bus stop particularly in the peak hours between 5 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. &mdash; I stood at St. Stephen's Green for a brief while not so very long ago &mdash; I am appalled at the amount of pollution from traffic that falls on the footpath.  I urge the Minister to have another look at the position in the city of Dublin, not only regarding the amount of pollution from traffic but also the measures she has already taken.  She has successfully gone a long way towards eliminating smog from the city.  I think there were only two or three days of smog this winter and they were bearable.</P>
    <P>Indications in recent times are that the burning of bituminous coal is on the increase in the city.  I received information in recent days that coal is being bought in County Dublin and burned in the city.  Traders or consumers are finding a way round the measures that are in force because, of course, they are not breaking the law.  It is not illegal to burn the coal in the city; it is simply illegal to buy it or for a trader to sell it.  Since bituminous coal is getting into the city in increasing amounts, this is a matter that will have to be looked at again.  I am quite sure the Minister is aware of this and I have no doubt we will see some new measures for next winter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.  It is a good Bill <Col N="1536" /> and will work well.  I believe it is years overdue and we owe a great deal to the Minister, Deputy Harney, for having tackled this problem and for bringing in such a comprehensive Bill.  Having said that, I think it has some shortcomings which, perhaps, can be corrected on Committee Stage.  I will deal with that later.</P>
    <P>If we are to protect tourism, which I believe will be our greatest industry in the future, then we have to clean up our environment.  Many speakers, including the Minister herself, referred to the cleanliness of our environment compared to that of other European countries.  It is well to make that comparison, but I do not think it is enough.  Our environment is not as clean as it should be or as it might be, and it is certainly not as clean as it was ten years ago.  I regret this; I believe this is what the tourist of the future will be looking for &mdash; a clean country, a pleasant climate and a good environment.  I believe we are on the threshold of a great future in tourism if we can clean up our environment.</P>
    <P>This Bill will deal with future developments and with large scale developments in particular, and that is the impression I get from the Bill.  I believe it should liaise with the IDA to assess firms before a commitment is made to them by the IDA regarding location in this country.  In recent years we have been inclined to look too exclusively at the relief of unemployment that firms locating here will bring, although that is extremely important.</P>
    <P>The Minister said she did not see the agency as an anti-industry agency.  To protect our tourism industry we have to protect our clean air and environment.  I cannot over-emphasise the importance of protecting the tourism industry.  We leaned on agriculture for many years as our greatest industry; the tide has now turned and I believe we may lean, in the future, on tourism.  However, we all have to make a contribution to that.  We have seen in recent times how certain industries which had been given permission by the IDA to locate here, had to withstand a tussle with An Bord Pleanála and with <Col N="1537" /> the courts.  I hope that this agency will put an end to that and that we will never again see the spectacle seen in the south of Ireland in recent years.  I hope we will never again hear an official of the IDA being critical of the citizens of that part of the country for doing what I hope this agency will do in the future.</P>
    <P>I would hope that there would be cooperation between all those concerned &mdash; the IDA, local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency, when it is set up &mdash; to ensure that we do not have a battle as to whether an industry should settle here or be told to take their trade elsewhere.  I believe the agency will do that.  I believe it will improve matters in that regard, but I have great misgivings regarding smaller developments.  I can see very little, if anything, in the Bill to direct the agency to smaller local developments which would affect the environment.  That is still being left in the hands of the local authorities &mdash; and, indeed, I would have to say some local authorities have fallen short of their responsibilities with regard to keeping the environment clean.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will be able to satisfy this House that when set up the agency will ensure that all developments, large and small, proposed or existing, which are injurious to the environment, whether through water pollution, air pollution, land pollution or visual pollution, will be monitored.  I am not sure that the Bill should not have an extended title. Rather than Environmental Protection Agency Bill perhaps it should be something like the Environmental Protection and Restoration Agency Bill, because our land is being polluted and has been polluted.  Our air and our waters have been polluted.  But this has not happened to any great extent, as stated by the Minister, compared to other countries in Europe.</P>
    <P>We have the European blue flag awards for beaches.  Many beaches in Ireland applied for this award over the last few years.  In 1989, 49 Irish beaches applied for the award and 35 received it. That is a fairly high proportion of awards for our beaches.  But when one considers <Col N="1538" /> our position on the extreme west of Europe, well out into the Atlantic, we ourselves can keep our beaches clean and we cannot blame others for polluting them.  I think the percentage of blue flag awards should therefore have been higher.  I do not have the national figures for 1990.  I hope there was an improvement. Of the seven beaches that applied for the blue flag award in Dublin county, five received it in 1989.  I am sorry to say that while an increased number of beaches in County Dublin applied for this award in 1990 &mdash; nine in all &mdash; only four received it.  That is to be regretted, but I am sure there must be some explanation for it.</P>
    <P>I would not be happy, and I do not think the Minister should be happy, until we see all of these beaches proudly boast of a blue flag award.  Other beaches should be entered for the award.  What a grand tourism heading that would provide for the European market.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to smaller developments. Now I will be parochial, because I have seen some developments take place in the immediate neighbourhood of Dublin about which nothing has been done.  In the Dublin mountains over the last number of years we have had the burning of city waste material to extract copper and lead.  This caused great pollution and annoyance to the people of the area.  I was involved, as I am sure other public representatives were, in drawing the attention of Dublin County Council to this activity.  The location of the activity and the people concerned, are well known.  The council did what they could, but all they succeeded in doing was running them out of County Dublin and now this activity is taking place just across the border at Glencree in County Wickow.  Acres and acres of the mountain have been spoilt.  Grouse or other birds will not nest there for years to come and if one drives through the by-ways at that particular spot in the mountain one cannot get out of the car.  Indeed, one would have to wash the wheels of the car before one could bring it back to one's own property because this black silt <Col N="1539" /> comes with it and if one walks the mountain it sticks to one's shoes.  This form of pollution has been taking place for a number of years and nobody seems to be able to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>I have been in touch with Dublin County Council about this and they have succeeded in running it across the border into County Wicklow.  I have been in touch with Wicklow County Council and I have been in touch with Powerscourt Demesne who are the owners of the mountain, and they have done all in their power to stop this from happening, but it has proved impossible.  What will this agency do with regard to this local problem? This is local to Glencree and Dublin but I am sure it is happening in other parts of the country as well.</P>
    <P>A development took place on the banks of the Poulaphouca Lakes six or seven years ago.  I am not sure whether permission was given by An Bord Pleánála or by Wicklow County Council but it is a development which is situated right on the banks of the lakes as you cross the bridge from Blessington.  This is one of the most scenic areas in this part of the world.  There is a most beautiful view from the bridge which is admired by hundreds of thousands of tourists, both national and foreign, in summertime and also, at this time of the year.  I was up there on Sunday last and there were traffic jams at many of the junctions because of the number of Dublin people going to the mountains.  Later on in the year they make for the sea, but at this time of the year they make for the mountains when the hardness of winter is over and the evenings begin to get longer. Here we have this development by a body, I am ashamed to say, that should have been more concerned about the environment.  The Dublin Metropolitan Regatta Committee have built a hideous building on the banks of the lake causing not only visual pollution but possible pollution of the waters.  Local regattas are held there during the year and international regattas take place on the lake drawing hundreds of people.  Washing and showering facilities are adjacent to <Col N="1540" /> the Clargester sewerage storage area which has to be emptied and cannot be allowed to over-flow.  If one was to leave a tap running it is likely that that tank would over-flow.  I was appalled to see from a notice on the side of the building that they were boasting that the building was sponsored by Bord Fáilte, the ESB and the Department of Education and that it was grant-aided by Cospóir.  Last year the notice disappeared.  Perhaps they anticipated the Bill.  Perhaps people are getting more conscious of what we should be doing for the environment. This is a development which must be tackled if we are to improve our environment. That is where I find fault with the Bill.  While it will deal with future developments and prevent pollution, I find nothing in it to deal with pollution already taking place.  I would like the Bill to be strengthened there.</P>
    <P>I would also like to add my voice to those who have already suggested that a member or two of the General Council of County Councils should be appointed to the agency.  I know the Minister will give this matter serious consideration and if at all possible I am sure she will accede to the request of many Senators here.  It is important that there should be a tie-in with local public representatives.  This body meets regularly and has very important discussions.</P>
    <P>I doubt if the proposed funding is adequate.  The Minister mentions £8 million, £4 million of which will be accounted for by the transfer of staff.  I do not know if that includes property, or if it will have to purchase property, or if there is property already there which can be transferred.  I would like the Minister to go into the funding in more detail and explain how the agency is going to operate when it is set up.  It will have to have many premises throughout the country and it will have to have headquarters. I would like to know where the headquarters will be, or if arrangements have already been made.</P>
    <P>The nation is waiting for this Bill.  I would compliment the Minister on bringing the Bill forward in such a way that it was not rushed.  The Minister has been <Col N="1541" /> conscious of the state of the environment for some considerable time; but despite that she took her time and consulted with many people, which was the correct way to go about it.  I cannot see the agency doing what it is expected to do by those watching its passage through this House without more funding.  I would rather see a figure of £20 million available because it has an enormous job to do and the sooner we get it up and running the better.  It is an enormous task not only to prevent future pollution but to rid the country of pollution.</P>
    <P>I hope when the Minister is replying that she will address the problem of existing developments which are polluting our environment.  I cannot stress sufficiently the importance of getting the environment back to what it was ten or 20 years ago.  We have a bright future in tourism if we can do that, and not only in the American market but in the European market.  I have no doubt that Europeans will flock here if we can give them a clean environment together with good services and hotels.  We are here today to ensure that this Bill passes from this House to the other House as fast as possible, and we hope that it will restore our environment to what it was ten or 20 years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OlgaBennett" hpid="Mrs. Bennett Mrs. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I compliment the Minister of State for having introduced this important and complex Bill in the Seanad thus giving this House the opportunity to fulfil its role as a formulator of legislation.  It is not necessary for me to remind the House that the environment has become a much more important issue over the last number of years.  Some commentators dismiss concern about the environment as a new fashion which will pass in time. I disagree with this.  I believe that people are becoming more aware of the fragile nature of our environment and are becoming more willing to make sacrifices to protect it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to recognise that any legislation relates only to minimum standard objectives but the main purpose <Col N="1542" /> must be to achieve much higher standards. There can be very few people who are unaware of the dreadful damage which can be caused to our environment by pollution.  We have many examples both at home and abroad of how easy it is to pollute and how dreadfully difficult it is, as regards expense to the Government and local authorities, to clean up pollution at a later date.  We are lucky that heavy industry has largely passed us by. The giant steelworks and petrochemical industries which have ruined many areas of continental Europe are unknown in this island.  The main purpose of the Bill is to create a much higher environmental standard.  We cannot, however, rest on our laurels.  It is vitally important that we implement the necessary legislation to protect our environment.  Many people feel that little can be done.  However, I would like to draw your attention to the present quality of air in Dublin, as mentioned by previous speakers, compared to the quality of air in Dublin last year. We were told by many people that vested interests would prevent anything from being done about this but we can now see the dramatic effect of proper legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on the courageous stand she took in banning bituminous coal in Dublin last year.  Last week we had freezing fog but there was no smog with it.  On checking the reading for that day the micrograms per cubic metre were 65.  The same weather conditions last year would have given a reading of well over 1,000.  The EC standard is 250, so we were well below it.  In my local authority area prior to the banning of bituminous coal the reading was over 1,000.  At no point this year has the EC regulation been breached.  Next year we will have even better and lower figures because some people stockpiled on bituminous coal which they have been using this year.</P>
    <P>Senator McMahon was talking about blue flags.  We are very disappointed that we did not get a blue flag for Dublin, in Dollymount of all places.  We queried it and the reason given was that if they gave <Col N="1543" /> us a blue flag we would upset the wildlife. Basically what they were saying was that they did not want too many people going on the beach because they did not want the birds to be disturbed.  We were rather disappointed.  We feel that we should have got it but maybe the Senator would look into it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OlgaBennett" hpid="Mrs. Bennett Mrs. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>It was rather strange but that was the reason.  The water pollution and air pollution Acts have ensured that the public are protected.  I welcome the independence of the Environmental Protection Agency which ensures that no longer can a finger be pointed at Government Departments or local authorities. Although we had no vested interest, we were accused of that in the past.  The independence of this agency is of paramount importance.</P>
      <P>In the past some local authorities have been offenders with regard to pollution but now they must lead by example. Monitoring is an essential ingredient and feature of environmental protection but legislation in the past has failed through lack of follow-up and enforcement.  No longer should information be withheld by Government agencies or local authorities from the public.  The public must be made fully aware and kept reliably informed at all times.</P>
      <P>Laying down conditions under planning is the norm but complying with them has not been strictly enforced.  There is always a need to balance the needs of the environment with the needs of industry. We cannot turn back the clock to a time when there was no need for industrial development.  This country needs industrial development but it must fit in with the surrounding environment.  There is no long-term profit in ruining our beautiful environment for short-term gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill as it has achieved a reasonable balance between the requirements of the environment and the requirements of industry.  The Minister said she was determined that this agency should not be seen as anti-industry.  It will be pro-environment and that means it <Col N="1544" /> will be anti dirty industry, anti dirty agriculture and anti dirty pollution.  I trust that the agency will be as vigilant in following up possible breaches by local authority agencies as they will be in following up breaches by multinational firms.  It is very important in the area of environmental protection that legislation be seen to be implemented on an even handed basis.</P>
    <P>Many different bodies and agencies involved in protecting a cleaner environment recommend setting up an advisory committee involving all those bodies with the agency.  There are many voluntary groups who have an input to make to the environment action programme and they should be catered for within the agency.  It would also be appropriate if environmental research were instituted in third level colleges.  I welcome the new research body, recently formed between the universities and third level institutions, which is prepared to offer constructive advice to the new agency. This is a voluntary group that can make a positive contribution on environmental issues.  This body is partially funded by Europe.  Industry should be invited to foster further research in the area of the environment by way of grants and research programmes.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the obligation laid down under section 75 of the Bill by which an equal labelling scheme will be introduced. This will allow the use of a special symbol on products which meet specified environmental criteria.  Ever since the awareness of the green lobby, there has been a worrying trend for many products to appear carrying a green tinge in either their advertising or their packaging.  One sometimes wonders as to the validity of these claims.  In the absence of a recognised environmental quality mark, it is open to unscrupulous manufacturers to abuse the consumers' desire to be environmentally aware.  Many shoppers take packaging at its face value.  If the packaging is green, if it has the word &ldquo;environment&rdquo; or &ldquo;environment friendly&rdquo; somewhere on the front of the box, then regrettably many people assume it is somehow environmentally <Col N="1545" /> superior to its competitors.  In many cases the opposite may be true.  I look forward to an early introduction of this labelling system and trust it will be of benefit both to the environment and to the environmentally aware consumer.</P>
    <P>Agricultural productivity has greatly increased due mainly to mechanisation and to the use of artificial fertilizers.  In recent decades further development has come through the intensive rearing of lifestock.  Associated with this change in animal husbandry has been the growing use of grass silage as fodder for cattle and all farm produce for pig and poultry feed. To a large extent these recent developments have changed the nature of farming and upset the harmonious relationship with the natural environment. In many cases the farming enterprise has taken on the attributes of industry and, in common with other industries, has developed a considerable potential to cause environmental damage.  Much of this potential arises from the need to dispose of wastes which in smaller amounts under traditional farming systems were formerly recycled as fertilizer or fodder for other crops.  The amount of waste generated from farming activities exceeds that arising in sewerage systems and industry due to the highly concentrated nature of the waste, such as silage effluent and manure slurry.  They have the potential to cause serious pollution particularly if discharged directly into our waters.  The chief effect of such waste in our waters leads, as we all know, to fish kills, the number of which has increased over the last few years.  The Environmental Protection Agency must create a greater awareness.  Efforts to protect the environment should be rewarded and substantial fines imposed where proven lack of concern has been shown.  The aforementioned recommended reward for effort could take the form of an environment assurance award.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill deals with noise. Will the agency deal with the monitoring of noise from aircraft?  Part VI section 105 startes that it does not apply to aircraft noise.  I have had many letters from residents in the airport area who are rather <Col N="1546" /> disturbed about the noise from aircraft that fly during the night.  Apparently they have been in touch with the Department of the Environment, the tourist office and Aer Lingus.  They just got acknowledgements to their letters.  They are concerned about this.  There are restrictions in Heathrow Airport and in De Gaulle Airport which have cut down on the numbers of aircraft flying from 23.00 hours to 0.700 hours.  This is something Dublin could look at.</P>
    <P>We should link quality assurance with environmental awareness and an environmental promotion programme should be instituted.  Environmental education is now a must from primary school up.  Environmental impact statements are very good on their own, but the agency must lay down guidelines and codes of practice to achieve standards and to keep the public informed.  It must not be afraid to release information.  It must realise that the adult population of Ireland are most discerning when it comes to assessing information released with the interest of public health and safety in mind.  There is a desire on behalf of most people to be more environmentally aware.  One only has to look at the increase in the sale of unleaded petrol, the relative ease with which smokeless fuel was introduced into Dublin and the many other examples which were highlighted in this House during a recent debate on waste recycling.  I look forward to the agency aiding this trend.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill as it represents one of the most important developments in environmental protection that we have seen.</P>

      <P>Like other Members I give <Col N="1547" /> the Bill a general and wholehearted welcome but there are certain areas where it could be amended.  The general thrust of the Bill is welcome.  It is doubly welcome because the general environment is a good one.  We are not too late in introducing this measure.  Our European neighbours in particular eastern Europe, France, Germany and the heavily industrialised nations, have allowed their environments to deteriorate so fast that in many cases measures to stem the decay have been taken too late.  Although there were some atrocious incidents here which polluted the environment, this Bill recognises the fact that we have a tremendous asset in our environment and that we are not going to allow it to be polluted and wasted as some of our neighbours have done.  For that, the Government and the Minister are to be highly commended.</P>
      <P>To some extent we have been fairly casual because we know that Ireland is a relatively pollution-free country.  We have enjoyed this and accepted the luxury of such an environment but we should not become careless about it.  It is time we faced up to the problems.  As one of the Members of this House who is not a councillor, I have an innate suspicion of giving county councillors powers which affect the environment too directly.  In many cases there are real difficulties and dilemmas facing county councillors with conflicts of interest between the environment, employment and industrialisation in their particular area.  I do not wish to be in any way sensational in mentioning the recent planning scandals or the substantial number of material contraventions of the Dublin development plan by introducing section 4 motions. There have been serious problems for the environment as a result of councillors introducing those motions.  If this Bill tackles that problem it will have done a great service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the purposes of this Bill is to remove from the direct political arena those areas where councillors find themselves with an obvious conflict of interest. I hope we will have no more section 4 motions but rather an agency which <Col N="1548" /> directs that the environment takes priority over commercial interests.  I hope also that the Environmental Protection Agency will have a direct input into the development plans especially as they affect Dublin but also as they affect other counties.  If the EPA counters the trend of commercialism taking priority over care for the environment it will indeed be doing a great service.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the three principal ingredients of this Bill.  The first one she mentioned was to be independent of Government.  I welcome that because it is &mdash; although she would not acknowledge it &mdash; a direct criticism of many of the bodies which are set up by Government and semi-State bodies.  Although there are major imperfections in the model the Minister hopes to set up, I hope it will serve as an example to other semi-State bodies.  I am tired, and many of the people in this House are tired, of seeing Government appointments to semi-State bodies which make them purely instruments for Government policy.  There are too many quangos in this country.  There are too many rewards for political service. Party people who have been loyal at election time are rewarded by appointments to various semi-State bodies controlled by the Government.  That is unacceptable.  It should have ended a long time ago but it is practised by all political parties.  It is very refreshing to see that this model tackles that problem. I do not think it tackles it as effectively as it might but it is a start in acknowledging that the Government should not be able to appoint their friends to positions of this sort as a reward for political service.  There is no suggestion in this Bill that that will happen in the case of the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets up a committee which selects three candidates for the post of the very important and delicate post of director general.  That committee consists of the Secretary to the Government, the Secretary of the Department of the Environment, the Chairperson of An Taisce.  The Managing Director of the IDA, the General Secretary of the ICTU <Col N="1549" /> and the Chief Executive of the Council for the Status of Women.  This is a start. I was not aware that was the model on which the DPP had been set up but I am very glad to hear it.  However, it is inadequate because in the end the setting up of this committee still leaves the appointments within Government control. Whereas all these people are undoubtedly very honourable and people of great expertise in their own field, I am not quite sure how or why they have been selected.  It is quite apparent that although this committee is at arm's length in regard to the Minister and the Government, the Secretary to the Government, the Secretary of the Department of the Environment &mdash; perhaps not the Chairperson of An Taisce &mdash; the Managing Director of the IDA and the Chief Executive of the Council for the Status of Women are all subject to some sort of Government pressure and influence. Many are themselves Government appointees and, as a result, they are subject and vulnerable to Government influence.</P>
    <P>It would have been more courageous, but politically, very difficult for the Minister, if the committee she set up to make the appointments consisted of people who had no relationship, directly or indirectly, with the Government.  In other words, perhaps it would have been more appropriate if other environmental groups had direct nomineees to that committee, for example the Irish Wildbird Conservancy, or Coast Watch and numerous other groups whose whole purpose of existence is the preservation of the environment.  The appointment of the Chairperson of An Taisce should stand.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the Minister felt unable to go the whole way and set up an advisory committee which is environmental, pure and simple, through and through, and where the appointments, although at arms' length, are not Government appointments.  In the end, the Minister retains enormous power in the area of appointments because the Minister can define the terms of reference and the <Col N="1550" /> quality of the candidates in giving instructions to that committee and the Government can refuse to appoint the committee's choice.</P>
    <P>I hope &mdash; I do not think it is the intention of the Bill &mdash; that this is not a cosmetic exercise which will result in it turning out once again to be an appointment within the Government's gift and that this committee is only a thin layer which disguises political patronage.  I have no doubt that is not the intention of the Bill but the Government can refuse to appoint any of the candidates suggested by the committee and can also remove the director general.  Section 21 (15) states that he &ldquo;may be removed from office by the Government if, in their opinion, he has become incapable through ill health of effectively performing his duties, or for stated mis-behaviour&rdquo; which is a very vague term or if his removal appears to the Government to be necessary or desirable.  That gives the Government a free hand to remove the director general.  If a Government were determined that a director was to be removed from his post they could remove this person not, for reasons of ill-health, but simply because they did not like them or because they were in conflict with the Government or disagreed with the Government.  I question the independence of this appointment and the independence of the board.  Whereas this is a great improvement on the selection of directors in many semi-State bodies, which is a scandal, it could have gone the whole hog and made sure that the Government were completely removed from the appointment of the directors and the director general of the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>The second main ingredient of the Bill is effective powers for the agency.  Like Senator McMahon I think that while the powers may be adequate in the way they are stated in the Bill, the budget which the agency has been given will be totally inadequate to do the job many Members of this House envisage for it.  It is limited to £8 million.  It has power to prosecute, to hold inquiries and to publish reports on pollution but it will not be able to hold <Col N="1551" /> many inquiries, pay many staff or publish many reports on pollution out of £8 million.  That unfortunately is a very small amount with which to run a Government-controlled agency.  I do not know the scale of the agency's programme but if the budget is only £8 million and if £4 million of that is for the transfer of staff I do not envisage the scale as being great. It will be extremely limited in its scope and in its geographical influence if its budget is restricted to this small amount. Maybe it is intended by the Government that it shall expand year by year and that when it has earned its spurs after the first or second year it will increase its budget. It is obvious that it will be necessary for the EPA to expand and increase its influence.</P>
    <P>Its greatest power is obviously the issuing of licences and I welcome that.  Like Senator Norris, I have reservations about the fact that many of these powers are covered by ministerial regulation as are the parameters within which it works.  It is worrying to many legislators that so much law is at the discretion of the Minister of the day.  It is bad law.  The effect of allowing ministerial regulations to creep into legislation is that Ministers are making and repealing laws day by day and at will.  That is an anti-democratic facet of this and many other Bills because basically the Dáil and the Seanad are being by-passed.  The Minister enacts regulations in response to certain situations. The problem with that is one Minister may make very different decisions from another Minister and the regulations do not come before the Dáil or Seanad.  This is a trend which is creeping into a great deal of legislation and it should be examined because it gives <i>carte blanche</i> to a Minister to make policy decisions for which he or she is not answerable.</P>
    <P>Senators McMahon and Bennett spoke at some length about the environmental situation in Dublin and also in Dublin Bay.  There is urgent need for protection. The first thing that should be done is that two appalling chimneys at the Poolbeg generating station in Ringsend should be <Col N="1552" /> removed.  Dublin Bay is one of our greatest assets and it is atrocious to see those two ugly chimneys belching out fumes day in day out and spoiling the view of Dublin Bay for miles around.  It is an eyesore on one of our greatest assets. The EPA should first of all look at ways and means of removing these or changing the generating station because they are an absolutely ghastly welcome to Dublin for anybody coming in by sea.  They spoil the view of Howth from the Wicklow Mountains and <i>vice versa.</i>  Apart from the generating station we may regard the bay as a wasting asset.  It is a wonderful asset which is being polluted by dirt, smells and sewage.  It is generally a disgrace. I do not know enough about protecting the environment to say if the pollution of Dublin Bay, both on the seashore and in the sea is beyond redemption. However, I know enough about it to know that the damage is quite unforgiveable. We have done things for which future generations will not thank us.  The pressures on Dublin Bay are huge.</P>
    <P>We have an extraordinary concentration of population in Dublin which has doubled in the last century and the industrial and commercial pressures on the port are obviously disproportionate to industrial and commercial pressures which are imposed on other ports of this size.  It is not as though we have not had warning of the difficulties and of the pollution of Dublin Bay.  It was in the last century that it was safe for shellfish to be in Dublin Bay.  I do not think it has been safe since then.  One of the greatest assets of the bay has actually not been available to us for nearly 100 years.  They were dangerous to health because the bay was polluted even in those days, but since then, people are conscious of the increasing pollution of the bay.  It is a terrible reflection on our disregard for this asset that bathing is only available in some areas of the bay now.  It is distinctly dangerous to bathe in areas such as Blackrock and on the south side of Bull Island.  That has happened only in the last 20 or 30 years.  Within my memory people were bathing happily in Blackrock and on Merrion Strand.  That was not all <Col N="1553" /> that long ago.  It is a great asset.  Bull Island and other areas are lucky in that they receive up to 10,000 visitors a day from all over the country.  All those areas are also being polluted by sewage and industrialisation.</P>
    <P>We are privileged that in the flora and fauna of Dublin Bay we have wild fowl and wading birds on Bull Island.  It was designated as a biosphere reserve by UNESCO.  An interpretative centre has been set up there.  Dublin is quite obviously unique as a wetland centre in a European capital city.  I do not think any other European capital city has quite such natural resources in terms of wetland. The Howth cliffs have wonderful seabird colonies.  From Dalkey to Sandycove there is massive fauna, many of them extremely rare.  Booterstown Marsh holds uncommon plant species and wildfowl.  Booterstown Marsh, as everybody knows, is &mdash; in what is very close to a criminal act &mdash; in danger of being destroyed.  It is vital that Dublin Bay should be preserved for the purposes of conservation, education and health.  All three of these particular qualities are in danger.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Environmental Protection Agency as one of its initial objectives will decide to examine not just the water quality of Dublin Bay, which has been examined at some length recently, but the shore quality of Dublin Bay and as a result come out with a report not only that pollution cannot be allowed to deteriorate there but how the situation can be improved and how those areas that have already been polluted can actually be restored.</P>
    <P>I know it is a very tall order.  The principal problem in Dublin Bay is the sewage problem.  The answer to the difficulties which we have with the sewage problem is that it is extremely expensive to introduce what they call tertiary sewage treatment, particularly in Dublin Bay.  There are different methods of treating sewage. Some of the sewage in Dublin Bay is simply untreated.  Some of it has been treated by what they call primary treatment. Some has been treated by secondary treatment.  Basically the <Col N="1554" /> differences are in terms of degree and in how much organic matter they remove. The real solution is the use of what they call tertiary treatment, which is the most sophisticated treatment of sewage which can possibly be introduced.</P>
    <P>Dublin Bay is crying out for tertiary treatment of sewage.  That, I gather from the best estimates which one can get, would cost £100 million plus.  It would be money well spent.  It is a classic case of where we could spend some of the money we are going to receive from privatisation. It could be spent on capital expenditure in this particular area.  Tertiary sewage would be an item of capital expenditure which would last for generations and which would be appropriate for the sort of capital that we are going to get from the privatisation of Irish Life and Irish Sugar.  It is most important that that capital is not made part of current Government spending, as is threatened by the difficulties into which we are now sailing.  It is most important that we pigeonhole that money and use it for capital expenditure of a sort which will last a long time.  A tertiary sewage treatment plant for Dublin is an appropriate place for this money to be actually spent.</P>
    <P>We also need to do a serious study of and make a serious plan for Dublin Bay. It was quite extraordinary, when researching this, to find that so little has been written on the dangers to Dublin Bay, especially on the actual sewage content. There is very little information on the algae.  There is very little information available on the actual scientific effects which sewage is having on various areas of Dublin Bay.  We know from surveys that have been done that fauna have been driven out of polluted areas.  We know that the worst area is between Butt Bridge and Poolbeg.  We know that various areas are totally unsuitable for bathing. I am talking about the South Wall. We know that in Blackrock a polluted stream runs in unchecked and we know that we are certainly in breach of the EC water bathing directive in various areas.</P>
    <P>We also know that salmonella bacteria was discovered in Dollymount in 1988. We know that the worst sewage is in the <Col N="1555" /> Blackrock to Seapoint area.  This is as a result of the untreated sewage discharged to the west pier in Dún Laoghaire.  We know all that, but what we do not know is what we can actually do about it.  There is a hotch-potch approach of plugging problems when they arise, breaching EC directives from time to time and hoping that we do not breach them in the next year.</P>
    <P>There are other concerns about Dublin Bay with which we should also deal.  The condition of the shores and of the shoreline waters which are polluted by the accumulation of algae and of sewage solids should be examined.  We also need to look at the pollution by the river Tolka and other streams which flow into Dublin Bay.  The Environmental Protection Agency could do us a great service by insisting on continuous monitoring of all these particular difficulties in Dublin Bay itself.  I do not know how much of its limited budget that would take up, but it would be doing us a great service if it started such monitoring.</P>
    <P>Another thing which the Environmental Protection Agency could usefully do is to take over the powers of local authorities where particularly objectionable schemes are proposed.  I am thinking in particular of Dún Laoghaire at the moment where plans are afoot for an infill of 70 acres in the West Pier area.  Even the suggestion of this is an abomination; it is unnatural.  It has not been scientifically investigated.  It is a terrible reflection on the sort of society we live in that, for commercial reasons, it can even be contemplated that 70 acres of our most natural asset and of our most beautiful environment should actually be filled in.  That scheme is so offensive that the Environmental Protection Agency could certainly do us a great favour by killing it dead at birth.  It should not allow, for commercial reasons, plans to destroy one of our most natural assets.</P>
    <P>With regard to the west pier in Dún Laoghaire, what is proposed there is the building of 600 houses, supermarkets, car parks and various other commercial facilities to be imposed after 70 acres of <Col N="1556" /> the sea have been filled in.  No reason has ever been given for this but discussions are afoot with property developers about it.  The only possible reason for this is because the sea is cheap.  They will not have to buy land to put housing there. The offence to the environment is so enormous that I think it would be unforgiveable to even contemplate a plan like that.  Once again, we would be offending the natural environment by stopping not only all the seafaring activities which go on there including, obviously, swimming, sailing, surf boarding and other activities, but we would also be affecting one of the most wonderful wetlands in Europe where birds migrate in winter.  Apparently, that does not seem to matter particularly to Dún Laoghaire Corporation which is, astonishingly, going ahead and discussing this plan with property developers. I do not think for one moment that it should be allowed beyond the first stage.  Once plans go beyond the first stage, they have a habit of getting to the next stage and then actually developing a momentum of their own, which enables them &mdash; sometimes due to improper pressure on councillors &mdash; to go ahead and destroy the environment before it can be stopped.</P>
    <P>Water quality should be improved.  The environment should be protected, particularly in Dublin; the coastal water quality should certainly be tackled.  I have examined Dublin Bay beach by beach and it is all in danger.  A lot has been said about blue flags by previous Senators.  It is my understanding that we have far fewer blue flags than we had some years ago. The only outstanding water quality award in Dublin was in Shanganagh, County Dublin, and the blue flag has been removed from there.</P>
    <P>We should also look at the situation where people own private beaches.  It may come as a strange suggestion from me, but it is something that we can no longer tolerate in Ireland.  Beaches should no longer be privately owned. There are still private beaches in Dublin Bay.  This is a public amenity for which the Environmental Protection Agency <Col N="1557" /> and other agencies must take responsibility. While we cannot confiscate private beaches, the era of private beaches should be over.  These beaches should be open to all members of the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.  I welcome the Minister for State to the House and commend her for bringing forward this Bill. The testimony to that is here almost 100 per cent attendance here during what must rank as one of the longest debates in the Seanad.  The many contributions from both sides of the House indicate the interest, commitment and concern of all of us in this House.  Many of us are members of local authorities and see various problems from time to time at first hand.  Others in their work or in connection with their nominating bodies see the problem of the environment which is becoming more obvious to all of us in recent years.</P>
      <P>I read an article recently in which it was indicated that there was a time when chimney stacks with smoke bellowing from them was seen as prosperity for an area.  For many years that was probably the case.  Nowadays, we are more likely to be worried about the question of unemployment and the provision of jobs. We are trying to get cleaner industry, cleaner air, cleaner environment and to protect our natural resources.  If we do not get it right in relation to the protection of the environment and if this agency is not set up and working well, if it becomes another body that will attend to matters in a half-hearted manner, it will not be able to take effective decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will not be able to bring in retrospective legislation in later years to correct these wrongs.  The damage will have been done for ever and we will not be able to solve the problems that arise.  It is very important that the Minister moves ahead with all possible speed to ensure that the agency is set up as soon as possible. What sort of a timescale does she envisage?  This has to be debated in the <Col N="1558" /> Dáil, but when the Bill is put through the Houses and signed by the President, has the Minister plans for getting the agency up and running?  Undue delay would be a sign that we are not taking the protection of the environment seriously.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that a certain amount of money will be provided this year and that something like £8 million will be provided in a full year.  It is important that this agency does not have the problems which have bedevilled the Ombudsman's Office, the Garda Complaints Board and An Bord Pleanála.  If they are moving, they are going at a funeral pace, very slowly.  There have been problems with lack of staff, lack of decision making and, at times, a lack of commitment from the relevant Minister once the body had been set up.  I urge the Minister to ensure that she does not set up an agency with obvious drawbacks. The staff must have the expertise, finance and numbers to do what has to be done. The necessary staff, finance and powers must be made available.  It is important that the necessary directives and regulations be brought forward without delay.</P>
    <P>It will take a while for this agency to get moving and it is important that the groundwork be done and that the local authorities set out the guidelines.  At times we have had legislation dealing with derelict sites, unfinished estates and enforcement matters under planning legislation.  It can become a war of attrition to get things done.  If there is a fault or a problem in an area it should not be necessary for some individual to take a legal action, as happened in the Hanrahan case with Merck, Sharpe and Dohme.  I know Senator Doyle had an interest in this case.  What would be the position had they not won?  They would have had to sell their farm.  I hope the agency will be able to take on board some of these cases, particularly where it appears that there is a genuine complaint, and that it will not be left to an individual to put everything &mdash; the house and their business &mdash; on the line if his rights are being infringed.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the agency can take on cases, get itself involved and make sure that <Col N="1559" /> defenceless people in our society are not going to bear the brunt of possible excessive legal costs.</P>
    <P>It is also very important, as it is with something like the Ombudsman's Office and other bodies, that an annual report be brought in and debated by both Houses.  I know the Minister has a special interest and a special commitment in relation to this area and will not say: &ldquo;I will set up the agency and off it goes&rdquo;. She will investigate complaints from the board in relation to directives, regulations or difficulties with local authorities, or difficulties with other Government Departments.  There can be nothing worse than seeing various Departments involved and one Department saying it is not their responsibility while another Department says it is not theirs, with the agency in between trying to act as a referee.  It is important that a report be drawn up on a periodic basis and that the Minister can act in relation to questions coming from the report.</P>
    <P>The question of how we develop this agency in relation to the European dimension is important.  We must look at how the environment has been protected elsewhere and, in particular, learn from catastrophes such as Chernobyl or the ongoing problem of Sellafield.  I would urge the Minister, with her colleagues, to keep pressing for the closure of Sellafield, because the problems which have arisen in that area, particularly in relation to deaths that have taken place, will continue.</P>
    <P>In relation to the appointment of the director general under section 31, is the Minister happy that he will be independent of the Government?  It is important that this agency have the power to carry out their functions.  It is important that they are not hamstrung by the Government.  The agency should be accountable to both Houses of the Oireachtas and be able to receive from both Deputies and Senators, representations regarding a particular area. As in vandalism the case of crime in an area when we write to the Garda Commissioner or the local Superintendent to <Col N="1560" /> carry out an investigation, the agency should be able to respond to Members' queries and complaints and to set investigations in train.  If this body is to have teeth, it should not be restricted by lack of finance, a lack of expertise or by interference by Government Ministers or Departments.</P>
    <P>This has been one of the furthest-ranging Seanad debates.  This shows the interest that all Members have in this subject.  We may have some amendments on Committee Stage through our spokesman, Senator Naughten, but having regard to the fact that we had a Bill on the agenda in the Dáil some time ago, I hope the Minister was able to get some of her better ideas from our Bill.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill in principle and thank the Minister for acting in relation to it.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators on all sides of the House for the warm welcome they have given this Bill Certainly, the decision of the Government to initiate the Bill in this House was a wise one, given that there were 37 contributions &mdash; in excess of 60 per cent of the membership of this House.  It was not just the number of contributions that impressed me but the depth of knowledge Senators showed in the very fine details of this Bill.  That certainly indicates very clearly to me that it is taken seriously by the Members of this House.  It is the case that environmental protection is now a matter of high priority for the public and for their representatives.  Given the warm welcome on the different sides and from different groups in this House, I think it is the case that environmental matters transcend party political differences and <Col N="1561" /> that there is a common interest and concern about our environment and its protection from all the various sectors and Members of this House in particular.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Bill in its broadest sense should receive the support of the House and that there will not be a division on Second Stage.  Any political difference between us in relation to the fundamentals of this Bill &mdash; and I accept there will be differences and amendments on Committee Stage &mdash; would lessen the credibility and the impact of the agency. If it is to be successful and if it is to do the job that is required of it, it is extremely important that it is established with the goodwill of as many groups as possible within the country and in particular that it has the goodwill of all the political parties.</P>
      <P>Many of the contributions and the suggested amendments are more appropriate on Committee Stage.  They deal in the main with various refinements that people would like to see in the Bill.  I will certainly be happy to be as open and as receptive to suggestions and changes from the Members of this House as I can. I look forward to studying over the next few days the amendments that may be put down to this Bill.  However, there are a number of common themes running through many of the contributions.  I am, therefore, going to deal with them, because it is important, particularly in the context of people trying to decide what sort of amendments they might frame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most Senators raised issues about the relationship between the agency and the local authorities.  They expressed the need &mdash; which I agree with &mdash; that there must be a very close relationship and they must work together and have a co-operative approach to what they are about.  First of all, let me make it clear that the agency is being established to supplement and complement existing bodies, including local authorities.  It will not be a substitute for local authorities in the area of environmental protection. The local authorities will still be the principal bodies concerned with protecting the environment through the continuing <Col N="1562" /> operation of environmental legislation. Most licences, particularly on the water pollution side, will continue to be issued by the local authorities and the planning and control system will remain solely the function of the local authorities.  That having been said, it is clear that the establishment of the agency will have a direct impact on local authorities by taking over the licensing and control of about 1,000 activities, by the provision of expert advice and assistance and as a result of the agency's general supervisory role in relation to local authorities environmental functions.</P>
    <P>In relation to the monitoring of general environmental quality, the agency will have overall responsibility and will be expected to do some monitoring itself. However, it makes good sense that it would avail of the experience and the resources of the local authorities in this matter and I anticipate that most of the monitoring required will continue to be done by them.  The control of planning by planning authorities and the integrated licensing system to be operated by the agency will be independent systems and could largely operate separately from each other.  The practicalities, however, will dictate a degree of co-operation and, indeed there are specific provisions in some sections which require consultation between them.  In addition, the general consultation requirements under sections 77 and 78 will be enforced through regulations, if necessary, in relation to the planning and licensing systems.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators, including Senators Norris, Naughten, Honan and Jackman, have referred to the Minister's powers in the Bill to make regulations or orders.  I would like to explain to the House that the Bill is a framework Bill, but the general principles and requirements are set out in individual sections together with the power of the Minister to make regulations or orders.  This is a standard provision in legislation of this type and is designed to allow the more detailed procedural and other matters to be legislated for separately.  This is intended purely as a practical measure. The Bill would become unwieldy if the <Col N="1563" /> alternative approach of including all details in the Bill were adopted.  There are numerous examples of this approach in environmental and local government legislation, including the Air Pollution Act, 1987, the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, and the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1964 to 1990.  Regulations cannot change the basic principles set out in the primary legislation but they allow detailed procedural and other matters to be changed more readily in the light of developing circumstances than if they were separately provided for in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that all regulations made must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, which may within 21 days annul the regulations.  Under section 7 the more significant orders, including those which would amend provisions of the Bill, the composition of the selection committee in section 21 and the First and Second Schedules to the Bill, will require a positive vote of each House of the Oireachtas before they can come into effect.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with concerns over the manner in which the director general and directors are to be selected.  Senators Finneran, Norris, Upton and Hederman raised points about the composition of the selection committee and the power of the Minister to change it.  Senators Naughten, Neville and Murphy urged that a final decision on the selection should be a matter for the Oireachtas.  I can assure Senators that there is nothing sinister in the power to change the committee, which is also in the An Bord Pleanála legislation.  For example, there is no guarantee that all the bodies listed in subsection 21 (ii) will continue in existence. Some might, for example, join with and be subsumed into a new body.  In any event, any order altering the composition of the selection committee must be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not accept that it would be appropriate that the Oireachtas should have a final say in the appointment of the board, as this I believe, would greatly politicise the appointment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1564" /> Contrary to the views expressed by some Senators and certain reported public misconceptions in recent months, the licensing procedures to be operated by the agency make provision for full public participation in the decision making process and recognise the need for oral hearings, which were referred to by Senators Hourigan, Kennedy and O'Donovan among many others.  The various stages included in the decision making process for integrated licences are modelled on the procedures involved in applying for planning approval and in appealing decisions to An Bord Pleanála. There should continue to be a relationship between them.  The essential difference is that the objections to the proposed licensing decision are made to the agency rather than a separate body.</P>
    <P>I realise that some Senators have difficulties with this procedure, but I gave it long and careful consideration.  I have consulted widely with many groups in the country and have listened to the views of all sides before deciding to adopt this approach.  The proposed arrangements are considered to be the most practical and equitable, given that the range of environmental expertise available to the agency will not be available in any other public authority.  This procedure will guarantee full consideration of licensing issues while also ensuring that unnecessary delays are avoided.</P>
    <P>Public access to environmental information and the degree of restriction with regard to the confidentiality provision in section 38 were referred to in a number of the contributions, including those of Senators Ryan, O'Keeffe, Raftery and Doyle.  I believe the establishment of the agency and the many specific provisions in the Bill requiring it to publish information or otherwise make it available to the public will lead to a major increase both in the quantity and quality of such information.  Provision is made in section 107, which Senator Norris had a misunderstanding about, for implementing the European Community directive on access to information.  There are at least 18 other sections in the Bill where there is specific provision for publication of <Col N="1565" /> information and, contrary to what was suggested by some speakers, the duty in most cases is mandatory rather than discretionary.</P>
    <P>Sections 57 to 59 and sections 62 to 69 are examples of the mandatory provisions. There are other sections where discretionary powers were considered more appropriate, such as the publication of environmental quality objectives, codes of practice and environmental labelling schemes.  While overall I consider the duty being imposed on the agency to make information available to the public is clear and unprecedented in its extent, I would be happy to look favourably at any amendments that might come to these sections of the Bill.  The greater availability of such information will inform public debate in the future and ensure that facts rather than fantasy are the basis for public discussion on particular development.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of discussion about BATNEEC, or best available technology not involving excessive costs.  It was raised by Senators Doyle, Naughten, Jackman, Fallon and Kennedy among others.  This concept has been developed internationally and is supported by the European Communities and by OECD and is in operation in many other countries. A similar concept, Best Practical Means, is contained in the Air Pollution Act, 1987, and has not given rise to problems or to a bonanza for lawyers, as some Senators suggested.  BATNEEC marks an attempt to ensure that standards to be applied in environmental protection take account of improved technology.  Were we to lay down rigid guidelines at this stage, as Senators Naughten and Upton suggested, they could date very rapidly because of new advances.</P>
    <P>In applying BATNEEC in the context of integrated pollution control, we are in effect balancing not only environmental impacts on various media &mdash; air, water and soil &mdash; but also the economic consequences of the technologies that are on offer to us.  The key point here is that since we in Ireland are importers of industry and, more to the point, importers of technologies, including environmental <Col N="1566" /> technologies, the Environmental Protection Agency and local authorities will be influenced by the type of technology widely used and proven in the more developed countries such as Germany, The Netherlands, Japan and the USA.  A technology which claims super environmental control but which was only employed in one or two plants in Japan or the US would not be acceptable on the basis of proven performance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that in a moment.  On the other hand, neither would a process that was 20 or 25 years old which was known to be inferior to a newer process operating successfully for five years.  It is important to note that BATNEEC is intended to assist the agency when making licensing decisions, but it is only one of six factors or criteria which must be considered.  The other criteria generally relate to mandatory standards which must be complied with regardless of whether BATNEEC applies or not and without regard to cost.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle raised the question of the water pollution legislation and in particular, how it applies to farmers and agricultural sources.  I believe the application of the principle of best available technology is not appropriate in this area.  The requirement here is basically one of adequate storage of effluent in conjunction with good management techniques in regard to slurry spreading times, weather and soil conditions.  These factors, combined with the lethal nature of effluent in terms of using up oxygen dissolved in waters, makes it essential that none of this effluent is ever released to water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators McKenna and O'Toole raised the possibility of giving the agency an educational role.  A provision was not made in the Bill to do this because of the establishment by the Government in September of last year of the Environmental Information Office in Andrew Street in Dublin.  I am pleased to note <Col N="1567" /> that that office has been extremely successful with in excess of 15,000 visitors to the office already and many telephone and written queries.  The agency does, however, have specific functions in certain sections of the Bill, including sections 54 and 55 with regard to training courses, conferences, seminars and the like. However, the assignment of a general educational function in the environmental area would be an obvious duplication of the resources and functions of ENFO.  I believe there is a need for coordination between what the agency is doing and what AnCO are doing and perhaps on Committee Stage we can look at that again.</P>
    <P>Many Senators sought an extension of the agency's function or an assurance that the agency will have an overseeing role in relation to particular problems or issues which cause them concern.  Senator Mooney, for example, referred to the environmental problems that result from the planting of conifers and Senator Raftery referred to the need to improve recycling and to look at the problems in disposing of animal waste and so on. Senator Upton referred to wildlife.  It was not possible, obviously, to go through the whole list of the items that might from time to time have an impact on the environment, but these functions are not specifically laid our because it would be impossible to cover every function.  There are general and wide ranging powers in the Bill for the agency to look at anything that is causing environmental damage, including the power to investigate any incident of environmental pollution, to issue codes of practice, to offer advice, to make recommendations to any member of the Government and so on. These functions adequately cover the concerns Members expressed during the debate.  However, as I said during both my Second Stage opening speech and, as I have reiterated here, I am prepared to look very favourably at the amendments that come forward from all sides of this House.  I hope the Committee Stage debate will be as informative and as serious as the Second Stage debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1568" /> I want to thank all sides of the House for the co-operative way they approached this Bill, despite some very lengthy contributions. Everybody approached this Bill in a serious way.  There was general goodwill.  I would like to thank the House for the embarrassing compliments that were paid to me.  While I may have given this Bill some political impetus, I have to pay tribute to the people behind me and to the officials in the Department of the Environment whose work this Bill largely is, and without the commitment they gave to the preparation of this legislation such a major and comprehensive Bill could not have been before us for the past three weeks.  I would like to record my appreciation &mdash; and many Members of the House also mentioned this &mdash; to the people who have been involved on a day to day basis, doing the hard work to produce what I believe is a milestone in terms of environmental protection legislation.</P>

      <P>Is cúis áthais dom bheith ar ais arís i Seanad Éireann chun freastal ar an mBille an-tábhachtach seo.  Tá súil agam go mbainfidh Seanadóirí an-taitneamh as páirt a ghlacadh sa Bhille, mar táimid go léir chun aire níos fearr a thabhairt do leanaí agus aos óg ár dtíre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is always a pleasure to be in the Seanad but I am particularly pleased today to have the honour of introducing the Child Care Bill.  I had charge of the Bill during my appointment at the Department of Health and I am grateful to my <Col N="1569" /> colleague, the Minister for Health, for asking me to complete the task of processing the Bill through this House.  I regard it as one of the most important pieces of socially reforming legislation ever to come before the Oireachtas and I feel privileged to be associated with it.</P>
    <P>The Bill comes to this House after a long and detailed consideration of its provisions in the Dáil.  In particular, the Bill was examined in great detail by an all-party Special Committee of the House which was specifically set up for that purpose. I am happy to say that the Special Committee carried out its task in a constructive, non-party political manner and it was possible to reach agreement on many of the issues that arose in our discussions.</P>
    <P>I was happy to accept all worthwhile amendments to the Bill in the spirit in which they were proposed by the various members.  A large number of amendments were made to the Bill as a result of its examination by the Special Committee.</P>
    <P>Important changes were made in the original provisions of the Bill, a large number of new provisions were inserted and other provisions have been extended and reformulated.  The result is that the Bill now before the House is greatly improved and I am confident it will be widely supported by this House.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to update and strengthen the law in relation to the care of children, particularly children who are being assaulted, ill-treated, neglected, sexually abused or who are at risk.  The existing legislation in relation to the care of children is based largely on the Children Act, 1908.  It has served us well and many of its provisions are still in use today.  However, there have been sweeping changes in society in the intervening period which need to be reflected in our child care legislation.  Our political and administrative structures have changed, new values and attitudes have evolved and there is a greater awareness of the rights of the child.</P>
    <P>While we live in a more enlightened society, there continues to be unhappy and deprived children in our community. <Col N="1570" /> At any time about 2,600 children are in the care of the eight health boards.  Many are in care because their parents are unable to look after them, whether due to alcoholism, marital breakdown or other family crises.  Most are reunited with their families after a few weeks or months; others unfortunately remain in care for years.</P>
    <P>There is another group of children who come into care in much more dramatic circumstances.  They are the victims of child abuse, whether it be physical, emotional or sexual.  In 1989, the total number of confirmed cases of all sorts of child abuse known to the health boards was about 1,300, of which the number of confirmed cases of sexual abuse was about 500.  These figures represent an increase of some fourfold in five years. The Department of Health have not yet completed the collection of statistics from health boards in respect of 1990 but all the indications are that the total number of confirmed cases in 1990, including child sexual abuse, will show a further increase.  These figures clearly illustrate the need for up-to-date and effective legislation to protect children who are at risk in the community.</P>
    <P>However, while we must have the legal means to protect children whose health or welfare is in jeopardy, it is equally important to safeguard children and families from unnecessary or excessive interference by the State.  I would see children being taken into care against the wishes of their parents only in exceptional cases where, for example, they have been ill-treated or sexually abused or where there are compelling reasons why their welfare demands that they be removed from their family.  The Bill has been drafted on this basis and I wish to emphasise that it poses no threat to the vast majority of parents who are doing their very best to rear and care for their children.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to the detailed provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 provides that the Bill is to be known as the Child Care Act and empowers the Minister to bring the various provisions into effect by order.  It is the intention that the Bill, <Col N="1571" /> when enacted, will be brought into operation as quickly as possible.  In this connection, I might mention that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> includes a commitment by the Government to make the necessary resources available to enable the Bill to be implemented over the period of the programme.</P>
    <P>Section 2 defines various terms used in the Bill of which the most important is the definition of &ldquo;child&rdquo;.  At present, the Children Act, 1908, as amended, defines a child as a person under 15 years.  This means, in effect, that a person over 16 years may not be placed in health board care regardless of how desirable this might be in his interests.  There is a small but growing number of older children who would benefit from being in care but cannot be admitted under the present law.  It is proposed, therefore, to define &ldquo;child&rdquo; for the purposes of this Bill as a person of up to 18 years; the main effect of this will be to raise to 18 years the age up to which health boards will be responsible for children and the age up to which children may be admitted to care.</P>
    <P>Part II, that is sections 3 to 11, contains a number of provisions aimed at promoting the welfare of children, and supporting families in difficulty.</P>
    <P>Section 3 places a statutory duty on health boards to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  This is one of the most important provisions of the Bill. It imposes a clear obligation on health boards to provide child care and family support services so as to assist parents in caring for their children and to prevent children having to be placed in care. These services may include social work support for families at risk, counselling and advice services, pre-school services, home help and home maker services, child guidance, day fostering, family resource centres and special projects for the young homeless and other &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; groups.  Thus the emphasis is on providing support and assistance so that children can remain at home; only in <Col N="1572" /> exceptional cases are children to be taken into care.</P>
    <P>I draw particular attention to the amendment to subsection (2) (b) made at the Special Committee so as to require a health board in its actions under the Bill to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. This makes explicit what has always been implicit: that the whole basis of the health boards' action is to promote the welfare of children in need.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with voluntary care.  It will enable health boards to receive into care without reference to the courts orphans and abandoned children and, with parental consent, children whose parents are unable to care for them due, for example, to serious illness, sudden bereavement, marital breakdown or other family crisis.  At present about half of the children in care are there on a voluntary basis rather than under court orders.  While there has been some increase in recent years in the number of children entering care through the courts, I expect that a significant proportion of admissions will continue to be on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is an entirely new provision which was inserted at the Special Committee. It aims to deal with the problem of children and young persons sleeping rough on the streets of our cities and towns.  It requires a health board to provide accommodation for homeless children who have no accommodation that they can reasonably occupy.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is another new provision inserted at the Special Committee.  It requires each health board to provide or ensure the provision of an adoption service in its area.  For this purpose a health board may arrange to have the service provided by a registered adoption society and may assist, financially or otherwise, a society with which it has made such an arrangement.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in section 7 to establish one or more child care advisory committees in each health board area to advise the board in the performance of its functions under the Bill.  The committees will be composed of persons with a special <Col N="1573" /> interest or expertise in child care and will include representatives of voluntary bodies providing child care services.</P>
    <P>Voluntary bodies have played and continue to play an important part in our child care services, particularly in the provision of residential facilities.  I wish to acknowledge the excellent work which they have done over the years and hope that they will continue to work with us for many years to come.  Section 9 enables health boards to make arrangements with voluntary bodies to provide child care and family support services on their behalf.  Section 10 empowers health boards to grant-aid voluntary bodies providing child care and family support services.</P>
    <P>Part III, sections 12-15, deals with the protection of children in emergencies.</P>
    <P>Since the Garda are often the first to come across cases of child abuse and neglect, section 12 provides that in an emergency a garda would be empowered, without warrant, to remove a child to safety.  This section was extensively amended during its passage through the Dáil.  Subsection (1) now provides that a garda may act where there is an immediate and serious risk to the health or welfare of the child and where it would not be sufficient to await the making of an application for an emergency care order by a health board.  New provisions have also been inserted granting the Garda powers of entry, without warrant, for the purposes of this section and enabling them to be accompanied by other persons &mdash; for example, social workers &mdash; in exercising the power of removal.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) has been amended to make it clear that where a child is removed to safety by a garda and is duly delivered up to the health board, the board must apply for an emergency care order as soon as possible.  Where no sitting of the District Court is due to be held within three days, it will be necessary to arrange a special sitting within three days to consider such an application.  It will not be lawful for the board to retain custody of the child beyond the three day period unless the court makes an emergency care order.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1574" /> Section 13 empowers a district justice to make an emergency care order which would authorise the removal of a child from his home and his placement in the care of a health board for up to eight days where there was an immediate and serious risk to his safety.  I might also mention that this was amended at Special Committee to enable a justice to make an order if there is reasonable cause to believe that a child would be at risk if he were removed from the place where he is for the time being.  This is to cover cases where, for example, a child is in voluntary care or in hospital and there is concern that he would be at risk if he were to return home.</P>
    <P>Part IV, sections 16-23 deals, with care proceedings.  It sets out the circumstances in which the courts may place children who have been assaulted, ill-treated, neglected or sexually abused or who are at risk, in the care of or under the supervision of health boards.</P>
    <P>Section 17 was inserted at Special Committee.  It enables a justice to make an interim care order placing a child in the care of a health board pending the outcome of an application for a care order.  This is designed to bridge the gap between the expiration of an emergency care order after eight days and the determination of an application for a full care order.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for the making of a care order, which would in effect suspend the parents' right to custody of the child and place him in the custody of the health board.  A care order could remain in force until the child attained the age of 18 unless it was discharged by the court because of changed circumstances.  In order to obtain a care order it would be necessary for a health board to satisfy the court that the child has been or is being assaulted, ill-treated, neglected or sexually abused; or that the child's health, development or welfare has been or is being avoidably impaired or neglected; or that the child's health, development or welfare is likely to be avoidably impaired or neglected.  These grounds differ entirely from the present legislation.  The focus is on the needs of the child rather <Col N="1575" /> than the wrongdoing or shortcomings of the parents.  I believe that this is the more appropriate approach and it will ensure that the needs of the child are given full and careful consideration.</P>
    <P>Where a care order is in force subsection (2) empowers a health board to do what is reasonable to safeguard and promote the welfare of a child in its care and, in particular, gives it authority to decide the type of care to be provided for the child; give consent to any necessary medical or psychiatric examination or treatment; and give consent to the issue of a passport or the provision of passport facilities to enable the child to travel abroad on holidays etc.</P>
    <P>Section 19 enables the court to make a supervision order, which would authorise a health board to visit a child in his home to ensure that he was being cared for properly.  The concept of supervising a child at home under a court order is new to our law.  Unlike a care order, which will have the effect of removing a child from his family, a supervision order would enable the child to remain at home while requiring the health board to have the child visited regularly to ensure that he was being properly cared for.  If necessary the board could ask the court to give directions to the parents as to the care of a child.  The court could direct the parents to bring the child to a day care centre, child guidance clinic, hospital etc.  A supervision order would apply for 12 months and would be renewable.</P>
    <P>Section 20 is an entirely new provision which was inserted on Report Stage.  It provides a link between the Bill and the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, and any other proceedings for the delivery or return of a child.  In any such proceedings the court will be able to refuse to grant custody to either or both of the parents and instead place the child in the care of a health board or, alternatively, to grant custody to one or both parents subject to the child being supervised by a health board under a supervision order.</P>
    <P>Section 23 is another new section which <Col N="1576" /> was inserted on Report Stage.  It provides that a court, which finds or declares that a care order is invalid, may refuse to order the return of the child to his parents if this would not be in his best interests; instead it may either make a new care order or remit the matter to the relevant district court so that it can consider the need to make a new care order.</P>
    <P>Section 24 is another new section inserted at special committee.  It requires the court, having regard to the rights and duties of parents, to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration in any proceedings in relation to the care and protection of children.</P>
    <P>I want to draw particular attention to section 25 which was inserted on Report Stage.  It empowers a court to make a child a party to all or part of care proceedings and to appoint a solicitor to represent the child in any case where the court is satisfied that this is necessary in the interests of the child.  Where a solicitor is appointed by order of the court, the costs and expenses, including solicitors' fees, incurred will be paid by the health board involved unless the court orders otherwise.</P>
    <P>Section 26 is another new section which enables the court, of its own motion or on the application of any party, to procure a report from any person on any question affecting the welfare of the child.  The reports may be received in evidence at the proceedings and the person making the report may be called as a witness.</P>
    <P>Sections 28, 29 and 30 contain a number of provisions aimed at reducing, as far as possible, the stress and anxiety associated with court proceedings.</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides that care proceedings will be heard in private and will be as informal as possible.  It also prohibits the wearing of wigs and gowns and provides that care proceedings are to be heard at a different place or at different times or on different days from those at which ordinary sittings of the court are held.  Section 29 provides that the child involved need not be brought before the court for all or any part of the hearing unless the court so directs.  Section 30 <Col N="1577" /> prohibits the publication or broadcast of any matter that would serve to identify a child who is the subject of care proceedings.</P>
    <P>Part VI, section 35-46, sets out the arrangements which may be made by health boards in looking after children in their care.  Under section 35 a health board may place a child in care in foster care, in a residential centre or, where he is eligible for adoption, it may place him for adoption or it may make other arrangements for his care, which may include placing the child with a relative.</P>
    <P>Section 36 was entirely redrafted at the Special Committee.  It now requires a health board to allow reasonable access between a child in care and his parents or any other person who has a bona fides interest in him.  A person who is dissatisfied with the access offered by a health board may apply to the court and the court may make such an order as it thinks proper regarding access.  There is also provision for a health board to apply to the court for an order authorising it to refuse to allow a named person to have access to a child in its care.</P>
    <P>Section 38 provides for regulations governing the placement of children in foster care and section 39 contains a similar power in relation to residential care.</P>
    <P>Section 41 deals with the circumstances in which a health board may remove a child from foster care or residential care.</P>
    <P>Under the original draft, a health board had an unrestricted power of removal.  This was amended on Report Stage and it is now proposed that the circumstances in which a health board would be entitled to remove a child will be subject to regulations to be made by the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>Section 43 enables a health board to provide &ldquo;aftercare&rdquo;, for example, support and assistance for persons who were formerly in care.</P>
    <P>Part VII, sections 47 to 55, provides for the introduction of a system of inspection of services for pre-school children, for example, day nurseries, creches, playgrounds and pre-schools.  There is a wide variety of pre-school services.  Some operate on a commercial basis while <Col N="1578" /> others are run on a community or self-help basis.  Some simply mind the children while their parents are away; others provide educational programmes designed to stimulate the child's physical and intellectual development.  Some services provide full day care while others operate for only part of the day.  The Department of Health estimate that there are over 1,500 different services around the country.  All of these services will be subject to regulation under this Part.</P>
    <P>Section 48 will enable the Minister for Health, in consultation with the Ministers for Education and for the Environment, to make regulations for securing the safety and promoting the development of children attending pre-school services. Persons carrying on pre-school services will be required to notify the local health board and there will be a statutory duty on them to take all reasonable measures to safeguard the children concerned. Health boards will be required to arrange for the inspection of pre-school services. Where services have an educational dimension, the inspection process will be carried out in consultation with the Department of Education.  Section 54 empowers health boards to provide pre-school services and to make available information on pre-school services.</P>
    <P>Part VIII, sections 56-64, deals with residential centres for children.  This entire Part was overhauled on Report Stage to provide for the introduction of a system of registration for children's residential centres.</P>
    <P>Section 57 provides that it will not be lawful for any person or body to operate a home for children unless it is registered with the local health board.  Section 58 provides for a system of registration which is closely modelled on the recently enacted nursing homes legislation.  Section 59 provides for appeals to the courts against decisions of health boards in relation to registration.</P>
    <P>Section 60 will enable the Minister for Health to prescribe requirements as to the standard of accommodation and facilities, staff numbers and qualifications, etc., in all the centres.  Section <Col N="1579" /> 61 provides that a person guilty of an offence under this Part shall be liable to a fine of up to £1,000 or 12 months imprisonment or both.</P>
    <P>Section 63 provides for the introduction of a superannuation scheme for the staff of certain children's residential centres.  This is something that has long been sought by the staffs of the centres and their representative associations. The staff concerned will be brought within the scope of the local government superannuation scheme.</P>
    <P>Part IX, sections 65-70, contains various technical provisions in relation to the administration of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 66 will enable the Minister for Health to supervise health boards in the performance of their functions under the Bill.  Section 69 reserves to chief executive officers of health boards responsibility for the day to day operation of the Bill, particularly those functions which affect individual children.  I expect that most of these functions would be delegated by chief executive officers to social workers and other officers of health boards.</P>
    <P>Part X, sections 71 to 76, contains miscellaneous and supplementary provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 71 proposes to make it an offence to sell solvent-based products to children where it is known or suspected that they will be abused.  Provision is made for fines of up to £1,000 or 12 months' imprisonment.  A new provision was inserted on Report Stage giving a garda power to seize any substance in the possession of a child in a public place which the garda has reasonable cause to believe is being misused by that child in a manner likely to cause him to be intoxicated.</P>
    <P>What I have outlined are the main provisions of the Bill.  As Senators will see there are many other detailed, technical provisions contained in it.  In preparing this Bill, we have paid careful attention to the relevant provisions of the Constitution and to relevant decisions of the High Court and the Supreme Court.  We have also obtained the advice of the <Col N="1580" /> Attorney General to ensure in so far as it is possible to do so, that the provision in relation to taking children into care are constitutionally sound.  What is now proposed is firmly based on Article 42.5 of the Constitution which states:</P>
    <P>In exceptional cases, where the parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards their children, the State as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.</P>
    <P>It is clear from this that the Constitution not only permits the State to intervene where children are not being cared for properly but indeed obliges the State to do so.  I am confident, therefore, that the various provisions of the Bill are in conformity with the Constitution.  As I indicated earlier, the primary purpose of this Bill is to protect children who are being, or who are at risk of being, assaulted, ill-treated, neglected or sexually abused.  There is an urgent need to update the law in this area and I believe this Bill represents a significant improvement on the present situation.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many aspects of the legislation that we find acceptable and it will not be opposed by us because we believe it to be in the best interest of children.  I would, however, make the point that if the Bill errs, it errs mostly in omission.  What concerns me are the aspects of the Bill that are vague and the areas not covered by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will start by reading section 3 (1) which states: &ldquo;It shall be the function of every health board to promote the welfare of children in its area who are not receiving adequate care and protection and to co-ordinate information from all relevant sources relating to children in its area.&rdquo;  That is a fine platitude which nobody would oppose but when we give the matter further thought we realise that the fundamental weakness in that section is that there is no clear indication that the <Col N="1581" /> appropriate resources will be available to the health boards.  We address this Bill at what I would term a time of crisis for the health services in this country and I am not being unduly alarmist.</P>
    <P>The shortfall in the North-Eastern Health Board budget for this year will be £1.4 million; and it will be £6 million in the Eastern Health Board budget.  The shortfall in the Southern Health Board will be £4 million, and in the Mid-Western Health Board it will be £2.3 million. The North-Western Health Board will have a shortfall of £1.5 million.  The Western Health Boards' shortfall will be £3.25 million and in the South-Eastern Health Board it will be £1.8 million. Those figures call the implementation of the provisions of this Bill into question.  In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> being voted upon today by a special delegate Congress of the ICTU there is a vague reference to the Child Care Bill.  I will avoid quoting the first paragraph because it just states the proposed enactment of the Bill but section 41 states:</P>
    <P>It is proposed to implement the Bill when passed on a phased basis and gradually to increase the number of social workers, psychologists and medical staff over the seven year programme. Additional residential facilities will be provided and there will be an increase in home support services for problem families.  Arrangements will also be introduced for the inspection and supervision of pre-school services.</P>
    <P>I consider it an absolute absurdity that we could discuss the increase in staff, back-up facilities and in infrastructure necessary to implement this Bill and, at the same time, be faced with a massive shortfall in the budgets of the health boards.</P>
    <P>Many health boards are proposing that hospital wards be closed down for periods of the year.  The psychiatric services in Castlerea may be put at risk.  If such is the case, how would a health board faced with that kind of dilemma divert money to implement provisions of the Child <Col N="1582" /> Care Bill?  I foresee a massive problem here and I am concerned about it.  I will be delighted if the Minister when he is replying on Second Stage and on later Stages can give the House an assurance that the funding will be provided.  If the funding is to be provided it will have to come from a special Estimate not yet available.  It is clear that the money to fund the services proposed in this Bill is not available to the health boards at the moment and that is a central consideration.</P>
    <P>What we are considering at the moment is a cutback of existing services rather than the expansion of services which is implicit in the very fine sentiments of this Bill.  The Minister and his colleagues will have to accept that this entire debate is unreal and worthless in the absence of assurance regarding finance.</P>
    <P>The report of the Task Force on Child Care recommended specific programmes in each health board area to deal with child care.  That recommendation would necessitate a massive injection of finance quite apart from the provisions of this Bill.  My contention &mdash; there is no point in putting the cart before the horse &mdash; is that the money has not been provided. Unless it is written into this legislation, that health boards will be sufficiently funded for this purpose, the provisions of the Bill are but a series of platitudes; aspirational but with no realistic foundation. That is an unfortunate criticism of the Bill but I would be failing in my duty as a public representative not to draw to the attention of the House to what is foremost in any consideration of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The point is made in the Minister's speech and stated in the Bill on a number of occasions that the rights of the child will be paramount but section 3(2)(b) refers to the rights and duties of parents whether under the Constitution or otherwise. I would draw the House's attention to Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution which confer on parents inalienable and imprescriptible rights and similar rights with regard to education of their children. Article 42 also confers similar rights on children.  However, these later rights <Col N="1583" /> seem less important and less qualified for constant protection than the rights of parents in the context of marriage.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court in a decision of March 1985 in the case of MC and MC and KC and AC <i>v.</i>  An Bord Uchtála issued a unanimous five judge verdict on that occasion which stated: &ldquo;The State cannot supplant the role of parents in providing for the infant the right to be educated conferred on it in Article 42&rdquo;. The court could not decide solely on the basis of what was best for the child.</P>
    <P>In a further case in the Supreme Court on 22 June 1977 J. <i>v.</i> D. it seems again that the rights of children are subservient to the inalienable and imprescriptible rights of parents.  These constitutional provisions, and specifically Article 42 of our Constitution, were born of outmoded thinking and they are a product of a historical reality that no longer obtains.</P>
    <P>There is no-one in this House who is not aware that one of the great problems in this country for many of us who have attempted to do some social good in our communities has been the exaggerated sanctity of the family.  There has been a belief, quite apart from the constitutional provision and quite apart from the law of the land &mdash; practising politicians are very much aware of this &mdash; that when two people got married and set up a family unit an untouchable entity, an independent republic, was created, beyond interference by anyone.  That was a product of a certain outdated philosophy.  I often think that that militated against the good of children.  A child could have been abused for many years within those confines and nothing could be done about it. It militated tragically against the good of spouses on many occasions as well.  It is interesting that despite the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission report &mdash; it is not suggested in this legislation and it is not often talked about &mdash; we do not consider removing the offender in a barring order case arising from sexual abuse.  I submit to the House that it might often be more appropriate that the offender be removed rather than <Col N="1584" /> the child.  Many countries, apart from our own, have adoptd the Toronto principle which would bar the offender, rather then the offended, in grevious cases of sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>The point I am making in drawing attention to Article 42 of the Constitution and to the Supreme Court interpretation of that Article in subsequent cases and, indeed, to the Toronto principle is that in this country we need to look at constitutional amendment in the light of new thinking and to set out the fundamental rights of children in no uncertain terms. The forthcoming local elections, which seem certain at this stage, would provide a great opportunity for the Government to introduce a constitutional amendment, which I have no doubt would pass with overwhelming acclaim.  It would delineate the rights of children in our Constitution more clearly and in a way that would be less susceptible to adverse Supreme Court interpretation than has been the case.</P>
    <P>While we have been considering and identifying correctly the very special needs of those who are abused, I would recommend to the Minister that consideration be given to the needs of the abusers.  There can be no doubt that for the purposes of this Bill it is right to term sexual abusers, physical abusers and other abusers of children criminal, and I accept that definition in the Bill.  The point however, is that abusers are invariably tragic figures, victims, often, of child abuse themselves and worthy of some support system within our State.  I recommend to the Minister and to the House in consideration of this Bill that we tackle the problem in a holistic way and consider the problems of the abuser also.</P>
    <P>The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and other Irish bodies have identified the need for mandatory reporting of cases of sexual abuse to health board professionals.  I believe this should be provided for in the Bill.  It would have to be done in a very subtle fashion, there would have to be proper channels for it and adequate legal protection for the health board workers. <Col N="1585" /> At the moment a health board worker who reported a suspected case of sexual abuse could conceivably be guilty of defamation of character and guilty in civil proceedings of doing something outside their sphere of duty.  I think a mechanism should be created to facilitate the reporting of sexual abuse and, indeed, I would submit that it should be mandatory for health board workers to make those reports where appropriate.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (3) states:</P>
    <P>A health board shall, in addition to any other function assigned it under this Act or any enactment, provide child care and family support services.</P>
    <P>I feel there should be a very real emphasis on prevention, which should be our real strategy in dealing with child care.  We have had much talk in recent years &mdash; some of it sincere, some of it quite hysterical and some of it almost neanderthal &mdash; about the rights of the unborn child. It is proper that all of us, as elected representatives, should now turn our attention in a very positive way to the rights of the born child.  With this in mind, prevention of problems should be our real strategy.  We should be looking at a programme of preventative exercises which would save money later in the Department of Justice Estimate and in the Education Estimate.</P>
    <P>We must look at urban poverty and at the new phenomenon of rural poverty identified by the Combat Poverty Agency recently and, in a very splendid fashion by &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; on RTE, as sources of problems.  There is no explicit reference in the Bill to the development of the community-based preventative services that will be essential, particularly for families where a supervision order has been issued.  It is exciting and challenging to consider the kind of things that could be done in the preventative area.  I ask the Minister to give this matter very serious consideration in his recommendations to health boards later.</P>
    <P>There is a need to look specifically at deprived urban areas.  We have to look, obviously, at questions like job creation <Col N="1586" /> and establish social and community facilities in these areas.  An interesting study was conducted in 1989 by Focus Point and the Eastern Health Board together. They studied 77 children in a deprived area of Dublin.  They discovered that 25 per cent of them were known to have or were suspected of having engaged at some time in prostitution.  Thirty-nine per cent were known to have engaged at some time in shoplifting or petty crime. Thirty-three per cent were known to be involved in alcohol abuse.</P>
    <P>Another reason for a preventative programme must be the growth of one-parent families.  One-parent families are often housed in areas where the mother has no relative to turn to.  Many Members here, including myself, spent some time living in flatland in Dublin.  I know that one could find an unmarried mother from rural Ireland living on her own in a highrise one-bedroom or two-bedroom flat.</P>
    <P>Children of single mothers are more likely to have to be taken into care and they are more vulnerable to money problems. As stated by the Task Force on Child Care Services ten years ago, we need a network of playgroups and nurseries in which children are encouraged and given a sense of stability.  Children would be given self-esteem by these experiences.  In this area we also need home helpers who are trained to work with children and who can give support to harassed mothers and fathers.</P>
    <P>If we were to develop strategies to prevent problems in the child care area later, I believe it would be money well spent.  In cold economic terms it would pay, but it would also pay in social terms and that is important.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament Draft Report issued in July 1985 emphasised the importance of prevention and early detection in dealing with children's difficulties. First, I would ask the Minister to respond to the question of our school attendance laws and the functioning of our school attendance officers.  I am not convinced &mdash; and I have some practical experience of this as one who taught in a national school for a number of years and also in a vocational school &mdash; that the <Col N="1587" /> school attendance laws are working properly or that we employ the right strategies to maximise school attendance and to deal with non-attenders, particularly those who come from difficult situations. We will have to look at the question of school attendance in the context of this Bill.  As the Minister and all Members of the House will appreciate, when school attendance becomes spasmodic a whole myriad of problems arise such as delinquency, illiteracy and retarded learning.</P>
    <P>I would recommend that we do something to ensure that school attendance laws are enforced.  I submit that this would involve improved personnel in the school attendance area.  Perhaps there could be greater training for our school attendance officers and greater numbers of them and a much more active school attendance programme.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise the question of children in travellers' halts.  It is an urgent matter.  In my own constituency we have one very well run and successful travellers' halt but I am convinced that there is nothing for the children in the halt.  I know that they go to special classes and that they go to the local primary schools but there seems to be little back-up in the halt and little that they can do in the evenings.  Of course, their school attendance would not be very good so I think we need to look at the needs of children in travellers' halts.  There is a very practical requirement here.</P>
    <P>Yesterday when coming through town and thinking of the Child Care Bill, I noticed that the problem of children sitting and begging around O'Connell Bridge still exists.  Very often these children are sent out by their parents and told that they must come back with X amount of money and perhaps they are physically abused if they do not.  It is a traumatic sight.  Immediate steps should be taken in this House to deal with the problem.  That is why I began by saying that I am genuinely concerned about resources.  I am not convinced that the resources will be provided in the light of the contemporary situation to enforce the provisions of this Bill, but I do think that <Col N="1588" /> the serious question of the children on O'Connell Bridge and elsewhere needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a State-sponsored pre-school or kindergarten system should be high on our legislative agenda. This would initially target certain areas of mass unemployment and of specific social difficulty.  This is very necessary and especially for children in deprived areas.</P>
    <P>The 1987 NESC report on Community Care Services has indicated a major shortage of social workers in the health board areas.  I think that a shortage of social workers would fundamentally affect the implementation of this legislation. I would want a specific commitment from the Minister that there will be an increase in the number of social workers over the coming years.  I do not think it adequate that we have a vague commitment in principle to such an increase.  We need a specific number of social workers to implement this legislation and an adequate child care programme.</P>
    <P>Section 7 mentions child care advisory committees.  I wholeheartedly welcome these committees in principle.  They are an important part of the mechanism of child care and a valuable adjunct to the health boards in dealing with child care problems.  Given that it is over 80 years since we had the last significant child care legislation in the 1908 Act, it is important that these committees become operative.  I would ask the Minister to indicate to the House in his reply what mechanism will be put in place for the selection, election, co-option, or whatever methodology will be used, to select the child care advisory committees.  What composition will these boards have? What kind of lifespan will they have? What functions will they perform?  I would like some elucidation on those committees.</P>
    <P>It may be that, as a result of the Seanad debate, there may be a change of heart on the introduction of a national children's council, like the Council for the Care of the Aged.  I do not see any reason we could not have a national children's <Col N="1589" /> council in place.  It would have great merit.  It would prove a very worthwhile forum for debating the needs of children on a national level.  It would allow for constant debate and a thorough review of our strategies in child care areas.  It would result in the Government being constantly provoked, agitated or reminded of the need for an updating of child care policies and for increased resources being budgeted for child care.</P>
    <P>There are many interesting reports in the child care area that could be discussed at such a national council. For example, the Tuairim Committee report of 1966, The Kennedy report of 1970 and the Task Force report of 1981 could come into the ambit of the national children's council. It would provide an interesting forum for discussion, for provoking new ideas and for agitating Government and other sectors into effective action in the child care area.  I would urge the Minister, even in something of a conversion from the Dáil, that he would take the initiative in the Seanad of accepting the principle of a national children's council.  It can only be for good.  It can only give us the benefit at national level of an ongoing, positive, worthwhile debate on child care in this country.  It will have a certain anticipatory role, as well as a review and analytical role in relation to what is being done.  Any Government, confident about their future strategies for child care, should have no difficulty with such a council.  I would urge the enactment of a children's council.</P>
    <P>One very important area is that of child care facilities.  There can be no doubt that the absence of child care facilities throughout the country is a major cause of the unequal position of women in employment.  I am thinking here specifically of the absence of creches in the workplace, the absence of the availability of creches available throughout this the absence of family support services. We could look at the UK as a model of what is available there.  It would be my contention that there should be a network of creches available throughout this country for working mothers.  Where <Col N="1590" /> there are working mothers and fathers, the children could be left at such creches and taken care of there.</P>
    <P>It is funny that we should be here today discussing the health boards and of giving new responsibility to them while, at the same time, in virtually all our hospitals run by the health boards there are no creche facilities available to the nursing staff; there are no creche facilities available to the administrative staff.  I submit that this is an area worthy of urgent attention. We must look at creche facilities for children where the two parents are working.</P>
    <P>It is suggested in the Bill that the area for the court orders will be the District Courts.  In an amendment on Report Stage in the Dáil the legislation was looked at to improve the <i>modus operandi</i> that will exist in the District Courts when child care cases are coming to them.  I would urge the Minister to look at family courts as the correct place for dealing with child care cases.  These family courts could be staffed by people with professional training.  They could have a much more informal character.  I would be the last to adversely criticise our District Courts.  The District Courts play an important role in contemporary Irish society.  The judgments of the district justices tend to be tempered with a lot of local knowledge, humanity and good sense.  That is the case in our District Courts.  It would be remiss of any elected representative to criticise our District Courts for the good work they do.  When you are dealing with family law and things as sensitive as this Bill proposes to deal with, then the correct mechanism must be a network of family courts with professionally trained people.  This is not a reflection on the District Courts but we see the family courts as the best method of dealing with this subject.</P>
    <P>I accept the principle of supervision orders.  They have to be in place but it must raise the old chestnut of staffing because to implement properly the supervision orders there would need to be increased staffing in the health boards and increased resources to fund such a level of staffing.  I would ask the Minister to specify how many visits he anticipates the children being supervised would <Col N="1591" /> receive, how often they would be visited, what kind of monitoring they would get, etc.  Those situations would need very close monitoring.  That would involve a bigger staffing commitment than exists at the moment.  That brings me back to the fundamental question I raised at the beginning as to how this is to be financed at a time when the health boards are creaking for want of finance.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill deals with the supervision of pre-school services.  I notice that the legislation will require cleanliness, heating, lighting, maintenance and ventilation in pre-school areas.  I do not take issue with that.  That is quite laudatory and is something we all want, but I notice there is nothing about training those who work with children. They will have to be professionally trained.  Specialised training for people working in the pre-school area and in all child care areas must be mandatory. Naturally, there will be very experienced child care workers, in other words, people who have worked in the pre-school area up to now; some of whom would be excellent and some would have a lot of practical experience.  Some of them would be unquestionably good. This would have to be taken account of.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that we throw out the baby with the bath water.  If people working in the child care area and have established their credentials and are doing a very good job, that would have to be taken into account.  They would need to undergo some short form of formal training to put them in touch with the most up to date contemporary thought and professional strategies in this area.  By and large, I would expect that existing expertise would be taken into account.  From now on that should be the case with people going into the areas of pre-school and taking care of children.  It is not wrong to say that people who care for children ultimately control the destiny of the country.  Ultimately, they decide the quality of life in the future.  This is the most sensitive and important of areas. People in that area should be professionally trained.  They should have the kind of expertise necessary to do the job. People working in creches, in pre-school <Col N="1592" /> groups and in Montessori schools need to be trained professionally.  I do not believe that people necessarily need PhDs in child psychology.  I am not for one moment suggesting that, but I do believe that a form of training should exist and certain regulations should be set out providing for that training.  There should be national certification to deal with this.</P>
    <P>I submit that the inspectorate must also be trained.  The people who inspect the pre-schools for the purposes of registration must be trained.  They must not just be trained in their capacity to look at physical surroundings and buildings because, while that is quite important they would also need to look professionally and with the right kind of focus on the entire emotional environment, the atmosphere in which the child was living, on the number of children there, the kind of resources they have and the kind of strategies in place for the child to develop.  That would have to be part of the focus of any inspectorate going into the pre-school areas.  That is why we need a trained inspectorate as well as trained personnel operating the pre-school services.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that the pre-school services must be required to register in advance of being set up.  In other words, they must set out clearly what their ambitions are, their targets and what they hope to do, rather than just simply give notice to the health board, that they intend to set up a pre-school or a child care centre.  They must be registered properly.  There must be regulations on the ratio of adults to children and on the qualifications and training of the adults providing the service.  This is extremely important.</P>
    <P>In England there is a register of child minders available to the State and there are tax allowances available to people involved in child minding.  The question of personal taxation would provide difficulties in administering a register system of child minders.  Nonetheless, it is something that will have to be looked at.  It will have to be looked at in an intelligent way, making allowance for the reality of the income levels of the child minders and for their particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1593" /> Obviously, this would all have to be worked intelligently into our tax codes.</P>
    <P>As I said, there should be a register of child minders.  There should be trained personnel in our pre-schools.  Our pre-school services must be required to register. This whole area must be regularised. There can be no doubt that this is becoming a major growth area at the moment and it will go on increasing.  That makes it all the more important that regulations would be put in place properly.</P>
    <P>We have to look at the question of after school services.  At the moment they are precluded from the Bill.  These can be important where the primary schools close early in the day and the children will be involved in after school services care often for a period of hours.  There are other areas where after school services do not exist at the moment and such a service should be put in place for some few hours of the week because of particular difficulties children would experience, and as a preventive exercise.  Prevention must be our strategy rather than dealing with the problem after it arises.</P>
    <P>I welcome broadening the definition of the child &mdash; increasing the age.  That is something to be welcomed.  It is important that that would be the case, particularly since there was an anomaly.  Other Departments were looking upon people as children until they were 18 years of age.  It is important for the purposes of this Bill that they be so recognised.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would make the point that ultimately we need to be assured that the funding to put the Bill in action will be available.  I repeat, all the portents are bad.  If the health boards are going through a whole range of cuts at the moment and cutting services, it is hard to believe they can take on board new responsibilities when they are already getting rid of old ones.  I find that a very worrying aspect of the Bill.  We need to look more positively than the Bill does at such matters.  We need to look at ways of preventing problems in the future.  That must be our ultimate goal.</P>
    <P>The thrust of the Bill is to deal with difficulties already in existence.  That is laudatory and necessary.  We must also look at strategies to prevent problems in the future, at strategies that will prevent <Col N="1594" /> children having to go into care in the future.  That is why there is a necessity for the provision of family support services, kindergartens, creches, a whole range of community services, increased number of social workers and whatever may be necessary.  We have to look in a more positive way at the question of child care. We will have to accept the principle of putting trained personnel into all our child care areas.  I propose to leave the matter at that and will introduce amendments to cover some of those suggestions later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on his change of office from Health to Justice.  As Minister for State at the Department of Health, the Minister worked with great dedication, sincerity and in a very earnest and upright manner.  At all times the welfare of the people, especially the weakest, the vulnerable and the sick, was always uppermost in his mind.  No doubt it is because of that that the Minister has been sent back to pilot this Bill through this House and also because of the deep concern and great interest he has taken in this Bill from the outset.  The Minister in his new Ministry will take on board many of the problems of crime present today. I feel confident he will deal with it with the same sincerity, dedication and determination as he tackled health.  No doubt, the Minister will bring in some legislation to come to grips with teenage problems in crime in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is a Bill which acknowledges and recognises the role of the family and its duties and rights, particularly the rights of natural parents. It is only when the family has failed that this Bill and its provisions will come into play.  Child abuse has been a great problem for sometime.  It was not as prevalent in the past as it is now.  The reasons for that I will come to later.  First of all, there is sexual abuse.  While I am sure there was always abuse of this nature, certainly it was not as popular a pastime, because that is what it has become nowadays.  All this started when we became a liberal society and threw out a lot of the things our grandparents and parents nurtured for centuries, when we became this newly <Col N="1595" /> educated, great liberal society where good solid customs and practices were thrown away as foolishness of the past. We are now reaping some of the results of that new found happiness we thought we were getting today.</P>
    <P>Sexual abuse is very serious, very traumatic and is terrible for the child who is a victim of it.  It is sad that a lot of it is within the family unit.  It is completely unnatural.  What has come over society for developing such an unnatural instinct as to sexually abuse our own nearest and dearest?  Serious research needs to be done as to what has pervaded the minds of the human being to act in such a manner.  We have allowed in a lot of pornography.  This type of corruption is eroding our society.</P>
    <P>Physical violence is another very serious aspect of crime today.  In my day there were rows in dance halls.  At that time a man was heard saying; &ldquo;He went down and when he got up I put him down again.&rdquo;  There was no such thing as hitting a man on the ground.  That was unprofessional. It was a fist to fist fight, a clean fight.  A person would not be abused on the ground.  Nowadays, it is knives, chains and so on.  Society has become outlandishly cruel.</P>
    <P>Children are out on the streets collecting money even though their families are getting quite a lot of social welfare money.  I was looking at a case on television recently where a woman was getting £154 a week, but it never mentioned her subsidised rent, children's allowance and how much she was getting in free clothes and shoes.  The total sum of money going into that house was an awful lot more than many a good home in this city and rural Ireland where people are living and rearing their families well. Something needs to be done to educate people how to use money and not abuse it.  It is the abuse of money that leads to those children being sent out on the streets to beg.  If they do not return home with so much money they are abused again.  I have on a few occasions, when waiting for somebody, observed children begging in the streets and have noticed an adult arriving and taking whatever money they collected and disappear.  The <Col N="1596" /> poor child has to sit there and continue begging.  A law is necessary to apprehend those culprits who are putting those children out on the streets.  When observed taking money from those children they should be charged and brought before the courts.  This is having a psychological effect on those children. We have criticised many homes in years gone by, but the environment was a lot better than what some children have to put up with today.  A survey needs to be carried out to assess this problem.  This law may help us to come to grips with that.  Those children should be taken off the streets and checked out to see exactly what kind of parents they have, where they come from and why they are out on the streets.  This is a type of physical abuse that must be brought to a sudden conclusion.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem when children are deliberately sent out to steal. It is unfair dragging the children before the courts; it is the people who send them out who are responsible.  This is a very severe type of physical abuse that we must come to grips with.  It is more than a physical abuse.  Parents may have a drink problem or a problem with drugs. They may be in an erratic mood and do not know where to stop.  The abuse of alcohol and drugs is where the real trouble is.  There should be a prohibition on the sale of intoxicating drink in cash and carries, supermarkets and take aways.  They are being bought by the bottle, not by the glass.  It is taking from people a great deal of money that should be going to the care of their children.</P>
    <P>As a result of sexual and physical abuse the child suffers emotional trauma.  I congratulate the health boards on the work they are doing.  They are providing a very good service.  One of the reasons why the health boards are doing such a good job, for which they do not always get credit, is that they comprise medical people, politicians and a good spread of people and they are dealing with the general public all the time.  Politicians are talking to their constituents, doctors are talking to their patients and social workers are talking to people generally.  With all that information collected and collated we are pinpointing where we think there are <Col N="1597" /> problems and many cases are coming to notice now in that manner.  That may not be as easy in a big city like Dublin but certainly in rural Ireland that is the attitude. We are keeping an eye out for such problems.  People hear and see things that maybe they cannot prove but they can pass on information.  Then you have the appropriate person keeping an eye out and coming to grips with the situation before it gets out of hand.</P>
    <P>In days gone by we had the extended family.  We no longer have the grandfather, grandmother, grandaunt or granduncle living with the young family. When the grandparents were there there was less opportunity for some of those abuses, because of the age and wisdom of the grandparents.  There was no such thing as babysitters then.  While the great majority of babysitters do a very good job, there is the occasion where some of them will unfortunately experience problems, for example, with a parent leaving them home or maybe experimenting with children when they are on their own. There was none of that type of thing when the grandparent was present and able to adopt a supervisory role.</P>
    <P>Today people are in new housing estates and built-up areas and it does not augur well for keeping a good community together.  That is where some of those problems lie.  The day of the extended family is gone, which is a great pity. When the children, teenagers, adults and the old people all rambled together, and went to dances together, there was a good mix and some control and supervision without it being seen but it was there. Nowadays every group go on their own. It tends to a lack of control that can lead to some problems.  If we had such control we would certainly not need to have a Bill like this before us.  It is important that we have a Bill because children are the weakest of our society and they must be protected.</P>
    <P>My health board, the North Western Health Board, last Monday launched a primary school educational course, the first in the country as far as I am aware. We launched a health education programme four or five years ago in secondary schools which has been a great success.  Now we have introduced health <Col N="1598" /> education into the primary schools. There is a working group consisting of teachers, psychologists and social workers, etc.  They have worked on it and presented a very good course.  This will help to eliminate some of the problems. Some of those people will be visiting schools and may be able to spot things in the schools much quicker.  When you had the smaller schools a lot of problems were detected earlier on.  With the smaller school there were only two or three teachers, who knew every child and every parent.</P>
    <P>Over the years we strove for better education.  With better education of course we may have gone overboard with perfecting the ABC and lost sight of all the other advantages of the small school which we took for granted.  When a teacher had a child from infants to second class that teacher watched them for two or three years.  When they went into third, fourth and fifth classes there one teacher watched them again so there was some continuity.  Now it is a different teacher for every class.  Scottish people would call it a horizontal system whereas we had a vertical system.  The argument about switching children from class to class, from one teacher to another each year, was that if children had a bad teacher they would not be stuck with that teacher.  However, the teacher dealing with a child for some years could detect little problems far quicker, whereas now they do not even get to know them, never mind knowing the parents.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay special tribute to national teachers who are doing a wonderful job.  They got very bad publicity in the media, who lacerated them.  I speak as one who has no friend or relation in the teaching profession whatsoever.  It was deplorable the abuse national teachers got.  We all know what it is to try and mind four or five children on a day when you have a birthday party for a child.  The teachers have a party every day, five days a week.  They have to correct school exercises when they go home and they do a wonderful job.</P>
    <P>They are not alone teachers but psychologists. If a child only gets knocked down in the school ground, the teacher takes out his car, brings the child to a <Col N="1599" /> doctor and brings him home.  If the evening is bad and the school bus has broken down, teachers will take their cars and leave all the children home.  The amount of work that teachers do and the way they have been treated by our media is nothing short of scandalous and I condemn it.</P>
    <P>I would not agree entirely with the previous speaker when he said there was a lot of talk about the unborn child.  The implication there is that we should not consider the unborn child.  The unborn child to me is something very dear.  We have a duty to protect unborn children. It is rather sad in this day and age that we have so many children not being allowed to see the light of day.  We talk about Romanian children and what is happening to them, but what about the thousands of children who are being denied the right to live?  I do not want to get emotional.</P>
    <P>I am sad that some of the medical profession in other countries, people who studied and worked hard to acquire a profession to protect life, are now terminating life.  There is plenty of proof of it now.  Do they not see the psychological effects and emotional effects it is having on people years later?  We will have to have more counselling and do more work.  I know the health boards are doing a great job and are doing their best and other organisations like Cura are also doing their best.</P>
    <P>There is a movement afoot which wants to encourage terminating life.  I appeal to them to realise that there is nothing as important as life.  Recently I read of a case in the newspaper where some woman had a car accident when she was eight weeks pregnant and she received compensation for the loss of the child.  Yet we have abortions taking place at 28 weeks and they try to tell us that a foetus is involved.  It does not make sense.  We all know that it is not a foetus, it is another human being.  I feel we should provide more counselling services in this area.  We all know, especially those of us who have been sick and who have had to make decisions.  I had to make a decision whether a hand could be kept or taken from me.  It is a time when you are <Col N="1600" /> at your weakest.  You are vulnerable and you say to the doctor &ldquo;Whatever you think is best.&rdquo;  You do not know.  Those people are in a traumatic state.  They are emotionally upset, they do not know what to do and they should receive full counselling and advice on all aspects. Then they should have a choice after full counselling, but to my mind they are being pushed by people in the medical profession trying to make money.  It is not for the love or betterment of the girl involved.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to these people.  We must help girls who get into that kind of problem.  We must put more money and resources into providing better counselling and give them a clear picture of what the whole thing entails.  We all know how much time parents who give their children up for adoption spend years later trying to trace the children and of the children who are trying to trace their parents.  In the other situation it is a finality &mdash; there is no tracing, that is the end of it.</P>
    <P>Our adoption societies are doing a good job, too, but unfortunately they are not receiving babies for adoption today. It is a pity because there are many good homes with good people who cannot have a family of their own.  They would love to give some child a home.  It is a pity that some of those people who have abortions do not have the children and then put them up for adoption where they would be allowed to live and they would get a good home to live in.  There are many parents so desperate for children they go out to Romania to get them.  We could solve that problem here at home. We will have to work on that.  I would like to see more counselling and help given to girls who find themselves in that situation.  I congratulate all unmarried mothers.  They are great people and God will reward them for keeping their children and rearing them.  They deserve all our support.  The Government have done a lot of work to help those people. It is only right and proper that it should be done.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect that the Bill does not deal with, perhaps some other Bill will do so.  It is something I will mention anyway.  There is an old Italian proverb <Col N="1601" /> that says &ldquo;It is a wise child that knows his own father&rdquo; and a French proverb says &ldquo;The father names the child, but the mother knows it&rdquo;.  When those old proverbs were written many years ago it must have been a problem then too.  It is nothing new.  The father's name should be registered.  That is important.  I do not think the men should get away scot free. It takes two to tango, it takes two to create a child.  One should not have to carry the can.</P>
    <P>Where it is known if at all possible in the father's name should be registered so that that child when he grows up will know who the father is.  We need to do something in that regard.  I would like to see us working on this, to keep records on it, because otherwise brothers and sisters could end up getting married and they would not know they were related. We owe it to the children: that when they grow up there will be a register somewhere where they will be able to find out who their fathers were.  That is a natural instinct for everybody.  We all know the work that has been done in trying to trace family trees.  If a child cannot trace its own father it will not have much hope of being able to trace a family tree.  That is something I would like to see some work done on.  Our health board works with two adoption societies in the north-west and we have a satisfactory arrangement.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that in this Bill the health boards have received a bit more power than they had.  Health boards will not act unless they have to.  It is important that they can take care of children.  That is what they do, no matter what may be said and even though you may have cases proven in court to the contrary.  The professional people social workers nurses, doctors and so on who go out and bring in some child do it for the very highest motive, the protection of the child.  They are fully convinced that that child needs attention.</P>
    <P>We talked earlier about pre-schools and creches.  I am not for too much training. We were told that if we had a driving test in this country we would eliminate accidents and make our roads safe.  We set up a driving test and now that we have all expert drivers we have more accidents than ever today.  Someone goes in to do <Col N="1602" /> the test and comes out on the road an ace driver.  They do not know if they are a good or a bad driver.  As one who has done the test &mdash; I had to do the test long before others did because I used to drive a hackney car &mdash; I never saw much in it.</P>
    <P>I do not know if all of this training is the answer to all our problems.  In fairness, the best people in the world today and the best people in Ireland to look after children are their mothers, by and large.  Many of the people who are involved in creches and in child care are mothers who cared for their own families. Now their families are gone they have time on hands and they love to mind children.</P>
    <P>My criteria would be that if a mother reared a good family then she will look after those children well because she is a mother.  Most Irish mothers are the best in the world; that cannot be taken from them.  I do not think that because a person goes to a college and comes out with a diploma, it means anything special. When woodwork theory came into the schools people could write 40 pages of foolscap about a three inch nail and never once say it was a straight bit of wire, but they could not put a foot on a stool.  They could do the practical work but they could not tell you how it was done.  The Irish mother is very practical and would be a good person to care for children.  I would not like to think that some of those people might be disqualified because they have no paper to say they are professionals.</P>
    <P>I would like to see children getting very good care, but they need more than care; they need love and being talked to. Children love to be talked to, to be taken on the knee and to be cared for.  That is what is needed in a creche not just feeding children by the clock or changing nappies on time.  All those things are very important but more is needed.</P>
    <P>Children are human beings.  They must be talked to and you must let them talk to you.  There must be a bond between the child and the carer.  That is more important for people running creches, to realise whoever is in charge should ensure that the children get what they need &mdash; care, attention, love, a little cuddle and a kiss.  This is a very important to a child <Col N="1603" /> growing up.  That is an area we must work on.</P>
    <P>Pre-schools are doing a very good job.  I never know whether to agree or disagree with them because in a way we are putting children into school too quickly and they do not get time to be children.  When children did not go to school until six years of age, they were at home or out in the field with their parents, older brothers or neighbours and they were learning. When you send them to pre-school, they are mixing with children of their own age all the time.  They are not getting the same attention we got.  When we were young there was always the old philosopher who told stories and we sat and listened.  If a child robbed a bird's nest, someone saw him and told him why it was wrong to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It was very important.  The philosopher would tell you the story of Murphy who, had a white horse and the other fellow had a brown horse, and rides with a saddle worth £50.  If the saddle goes on the white horse he is worth twice the price of the brown horse, and if the brown horse is worth three pence, what is the price of each horse?  That was education too.  These were tricky questions but it was great fun working them out.  These children are missing out.  That is all gone today.  That is a great pity.</P>
      <P>There are not enough people now to talk with children, but the pre-school does a good job.  However, I think we are going over the top educating children. I read that an American scientist said that at 12 weeks into pregnancy a child was starting to learn and mothers should teach them while they are still in the womb because they are capable of learning. Scientists carried out some research into this area by playing music.  They found that the child who listened to music while still in the womb was more musical than the child who did not.  My point is that the unborn have a life too.  This is something we should be concentrating on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I like to see pre-schools but they should <Col N="1604" /> create the right environment.  Overemphasis on the chalk and blackboard is not the thing for children at that age.  In playschools they should get an opportunity to play, talk, mix and have a good line in conversation.  They should be taught to communicate with each other. That is real education.  Being able to spell cat and mat comes in its own time. Children should communicate with each other and realise that they must share with one another.  That is very important, and that is a provision I would like to see in the Child Care Bill.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased about the supervision order.  The last thing we want to do is to take a child from the parents or parent. The law was black and white.  If things were not going right at home the child was taken into care.  That was traumatic for the child and the parent.  Now, the authorities can apply for a supervision order.  The health boards will be able to send their social worker or local health nurse to see what is happening and they can talk to and counsel the parents.  They can talk to the child for two or three hours to see how the child is doing.  They can assess the child in their own time and then bring the child home again.  That way the child is not being taken away he is being supervised at home.  That is very important because the parents know they have to play their part and that is better than separating them.</P>
    <P>The supervision order is a very good thing.  I am delighted it is in the Bill because it certainly will give parents the opportunity to learn how to cope with problems.  The fact that a child will be taken away for three or four hours gives a parent time to reflect.  The parents know that if they do not get their act together their child will be taken into care.  Under the old system, the child would have been taken away and parents would have had no say in it.  Now they know that their child will return in a few hours.</P>
    <P>I still think the motherly instinct is so strong that if there was a backup service it will be of tremendous benefit to the child.  Above all, we must try to keep families together.  The family is a very important unit.  If you do not have a good family, or a close family, you will have a <Col N="1605" /> very unstable society.  It all hinges on the family.  I welcome that provision.</P>
    <P>We must come to grips with the real problems.  We can have all the Bills and laws we like, but we must come to grips with the main social problem today, which is the abuse of substances &mdash; alcohol, drugs, sniffing glue, etc.  Throwing more money at the problem is not the answer. That is what is wrong with children. When a child walks into a house, the parent sometimes says, &ldquo;Here is some money, go and buy yourself an ice cream&rdquo;.  When a child is in need they want someone to talk to them and to give them some love and care.  They do not want money for sweets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this very important motion on the Adjournment. I want to thank the Minister for coming in here to respond to this matter himself. I appreciate the demands that are on his time but, as far as I am concerned, the issue is one of major importance to many parts of rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue arose as a result of the judgment in the High Court on 29 November 1990.  Waterford students had taken an action in the Circuit Court and were defeated in an appeal hearing in the Supreme Court which gave a judgment whereby, according to my interpretation of the judgment, students had the option to be registered either at their place of birth or in whatever town or city they <Col N="1606" /> were attending college.  However, at the appeals court in Athlone last Monday the county registrar for Roscommon, Mr. McCormack, took the view, as a result of the Supreme Court judgment that students should be registered in the town where they were attending college and not at the home of their parents.  That judgment has very serious implications for many parts of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>In counties such as Roscommon, which has no third level institution, in counties such as Mayo, Leitrim, Galway, with the exception of Galway city, in Sligo, with the exception of Sligo town, Longford, Westmeath, Offaly, Donegal and Cavan the implication of that judgment is that none of the students between the ages of 18 and 21 can be registered in their home constituencies.  I am not here to criticise Mr. McCormack on the decision he has taken, but it is my interpretation of the Supreme Court judgment that students are permitted to be registered, if need be, both at home and at their place of residence in college.</P>
    <P>In my view the Supreme Court bent over backwards to point out that it was not an offence to be registered twice &mdash; the offence was to vote twice &mdash; and it drew the distinction clearly between being registered twice and voting twice. I feel that if this situation is allowed to continue it could deprive many of our young people of the opportunity to use their democratic right to vote.  As the Minister knows, many students go to Dublin, Galway or wherever, and for the first year many of them are in digs; during the second year they move out to apartments and most of them could have up to four different addresses between the time they enter third level education until the time they complete it.  It is more than likely that the vast majority of them will not bother to register.</P>
    <P>In Athlone I made the point to the county registrar that it was my interpretation of the law that a student was entitled to be registered where they were living on 15 September.  The county registrar pointed out that at that stage they had made up their minds as to whether they were going to college or not and would probably have paid a deposit on their fees.  As far as he was concerned he <Col N="1607" /> would not register any students at the revision courts in 1992.  His interpretation of the Supreme Court judgment was that they should be registered wherever they were in college.</P>
    <P>There are many issues involved here. Are different county registrars going to adopt differing attitudes?  If so, surely the situation needs clarification.  That is why I have raised this question here today.  I cannot understand how a judgment would be given that would deprive those young people of the opportunity of being registered at their place of residence or of birth.</P>
    <P>The point was made very forcibly at the revision courts that any student of 18 years of age would normally give his home address and not his address at college. However, this was questioned by the county registrar when he pointed out that it was not the student's residence but that of his parents.  I know that this matter has arisen since at a number of other revision courts in Roscommon and the county registrar has stuck to his interpretation of the Supreme Court ruling.  It is a sad and annoying situation.  Many young people throughout rural Ireland could find themselves, in the event of a general or a local election, unregistered because the vast majority of them, having been deprived of the right to be registered in the county of their birth, would probably not bother to go and register at the place where they are attending college.</P>
    <P>Many people who move out of Mayo or Roscommon and go to Dublin certainly would prefer to be registered at home &mdash; I am not talking about students but about people who move to Dublin to work &mdash; because they are familiar with the politicians in their home area and would prefer to go home to vote rather than be registered in Dublin.  We all recognise that the law of the land does not permit this and we understand why.  But when you are dealing with students it is a different situation because, as I already pointed out, those people move and do not remain at one address.  The likelihood of their being registered is practically nil, except for those who are involved in the students' union or in some other organisation and for a political reason decide <Col N="1608" /> to register as occurred in the Waterford case.</P>
    <P>I understand Senator O'Keeffe wants to share my time and I am prepared to give him five minutes of my time.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to clarify the situation once and for all.  It is fair enough if amending legislation needs to be introduced but I do not think the Minister will have to do that.  If it has to go back to the Supreme Court, then that will have to be done because I do not think this can be left unclarified.  I do not see how a judgment of the Supreme Court grants rights to students in Waterford and deprives students in other areas of the right to register at their place of birth.</P>
    <P>This decision could have very serious implications.  If one is to stick rigidly to the law, all students will have to be resident at home in September.  They will not be resident on that date in the town where they will receive their third-level education and will not move there until approximately the middle of October. How can they be registered there when they are not resident there?  That is a contradiction.  A student is likely to be away from home at college for approximately 130 days each year.  In other words, he spends a far greater portion of the year living at his parents' residence, using his parents address than he does at college.  It would be utterly wrong to deprive a student of the opportunity of being registered at his place of birth.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to clarify the situation. I have not come here with a chip on my shoulder.  I have no wish to criticise the county registrar's interpretation of the Supreme Court judgment but my interpretation is different from that of the county registrar.  I believe a student is entitled to be registered at his place of birth and that is my concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because I want clarification of this issue.  I lecture in a third level institution and the right to vote is a major issue for students. Many of them have registered <i>en bloc</i>, as it were, with a view to having an impact on the local elections.  However, my view would be different from that of Senator Naughten.  I find that many students want butter on both sides of their bread.  They <Col N="1609" /> want to be registered where they are attending school and, at the same time, they want to be maintained on the register at their place of birth.</P>
      <P>Looking at the interpretation of the Supreme Court case, I wonder if the Minister could clarify whether they have the right to be registered in both places.  This right is not granted to people who are working away from home for five or six days a week.  Is it likely that the situation regarding registration will be changed for students and does not give people working away from home a similar right?</P>
      <P>There are 36 weeks, approximately, in the school year.  I can understand that students may not be at home during the rest of the time.  They may be working during the three month summer period and may not be available to vote.  I am looking for clarification from the Minister on this issue because it is a talking point in all third level institutions because of the local elections this year.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I must confess that I approach this debate hesitantly and with considerable trepidation.  In discussing this matter at all we are treading a very delicate line between what is appropriate to us as legislators and what may be more appropriate to another institution of the State &mdash; the courts and the judicial process.</P>
      <P>The procedure for the registration of electors is a statutory process in which no role is assigned to me as Minister.  In order to be helpful to Senators, I propose to set out this process as clearly and as succinctly as possible.  It will be appreciated that I must be most careful not to comment, favourably or otherwise, on the manner in which the authorities involved discharge their statutory role. In particular, it would be grossly inappropriate for me to express any opinion in relation to the interpretation of the relevant legal provisions either by county registrars generally or by any particular county registrar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In carrying out his functions under the electoral law, the county registrar is an independent statutory officer and is not subject to direction by the Minister. There is a process laid down by law under <Col N="1610" /> which his decisions may be reviewed but they may only be reviewed in this way and not in any other.</P>
    <P>The procedure for the registration of electors is set out in the Electoral Act, 1963 and in regulations made thereunder. Briefly, a draft register is prepared by the registration authority, which is the county council or county borough corporation, following house to house or other adequate inquiry.  The draft is published and is made available for inspection in public offices throughout the registration area.  The public are exhorted by advertising campaigns conducted by the registration authorities and by my Department to examine the draft to ensure that it is adequate.</P>
    <P>Any person may make a claim for the addition or deletion of a name.  The registration authority, as far as possible, checks out the facts alleged in each claim. The list of claims is published and each claim is referred to the county registrar for ruling.  Each person affected by a claim is given notice of the time and place at which the claim will be ruled on and of his or her right to attend or be represented and give evidence, including if necessary, sworn evidence.  The county registrar rules on each claim at a public sitting usually referred to as a &ldquo;revision court&rdquo; or a &ldquo;revision sitting&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The persons concerned are notified of the ruling on the claim and of their right, if dissatisfied, to appeal against the decision of the county registrar to the Circuit Court and of the right of further appeal, on a point of law, to the Supreme Court.  This process is spelled out in the law.  It will be noted that it is a legal process.  It will also be noted that the Minister has no role and no right of intervention.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of the process I have just described, certain students of Waterford Regional Technical College appealed to the Supreme Court against a decision of the relevant county registrar which had been upheld by the Circuit Court.  I am conscious of the pitfalls involved in attempting to summarise or paraphase a judgment of the Supreme Court.  I am, therefore, arranging to have copies of the judgment placed in the Library so that Senators will be able to consult it for <Col N="1611" /> themselves.  To give a general indication of the trend of the judgment I would quote the following extract from <i>The Irish Times</i> report on the case published in their Law Report on 4 February:</P>
    <P>On a proper construction of section 5 of the Electoral Act, 1963, as amended, an individual may be ordinarily resident in more than one constituency, and a student who resides away from home while attending college will be ordinarily resident both in the constituency of his or her family home, and at least during the academic year, in the constituency in which his or her college is situate.  Furthermore, Article 16.4 of the Constitution, while imposing a ban upon double voting at a Dáil election, does not forbid double registration.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court judgment is the authoritive statement of the law on the point and must be complied with.  That much said, there are many questions arising out of the judgment and it is now up to the individual county registrars to interpret as they think fit the precise effect of the judgment in relation to the individual claims coming before them.  It would be quite inappropriate for me, as Minister to purport to give them any guidance.  But as I have indicated, there is a specific statutory process by which the ruling of a county registrar on any claim can be reviewed by the courts.  I would hope, too, that, in the light of their experience with the present register, county registrars may decide to share with one another the experience which <Col N="1612" /> each will have gained and review the different kind of cases arising with a view, as far as possible, to establishing a uniform approach in relation to future registers.</P>
    <P>So far I have been talking about the legal effect of the court judgment.  The judgment also has some very serious implications for us as legislators and as public representatives.  However the judgment is interpreted in individual cases, it seems certain that there will be a substantial element of duplicate registration. This raises an obvious and very worrying possibility of electoral abuse, particularly personation.  As legislators we must give very serious thought to this.</P>
    <P>The court judgment does not involve a constitutional interpretation, it is concerned only with an interpretation of the existing law.  It is, therefore, open to the Oireachtas to consider amendment of the law.  For example, the Oireachtas could restore the situation to what we all assumed it to be before the court judgment, and provide that no person may be registered more than once as an elector.  Given the nature of the matter I would think that any move in this regard should preferably be taken by way of agreement.</P>
    <P>There are many thoughts that would occur to one on this matter but this is not the time to dwell on them.  We will all get an opportunity of expressing them at a later date this year.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 27 February 1991.</P>
