      <P>I have notice from Senator Paddy McGowan that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to remove the anomaly that exists in the provision of scholarships and maintenance grants for second and third level students residing in the South of Ireland and attending college and taking A levels in the North of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to review the case of a prisoner in Arbour Hill (name supplied) with a view to exercising his ministerial prerogative of commuting the sentence in the light of its comparative severity taking into account the circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>Tá fógra agam ón Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Le fiafraigh d'Aire na Mara cén polasaí atá ag an Roinn i leith forbairt tionscail Sliog Éisc i gConamara go <Col N="930" /> ginearálta agus i gCill Cearáin go speisialta.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Dan Kiely of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to make funds available for the repairs to the coastline in County Kerry damaged in recent storms.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Tom Raftery of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to enforce the hormone ban and to intercept the supply of such illegal substances in order to protect the good reputation of our beef.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Avril Doyle of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The urgent need for a paediatric unit at Wexford General Hospital.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Éamon Ó Cuív of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to outline his plans for the location of further industry in Galway city and its environs to provide employment for the large number of school and college leavers each year in the area.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Mary Jackman of the following matter:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Social Welfare to allocate part of the £500,000 provided in the 1991 budget for Women's Aid to the women's refuges, particularly Adapt House in Limerick city.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators McGowan, Norris, Ó Foighil, Kiely, Raftery, Doyle and Jackman as suitable for discussion on the Ajournment.  I have selected Senator McGowan's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Norris, Ó Foighil, Kiely, Raftery, Doyle and Jackman may give notice another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have to rule the matter raised <Col N="931" /> by Senator Ó Cuív is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think at this stage that Members representative of each of the political groups in the House would wish to take the opportunity to pay tribute and express sympathy to his family on the recent tragic and premature death of the late John Kelly.  I now call the Leader of the House, Senator Seán Fallon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It saddens me to have to propose a vote of sympathy to the widow and family of the late John Kelly.  Only two weeks ago we were expressing the hope that he would make a recovery. Unfortunately, that was not to be.</P>
      <P>John Kelly, as we all know, was an excellent parliamentarian.  He was witty, quick and articulate.  He was, too, a pure academic and an outstanding legal expert, particularly in the area of our Constitution.  I think it can be said without any doubt that he was an extremely popular Member of the House on all sides of the political divide.</P>
      <P>It is amazing how we remember him. I have to say that perhaps I did not know him as well as other Members of the House and in particular his colleagues in Fine Gael.  I had the pleasure of sitting beside him eight years ago, when he was Minister for Trade and Commerce, at a Chamber of Commerce function in Athlone, and I must say I had a very enjoyable evening.  He was funny and witty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two stories that stick in my mind which he told me that night and I remember them as if I heard them yesterday. One was the famous story he told me of the politician who on Christmas Day was at home with his family waiting for his Christmas dinner.  A knock came <Col N="932" /> to the door and a gentleman arrived looking for a medical card.  The TD produced a medical card application form, asked him to fill it in and sign it.  Then he said: &ldquo;On your way home bring it to your GP, then bring it back to me and I will send it off&rdquo;.  The man replied: &ldquo;Look, I would not like to upset my doctor on Christmas Day&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He told me another story which is relevant to this House, which was that he would sooner campaign in four general elections than in one Seanad election. There is a moral in both stories if you examine them.  I am sure the Senators on the other side at the back will understand that that might be one reason why so many people on both sides of the House would like to go to the Lower House.</P>
    <P>Certainly, John Kelly will be missed. His death is a loss to all of us.  He will be missed by his family, his country and his political party.  I offer my sympathy to his widow and his family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my sad duty but great privilege on behalf of the Fine Gael group, the party which John Kelly served with such distinction for many years, to pay a short tribute to his memory.</P>
      <P>John Kelly was a distinguished Member of the Oireachtas for about 20 years, serving in the Seanad from 1969 to 1973 and then as Government Chief Whip on his first day as a Deputy.  Being a Government Chief Whip at any time, as we know, is a difficult job.  It was quite difficult at that time, as a Coalition Government had been elected after 16 years with just a slim majority.  He also spent a brief period as Attorney General &mdash; a fitting tribute to a person who was a constitutional lawyer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He had a long and distinguished parliamentary career and was without doubt the most brilliant speaker of his time.  I think I speak on behalf of all of us here in saying none of us has heard or seen a better speaker in our time here. He had a great gift of speech; he was eloquent, witty and always had good humour.  He had a tremendous independence of mind.  He was a clear thinker and speaker.  He was forthright in his <Col N="933" /> views but considerate in respect of the views of others.  He was always concerned about the welfare of Members of both Houses, of people on both sides.  He was an academic but he mixed with tremendous spirit with all Members of the House and enjoyed, as the previous speaker related, the many anecdotes and stories of political life.  He served his constituency of Dublin South with tremendous efficiency and effectiveness.  He looked after the needs of his constituents and was returned on many occasions at the top of the poll.</P>
    <P>They say no one is irreplaceable, but in my view John Kelly is irreplaceable in Irish political life and Irish life in general. On behalf of the members of the Fine Gael group, to his wife, Delphine, and family we extend our most sincere sympathy on their tragic loss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the sentiments expressed and I do so on behalf of my colleagues on the University benches here.  In passing, I may say that we fully accept your suggestion that there should be one spokesperson for each group, because on these occasions it is much more in accord with the dignity of tributes paid that they should be limited only to the spokespersons.</P>
      <P>It is very hard to accept that John Kelly is dead.  Frequently, it is more difficult to accept that certain personalities are gone than others.  It is very hard to accept that that vibrant intellect is no more; to adopt the Lear phrase, why should a dog, a horse or a rat have life and he no life at all.  It is very difficult to accept this, that he should have left us so suddenly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I knew him quite well and often participated with him in discussions, both private and public, and I subscribe to everything that has been said about his wit and his erudition.  I would also like to make the point that he was intensely patriotic while having nothing but contempt for that kind of strident, loud-mouthed nationalism which really has no substance in it.  He was genuinely patriotic, deplored that dreary imitativeness of so much of Irish life since independence &mdash; and honesty compels me to <Col N="934" /> add that he regarded the University seats as an example of that dreary imitativeness of English political culture.</P>
    <P>His witty and mordant turn of phrase would have placed him very much at home in the columns of <i>The Leader</i> newspaper at the turn of the century.  Indeed, so much of his cast of mind was of that Gaelic League early Sinn Féin days; and later on he very much respected and was, in turn, influenced by the political integrity of the first Cumann na nGaedheal administration.  He is a great loss.  He might himself squirm at the mawkishness of the phrase, but the fact is that Ireland has lost a devoted son.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I would like to convey our sympathy to the family and relatives and indeed all the people who were affected by the sudden death of John Kelly &mdash; sudden in the sense, as Senator Murphy expressed it, that none of us would have expected this to happen.  Most of us thought he was not a worrier, but the lie is given to that by what happened when he was Whip.  Any of us who were around then knew how enthusiastic he was, the way he went about trying to get people out of bars, etc. to make sure that everything was right.  He met other party Whips to ensure that everything was in order.  He certainly was a worrier but, of course, he had one or two people he had to worry about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was a quick-witted man, perhaps not in the same style as Frank Cluskey but his keen mind could come up with something very sharp and incisive, and witty.  In this he was not always at one with his own party, and was very open about that.  He told the truth equally about Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  He believed they should be one.  He was equally brutal about the Labour Party, saying that Fine Gael had no business being with them under any circumstances, that they were not his type. That was something we had to appreciate and understand about the man. He was upfront, a committed and concerned person.  Like Frank Cluskey, <Col N="935" /> he was not over-enamoured of the idea of clinics because you had to tell people you could do certain things you could not really do.  In that sense he had an affinity with Cluskey.  There is no doubt he is a great loss.  I did not expect to hear of his death at such a young age.  I would like to offer our sympathy and prayers to his wife and family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my colleagues in the Progressive Democrats I would like to extend to the Kelly family our deepest sympathy on their great loss. I had the privilege of serving in the last Dáil in which John Kelly was a Member. As a new Deputy it was a great experience for me &mdash; indeed one I will always treasure &mdash; to go into the House when John Kelly was speaking.  It was something I did on every occasion he spoke in the House.  His extraordinary ability to convey a point be it witty, serious or whatever mode he felt necessary, was something to behold.  I often wondered &mdash; as, I am sure, did others &mdash; how I could be as good as John Kelly in that vein.  There is no question but that he raised the level of debate, both in the Houses of the Oireachtas and indeed outside them.  He was a distinguished Attorney General and served in ministerial offices as well.  He is a great loss to public life in this country.</P>
      <P>He was also a brilliant academic.  He epitomised academic excellence for this country internationally for many years, most notably in Germany, by the many lectures he gave there.  He was part of Irish culture and life, both in Parliament and outside it.  His loss is a great loss &mdash; a great loss to the Fine Gael Party and to all of us not to have him here with us today.  We convey our sincere sympathy to his family.</P>

      <P>Before I call on the Leader of the House, I am happy to announce that the long-awaited simultaneous transmission system has finally been installed and today's sitting is being used as a training session for the staff involved to make any final technical adjustments that may be necessary to the system, such as the level of microphones. After this dress rehearsal it is expected that the microphones will be available in the House tomorrow and the system will be up and running.</P>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity to thank all the Members of the House for their support in urging that the translation facility be provided sooner rather than later and to offer particular thanks to my colleagues on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for their assistance and co-operation in ensuring that this essential service was made available. Indeed, a word of thanks also to Senator Ó Foighil who took every opportunity in the House to promote the case for the system.  I am aware that he wants to comment briefly on it.  If the House agrees, we will give him a brief moment to comment at this stage.</P>

      <P>Thar ceann mhuintir na Gaeltachta, phobal Gaeilge na tíre seo, agus ar son Sheanadóirí an Tí seo ba mhaith liom ár mbuíochas a chur in iúl go bhfuil an córas aistriúcháin insealbhaithe sa Teach seo.  Gheall an coiste roimh an Nollaig, an Cathaoirleach ina measc, go mbeadh sé ann tar éis na Nollag agus d'éirigh leo an sprioc sin a bhaint amach.  Tá mé faoi chomaoin freisin, ag chuile bhall den choiste, agus ag an gCathaoirleach, gur éirigh leo sin a dhéanamh.  Gabhaim buíochas chomh maith le Comhchoiste an Oireachtais don Ghaeilge as an tacaíocht a thug siad don éileamh seo, agus le gach duine ar an dá thaobh sa Teach a shaothraigh go díograiseach leis seo a chur i gcrích.

      <P>In regard to the business for today, we will resume on Item No. 3, the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990, Second Stage.  It will continue from now until 6 o'clock; we will have a sos from 6 p.m. until 6.30 p.m. and from 6.30 p.m. until 8 p.m. we will have Item No. 13, Motion 68.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, may I also welcome the introduction of the simultaneous translation system on behalf of Fine Gael and pay tribute to all, especially Senator Ó Foighil, who made this a crusade and ensured that it had a successful outcome and to you, a Chathaoirligh, for the way in which you, as Chairman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, put pressure in the right places to expedite the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if there is some way in which the Seanad could note the major political reforms that are taking place in South Africa, to express the support of the House for this continuing process and to hope that what is now started will be irreversible and comprehensive.  I feel it would be appropriate if in some way we could have a debate on that subject so that the very strong views of this House and, I hope, the support of this House for what is taking place could be <Col N="938" /> expressed.  The matter has not been debated elsewhere and I feel it is proper that at least one House of the Oireachtas should take note of this important development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points I would like to raise.  The first point is on the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990, which we are discussing today.  Obviously, we have been fully supportive in the introduction of the Bill and in dealing with that legislation. We indicated to the Government side earlier that when there is much interest in a Bill and many speakers lining up to speak, it would be advisable to go on a bit later at night.  I know that arrangements have been made for today and that the sitting finishes at 8 p.m.  I certainly feel that with the number of speakers we have at the moment there is no reason why we should not have gone on until 10 p.m.  I would suggest that the Leader of the House takes that on board if there is a pressure on business next week to do the same.  It means as well, incidentally, that people who contributed to the debate last week will have very little of a contribution to make this week.  The more that it is spread out and the longer we give to the sittings the more opportunity there is to contribute on other matters.  I would ask the Leader to respond to that and perhaps to take that on board for the future.</P>
      <P>I raised with the Leader of the House last week the need to extend the time for Private Members and asked him to respond.  I note we have the Government side tonight, which I have always found to be a contradiction in terms, but nevertheless it is there.  I think we should extend that time because it brings more interest and more variety to the business being dealt with.  As well as that, we have some additional responsibilities, with the proceedings being televised, to try to give some variety to the business as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked of the Leader before, and I made it clear that I would be raising it again this week, the question of the Bill to remove the discriminatory aspect of post-primary education.  I know the Minister had the view that it would not be <Col N="939" /> her responsibility much longer.  Now that she is back permanently with us, I ask the Leader of the House to raise that matter with her with a view to getting it cleared.</P>
    <P>The final issue I want to raise, and to ask the Leader of the House to give serious consideration to it, is the Middle East war.  We have had discussions and statements on this already and a lot has changed since that time.  We now have the person we were led to believe was the head of the armed forces, the leader of the UN, condemning some of the actions of what we were told two weeks ago was his army.  Many developments have taken place since then.  I do not intend making a speech on the issue, but we should now consider and assess where we are on this, even if we did nothing else but read back to people the speeches that were made a fortnight ago, let them see what they said and judge whether it stands the test of time.  I urgently request of the Leader of the House that this matter be given priority during next week's business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Manning in his suggestion to the Leader of the House in relation to a debate on South Africa.  The changes taking place there are momentous and perhaps are being lost in the media attention being directed at the Gulf War.</P>
      <P>I would also to a degree support Senator O'Toole's suggestion in relation to the Gulf War.  I am sure Senator O'Toole and all our colleagues on both sides of the House study war and its developments and realise that wars rarely, if ever, continue as they were meant to at the start of hostilities.  Perhaps the Leader might consider, if not in the immediate future then at some time during the session &mdash; hopefully, the war will have ended &mdash; a debate in relation to the developments in the Gulf War.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Leader of the House if he would give consideration to the possibility of this House discussing on a regular basis developments within the European Community.  For example, <Col N="940" /> on the Order paper there are eight resolutions under the heading of European Parliament.  This House, apart from specific motions, does not get the opportunity to discuss all these resolutions, and a number of them have far-reaching implications.  For example resolution (ii) on the constitutional basis of European union; resolution (vi), which deals with my own brief in the House &mdash; the development of the common transport policy in the run-up to the completion of the internal market; and resolution (viii) dealing with the executive powers of the Commission.  It is in that context that I would like the Leader to convey our thanks for the stand which the Irish Government took in the most recent discussions at European level among the Council of Ministers.  According to a report in today's <i>Irish Times</i>, the European Community will supply gas masks to Palestinians in the Israeli occupied territories&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate and fully support the Cathaoirleach's ruling on this matter.  The last time the House met statements were made, which were on the record of the House, that I had told lies to the House in relation to the Israeli Government's refusal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise an extremely serious matter with the Leader of the House.  It is a matter which has already gained much attention in the media, but not in this House.  It is a matter that very specifically affects the area the Leader of the House himself represents.  I want to put two points to the Leader of the House: (1) that he would convey the anxiety of this House on this issue and (2) that he would try to have an emergency debate on it.  The issue is the problem of funding, the crisis in funding, in the health boards areas at the moment.  This is a serious matter for local democracy and obviously for the patients concerned.  Many health boards &mdash; including the Cathaoirleach's own board &mdash; have said they will not be able to function in the coming year and that many beds will be lost&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Leader of the House will give some consideration to having an urgent debate on Northern Ireland where there is now evidence of a deplorable political stalemate.  The point of such <Col N="942" /> debate, with an appropriate Government presence, would be, I hope, to throw some light on where responsibility lies for this debacle which only plays into the hands of the paramilitaries.</P>
    <P>I support Senator O'Toole's request for a further debate on the Gulf War.  It is true that we made statements on that recently but the developments since then are alarming and the position I took, after much agonising, would be considerably modified in the light of subsequent developments.  If there is such a debate, I hope that those who had absolute conviction and certitude about their position from the beginning will recognise the good faith of those of us in this House who voted in the way we thought proper and that it will not be an occasion for triumphalist crowing.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the question of the foreign affairs committee.  Judging from what other Senators have said today, the need for this committee is now more urgent than ever.  I ask the Leader of the House and the Taoiseach to ensure that if such a committee is set up Members of this House would be included on it.  It is vitally important that it is not confined to Members of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of the Gulf War has been raised.  I lived in South Africa 20 years ago.  I was in Zimbabwe for three years and I have a deep interest in that part of the world.  The momentous changes happening there should be encouraged. They are very traumatic for both sides and a full debate is needed on that subject. Then, there is the issue of the Baltic Republics.  There were extraordinary pictures available yesterday evening on Channel 4 which were filmed in Latvia and they were just unbelievable.  These are three major worldwide issues on which both Houses should focus.  A foreign affairs committee would need to meet on a regular basis in order to discuss these subjects and the developments in Europe.  It is no longer acceptable that <Col N="943" /> there should be further delay in setting up such a foreign affairs committee.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a tabhairt don Seanadóir, Pól Ó Foighil, ar an seirbhís aistriúcháin.</P>
      <P>Everybody in the House indicated that there was a general welcome for the simultaneous translation service.  Although there was a lot of goodwill, the pressure so effectively mounted by Senator Ó Foighil had a great deal to do with the timing of this and it is appropriate that we should recognise that.  There was general consent and assistance from all the House but a particular role was played by Senator Ó Foighil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would agree with Senator Cullen who raised the question of a foreign affairs committee.  It is Item No. 49 on the supplementary Order Paper.  I wonder if the Leader of the House could assuage my concerns because I note in the newspaper <Col N="944" /> reports adverted to by Senator Cullen that it is consistently referred to as a foreign affairs committee of the Dáil. I would like a cast-iron undertaking, if possible, that it will be a proper committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas, particularly since it has been pressed for in every session of Seanad Éireann.  It would be an extraordinary insult if we were excluded from this particularly since so much of the material on the Order Paper of this House deals with foreign affairs.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to item No. 52.  I am well aware of the fact that the Order of Business has been agreed by the Whips so I have no intention of attempting to subvert that agreement or of calling for an alteration in the Order of Business for today.  I would point out that there is concern on all sides of the House on the question of the harmonisation of asylum policy in Europe which concern is sharpened as we approach 1992 by virtue of the fact that an anonymous committee of the Community may well decide for us what our asylum policy should be.  There would be general agreement throughout the House that in the light of the Gulf War, of the fact that there seems to be a policy of random arrest and export back, simply on the basis of nationality, of Iraqis and Palestinians to the Middle East&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In the same way I support the call for a debate on the Middle East, during which it would be possible to clarify at some length and in some detail Senator Mooney's partially informed views of the gas mask system. I sincerely hope he will express his great concern that the European Community found it appropriate to classify gas masks as war material when they were supposed to be supplied to the Israelis.</P>

      <P>I join with Senator Neville in hoping that Item No. 7 on the supplementary Order Paper, in the name of the Progressive Democrats, dealing with the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis being held in the Mansion House will be moved by them at an early date because this may embarrass Fianna Fáil Members of Dublin Corporation in the light of their sleight-of-hand which allowed this year's Ard Fheis to be held there.</P>

Many people cannot avail of their democratic right to vote as they may be working away from home.  Also, many young people who are on the register at home but are away in college do not have an opportunity to vote.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate Senator Byrne's feelings about the fog of words that has ascended on the House.  I support my colleague, Senator O'Toole, and a number of other speakers who suggested we should have another look at the appalling tragedy that is evolving.  There are a number of specific issues that are particularly worthy of analysis.  One is the debasement of a free press which is a long term worry to all of us who believe passionately in a free press.  A free press is a press that is able to say things that I and other people violently disagree with.  It is not freedom to agree.  Perhaps my colleagues, Senators Mooney and Cassidy who have a <Col N="948" /> great interest in the entertainment world might join with me in this, that the most-eloquent statement made recently about the war was made by Sinead O'Connor with considerable courage and bravery. It was eloquent in its simplicity and she deserves our congratulations for refusing to participate in awards which would and could be used to glorify war.</P>

      <P>If the Leader of the House is going to have a debate on that issue it should be on whether that political party should be allowed to function because that is the issue and not the restrictions on its activities.  I ask the Leader, in conjunction with a number of my colleagues, to have a debate on <Col N="949" /> agriculture which reflects not just the magnificent global figures that are quoted here but the distribution of income within the farming community and the loading of agricultural income in favour of the privileged 20 per cent at the expense of the other 80 per cent which is perhaps the greatest scandal in agriculture.</P>
      <P>Would the Leader of the House allow us to have a debate on the appalling occupation of East Timor by the ally of the United States, Indonesia, which has resulted in the deaths of perhaps 100,000 people under appalling conditions, the annexation of a separate community with no identifiable links with Indonesia which was done&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am particularly concerned about the fact that in excess of 300 people have brought Romanian children into this country.  There are problems, for example, when they want to take them on holidays they do not have an EC passport as Romania is outside the EC. Legislation should be introduced as soon as possible and the issue of single parent adoptions should be incorporated into it. When will we have a debate on this very urgent matter?  I understand that in the other House Deputy Shatter has introduced a Bill but there are some shortfalls in it.  It is a matter that is in urgent need of redress.</P>

In that spirit I will not repeat the statements that have been made in relation to asking the Leader for a debate on Agriculture other than to join with him and to allow us to clarify this situation for some of the Senators opposite who appear to have some difficulties about the matter.  There is one final matter.  Perhaps, a Cathaoirligh, from where you are sitting you are in a better position than the Leader to judge these matters.  Senator Murphy wondered about the fact that there was not suitable seating for him at a previous sitting.  From where you are sitting, Sir, can you observe that there has been a sufficient movement to the centre by the Labour benches to allow room for a seat for Senator Murphy.</P>

      <P>We are now an hour and five minutes on the Order of Business.  I have to suggest that many of the matters raised by many Senators were totally inappropriate to the Order of Business. There is no chance of some of them being raised.  Certainly we will look at many of them and see what we can do.  Senators raising these matters knew in their hearts they were just getting up to speak.  I do not think it is appropriate for a House <Col N="958" /> of the Oireachtas to continue like this. Certainly I am not impressed.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning asked for a debate on South Africa.  We had a debate on South Africa some time ago, a fairly long and worthwhile debate, an excellent debate, in fact.  I have no plans for a debate on South Africa in the very near future.  Reference was made to Senator Ó Foighil and his campaign.  I congratulate him for that and also, as Senator Lanigan said, Nioclás Ó Conchubhair, a former Senator, and, indeed, a former Cathaoirleach and Leader, who was very active in the early days in having this service brought into being.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole asked about the Environmental Protection Agency and asked that we might sit late this evening. I have indicated that we are sitting this evening on this Bill.  We could have had a half an hour of it over by now if Senators were fair.  I certainly will consider his point for next week.  I believe it will go on next week.  It is a Bill in which many Senators have expressed an interest.  On this side of the House alone, we probably have another 16, 18 or 19 speakers and the same, I know, applies to the other side.  Certainly we will not have a late sitting today but we can think about it for next week.  Senator O'Toole also asked for an extension of Private Members' Time.  I have no plan for an extension at this time.  He also asked for a debate on education.  Again, I have to say I have no plans for a debate on that.</P>
      <P>Many speakers asked for a continuation of the debate on the Gulf.  We had a full debate on that two weeks ago.  We have no plan for a further debate on that. We have very important legislation to discuss for the rest of this month.  I have always said that my priority was legislation. We have the very important Environmental Protection Agency Bill that we are very pleased to have in this House and we plan, and rightly so, to do justice to that Bill.  We also have the important legislation which many people are crying out for, the Child Care Bill. That will be taken as a priority during this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mooney talked about the Gulf <Col N="959" /> war and South Africa and he asked about developments in the EC.  Again I have to say there are no plans for a debate. Senator O'Reilly expressed anxiety about the health boards and health matters.  I say there is no plan for Government time for a debate on health.  We will have, hopefully this month, a continuation of the debate on the Appropriation Bill. Surely that is one way he can do it.  The other way, as the Cathaoirleach rightly pointed out, is in Private Members' Time if he wishes to use that.  Equally, I have no plan, as Senator Murphy requested, for a debate on Northern Ireland, He also mentioned the Gulf war.</P>
    <P>Senator Cullen asked about a foreign affairs committee.  In regard to this committee there are ongoing discussions with the Taoiseach and other parties.  I hope that there will be Seanad representation on this committee.  Again, he asked about matters dealing with South Africa.  I have no plans, Senator Neville, for a debate on item No. 7.  Senator Norris talked about a Dáil or all-party foreign affairs committee.  I repeat what I said earlier.  I am hopeful that there will be Seanad representation on this.  He also asked for a Middle East debate and for a debate on item No. 7.</P>
    <P>Senator Hugh Byrne asked for a debate on agriculture and he spoke to me about it.  Although we had a debate perhaps six weeks ago on agriculture, there is widespread support for such a debate.  I have indicated to many Members that on Government time when we get an opportunity it will be the first thing we will debate.  I accept that there are problems in the whole area of GATT, the CAP.  As far as I am concerned when we get an opportunity we will look at the possibility of a debate in Government time.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten referred to agriculture and local elections.  All I can say is that the elections are due to be held this year.  I have noted what the Senator has said in regard to Sunday polling.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan paid tribute to Senator Ó Foighil.  He asked about a debate on the Gulf and he mentioned the prison <Col N="960" /> system.  This is something on which I have personally given assurances to some of the Senators on the other side.  Senator Harte raised the matter in a very positive and diplomatic way some time ago and I am very anxious to facilitate him I will do that at the first opportunity.  He also asked about agriculture and he mentioned lowering of farm incomes. Obviously that can be dealt with in the debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Rory Kiely asked for a debate on agriculture.  I have no plans to take Items No. 1 and 2 at this point in time. Senator John Ryan asked for a debate on health.  Again, the same reply goes to him as I gave to Senator O'Reilly.  It can be done on Private Members' time or on the Appropriation Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan also referred to a point that there was never in his time difficulties in getting debates from time to time on matters like foreign affairs or relief matters.  That still is the way but it is a question now of getting legislation first and when we find we have time certainly those matters can be taken. Senator Hourigan referred to agriculture and he knows my reply on that.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan asked about foreign adoptions and Romanian adoptions in particular.  There is no Bill in place.  I know the Minister is concerned about this matter and I believe I am right in saying he is considering legislation dealing with it.  Obviously we must await developments here.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross asked for a debate on South Africa and Northern Ireland.  As I have said, I have no plans in those areas. Senator Honan congratulated Minister Daly, and rightly so.  Senator Willie Farrell's comments were noted.  Senator Cassidy made several points.  I wondered was he anxious about &ldquo;Scrap Saturday&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>May I apologise to the Minister for the undue delay experienced here this afternoon and would like to point out that many of the items raised on the Order of Business should not have been taken.  It was an insult to her.  I apologise on behalf of this side of the House for the undue delay she experienced. It seems rather ironic that people would look for an extension of time to debate this topic yet these very same people use the time during the Order of Business to delay the proceedings of the House and to cut down on the extra time they are seeking.</P>
      <P>I spoke at some length the last occasion we looked at this Bill.  I do not propose to go back over trodden ground.  Instead, I would like to mention a number of items I raised by way of emphasis today.  First, there is the issue of the county development plan versus the IDA and the location of industry.  I made the point the last night that every county council and city authority have a development plan on a five-year basis.  Generally speaking, they decide where industrial development should be sited and the suitability in regard to the different types of industry.</P>
      <P>In the past because of the fact that the IDA may have a land bank which is not located within this particular development plan, or which is not earmarked for a certain type of industry, try to locate an industry, such as Merrill Dow in Killeagh thereby causing all sorts of difficulties. Does the Minister see any role for the agency with regard to suitability of site and endorsement of development plans prior to the siting of industry?  Perhaps when the Minister is replying she might advert to that difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also mentioned the last night recruitment and the fact that obviously staff will be transferred from An Foras Forbartha and other Departments and that some staff members will be identified with the local authorities.  I expressed my concern about the word &ldquo;identify&rdquo; in that there <Col N="962" /> seemed to be some element of coercion in that.  Perhaps on Committee Stage the Minister would look at that work.  I also raised the issue of staff and the fact that we are decentralising the Environment Protection Agency.  We all welcome that. In decentralising that agency there is the suggestion of coercion particularly of members of what was formerly An Foras Forbartha and perhaps taking them to various different parts of the country out of Dublin.  How happy will they be with that situation?  How happy, for instance, will be the members of local authorities who will be asked to join the new agency?</P>
    <P>I also raised the issue of salaries and the fact that the salary of some people with An Foras Forbartha would be much better than that of people in local authorities. Perhaps the Minister would also have a look at this area.  I mentioned that perhaps it would be better when setting up an agency to have direct recruitment and thereby having a direct commitment to the agency from day one than having people seconded to the agency who are not totally committed to it.</P>
    <P>One of the things that causes me concern in an otherwise fine Bill is the interaction between local authorities and the Environment Protection Agency.  One of the areas where this seems clearly at variance is that the local authority have control over the agricultural land.  It would appear that the agency will be given control over monitoring the rivers and lakes. I pointed out that many of the difficulties and the pollution that arises in rivers and lakes emanates from agriculture.  I suggested that perhaps the Minister would have another look at that and if she is giving the agricultural side of it to the local authority perhaps the monitoring of lakes and rivers would also be left with the local authority with the agency still maintaining a co-ordinating role in that respect.</P>
    <P>I also raised at some length the possibility that when seeking planning permission under an EC directive, particularly for the pharmaceutical industry, that there is an EC requirement that we would have an environmental impact study.  A local authority, the planning <Col N="963" /> authority, are required by law to give planning permission based on good planning and also based on an environmental impact study being submitted with it. While I understand the impact study will have to be given to the agency for comment I can envisage a situation where a local authority could give planning permission to an industrial project while the agency may refuse to grant a licence.  To get over that situation I ask the Minister again to see if we could have a much better co-ordinating role between the two.  It does not seem to be as clear-cut as it could be.</P>
    <P>Following on from that, might I question the role of An Bord Pleanála when it comes to appeals, given the emergence of the EPA.  Everyone here will agree that with all future pharmaceutical planning applications there will be a demand for an oral hearing?  If we look at the past record of oral hearings in this regard, we will see that they concentrated mostly on the impact the planning would have on the environment.  Under the EPA, we have the licensing taken away from the local authority.  Can the Minister see a meaningful role for An Bord Pleanála, given that this fact has emerged?</P>
    <P>There could be a situation where somebody demands an oral hearing and that is granted by An Bord Pleanála.  The industrial promoters come before An Bord Pleanála, they present their case and they have to have their environmental people there to argue why the planning permission should be granted. On the other side of it, the EPA may grant an oral hearing.  There is a possibility that we will, on the one hand, have an oral hearing with An Bord Pleanála and another with the EPA.  That would defeat the purpose for which the EPA are to be set up and certainly the co-ordinating role that the Minister envisages for it.  Could the Minister ensure that if an oral hearing is to be held that hearing and the Bord Pleanála oral hearing will be held simultaneously?  With 220,000 unemployed the last thing we want is projects held up for 18 months or two years.  The faster we can get these off <Col N="964" /> the ground the better all of us would like it.</P>
    <P>May I digress for a moment and take up the question of appeals with an Bord Pleanála?  In the recent past there have been delays of up to ten months before final decisions were taken on appeals. However, there has been an improvement, thanks to the Minister of State and the Minister for the Environment in ensuring that the staff in An Bord Pleanála has been increased and that there is a greater awareness of the fact that appeal decisions should come out more rapidly.  Is it possible to categorise some of the planning appeals coming before An Bord Pleanála at present?  I suggest they could be put into three categories, private appeals for private homes and the commercial and the industrial appeals.  In regard to the industrial side, to improve the take off of industry and employment creation, is it possible that the Minister would consider requiring An Bord Pleanála to make decisions on such appeals within a three month period? After all, if the local authority are required to make a decision within two months is it too much to ask an Bord Pleanála to make a decision on an industrial appeal within a three month period?</P>
    <P>I would also like to use the occasion to welcome the setting up of proper regulations and standards pertaining to environmental impact studies for projects covered under the EC directive, I have no doubt that standards, regulations and applications have varied between different local authorities.  There is even a suggestion that conditions were less stringent under some local authorities than they were in others.  There is every likelihood that the promoters of some of the projects were well aware of this and used it to their own benefit in the past, thereby leaving us with certain environmental problems that cause difficulty for other local authorities who were doing the job properly.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 104 and I admit that it was extremely difficult for a local authority up to now to get a conviction relating to noise pollution, given the fact that the local authority had to prove nuisance. <Col N="965" /> The new Bill brings noise within all-embracing legislation which will make it easier to prosecute, given the specification of levels so that if a party exceed certain decible levels that party will be subject to the rigours of the law.  That is a very welcome addition.</P>
    <P>I will dwell for a minute on the open door approach in section 64.  The open door approach is certainly very welcome to the public and I must say is welcome to industry as well.  Let me use this opportunity to endorse the stand taken by the Sandoz Company, who are now going ahead with a project in Cork, on being the very first to open their doors and to show others how it can be done, how you can bring the people with you rather than have the veil of secrecy that applied in the not-too-distant past.  I ask the Minister to consider the frequency of the availability of such reports.  Will they be weekly, monthly, or quarterly?</P>
    <P>In making this point, I am genuinely conscious of the possibility of people crawling all over the agency office looking for information on monitoring.  There must be the suggestion that we will have an implication of increased costs here in making such information available. Obviously, the more frequently you make it available the more staff will be required as a back-up and the whole process will become more costly.  I do not think that that is the idea behind the Bill. The Minister will recall, with a wry smile, that when this agency was first mooted £500,000 was suggested as being available to set it up, whereas now that provision has grown to £8 million.  I pose the question: can it be held at that figure if we are to immerse the agency in bureaucracy, being mindful also of the capital and operational costs that will accrue?  Operational costs do not come into play with a local authority in that these costs are already being paid for; there is no increase in staff.  If you go down the road of having a completely open door and having material and monitoring results available at a whim then, in my view, an extreme danger of escalating costs will ensue.</P>
    <P>I would also like, under this section on <Col N="966" /> an open door policy, to raise the question of the company's right of confidentiality in respect of processes and the danger of making sensitive information available to competitors.  Up to now companies have told us that the veil of secrecy existed to prevent competitors getting information that could be detrimental to the original company in the long run.  I go along with the Minister that that was a handy cop out but I think that there is a level to which we can ascend or descend with regard to making information available before we impinge on the rights of companies. I would ask the Minister in her reply to advert to my question in this regard.  In this section I would also ask the Minister if the agency have any regard to the application of the <i>sub judice</i> rule? I am aware that certain local authorities in making submissions to the Minister were very conscious of difficulties that might arise under the <i>sub judice</i> rule and are certainly very anxious to have that included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under section 59 we come to landfill sites.  Here again we see that the performance of the local authority will be dictated by the agency.  I welcome that. I see inherent dangers here again, for costs.  If we are going to make demands on the local authority to reach a specific standard, that standard will cost money. It is estimated that disposal costs at present are roughly about £2 per tonne. If stringent regulations are brought in it was suggested to me the burden could be £5 or £6 per tonne.  This would place a fairly heavy burden on the local authority and would certainly place an enormous burden on some private operators who are helping local authorities, in many areas, to provide a service which has not been available hitherto.</P>
    <P>Dealing also with costs, we will have a look at secondary treatment.  Every one of us welcomes the fact that the Government are prepared to spend £1,000 million on the provision of plants.  That is as it should be, and it is not before time, because it is now held that many local authorities were the greatest polluters of all.  They in turn would maintain <Col N="967" /> that they were polluters because they could not get enough funding from central authority to tackle the problem. There is now a very positive move in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is fine to provide money for the setting up of these secondary treatment plants but nothing has been said about providing funding for the operation of these plants by local authorities.  Will more finance be made available to local authorities from Central Exchequer? Will some type of levy be placed on households to meet the extra costs that will accrue to local authorities, or will we have to increase substantially the costs to the householder in those particular areas where service charges are operational.</P>
    <P>Before I leave landfill sites I would also like to advert to the fact that landfill sites are a major headache to any local authority.  There is no greater headache than the Cork city landfill site at present. It can be claimed, justifiably, that the operation of that site may not have been what it should have been.  We now have a situation that is out of control and we have a section 4 on that particular landfill site, a landfill site which would certainly have met the city's refuse requirements for the next ten to 20 years.  We have a section 4 asking that it would continue in operation for five years only.  The question has to be asked if that landfill site closes down whether the people in The Mahon in Cork the people in Gurranebraher in Cork, or in some other part of the city, will have to accept the landfill site?  We know the problems that ensue with people in trying to place one of these sites.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister &mdash; I know that is something that is close to her heart &mdash; as an alternative to the major concentration on landfill sites, should look at various options in the future.  The landfill site is an option that is going to stay with us. There are certainly two other areas that are well worth looking at.  I would draw the Minister's attention &mdash; and I know she is very well aware of it &mdash; to an anaerobic digester which is a pilot project operating in Ballincollig at present and <Col N="968" /> the results of which indicate that it is going to be tremendously successful in the digestion of raw sewage.  I refer to output from factories like Pfizers and particularly to offal which, as you know, has been dumped in various fields around this counry without any control at all.  The ironic thing is that Cork County Council, given the success of the project to date, are quite happy that it can be a success but obviously they are looking for money to pursue a feasibility study.  Why I say it is ironic is that they have got £50,000 directly form the EC to fund that pilot project yet the Department of the Environment to date have failed to come up with any funding for that feasibility study. I would ask the Minister as a matter of urgency to look at this project as it would appear to offer great prospects for the future.  I would also ask her to look at the issue of incineration.  While it is expensive, it is something that does not have the emotional impact that landfill sites seem to have.  Perhaps in dealing with the agency she would emphasise to them the importance of looking at other alternatives to landfill sites.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the word &ldquo;accreditation&rdquo; and to remind the Minister again that accreditation from the Irish Laboratory Accreditation Board is recognised in Europe.  Some local authorities have their laboratories accredited at this stage or are on the verge of accreditation.  I understand that traceability, accountability and reliability go hand-in-hand with accreditation.  May I ask the Minister if it is the intention of the agency to acquire accreditation under the Irish Laboratory Accreditation Board for its laboratories because if it is, that will involve it in extremely expensive processes.</P>
    <P>Given the fact that there is a provision in the Bill for use of the facilities of local authorities by the agency the likelihood is that the agency will look to those local authorities that have accredited laboratories. Can the Minister envisage a situation where some local authorities would be bogged down with monitoring work and laboratory work on behalf of the agency to the detriment of some of <Col N="969" /> the other work that would come under their ambit?  How would the Minister envisage that this difficulty might be overcome?</P>
    <P>There are two other points I would like to make to the Minister.  Section 60 states: &ldquo;the local authority will be directed to carry out the functions in question but only if the local authority has the necessary funds.&rdquo;  Some people will say that this is a cop-out and that it gives an opportunity to the local authority to avoid spending fairly sizeable sums of money.  In regard to that and in view of this condition in relation to availability of funds, is it the intention of the Minister that the agency would make a suggestion to the Department of the Environment concerning what the agency would consider to be priority projects and requesting that those priority projects would have funding made available to them?  It is hardly worthwhile having an agency make a suggestion to a local authority that something should be done if the local authority can say to the agency that they would love to do it and that it is very desirable to do it but that the money has not been made available.  I am wondering if there is any way the agency could have some format by which it could suggest to the Department the order of priority in which projects should come onstream.</P>
    <P>There is one final point I would like the Minister to refer to when replying. Vegetable processing appears to have been left out of the ambit of the agency whereas sugar beet comes within its ambit.  My understanding is that there is a fair level of BOD emissions from food processing plants.  It seems sensible that if sugar beet is put under the ambit of the agency that food processing should be under it as well.</P>
    <P>I will have other points to make on Committee Stage.  It is an extremely important Bill that is going to have major implications for the environmental control of this country for the image of this country abroad regarding the degree of care we have for our environment.  Care of the environment should also lead to job creation.  While I may seem to have been critical on a number of issues, I <Col N="970" /> would like to emphasise that I am looking for direction rather than fault-finding.  I am trying to anticipate problems that may arise because nobody in this House can deny that this Bill sets out the ideals to be attained.  There are practical difficulties in the attainment of those ideals. I hope that anything I have said with regard to this Bill will serve to resolve those practical difficulties to enable us to achieve the ideals for which we all strive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the frustration of Senator O'Keeffe at having to wait for such a long time.  I suppose the protracted Order of Business mirrors the frustration of Members who submit motions and find after an 18 month period that they are still there and are becoming largely irrelevant. I would not accept that the interruptions should be tolerated to the degree to which they are tolerated.  I am glad that the Minister is still with us.</P>
      <P>Like the Senators who spoke last week and today, I welcome this long-awaited Environmental Protection Agency Bill and I commend the Minister for her vigour and tenacity in pursuing the measures and objectives set out for the protection of our environment.  We are very quick to promote our country as a country with a fresh environment and ideally suited to agriculture and to food production.  Our community, however, remains ambivalent in its attitude to pollution. We tend to regard pollution as somebody else's responsibility.  Although we have a Litter Act and substantial fines for contravening its laws, one does not notice any great improvement in our cities, towns and countryside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a teacher, I have seen programme after programme of environmental studies on the curriculum at primary level and second level but those programmes have not yet influenced all our young people to be more aware, more vigilant and more responsible in relation to our environment. It is a matter I find extraordinary difficult to unravel after many years. Twenty years ago students were far more protective of our environment with little or no education at that level on the curriculum. Unlike present-day students <Col N="971" /> who have the advantage of environmental programmes.  This is an issue that should be looked at again in the educational system.  Why is there a contradiction between what they learn in class and apply within the school grounds and what happens outside?  Once they go outside the school grounds they tend to leave their environmental education within the campus.</P>
    <P>The Minister in her opening speech two weeks ago referred to the distinction between our environmental situation and that of other EC countries saying: &ldquo;Heavy industry passed us by leaving us almost alone in Europe with a relatively unspoilt environment&rdquo;.  I would say that it was through an accident of colonisation policy that we were by-passed by the industrial revolution and by its ravages which are still to be seen in many major cities in the United Kingdom, in France and Germany, despite heavy funding to erase or remedy those desolate reminders.  That accident of colonisation policy has been to our advantage.</P>
    <P>Our fresh clean environment is something special and precious and is a strength we must preserve.  It is a vital asset to our tourist promotion, to the marketing effort behind our food products from land, sea and water and indeed to our leisure facilities which are of growing importance.  All of these attract overseas investment whether in high-tech industry or in the financial services. Therefore, the priority the Minister, and indeed the Government and Opposition parties, is giving to the protection of the environment is very welcome.  National, local and EC regulations require that environmental standards should be protected and improved.  Political commitment and will is now being put behind those efforts.</P>
    <P>Throughout the eighties, public awareness of the threat to the environment and of its possible global repercussions has been aroused regarding the depletion of the ozone layer, the implications of global warming, the destruction of the rain forests and very recently regarding oil spillages and their use as a weapon as we have <Col N="972" /> seen in the Gulf War.  In Ireland we have been largely untouched but we know of the scares and the damage caused by Chemobyl and of the debate and controversy over our possible contribution to Europe's acid rain and, of course, we are aware of the smog problem which enveloped our capital until action was taken.</P>
    <P>Despite all of this, Fine Gael Oireachtas Members were acutely disappointed by the negative Government reaction to its Private Members' Bill which predated this legislation by over 14 months.  We should surely be aware that on environmental matters, delays can be detrimental and it only allows the problems to increase.  In reading through the Bill, I am gratified to note that many of the provisions of the Fine Gael Bill have been written into this legislation and that the concerns of other interested bodies have also been given recognition but what arrests our attention is the key issue of the independence of the agency.  It is not only the Fine Gael Party who have highlighted the question of the agency's independence; other interested bodies have done likewise.  Fine Gael sought a resolution regarding the appointment of a director general for the agency.  We are not happy, either, that the Minister for the Environment can change the personnel appointed to the committee by way of order.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the structure of the foreign affairs committee.  Fine Gael looked for the establishment of an Oireachtas environment committee. That is something the Minister could have taken on board.  This would have been a mechanism for making sure that the recommendation of the watchdog agency would be implemented in legislation by Government.</P>
    <P>In many parts of the Bill the Minister refers to an integrated approach.  This link between the Oireachtas and the agency would have been appropriate and it would fit in with the integrated approach which characterises many aspects of the Bill.  In the same vein and in the interests of an integrated approach, it would also have provided for a clean <Col N="973" /> start if our Departments had been obliged to hand over files relating to environmental issues such as those on the operations of the Sellafield reprocessing plant.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael's concern also is that there is no provision for appeal against the terms of licences granted under this measure.  This concern is shared by many bodies, from the Confederation of Irish Industry to the various environmental groups.  If the public does not have that right of appeal they will become extremely frustrated.  We have the situation relating to Sandoz as Senator Batt O'Keeffe mentioned.  That sense of frustration can become very deep and bitter if people as a group feel that they do not have access to an appeals process.  I am not just talking about industry in particular but the general public.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does accept that there will be a provision for appeal &mdash; this will be debated at length in the next few days &mdash; I wonder about the amount of expertise in the agency.  This is a good thing but I do not know where the general public could get the expertise they would need in relation to appeals, if all available expertise is already within the agency.</P>
    <P>The agency and its powers must instil confidence in those charged with protection of the environment that the job can be done.  It should also inspire respect in those it sets out to police.  Thus, it is vitally important that the agency should have the power to act quickly and should be seen to do so.  In this regard Fine Gael are concerned about the absence of powers for the agency which would enable it to act with control and emergency orders through the courts to prevent or arrest a pollution incident.  This is one thing we would have liked to have seen and perhaps the Minister may yet include it.</P>
    <P>I share the concerns of other Senators that many sections of this Bill do not become operable without a ministerial order, which means that some actions and measures would have to take their place in the queue on the parliamentary legislation programme.  If the queue on the Dáil legislation programme is anything like the queue for motions on our <Col N="974" /> Order Paper, that is certainly something the Minister should look at.</P>
    <P>One of the major criticisms levelled at An Bord Pleanála related to the length of time taken for objections to be processed through oral hearings together with the subsequent consideration and decision-making. It is very important that this agency should be able to act quickly.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the most vital aspect of the Bill which relates to resources. Resources, of course, are of paramount importance.  I refer to the resources made available to the agency and to those provided for those agencies and operations which will come under the orders of the agency.  Keeping an eye on the resources of the agency and on other matters is a job which could have been given to an Oireachtas environment committee.  Certainly the pressure would be on them to ensure that resources would be provided.</P>
    <P>The partnership this new agency will have with local authorities, is very important. There is not a very compatible relationship at the moment between local authorities and the Department of the Environment and I hope this lack of partnership will not be continued between the new agency and local authorities.</P>
    <P>In the area of environmental protection and conservation, we tend to perpetuate ambiguity and we add to the dilemma of taking action with the rules and lack of resources of our local authorities. On the one hand, our local councils are planning authorities and they have a responsibility to protect the environment but, on the other hand, our councils are also developmental agencies in their own right and they are striving to provide resources and facilities to attract industry and jobs.  Our councils are also responsible for monitoring and protecting our rivers and coastal waters.  Yet, many of these very same authorities are the very agencies responsible for discharging raw sewage directly into our rivers, harbours and estuaries.</P>
    <P>In one sense a positive effect of the agency's establishment is that the local authorities will now be freer from many of the roles and functions they had regarding the stringent measures needed <Col N="975" /> in order to look after farm pollution but at the end of the day a fine balance is involved.  Distinctions and lines will have to be drawn and roles will have to be fully spelled out.  A balanced approach is necessary and practical and practicable relationships and operational assistance must be put into place.  This new agency will have to grapple, too, with the perception of local authorities as the agents responsible for monitoring and controlling toxic waste emissions by industry. We have to deal with the very cynical public view of the councils, especially in the wake of cases like that of John Hanrahan and the Merck, Sharpe and Dohme Company near Clonmel.  There are other cases which tend to underline that limits and standards laid down by authorities may not always be complied with and also underline the shortcomings in our system of policing and enforcing any standards or limits we set out.</P>
    <P>As a member of Limerick County Council I am only too familiar with these problems and the difficulties caused through lack of funding, manpower, resources, expertise and technology.  I would cite the example of Aughanish Alumina, which is the biggest single industrial investment in this country and it is one which sparked genuine and exaggerated fears of its impact on the environment when it was first mooted back in the seventies.  Limerick County Council is the licensing authority for Aughanish. It has open access to the plant and its site to monitor emissions and waste disposal. Aughanish Alumina monitoring equipment is superior to that vailable to the council, with the result that Aughanish largely is relied on to keep its finger on its pulse and to keep records of its own emission standards and levels.  Some industries may not be so responsible and environmentally conscious.  What is now the system at Aughanish is, to use an analogy, like a driver breathalysing himself or herself and then turning himself or herself in when he or she is over the limit.  Perhaps not all industries may be as conscientious as Aughanish Alumina, but it is something that worries me: the <Col N="976" /> lack of resources within local authorities to be able to monitor industries that we have, likely, in this country.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the need for practical balance in the operations of this agency and their powers.  This is particularly important.  In relation to the competitiveness of industry.  We must be fair in striking the right balance between environmental control measures against the real risk to health and the environment and between the economic cost of such controls.  The best protections in industry, and those which are least costly, are those installed in advance or worked out in the production processes and operations of the firm.  Indeed, firms can save money by saving on waste.  This is the policy and attitude which we should be trying to develop &mdash; a working relationship with industry in which we show that we understand the problems which firms face and that we want to help them to help themselves.  It is very important that the spirit of co-operation is one that is underlined over and over again.</P>
    <P>Turning to the matter of integrated licensing, which the new agency will operate, I note that the Bill provides that the best available technologies will be used but will not entail excessive costs.  I regard this as reasonable, but I would like the Minister to enlighten us on who will decide on what the best available technologies are and will industry be compelled to adopt the best available technologies.</P>
    <P>Section 82 also provides for a two-stage public consultative process in relation to draft integrated licences.  This provides for objections and oral hearings if necessary. The public participation and access to the process is important and, hopefully, besides providing a forum and public access to matters about which the community may have concern, this process would also help to allay worries and so speed up the granting of licences and controlled operations by firms or other entities.  That is something to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome both section 55 and section 56 under which the agency will provide advice and assistance to local <Col N="977" /> authorities.  Senator O'Keeffe raised this matter a few moments ago.  If the agency operations reveal that local authority funding and facilities are not up to the task, will the agency then step into the gap or be able to offer appropriate funding? When the agency fix standards of operation for local authority sewage treatment plants and landfill sites, will the resources be available to local authorities to comply with the standards?  I am asking if this Bill and the establishment of this agency is simply the will and if lack of funding at local authority or agency level will prevent us finding the way to put that will into action?</P>
    <P>In other areas, I would ask the Minister if the word &ldquo;guidelines&rdquo; is not too vague in relation to the information to be contained in environmental impact statements? In the interest of establishing a workable relationship between this important new agency and our planning authorities, I hope that the groundwork has already been laid by consultation and liaison between those drawing up this Bill and those involved in the local government reform proposals.  I would have presumed that it would have been a major aspect of local government reform.  I have not seen the reform proposals but I hope it was worked out in relation to that reform.</P>
    <P>I welcome the ECU labelling scheme and I am glad that, for once, we are ahead of EC regulations on product labelling. One particular supermarket, Quinns-worth, are pushing hard on environmental care.  I hope that consumer education and awareness will be further advanced and cultivated through information packs and an awareness programme, aimed not just at schools but at all levels of society.  Industry, too, can play a major role in this process by having open days for all.  Aughanish Alumina are extremely open for a company which works around the clock.  They are extremely open to environmental groups, geography associations, teachers, schools and the general public.  I would say there is not a day for which they have not planned a tour throughout their company. That, in itself, is a very worthwhile <Col N="978" /> exercise, where the general public can go to industry, are given a briefing session and can see what is being done in the area of pollution.  Obviously, that can show that firms have responsible care for society and that they take action when action is needed to be taken.  Sometimes through ignorance we can kick and shout against problems without ever having had access to industry to see what steps have been taken by industry.  Such tours would surely alleviate the concern of the general public by making them more aware.</P>
    <P>We should be looking for greater liasion and co-ordination between the Departments of the Environment and Education in relation to the schools programmes to bring people up-to-date with what is happening.  Although I have criticised already the situation whereby there is a tremendous emphasis on environment, perhaps it might be too theoretical; and I think that school visits and the practical application is something that will have a far greater influence on the students rather than something that they read in text books.  All it needs is time. As a geography teacher, I found no difficulty in having access to many firms in the mid-west.  They were always very encouraging to students, despite problems with insurance.  The one thing that the student, whether a first year or a sixth year student, remembered after leaving school was the trip to the factory or the farm.  That sort of liaison is something that should be taken up between the Departments.</P>
    <P>In looking through the committee that is selecting the director of the agency I am glad to see that two women are included, one the chairperson of the council of An Taisce and the chief executive of the Council for the Status of Women.</P>
    <P>That is very much to be welcomed. Despite the negative aspects &mdash; I did not wish them to be negative; I wished them to be seen in a positive light by the Minister &mdash; we are all very supportive to the Minister in her efforts, not only in safeguarding our environment for a <Col N="979" /> better life, better prospects and developmental potential, but also we are playing our own small but responsible part in shaping a pollution-free planet.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether Johnstown Castle in County Wexford is to be the centre for the agency.  It may be on the east coast, and I suppose those of us on the west coast feel that there is always that distinction between east and west, but it is outside the Pale and if it is to be Johnstown Castle in County Wexford I certainly would welcome it as a measure of decentralisation.  By and large, we support this Bill.  It is a very good one and I hope the Minister will take into account the various points I raised, which I raised from a positive viewpoint and which I think would make the Bill an even better one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I would like to be associated with the remarks which the two previous speakers made to the Minister concerning the unwarranted delay in the Order of Business, whereby the Minister of State had to wait in excess of nearly an hour and a quarter.  This is unfortunate, because from time to time we have criticism, particularly from the opposite side, that Ministers are not available in the House.  I would like to be associated with the expression of apology to the Minster in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on her great endeavours in bringing this Bill before the House.  Indeed, as Chairman of Cork County Concil last year, when Cork was the epicentre of the environmental debate, I am well aware of the interest the Minister took in the Cork area, particularly in relation to the Merrill Dow issue and Sandoz, etc.  The Bill is to be welcomed.  One apprehension that I had &mdash; and I expressed it last year, being a member of a local authority, a member of Cork County Council &mdash; was that there was a fear among councillors, and indeed among county managers, that there would be overlapping and a watering down of the powers of the local authority. I am glad to see that the main <Col N="980" /> thrust of the Bill sees a liason with local authorities.</P>
    <P>As far as the planning functions are concerned, they are basically being left intact with the local authorities.  The new integrated licensing provision will relieve the burden of responsibility on the local authorities, where you had to apply for air pollution licences, water emission licences and so on.  There was a serious problem in the Cork area concerning these licences.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refute the concept abroad that local authorities are not concerned about the environment.  Last year, working in close liaison with the environmetal department of Cork County Concil, spearheaded by Ian Maclean, a noted international expert on the environment, we had to deal with the great concern in the county at large for the environment.  The one fear that I and others had in relation to reducing the powers of the local authority has not materialised and I am happy to say that the proposals put forward in this Bill regard a good working relationship with all local authorities as essential.</P>
    <P>I suppose the environmental debate in Ireland, commenced in my own home territory when in 1974 the biggest oil spillage ever occurred in Bantry Bay.  The local authority and the Government at the time were unable to cope with this problem.  It eventually sorted itself out. At that stage I think it created a realisation by the council, by the Government, and indeed internationally, of the serious damage this could do to the area.  More recently we heard of the serious oil slick in the Gulf, to a lesser extent that was the situation for several months in Bantry Bay; but, luckily enough, that particular oil spillage was contained.  The debate is still going on.</P>
    <P>Not too long ago in my home town there was a very well attended meeting at which the fishermen, particularly the mussel fishermen, tourist interests and public representatives came together to try to decide whether the single buoy moorings in Bantry Bay should be allowed.  Perhaps this is to a certain extent bordering on the marine side, but <Col N="981" /> certainly we are still dealing with an aspect of the environment that sparked off a big debate.  In 1976 An Taisce spearheaded huge opposition to the construction of an oil refinery on Whiddy Island and were successful at that stage in stopping an approach by a large multinational whereby a tourist area, indeed an area with rich fishing grounds, could have been devastated if the island had been overdeveloped along those lines.</P>
    <P>I believe that environmentally friendly industries must be welcomed and they can live together.  In Cork we have at least several examples throughout the county where pharmaceutical and chemical industries are thriving in the midst of farming communities and in strong tourist locations.  I might cite the case of the Eli Lilley factory, which is only a few miles from the very popular town of Kinsale and in the midst of a large farming area.  It has thrived there over the last decade or so with not a whimper either from the farmers or the tourists.  It is a shining example of how industry can blend in with the farming community and be acceptable at local level.  There is also the example of Schering Plough.  In addition these two very welcome companies in Cork are creating huge employment. They have succeeded in proving that, with the right approach industry can find a home in this country.</P>
    <P>There was a large public outcry, in east Cork particularly but indeed throughout Cork county, which resulted in Merrill Dow eventually pulling out of east Cork. There are different opinions on that.  I believe that that industry was a huge loss to this country.  I think the wrong reasons were put forward initially to bring about the loss of this industry, put forward by a small group of well-heeled objectors in this area.  It might be appropriate that this industry should have been sited in Ringaskiddy.  Initially, when Merrill Dow came, one wonders if the IDA were persuaded to site it in Ringaskiddy, which is a huge industrial zone.  I believe it is the largest in the country.  At any rate I felt &mdash; as indeed did the vast majority of the 48 members of Cork County Council, bar two poeple who expressed reservations <Col N="982" />&mdash; that it was a matter that was handled badly and that it was a huge loss to this area.  Less than 12 months earlier a similar type industry, set up in the Dublin area without a whimper.  On one occasion when a deputation from our council headed by myself met the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, his attitude was that if you tried to site a henhouse in Cork there would be an objection.  That is an image of our county that was projected and it is something we must certainly try to ensure is rectified.</P>
    <P>In relation to Sandoz, they must be complimented on going ahead with their project despite the fact that currently there are High Court proceedings pending. Sandoz came in.  They took the bull by the horns.  They met with local interests, council, etc., and they proved beyond reasonable doubt that this industry can be sited in Ringaskiddy without causing any pollution or without causing any fears to the public.</P>
    <P>There is a great concern in the Ringaskiddy area about smells in the lower harbour and so on.  This is a matter that must be tackled.  The council were blamed for being incapable of tackling this, but it is not too long ago since legislation was introduced to enable the local authorities to take action against air pollution offenders.  In one particular case, where Cork County Council granted planning permission to an industry in the Ringaskiddy area, certain minimum guidelines for the emission to the air of pollutants were set down but, on appeal by that particular industrial company to An Bord Pleanála, to my amazement the guidelines were totally watered down. An Bord Pleanála failed in that instance to take cognisance of the serious reservations expressed by the council in imposing certain restrictions.</P>
    <P>I think that this integrated licence system will neatly combine and co-ordinate the old problem whereby an industry had to go along, first of all, to get a licence for air emissions, water output, sewage, etc.  This is a very welcome move and will help industry in their endeavours to set up in this country.</P>
    <P>I think the Sandoz company will be one <Col N="983" /> of the major industries to be sited in this country.  Work is in progress on that site. As I have said already, despite some opposition and High Court action currently being processed, they are going ahead with this project.  Indeed, the whole county welcomes such a development. Whereas certain fears have been expressed by the community in the Ringaskiddy area, I think the setting up of this agency will certainly help to allay the fears of the public.</P>
    <P>The truth is that the general public had lost confidence in the local authorities, particularly in Cork County Council.  It seemed to be the epicentre of the whole environmental debate over the last two years or so.  The public castigated not alone the members of the council but the managers and, indeed, the staff.  The environmental development of Cork County Council is probably the strongest in the country.  There are 19 full-time staff.  I hope some of these staff may be used for employment with the agency and that their expertise will be widely welcomed.</P>
    <P>One fear that people had of this agency is that it would be centralised and stand apart from local authorities.  I would like to cite one example.  About two years ago a pollution problem arose within ten or 12 miles of Cork.  The local authority were contacted and within two or three hours Mr. Ian Maclean and his team were on the site taking responsible and proper action.  Certainly liaison with the councils is to be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the very sensible and obvious move to create new offences and proper penalties for offenders.  We can categorise these basically into two types of penalties.  The summary penalty applies at District Court level where relatively minor offenders face a penalty of £1,000, plus a daily penalty should the offender not rectify the situation.  Then at a higher level there is a prosecution by the Director of Public Prosecutions, which may be initiated by the agency, where the penalties are as high as £10 million.  This is to be welcomed.  Large multinational companies can come in <Col N="984" /> here and from time to time we do get a bad apple.  I think that is probably the problem we have in Cork.  One or two bad apples spoil the whole image of industry. Now there are huge penalties which can be imposed and all costs incurred in prosecuting these cases will have to be borne by the offending company, or individual, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker, Senator Jackman, touched on the question of environmental awareness in schools.  I was very happy, in the last four or five months since the new term commenced last September, that at least eight or nine children in my home town wrote to me on a number of matters concerning the environment.  The awareness of teachers and children in a classroom was a pleasant surpise to me.  They were concerned about many matters.  One matter that some of the children raised was the ongoing problem we have along the south coast of pollution from ships.  We are on the main shipping lanes coming on to the coastline.  This may be going into the realms of the Department of the Marine, but certainly it is an environmental hazard that has to be tackled.</P>
    <P>I am aware that a Sea Pollution Bill is due to come before the House.  The refuse and rubbish coming in off ships onto our shores &mdash; if you walk any of the beaches you will see it &mdash; is becoming an increasing problem that has to be tackled. There is one other point I would like to put to the Minister and perhaps she could consider it.  Can anything be done about the problem where ships coming into our harbours and onto our shores are literally abandoned?  It would be remiss of me not to raise this issue.  We had the frightening experience for several weeks in Bantry with the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> which eventually ended up near Baltimore.  The pollution that emanated from that cost the local authority approximately £1 million to clean up.  The vessel was abandoned and it is now resting on a rich herring bed some miles off Baltimore.  That is just one example which caused a furore at the time.  We were unable to handle it.  The crew were rescued and the boat with engines running was left on the high seas. <Col N="985" /> It could have ended up anywhere if it had not hit that particular reef and would probably have ended up on the coastline of Waterford.  However, we ended up with that problem in Cork.</P>
    <P>In the inner harbour of Castletownbere there is a large ship which again was brought on to the coastline deliberately and, in my view, scuttled.  It is partly submerged between Bere Island and the mainland and at Castletownbere.  Again, this has been there for several years and efforts made to do something about it have failed.  Cstletownbere depends on fishing and the islanders coming and going from the mainland and the fishermen have a serious problem with this.</P>
    <P>Again one might argue where do you draw the line?  Is this the responsibility of the Department of the Marine or whatever? I consider it to be an environmental hazard that we must deal with.  If you go along the coastline into my neighbouring county of Kerry you have the famous <i>Ranga</i> which landed on the Dingle Head penninsula on a very scenic beach and the wreck is still there many years later.</P>
    <P>This is only the tip of the iceberg because it appears &mdash; and I may be wrong &mdash; that the shipping companies, if they run into difficulties and have a vessel like the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i>, which is basically a wreck, seem to be able to come into our shoreline and abandon these vessels with little or no redress.  As far as I am aware, in none of these instances, which have caused great local concern, has any compensation been provided from the insurance companies involved.  I think at the end of the day the Department of the Environment, certainly in relation to the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> episode, had to foot the bill.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, this may be moving slightly out of the realms of the Minister present, but I would like to ask her to look at these matters and possibly liaise with the Department of the Marine to see what, if anything, can be done.  In addition to those mentioned, there was a further episode last year when a vessel came into Bantry Bay, owned, luckily enough, by the Shell Oil Company.  A huge hole of 50 feet by 80 feet had opened <Col N="986" /> up in the vessel by accident; but, eventually, through liaison with the Departmnent of the Marine, the vessel was repaired and removed from Bantry Bay.  One must not forget that in stormy conditions that vessel was there for several months before it was actually repaired and taken out.  We feel that in any area &mdash; whether it is Cork, Kerry or Wexford &mdash; where there is an element of pollution by ships coming on the rocks that is a problem that must be tackled; but so far, in my view, successive Governments have failed in this regard.</P>
    <P>The whole concept in this Bill is not before time and I would whole-heartedly welcome the Bill.  One fear that I have is in relation to the appeals process.  This was touched on by Senator O'Keeffe. One worry the IDA have mentioned to me is that there are so many steps to be gone through when a company apply for planning permission.  Initially they apply to the local authority.  If you take the case of Merrill Dow, they had to go before an oral hearing.  Then there was a High Court action, etc.  There are many hurdles to overcome.  This legislation does not have the mechanism to deal with what I would call deliberate appeals and deliberate lobbies by small groups who sometimes do not have proper grounds for their objection.  Take the case of Merrill Dow, Sandoz or the reopening of the Whiddy Island terminal, a group of ten or 12 people by using the system can hold up for years the issue of planning permission. Maybe the problem lies with An Bord Pleanála.  I would complain bitterly about the long delays in An Bord Pleanála issuing decisions on appeals.  It is time to tackle this area.</P>
    <P>In relation to the issue of licences, an appeal could be made to the High Court if some individual or company was unhappy about air pollution, etc.  If that was the case I could envisage a situation where the local authority would grant planning permission and the integrated licence would be granted by the agency but it could subsequently be held up for several months on appeal.  At the moment you <Col N="987" /> can appeal a decision of the local authority by lodging £30.  Would it not be sensible to consider increasing that, at the discretion of the agency, to £5,000 or £10,000 to ensure that people with frivolous and unreal objections do not impede an industry from setting up in a particular area.  That is something that should be considered.  This Bill fails to address that problem.  Would the Minister like to comment on that?</P>
    <P>It is laudable that not only is the new agency involved in liaising with local authorities and advising Ministers and public authorities but it is also involved in setting down codes of practice and various guidelines for industry, etc.  This is very sensible.  Once the agency is in being, industrialists can go to it and a copy of the codes of practice that apply to similar type industries.  That is a sensible and prudent step rather than coming in and feeling their way by trial and error.</P>
    <P>I concur with the sentiments expressed by my Cork colleague, Senator O'Keeffe, that this agency should and could be set up in the Cork area.  In the environmental debate Cork seems to be the hot potato <i>vis-a-vis</i> industries.  We have the technology and expertise in the county and the agency could be properly operated from there.  As a public representative from the county I urge the Minister to consider this.  It is an appropriate location.  The facilities are there and it would be very welcome in the county should the Minister so decide.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and the Department for the comprehensive Bill before the House.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise a few issues on the matter.  The Bill is so extensive and covers such ground that a lot of work must have been put into its preparation. I am delighted that at the start of the nineties the Government saw fit to take a fresh look at the environment and brought several measures into being in relation to farm pollution, etc.  As this decade progresses, hopefully Ireland will improve in the relatively good clean environment we have and maintain the <i>status quo</i> as far as possible.  A German <Col N="988" /> tourist told me last year that in his country you cannot get any river where you can fish salmon or trout.  We had a problem in Cork and other counties where pollution by effluent caused serious problems for salmon beds in our rivers.  We must create an image abroad that Ireland is green, that our waters are clean and that we have a friendly environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and I apologise for the long delay.  We are not usually as late in starting business.</P>
      <P>The Minister deserves compliments for her single-mindedness in pursuing a certain number of very clear objectives in this Bill.  What she has produced is a Bill I welcome, notwithstanding some reservations, comments and criticisms.  I stopped counting the number of sections in which the Minister has to make regulations to bring various sections into force.  The legislative process on the Environmental Protection Agency and the issues connected with it will only begin when this legislation has gone through both Houses of the Oireachtas. There will be an enormous number of regulations and orders to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sincerely hope the Minister will be in a position to see that the same single-minded determination is applied to ensuring that the various welcome provisions of this legislation are implemented quickly.  If the agency is set up and properly resourced, it will be a good testimony to the Minister.  She will be able to claim it as her own creation to a considerable extent.  Hopefully, it will set us on the road not to a concept that I am not too happy with, which is the alleged balance between the environment and economic development, but on the road to the reconciliation of economic development and the environment which does not imply a trade-off of a deterioration in the environment in return for economic development but harmony.  Balance implies a trade-off and there is no need for a trade-off between the environment and economic development. There is need for economic <Col N="989" /> development to operate within the constraints under which this planet must operate.</P>
    <P>In political and practical terms what this country needs most, and what the city an county where I live need most, is winning and sustaining trust between industry and the local community.  There are some ironies about that question that I will return to but it is a fact that there is a profound level of distrust in many parts of the country about both the willingness and the ability of regulatory agencies to take a resolute stand on behalf of the environment.  There is a considerable belief that it is in the interests of industry, for instance, to take the short option, the unsafe option or the environmentally risky option, in the pursuit of higher profits.  One of the peculiar ironies of the developing environmental consciousness both in the United States and in mainland Europe has been a considerable underlining of the fact that this is not necessarily true.  Let me explain why.</P>
    <P>The ultimate target must be zero emissions based on zero waste.  That may well be a target that will take us a long time to achieve.  We must aim at zero emissions of substances which can cause any deterioration of the environment.  That is not an easy objective.  The irony of the experience of many companies who have been forced to meet higher and higher environmental standards is that it produces a requirement to have a very precise knowledge of what is happening in the process at every step of the way so that there can be a sustainable record of the inventory of the plant and of all of the emissions, not only those that go up the approved stack or through the approved incinerator but all the small leaks, drains etc.  In doing that it draws considerable attention to inadequacies in a process, to limitations of efficiencies of a process, to perhaps excessive use of energy-producing environmental hazards or problems that were not noticed.  This can often produce considerable improvements in productivity, not just motivated by the extra capital investment environmental protection requires but also <Col N="990" /> motivated by the fact that people have to understand and scrutinise their process in a way they did not before.  This is true both of environmental protection and in the related and inseparable area of health and safety of the workforce in the plant and the health and safety of those who live in the vicinity of the plant.</P>
    <P>The superficial cheap or smart option of cutting corners on environmental, safety or health issues in return for larger profits demonstrably and frequently produces quite the opposite effect.  As has been evidenced in Bhopal, Seveso and in other places, you can get away with these things for a while but the ultimate cost when either the community catch up with you through increasingly rigorous environmental protection or specific accidents land you with enormous bills and damages will be enormous.</P>
    <P>The other side of it is that in order to operate to the optimum level of health, safety and environmental concern you actually end up with a much better trained workforce, with a better motivated workforce and with a much more knowledgeable workforce.  It is an ironic fact that many of the less than ideally safe practices that were engaged in the tragedy which resulted in the <i>Betelgeuse</i> explosion could have been avoided if that particular place was part of a refinery or something like that because the level of technological know-how, workforce training and supervision would be considerably greater where you have an industry related to it which is run by people who are specialists in the area. That is the opinion of a friend of mine, since deceased, who was a technical adviser at the <i>Betelguese</i> inquiry.</P>
    <P>It is important to sort this out because many people end up balancing things that do not actually conflict.  The fact that some parts of the world have been polluted on some occasion does not necessarily mean that there has to be some acceptable level of damage in return for industrial growth.  It is possible to have growth without causing damage to the environment.  It is important to remember that trust in an issue like this is not just getting the public to believe the chemical <Col N="991" /> industry, Environmental Protection Agency or the local authority.  It also involves getting the chemical industry, the Environmental Protection Agency, the local authority or the Minister for the Environment to trust the public and disclose considerable information about emissions and risks and the assessment of the relative risks of various options.  They must trust the maturity and commonsense of the public to make proper judgments.  Trust is not a one-way process.</P>
    <P>The experience, as reported to me, of many people in the environmental movement in Cork county with their local authority was something less then total trust. It took the most welcome Cremer and Warner report on the environmental quality of Cork harbour to make available to the many groups concerned with the environment much of the monitoring data that Cork County Council had at their disposal and which they showed a considerable reluctance to make available. It is not the way to persuade people that you are on their side.  If it was not commercially confidential when Cremer and Warner did their study, it was not commercially confidential before they did their study.  Therefore, it is extremely important that we get beyond the stage of good intentions and on to the area of a very clear acceptance of the right of people to know everything unless there is a profoundly serious reason not to inform them.  Everything else must be on the table and must be available.</P>
    <P>That is the other side of the equation of trust.  That is the way to get people to accept that there is a risk involved in everything.  As somebody with whom I was discussing this matter said, if only people would realise it they are probably safer half-way up a platform in a large-scale chemical processing plant than they are at the top of the stairs in their own home in terms of the relative risk of something serious happening to them. The statistics are there.  Every young person in our universities who goes to work on a building site here or in Britain <Col N="992" /> will operate in the most hazardous environment for the three or four months of their lives.  They will probably be 15 times greater at risk from serious accident or death on a building site then they would be working in a large-scale chemical plant.  They would be considerably greater at risk driving their car to and from home to work than they would be working in a chemical plant.  That is not an opinion.  If you work out the number of serious accidents or fatalities that happen per 1,000 people over a lifespan of 40 years, then the chances of serious accident, injury or death are actually significantly less working in something that is regarded as high risk such as the chemical industry and significantly greater in an area that people regard as a bit messy and dirty and not liable to blow up in your face such as the building industry. The workforce in the building industry are far more at risk.  That is not just in this country; it is universal.  It has nothing to do with Irish work practices.  It is a fact that the construction industry is a good deal more dangerous.</P>
    <P>The second thing is to get people to acknowledge that there are acceptable risks that we all take for granted.  If I told people that they were driving around in their cars sitting on ten gallons of high explosive material they would be very frightened.  In truth, petrol is amongst the most hazardous substances in terms of its explosive limits, in terms of its flammability, which is clearly related to its explosiveness, and in terms of its toxicity. Nobody, who has anything to do with the petroleum refining industry would dream of siphoning petrol out of a car tank not because of anything to do with the morality of it but because they know from their own training how great a health risk it would be even ingesting the vapour or ingesting into their mouths temporarily a few drops of petrol.  People will do those things because certain things are taken for granted.</P>
    <P>Similarly, people who are worried about the storage of certain substances in a process or in a plant near them will not feel the least bit nervous if they are standing in the middle of O'Connell <Col N="993" /> Street in Dublin, or Patrick Street in Cork, and a large tanker from one of the bottle gas companies goes rumbling past at 30 miles per hour carrying, in an acceptable fashion, something that potentially has the explosive capacity of a fairly medium sized bomb.  We accept risks but the only way to get the public to accept the risks involved is to make sure that everything is on the table and to make it clear that you trust people.  If information is withheld, delayed, diluted or distorted in the interests of not letting the public know &mdash; we are long past the time when you can cod or fool people as they are now extraordinarily well informed about environmental issues &mdash; then we will have no hope of winning their trust and confidence.</P>
    <P>I am on record as saying that not only would I be happy with Sandoz.  However, I would be happy if every other chemical company in Cork county area had to meet the same standards.  Many of them do not.  Given those standards, I would be happy to have further developments of the chemical industry in the lower harbour. While I live a few miles from the centre, I am actually in a direct line with the prevailing wind of anything that might happen to be released in Ringaskiddy.  I am not that far from it and I would have reason to be wary of any significant risks. I am a sort of practising chemical engineer and, therefore, I have no great problem in principle with large or small scale chemical processes but I have a considerable problem with the way it has been done.</P>
    <P>An experience I had a couple of years ago with my own profession did not help my belief that the public had reason to be wary.  I was asked to write an article on the chemical industry and the environment in Cork for the journal of the Institute of Engineers of Ireland.  I wrote an article in which I said effectively what I have just said here, about the need to win public trust and perceptions.  It was decided not to publish it because it might offend too many members of the Institute of Engineers of Ireland.  The suggestion <Col N="994" /> that there was a problem about perceptions was regarded apparently as profoundly offensive to many collegues in my own profession.  If that is offensive we are a long way from winning the sort of trust that we need.</P>
    <P>The other area that is important in the winning of trust is that decision-making must, to the greatest possible extent be transparent.  I know this has been said over and over again.  It is one of the areas of the Bill about which we should have a serious discussion.  If one goes through it with care the actual number of rights that the public have to information are not nearly as extensive as the aspirations. There are certain rights but much of what is in this Bill has more to do with enabling the Minister or the agency to the extent that he or it wishes to publish information. On the other hand, there is a categorical right on the part of the agency to determine what is confidential and a categorical and explicit insistence that anything that is determined by the agency on its own criteria to be confidential must be kept confidential.  I am unhappy with the balance of rights in both directions. It is important that any agency dealing with the environment must be seen to be independent and must be well resourced.</P>
    <P>I have had a number of complaints from people in areas to do with the industry that nobody is quite clear yet about what the agency's budget is.  Seven or eight million pounds is the figure mentioned in the press.  There are a myriad of provisions for the Minister to transfer functions to the EPA, such as inquiring into major pollution disasters.  Such inquiries can be expensive.  They have power to force people to give evidence, which is expensive.  One would not have much change out of £1 million after some of these inquiries.</P>
    <P>The public at large must believe that they know everything about what is going on and what a process is doing.  Secondly, they have to know the risks involved.  We must accept that there is a risk involved in doing anything.  Whether one stays in bed or gets up, there is some sort of risk. There is a risk involved in everything and the risks involved in industrialisation are <Col N="995" /> no more significant than many of the others.</P>
    <P>The agency must be transparent and independent.  The Minister has done a very good job in ensuring that this agency will be independent and of course it has to be well resourced.</P>
    <P>At this stage, having declared my profession, I better declare an interest.  I have a considerable interest in the chemical industry.  My main profession is involved in the education of chemical engineers to work in the chemical industry. Therefore, in the spirit of this legislation I declare my interest.  It is important in terms of public perception and winning public trust to put things in perspective.  I will refer to some statistics from the Department of the Marine quoted by Niall Buckley at a conference in Jury's in Cork on 23 January last organised by the FICI on the chemical industry's views on this legislation.  He identified sources of fish kills.  While fish kills may not in the long term be the most insidious form of pollution they are the most obvious and spectacular and the one that has had a considerable part to play in educating and alerting the public to the concerns of the environment.  Forty seven per cent of fish kills, according to the Department of the Marine, are related to agriculture, soil enrichment and water enrichment; 20 per cent are related to local authority treatment of sewage, water and other civil works; 18 per cent are attributed to what are called &ldquo;other causes&rdquo;.  I would be interested to know what they are.  It may well be fly tipping. Fifteen per cent is attributed to industry in general.  I would love to know what proportion is attributed to the chemical industry which for many people is the number one target in the area if environmental concern.  I put those figures on the record not to claim anybody is better than anybody else but to remind ourselves of where our problems lie.</P>
    <P>I am not exactly one who could be identified as being a champion of multinationals but there is a view that it is the multinationals among our industries who have caused the greatest problems. <Col N="996" /> Newspaper accounts in recent years of the antics at a certain plant of Kerry Coop when local authority inspectors were endeavouring to look at what was being discharged into a prime fishing river; sounded like a cops and robbers operation. Two officers had to attend at the same time.  One was at the gate and the other had to sneak around the back to observe what was being done beside the river while his companion got in to inspect the effluent tanks.  It was horrific and it was not a multinational that was involved.  It was an indigenous company run by a person who would be identified by many as the model of an Irish entrepreneur.</P>
    <P>They contested a number of licences all the way to the Supreme Court.  It was not a very inspiring sight to see an indigenous industry do those things on at least two or three occasions which was sufficient to suggest that they were not accidental oversights, or accidental mistakes of individuals, but were more likely organised, planned and deliberate.  That is not the way to win trust.  The public, in terms of their own comprehension of the environment, would want to direct their eyes a good way beyond to include a good deal more than the obvious targets. There is the slight view that the food industry is almost, by definition, environmentally friendly and the chemical industry is almost, by definition, the opposite.</P>
    <P>Dairy waste is amongst the most lethal in terms of the destruction of the quality of water from substances that can be dumped into a river.  It is not toxic but in terms of its capacity to destroy the life environment of river water there are few things worse.  We would want to keep our eyes on the whole of the play.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it would not be correct of me not to make a few references to a broader perspective.  We have in the western world deceived ourselves for many years that economic growth is something that can go on forever.  Most of what is being done, even in the most advanced countries, in terms of environmental protection, is still based on the assumption of growth forever.</P>
    <P>There was a conference in Cork, at <Col N="997" /> which the Minister's Department was represented, run by the Institution of Chemical Engineers and the FICI on the effect of the chemical industry on the environment.  The first paper was read by Dr. John Cox, a chartered engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Chemcial Engineers and well known as an international counsultant in the environment area. Dr. Cox made the point that the United States, with 2 per cent of the world's population, consumes 25 per cent of its oil.  I am tempted to extrapolate from that certain other things that are going on around the world and the motivations for them, but I will restrain myself.</P>
    <P>Dr. Cox a profesional mathematician said:</P>
    <P>As a mathematical exercise I have calculated how much oil, gas, uranium, iron, copper and lead would be available if the entire world enjoyed the standard of living of the US in 1970.</P>
    <P>That is not the standard the United States enjoys today.</P>
    <P>The sobering result emerged that apart from coal and iron, which would have an eight to ten years lifetime, the average period before resource depletion of oil, gas, uranium, copper and lead would be two years.</P>
    <P>If the world consumed oil at the rate that the United States consumes oil at present, the level of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere would increase tenfold.  If the hungry world were to reach the standard of consumption &mdash; I do not say the standard of living, because I think it is a very ambiguous term &mdash; of the United States &mdash; I am just picking the United States because it is the greatest consumer of resources in the world &mdash; we would have two years of most of the world's fundamental resources left to us.</P>
    <P>That is something the world should address in terms of environmental concerns because that Gadarine swine-type of pace of consumption of world resources is impossible to sustain.  It will produce environmental disaster in its wake.  It is extremely important that we <Col N="998" /> should not just confine ourselves to the belief that ending emissions, however welcome that will be, will deal with underlying problems of what we are doing to this planet, and to the balance-of life and of the eco-system.</P>
    <P>When we are looking at the issue of resources and the issue of the depletion and destruction of the environment, we ought to remind ourselves that it does not begin and end with science.  The whole way in which economists have looked at the world &mdash; economists of both the left and right, if the left exists anymore, as a system of economics &mdash; with their attention to growth, have under-valued the world and its resources.  I read an interesting article which pointed out that all over eastern Europe particularly, because it is the most extreme, but to a considerable extent in parts of Britain, Germany and the United States, economic growth continued from the forties to the sixties, and even in the 19th century, with appalling cost to the environment. However, that was still seen as a growth in gross national product and as an apparent measure of improvement in human wellbeing even though the whole environmental condition of the people who live in that area was being devastated. Having got away with it once we then proceed to build industries and a whole system to clean up that mess and we call that further economic growth whereas in fact all we have done is damaged the world's environment and now we have to spend a lot of money to get back to where we were before we did the damage.</P>
    <P>The whole economic model is inadequate because economists regard everything outside the individual producer and consumer of goods as being a limitless resource which can never die.  They never assume, for instance, the natural resources are limited.  There is no such thing in traditional economics as the social cost of any activity.  There is no such thing as the social cost of destroying the quality of the air in an area, or of the social cost.</P>
    <P>Exercises have been carried out.  The European Community has published a <Col N="999" /> very interesting study on the social cost of different forms of energy usage.  If you introduce even the most conservative, least favourable estimates of the cost of the social benefits of renewable energy &mdash; solar energy, wind energy and various things like that and add in the social benefits in terms of the reduction in emissions, in the reduction of risk from nuclear power stations, you discover that if your economics are done according to those criteria they are actually more economical than traditional methods of energy transformation.</P>
    <P>That means that the whole basis for the assessment of economic wellbeing, as a measure of social wellbeing, is flawed because the economists have always failed to introduce the collective conception of the environment.  However unfashionable collectivism in general may be, the one thing that must be said over and over again about the environment is that it is a collective problem that cannot be solved by individual enterprise or individuals.  It has to be solved by states and communities and, ultimately, the whole world, acting together.</P>
    <P>On the same related issue it would be incorrect to leave the question of growth and economics without a reference to the greenhouse effect.  Not because I want to talk at length about it but because many of the remedies that would be implicit in a Bill like this are not actually remedies to end emissions but simply to change emissions.  Incinerators, for instance, do not end emissions.  They simply convert toxic subtances into carbon dioxide and water.  The trouble is that carbon dioxide and water are two of the greenhouse gases.  It is not a solution to environmental problems to convert substances which are environmentally unfriendly in one way into other substances which are environmentally friendly in another way only you put it on the longer finger.</P>
    <P>There has to be a longer term strategy to stabilise the quality of the earth's atmosphere because of the fact that the greenhouse effect could ultimately have a more serious effect on the way life on this earth develops than the occasional <Col N="1000" /> emission of something highly toxic and life-threatening.  Therefore, we cannot deal with the problems of emissions simply by changing the emissions.  The only change must be into something that is harmless and there is very little that is harmless because the environment is an extremely delicate balance and any imbalance can produce all sorts of down's stream consequences which can do enormous damage, and will do enormous damage as we know at this stage.</P>
    <P>It is worth reminding ourselves also that the gradual gobal warming will produce a knock-on effect which will make its own consequences worse.  The gradual rise in world temperatures which that will produce may well release large quantities of methane from the permafrost of both the northern and southern hemispheres, the colder regions as they begin to warm.  The trouble with methance is that it is vastly more a contributor, proportionately, to global warming than carbon dioxide.  Therefore, you are into a sequence which will actually be what people would call a forward feed mechanism, that the gradual release of more carbon dioxide will produce more releases of methane, which will make the problem worse and worse.  We have to stop it.  It cannot go on.  Therefore, solutions which are not based on ending emissions or stabilising the global environment are not solutions.</P>
    <P>They are simply alternative ways of doing the same thing but making it happen over a longer period of time.</P>
    <P>Coming back to our own national problems, I have to remind the Minister of a letter published in the <i>Irish Times</i> in 1985. When we had a debate in this House in February 1988 on the Water Pollution Bill, the Minister very proudly told us that in the local authorites there were 62 engineers, 70 technicians and 15 chemists responsible for environmental protection. At the time I came across a letter and it is worth repeating to this Minister because she might have something to say about it.  The Chief Executive of the Central Fisheries Board wrote this letter and he said that over the five years from 1980 to 1985 his ten pollution officers <Col N="1001" /> investigated between 5,000 and 6,000 incidents annually and prosecuted about 70 people per annum.  At the same time, the combined activities of local autorities in the same period amounted to 2,000 investigations per annum with about 30 prosecutions per annum.  It seems to me that ten pollution officers by the Central fisheries were, on the face of it, enormously more efficient than a total of 140, officials of the local authorities.  Perhaps the Minister could find out whether they were all actually involved in environmental protection or what were they doing.</P>
    <P>Before looking at aspects of the Bill and some of its limitations, I understand the Minister intends to bring in a Bill to deal with waste disposal.  The American Environmental Protection Agency legislation has been amended and among the amendments is a provision that one of the objections of the Environmental Protection Agency must be the minimisation of waste.  This is an extremely important topic; it is part of what I said, it is part of realising that waste is not something that we can simply convert from one form to another.</P>
    <P>If I can quote again from Dr. John Cox, he listed a series of statements about waste, the first being that elimination is better than control.  I do not mean elimination of emissions, I mean eliminating waste, eliminating anything so that you do not have to deal with the emissions, you get rid of it at source rather than control it once it is there.  He said a number of things that are perhaps worth putting on the record, even if some of them might be contentious.  The first is that waste disposal companies encourage waste.  Therefore, the whole question of whether waste disposal companies should exist is a matter of considerable contention.</P>
    <P>The second point was that national consent limits will not work.  We need international limits which will be imposed everywhere, otherwise we will have a flight of those industries that are not prepared and that are foolish enough not to accept decent standards in places where national limits are lower.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1002" /> The third point was that trade in waste is a bad thing, that if waste becomes a marketable commodity there will be a further incentive to produce waste whereas, in fact, the objective should be to minimise the production of waste.  The fourth point is one that is extremely important.  Dilution does not reduce pollution. Dilution changes it but it does not reduce it.  Dilution is a deception, in my view.  Simply looking at concentrations on their own is not a sufficient response to pollution.</P>
    <P>Finally, we should remember that conversion does not reduce pollution.  Let us remember what happens.  On the average plant, if there is an offensive gaseous emission they will scrub it out so you will turn it from a gaseous emission into a liquid emission.  What do you do with the liquid emission?  You will have to do something else with that.  You might as well incinerate it and what will you do when you incinerate it?  You produce another gaseous emission which may be less immediately toxic or less immediately environmentally unfriendly but is nevertheless an additional form of waste which in the long term will produce and have an impact on the quality of the environment.  The whole area of waste needs further revision.  When I first read the Bill I thought this was missing but I was informed that there could be a reason for that to do with future legislation.  I hope we have legislation to deal with the whole area of waste that it will be based on the recognised need to minimise waste, not the idea of controlling it, regulating it, or organising it.  The fundamental requirement must be zero waste producing zero effluent.</P>
    <P>The 20 per cent of fish kills are attributable to local authorities, sewage, water and other civil works.  It is a great pity that section 60 (2) (c) of the Bill effectively means that if local authorities do not have the resoruces to meet prescribed standards the Environmental Protection Agency can tut-tut as much as it likes but it cannot make them do anything.  It is not the way to convince other areas of activity, particularly in <Col N="1003" /> industry, and agriculture, where considerable impositions will be needed if we are to preserve the quality of many of our rivers and streams, that they must do things because they must do them but the local authority will only have to do them if they have the money.  That suggests one law for local authorities and another law for other people.  That is not to blame the local authorities.  As a community &mdash; successive Government will have to do this &mdash; there will have to be resources provided.</P>
    <P>If a local authority are to be given the job with stringent new laws and with an Environmental Protection Agency which will expect them to enforce fairly stringent regulations, if on the one hand they will be measuring the quality of effluent from many activities in their area and telling people this is at an unacceptable level while, at the same time, 100 yards away they are discharging material into the same waterway and are exempt from any pressure from the Environmental Protection Agency because they do not have the money to do anything about it, they will not have much credibility in the eyes of the industry.</P>
    <P>That kind of uneven standard is the sort of thing that is liable to persuade many multinationals to find somewhere else to operate than in a country which has two sets of standards for the environment, one for local authorities and another for industry.  They will feel they are being had.  It seems to me that subsection will have to be strengthened in terms of a timescale and a commitment beyond which that section will lapse.  If you want to give it five years or 10 years until the programme on the environment that the Minister announced a couple of years ago is implemented, then let us have that and say that in ten years' time that subsection will lapse.  To leave it open-ended forever is, in my view, to invite very invidious comparisons between the law for local authorities and the law for everybody else.</P>
    <P>Another area that deserves considerable concern is the need to integrate the planning process and the issuing of <Col N="1004" /> integrated pollution licences by the Environmental Protection Agency.  It would be a travesty of what I believe to be the Minister's intention if the EPA simply became a body that fed in information to the planning process, then the planning process made decisions and then people could appeal the standards set and the criteria set by the EPA to An Bord Pleanála because that would still leave An Bord Pleanála as the final Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála are neither transparent nor particularly credible.  By this, I mean that An Bord Pleanála have no particular obligation to make public the basis on which an inspector comes to a conclusion at a public hearing.  Neither do they have any obligation to make public the reasons they do not accept the recommendation of an inspector.  It would be a great pity if ultimately the final decisions about areas of environmental protection were, by default or by lack of precision in legislation, left with An Bord Pleanála because one of the major objectives of this legislation would be lost which is to have an independent agency, transparent in its operation, properly resourced and able to take action to preserve the environment.  It seems to me there is a case for considerably greater precision on that in the legislation.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, I am still unhappy about the open-ended nature of this legislation in terms of what the Minister can say to the agency about extra responsibilities and can delegate extra responsibilities in a large range of areas to the EPA without some sort of consequential or linked guarantee of funding.  It seems to me to be a recipe for a hopelessly under-resourced agency, over-burdened with work, and whenever we have a minor or a major disaster and there is a public outcry the Minister will say, &ldquo;I am getting the EPA to look at that&rdquo; and extend it yet further.  If this agency do not have the resources to act quickly, efficiently and with all the expertise they need, they will lose credibility quickly and we will be worse off.  If you set up an EPA and they do not work <Col N="1005" /> you cannot just start a second time.  You will have lost the public argument about credibility.</P>
    <P>Finally, a couple of specific points on the Bill.  I did not intend to go on quite so long and I apologise to the Minister for that, there is an enormous amount to be said.  I do not want to anticipate Committee Stage but there may be a few areas where the Minister could answer a few questions.  Section 5 deals with the best available technology not entailing excessive costs.  The definition of the best available technology etc. is construed as meaning the provision and proper maintenance, use, operation and supervision of facilities which, having regard to all the circumstances, are the most suitable for the purpose.  We can do better than that.  There must be something to do with scientific data and scientific information and the best available scientific information and there must be something to do with the environmental need of the time.  In section 5 I am not happy with what looks to me like an excessively generous commitment to sensitivity about aged facilities, nor do I think it is right to refer to the best available technology and then in a subsection to talk about the costs which would be incurred. If the beef industry is having a bad year and a large number of plants are not up to scratch, can they postpone their investment in proper environmental protection equipment?  I do not think we should.  I do not think that does any good. To be consistent as a liberal on prison issues, I am not happy about anybody being landed in jail for ten years for an offence to do with the environmental pollution. I am quite happy with large cash penalties but ten years in jail seems to me to be a little disproportionate.</P>
    <P>I do not want to drag out my contribution to the next sitting day but there are just a couple of areas I am unhappy about.  I am unhappy about the whole area of disclosure of information because of the question of transparency.  The agency can publish a lot of things but they do not have to publish very much.  They may for instance, cause a report of an inquiry to be published but they do not <Col N="1006" /> have to cause a report to be published. On the other hand, they have the absolute right to define what is confidential information.  That, of course leaves them in a position where they are not actually accountable.  The only information that should be confidential is information for which there is an overwhelming reason to ensure confidentiality and that is usually commercial.</P>
    <P>I will remind the Minister &mdash; I am sure she is aware of it &mdash; of Toxnet in the United States.  It is a data base, accessible to anybody with ordinary personal computer and it has in its data base about 20,000 chemicals, all of the emissions of most of the chemical industry in the United States.  Of those 20,000 substances, only 30 have presented problems for the industry in terms of actual genuine commercial sensitivity.  We need similar criteria here.  Let them argue and convince the agency that certain data is commercially sensitive but beyond that let everything be transparent.  In particular, let recommendations by the agency to the Minister about standards be published.  If the Minister wants to disagree and not implement them, let them be published.  Let recommendations on codes of practice be published, let recommendations on criteria for various areas at activity be guaranteed to be published.</P>
    <P>Section 107, which enables the Minister to make environmental data available does not make the Minister make it available.  It is enabling legislation.  It should be a right of the public to know. All over the area of availability of information is the enabling rather than the compelling, whereas on the question of confidentiality it is a fact that confidential information must not be disclosed.</P>
    <P>On the question of the advisory committee, it is a bit peculiar to invite representatives of environmentally concerned groups to act on an advisory committee and not be able to report on their activities in areas that the agency will define to their own members.  That is a guarantee to make people quite rapidly <Col N="1007" /> have the feeling from within the membership of their organisation that they are not really representing them anymore.</P>
    <P>The whole area of confidentiality will need to be looked into.  The world is full of Acts dealing with freedom of information. There is no difficulty in drafting legislation which protects confidential information where there is a legitimate interest and guarantees public access. The United States has comprehensive freedom of information legislation which is still capable of defending both the national security of that country and the commercial interest of various bodies. Yet, we had the ridiculous situation in this country where information was sought on defence-related issues which Eolas had and Eolas would not supply because they said it was confidential. Some of these organisations then contacted similar organisations in the United States and had no problem getting the details through the American Freedom of Information Act where Eolas were establishing standards for the Defence Department.  They got it from the United States under American Freedom of Information legislation.</P>
    <P>In many of these areas, because of the existence of firms like Toxnet in the United States, much of what some people would have you believe is commercially confidential is available from them in the United States.  You are actually writing legislation to keep confidential things that, increasingly, as the world becomes a smaller place and as processes become similar are replicated in a number of different political units.  Confidentiality, unless it is based on sound criteria, will be meaningless.  Therefore, this legislation badly needs an emphasis on the right of people to access to information and on the right of people to have serious commercial information kept confidential and not leaked by some backdoor method.  The more you distinguish between what is rightly and properly confidential and what is rightly and properly in the public domain, the more likely it will be that you will be able to enforce this legislation.  It would be useful if the <Col N="1008" /> Minister addressed the question of the integration and not just the integrated pollution licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on Senator Fitzgerald to move the motion.  He has 30 minutes.  I welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá fáilte romhat, a Aire, sa Seanad.</P>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, noting with concern the increasing threats to the natural environment posed by chemicals and poisonous compounds used in agriculture, and while welcoming the scheme of grants to assist farmers in carrying out pollution control work, calls on the Minister for Agriculture and Food to introduce more stringent regulations to control the use of pesticides and to ban the use of strychinine to ensure human safety and the protection of wildlife.</P>
      <P>In moving this motion I am calling for stricter controls on pesticides and poisonous chemicals.  I am also calling for a ban on strychnine and other highly toxic poisons.  In doing so, I am taking into consideration the implications such restrictions, if implemented, would have on the people who use those chemicals and poisons and the alternatives that could be introduced.  We must also consider the devastating effect the use &mdash; and often misuse &mdash; those agents have an our environment.  In this respect I am particularly concerned about the effect those chemicals have on our mammals and the bird population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that Ireland is to the forefront in environmental protection, despite criticism from time to time, especially if there is a fish kill in our <Col N="1009" /> rivers.  In most cases fish kills are purely accidental or occur through carelessness or complete ignorance.  If and when this happens, due to good legislation introduced by the Government in recent years, the culprit or culprits in most cases are brought to justice and compensation for the damage caused to rivers or lakes awarded.</P>
    <P>A friend of mine who visited a chemical plant in Cork recently was very impressed at the regulations which had to be implemented under our planning laws, at a cost of £14 million to the chemical plant, before they were allowed to operate.  It is, therefore, impossible for me to understand why strychnine and other chemicals are being used widely by landowners and gun clubs throughout Ireland without the same stringent regulations.  Strychnine is a toxic ingredient of curare and even primitive Indians for centuries were aware of its qualities.</P>
    <P>I am very happy with recent regulations and legislation which have been introduced by Government Departments to protect our environment and especially with the Environmental Protection Agency Bill which is going through the Seanad.  I welcome the strict planning regulations which are in force in relation to chemical and other industrial development and I also welcome the recent budget announcement to increase funding to help in the elimination of farmyard pollution.  The motion I have proposed will be a further step in the protection of an environment which is the envy of industrialised Europe.</P>
    <P>Strychnine has been primarily marketed as a rodenticide.  It has been used against a wide variety of wild mammals and birds.  It is now no longer considered successful as a rodenticide because of bait shyness in rats.  A number of authors on pest control have stated that strychnine can no longer be justified as a pesticide because of its high toxicity and the existence of more effective alternatives. Strychnine is an extremely persistent compound and baits are toxic over an extended period.  It is significant that no reputable pest control company use or recommend the use of strychnine in <Col N="1010" /> Ireland, according to my information.  It is considered that the poison is too hazardous to operators and to the general public.</P>
    <P>Apart from the human risk, the impact of strychnine on populations of endangered birds of prey and other non-target wildlife species, is one of the major reasons for governments throughout the world cancelling, or placing restrictions on, its use.  In many, but not all cases, birds of prey were not the target species but nevertheless their numbers were decimated by secondary poisoning.  The main targets for those poisons are foxes, mink, hooded crows and domestic dogs. The problem for the sheep farmer of foxes, hooded crows and domestic dogs has been with us for a century and strychnine has been used to deal with the problem for the same length of time.  If strychnine was the answer to the problem it should have been solved by now.  In my opinion it will never solve the predator problem but because of its use, and in some cases its misuse, several species of bird in Ireland are now extinct.</P>
    <P>Conservationists recognise the need to protect livestock from predators but the main concern is that poison can kill non-target species such as protected mammals, protected birds of prey and wildlife generally.  The protected species most threatened by poison are the pine marten, Ireland's rarest mammal, stoats, buzzards, henharriers and eagles.  Per-egrine falcons, kestrels, merlins and owls are less at risk.  However, bam owls are known to have been killed by agricultural fungicides and rat poison.</P>
    <P>The population of red foxes and grey crows has not decreased in recent years. They remain the two greatest predators affecting our sheep farmers.  The use of poisoning against those predators has increased.  In a survey conducted in the Dingle peninsula in 1988 by David Hickie for the Irish Wildlife Conservancy, Garda figures show that 58 certificates for strychnine were issued in 1983 and 194 certificates were issued in 1987.  This has caused me to form the opinion that the economic threat posed by those predators is not met by the present methods and, <Col N="1011" /> on closer examination, that the supply and use of various poisons and chemicals are in fact not effective, are dangerous and cause a threat to the user, his family and stock.  Further, they are unspecific in their targeting, thereby causing devastating effects on mammals and bird life, thus changing the ecology of the countryside.</P>
    <P>The dangers of secondary poisoning and water pollution must also be considered. The substances most widely used are strychnine, alphachloralose, fluoroacetamide, nevinphos and endorin.  The latter two, nevinphos and endorin, are not yet used here but they have been used extensively, and illegally, in Great Britain.  I would like the same measures to be taken against them as is taken against strychnine and other poisons to safeguard us for the future.  One of the agencies controlling and monitoring poisons here is the pesticide control unit of the Department of Agriculture, who have responsibility for the clearance and registration of pesticides within the State. They act under European legislation &mdash; EC Directive 78/631 &mdash; the Poisons Regulations, 1982 and our Poisons Act, 1961, amended in 1983, 1984 and 1986.  The public health section of the Department of Health are responsible for issuing strychnine certificates to Garda stations and are responsible for public health consideration. The Garda Síochána issue certificates to landowners for the purchase of strychnine.  The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland supply strychnine on the presentation of a Garda certificate. The Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works are responsible for implementing the Wildlife Act, 1976.  The IFA, ACOT and the National Association of Regional Games Councils act in an advisory capacity and do not recommend the use of strychnine.  The IFA and ACOT, for example, see the use of strychnine as old fashioned and dangerous and recommend the use of alternative methods of predator control and the use of better husbandry.</P>
    <P>The supply and use of these substances <Col N="1012" /> are controlled at present under the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act, 1965, the European Communities Wildlife Act, 1976, the Poisons Regulations 1982, S.I. No. 188 of 1982 and the Control of Dogs Act, 1986.  This is the legislation that covers poison and the different aspects.  In combination this legislation is lacking because it allows landowners to buy strychine provided a signed Garda certificate is produced within two weeks of the date of issue, whereupon he or she is entitled to purchase one gramme of strychine.  There is no limit under our legislation on the amount any landowner can buy annually.  He can keep coming back week after week, month after month and can renew a certificate and buy as much more as he likes.</P>
    <P>Carcases of dead animals may remain above ground providing they are used as poison bait.  This is a total and absolute contradiction and should never have been part of any legislation governing strychnine or any other poison.  In fact, the reverse should have been the case in so far as anybody carrying out this practice should be prosecuted.  In this day and age the legislation legalising such an action should be amended immediately, without further debate.  It is amazing that under the Diseases of Animals Act, if an animal is dead in a field a farmer has to remove it and bury it; yet, he can say to the council official or the Garda who come out: &ldquo;Hold on, I am going to put poison in that animal&rdquo;.  He is then legalising the action.  This is absolutely crazy in this little island which is so well protected environmentally.  It is something that should be tackled immediately no matter what the cost and whoever introduced this should be taken to task now</P>
    <P>The legal provision governing the use of strychnine do not apply to the use of alphachloralose.  This substance, although not as toxic as strychnine, has been found to be just as dangerous to non-target species.  As I have said already, nevinphos and endorin, to the best of my knowledge, are not available here.  They were widely and illegally used in England and caused devastating effects.  Therefore, I would not like to see <Col N="1013" /> them being introduced on the market here.  As far as I can ascertain, the restrictions that apply to strychnine and aplhachloralose appears not to apply to nevinphos and endorin even though both chemicals ar acutely toxic to wildlife.</P>
    <P>The legislation governing the supply and use of those substances in Ireland is at variance with most other states where strychnine and fluoroacetamide are either totally banned or severely restricted. In countries as far apart as the USA, New Zealand and Iceland they are banned, while in the UK the use of strychnine is limited to the controlled extermination of moles.  Even Romania banned the use of strychnine in 1968.  In 1973 the World Health Organisation's report stated that strychnine, fluor-acetate and fluoroacetamide poisons should only be used, or allowed to be used, by pest control operators and restricted to areas in which access to humans or useful animals is completely restricted.  The FAO a UN body, do not use strychnine in their projects in developing countries and suggest the use of more selective and less toxic means of pest control.</P>
    <P>Strychnine imports here in 1988 were 40 times more than in Northern Ireland. The quantities recorded were 22 kilos and 0.5 kilos respectively.  There is no evidence that the laying of poison bait controls the number of predators in a locality.  The numbers of foxes and hooded crows appear to be unaffected. Indeed their numbers are reported by farmers and other rural people to be on the increase.  Again, a survey carried out among sheep farmers in the Dingle peninsula in 1988 showed that farmers who used poisons claimed marginally higher lamb losses than neighbouring farmers who rejected the use of poisons.  The report stated that the average sheep farmer in the Dingle peninsula &mdash; I have to come back to this, as this is the only evidence I have &mdash; had approximately 100 ewes per flock.  In 1990-911 am told by reliable sources that a flock of 100 ewes produce, on average, 150 lambs. This year, for some reason or another, many sheep had twins and triplets. <Col N="1014" /> Taking losses into account there were still an average of 150 lambs from 100 ewes. The farmer gets roughly £17.50 EC payment for a lamb.  Even though lamb numbers were down this year, the price still ranged between £15 and £25 in my-part of the country for a lamb.  The sheep farmers claim they have a total mortality rate of about 14 per cent.  They blame half of that on the predators; 7 per cent for foxes and grey crows.  I have an alternative for those farmers.  In my calculations each of those farmers &mdash; average flock owners &mdash; are losing £500 a year to predators and the use of strychnine has not solved that problem for them.  They are still losing year after year after year.</P>
    <P>If there was a once-off investment of, say, £500 to £1,000 for a proper paddock, where they could drive their sheep in the lambing season, it would solve the problem once and for all.  If I was a flock owner I would not hesitate to put a six foot high wire around a four, five or six acre field.  Not alone would I do that to keep the foxes out, but I would floodlight it as well, with the kind of money that is being made on sheep and lambs at the moment.  This is the alternative.</P>
    <P>I know that old habits die hard but I remember back in 1970 when it was nearly impossible to get farmers to change their mind about marking sheep. They would use only tar.  Tar would have to be used because the red mine would wash off.  We got them out of that simply because of the value of their fleece &mdash; their neighbours were getting a better price for wool.  Following that committees were set up in most councils to deal with the problem of sheep scab and to try to convince farmers to dip their sheep twice a year.  It took 15 years to convince them that it was good husbandry and that they would get better value for their produce if they dipped their sheep twice a year.  At that time half the sheep population in the country were scabridden and we had veterinary officers from county councils trying to get rid of the problem.  Now, thankfully, after 15 years, that problem is gone.  Instead of trying to make farmers come in and dip <Col N="1015" /> their sheep, almost every farmer has his own little sheep dipping tank.</P>
    <P>In the very same way a majority of farmers would not touch strychnine.  It would only require a little effort by the powers that be &mdash; ACOT and the Department of Agriculture and Food &mdash; to once and for all get rid of strychnine and educate the farmers in what they should do to have better produce and better husbandry. Strychnine is not the answer.  It is quite obvious that strychnine has not got rid of foxes as we are told they are on the increase.</P>
    <P>Hooded crows can be shot.  There is no problem in relation to this as most farmers have shotguns.  There are crow traps and they are being used effectively by sheep farmers here.  They are being used effectively in different places.  Crow traps have proved to be highly effective in capturing large numbers of birds if they are used properly.  The construction is that of a large cube-shaped frame covered with fine wire mesh.  The upper surface is V-shaped with an entrance in the bottom of the V.  Birds which are attracted by the bait placed in the trap can drop down into the entrance and are hindered from escaping upwards because of their own wing span.  The advantage of this method is that it is selective.  Hooded crows and magpies can be humanely disposed of but any non-target species found must be released unharmed under the Wildlife Act, 1976.  If those traps are used they will not only be far more selective, but more efficient than poison.</P>
    <P>We are one of the few countries in the world today to use strychnine in the manner we are using it.  I will accept nothing short of totally banning strychnine and alphachloralose and I also want to include nevinphos and endorin in whatever legislation is introduced for the banning of poison.</P>
    <P>I have a very striking example of the effect of indiscriminate poisoning.  I will quote from a letter which I got from the Chairman of the Irish section of the International Council for Bird Preservation and I particularly picked out this part of his comments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1016" /> A very striking example of the effect of an indiscriminate poisoning which in the Irish context almost always implies strychnine, is given by the Common Buzzard.  This is a large, hawk-like bird which subsists almost completely on carrion, i.e., animals which have died naturally, remains of kills by other predators, and man-generated waste material.  It is thus particularly susceptible to the effects of strychnine, with the result that it only occurs in Northern Ireland despite there being abundant suitable habitat and food supply in the Republic.  The birds visit every year as vagrants and would undoubtedly recolonise the country if they survive long enough, but are almost always poisoned soon after arrival.</P>
    <P>That, again, points to the fact that the Six Counties of Ireland which are the same as the other Twenty-six Counties must be using strychnine to a lesser degree or none at all.  He also said:</P>
    <P>A further objection to strychnine is its extreme inhumanity, in that its victims die slowly and in great pain.  It is also extremely persistent, and poisoned bait remains fatally active for many months even in outdoor conditions. It is for this reason that the current regulations regarding its use were introduced, but these, as you must know, are quite ineffective...</P>
    <P>The whole problem of pesticides is quite complex, but reduces, in essence, to substances which directly effects birds, such as the well documented DDT disaster, its effects lasted for three years and those which have a secondary effect by depriving them of their food supply, e.g. by killing the insects on which they prey.  You may be interested to know that it has been shown that birds are by far the most effective way of reducing populations of insect pests &mdash; a blue tit feeding its young has to capture 2,500 insects each day, so they do a very good job.</P>
    <P>A farmer in particular has to depend on wildlife.  We will wipe out wildlife with <Col N="1017" /> this indiscriminate poisoning and I have outlined the problems here.  It is ridiculous to leave a carcase in a field until its bones are bleached white &mdash; the law does not specify whether it is a lamb, sheep, horse or a cow.  Perhaps the brucellosis we are trying to ged rid of is in some way tied up with all these carcases, lying around and with all this indiscriminate poisoning.</P>
    <P>I again call for the complete and total ban of strychnine.  I have not had the time to go into all the other weedkillers and pesticides but I am sure that some of the other speakers on the Opposition side of the House and, indeed, on this side, will take up the cause for a stricter control on these.  We have a great environment in Ireland and it is a pity that strychnine should be the one chemical at the centre of the discussion.  We have been doing so much in recent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me first of all say that I am very pleased to support this motion.  I may have one reservation and that is that I am not quite sure what the word &ldquo;control&rdquo; means in relation to chemicals.  Senator Fitzgerald of course concentrated on the ban part of it.  I have to say that I agree with him.  I think strychnine is a particularly cruel and unselective method of controlling vermin.  In the past, farmers usually used it to control the harassment of sheep by dogs.  In that respect it was non-selective and many a good dog was killed in a cruel fashion.  I would suggest a better method. I think every dog should be tatooed and details of the tatoo and the name of the owner should be lodged with the police. In that way dogs that are caught straying or harassing or savaging sheep could be traced back to the owner and the owner held accountable and made pay for the damage.  That would teach owners to keep dogs under control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Other chemicals which Senator Fitzgerald referred to and did not dwell on, each of us will have something to say on the issue.  There is a popular perception abroad at this time that chemicals are always dangerous in <Col N="1018" /> food production, that chemicals are always damaging to the environment and that the natural method &mdash; whatever that is &mdash; is better and that all things natural are good.  The facts do not support this. For example, tuberculosis, smallpox and any other human disease one cares to mention, are all natural.  Means of controlling them by putting foreign substances with the aid of a foreign object like a syringe into the human body is entirely unnatural.  But are we going to go without these means?  Are we going to revert back to the natural system and suffer the consequences, as our forefathers did, of uncontrolled contagious diseases?</P>
    <P>We have at present a lot of people promoting the idea of organic food.  That is fine.  If they want organic food and if they are prepared to pay the extra price for it, then by all means they must be catered for.  But they have no right to be pushing their doctrine down the throats of every other body and forcing poor people to pay a much higher price for the food that they need.  Furthermore, and here is the point, without the aid of chemicals we could not possibly feed today's world population.  It is not the use of chemicals that is the problem; it is the abuse of them.  Let me remind this House that this nation lost nearly half its population at one time precisely because it did not have a chemical to control the fungicide <i>Phytophthera infestans.</i>  If we revert back to a situation where we have no chemicals to control weeds, pests, fungicides, diseases and so on, then we would all be in very serious trouble indeed.</P>
    <P>I know there are many people out there who simply will not believe my word but perhaps I could quote a much more eminent personality in support of what I say.  I refer to Professor Norman Borlaug. For his achievement in laying down the groundwork for the Green Revolution Professor Norman Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1970, but his work did not end there.  Today he is a distinguished Professor of Agriculture in Texas A and M University, a consultant to the International Maize and Wheat Improvement <Col N="1019" /> Centre, President of Sasakava Africa Association and Leader of Global 2000 agricultural programmes in Africa.  Dr. Borlaug is also an honorary member or fellow of academies of science in 11 nations and has earned honorary doctorates from 28 universities in 11 countries. What does Dr. Borlaug say about the use of chemicals?  He says:</P>
    <P>Given current scientific knowledge it is my belief that the judicious use of agricultural chemicals, especially chemical fertilizers, is absolutely essential to produce the food needed to feed today's population of 5.3 billion, which is currently increasing at the rate of 88 million per year.</P>
    <P>He goes on to make another observation, which I think is very apt:</P>
    <P>I want to stress that agricultural chemicals and fertilizers are like medicines. When used appropriately they are beneficial, but when used without proper caution they can be deadly.</P>
    <P>I think that is a very apt analogy and one that we should bear in mind.  In this article he makes a case about the necessity to use chemicals in order to feed the world's population.  He said:</P>
    <P>The UN population agency's medium projection is for a world population to reach 6.1 billion by the year 2,000 and 8.2 billion by the year 2025 before stabilising at about ten billion towards the end of the 21st century. As in the past, it is likely that about 98 per cent of the increased food supply needed to feed these growing human numbers must come from the land, especially from grains such as wheat, rice, and maize.</P>
    <P>Here is the nub of the matter.  He concludes:</P>
    <P>Even if current <i>per capita</i> consumption stayed constant, population growth will require that annual world food production expand by 70 per cent over the next 37 years.  However, if diets improved among the poor and <Col N="1020" /> undernourished annual world food demand by 2025 would be as great as 9 billion tonnes, or more than double the 1988 harvest.</P>
    <P>That is fairly sobering kind of information to be getting.  Certainly, those people who are attacking science and technology today would want to reflect on the facts given by Professor Borlaug.  Science and technology are undergoing growing attack by environmentalists, mainly from the affluent nations, who claim that the consumer is being poisened out of existence and who advocate that we abandon the current high yielding agricultural systems and revert to what they call more sustainable lower yielding technologies. Certainly, environmentalists and agriculturalists have a professional and a moral obligation to warn the political, educational and religious leaders of the world about the magnitude and seriousness of the problem regarding arable land, food quality and population growth.  We must also realise that we cannot turn back the clock to the good old 1930s when world population stood at about two billion and few agricultural chemicals and little chemical fertilisers were used.  Professor Borlaug finally finishes his article by saying:</P>
    <P>World peace will not be built on empty stomachs.  Deny farmers today the use of commercial fertilizers and other chemical aids and the world will be doomed, not from poisoning, as some say, but from starvation.  That is the reality.</P>
    <P>To those who say that our food is of inferior quality and that insecticides are poisoning our food, let me first of all remind them that people are living longer now than at any time in the history of mankind.  Of course, medicine has contributed to that.  But if the food is as poisonious as they say, I am afraid we would not be living that long.</P>
    <P>In support of the view that food is more nutritious and healthy now than at any time in history I would like to quote the views of Professor Bruce Ames of the University of California.  Professor Ames is a leading biochemist and the winner of <Col N="1021" /> many prestigious awards including &mdash; and this is the important point for people who are concerned about the chemicals in our food &mdash; many awards for pioneering cancer research, including the prestigious General Motors Cancer Research Foundation Prize in 1983.  In 1985 he won the Tyler Prize, the highest award in the US for environmental achievement.</P>
    <P>What does Professor Ames say about insecticides in food?  Well, he has some astonishing things to say about it.  First, he points out that in the US the number of people under 85 dying from cancers of all types, except lung cancer, fell by 13 per cent between 1950 and 1985 but the incidence of lung cancer has gone up dramatically in the past 30 years and now accounts for roughly 400,000 deaths in the US, or 30 per cent of all cancer cases.</P>
    <P>What does Professor Ames say about pesticides?  He said plants do not have claws or teeth and cannot run away, so they develop their own pesticides to protect themselves from predators, including the human.  Individual plants contain as many as 40 or 50 pesticides accounting for as much as 5 per cent to 10 per cent of the plants total dry weight.  Then he points out &mdash; and this is where people are going overboard about the use of chemicals today and pesticides in particular &mdash; that 99.9 per cent of all the pesticides we are exposed to are natural; in other words, they are produced within the plant for the plant to protect itself. He goes on to quote the plants that have all of these things.  These plants, which we know contain natural carcinogens at levels ranging from a few parts per billion to parts per thousands &mdash; I do not want you to go on a diet, a Chathaoirligh &mdash; include apples, bananas, broccoli, brussels sprouts, carrots, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, cinnamon, cloves, cocoa, coffee, comfrey, fennel, horseradish, mushrooms, mustard, nutmeg, orange juice, parsley and so on.  There is not a food we eat today, apart from sugar, that if we synthesized it in the morning and presented it as something new there is no regulatory authority in the world that would approve of it.  That is the situation. I am not saying that that is wrong.  That <Col N="1022" /> is nature.  That is how natural things are. That is the view of this gentleman, who ought to know what he is talking about, and certainly I tend to agree with him.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that we cannot do without the use of chemicals in food production today.  It is the abuse of them, and not the use of them, that we have to be worried about.  Could you imagine trying to produce potatoes without fungicides?  Could you imagine trying to produce lifestock without anthelementics for stomach worms, hoose, lung worms, lice, ticks and so on?  Some of you will remember the time when we had the warble fly driving our animals crazy. Apart from the economic loss and the lowering of quality of the product, think of the suffering of the poor animals if we did not have the use of these chemicals we have today.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, I fully believe and support the idea that these materials must be used with the utmost care.  I do believe that there is an increasing awareness of this, not only among farmers but among the manufacturers of sprayers and other forms of applicators of the material. These things are extremely expensive and it would be a very foolish farmer who would throw them around liberally to do damage to the environment but also to do damage to his pocket.  We must use them.</P>
    <P>For those people who do not want to use the food they are used on, that is fine, provided they are prepared to pay the extra price for it but let them not try to force that system on the rest of us, which would force poor people to pay a very high price for their food.  To those who argue that there is a growing demand and a big demand for organically produced food, let me remind them that Marks &amp; Spencers, who tried it out, took them off the shelves only a few months ago because they simply were not moving because the price was too high.</P>

      <P>Thank you, Sir, but I was asked by your leader to keep going for longer some time ago.</P>
      <P>We cannot do without these chemicals today.  We have to ensure that they are used carefully.  It is up to the farmers in the first instance, but it is up to those supervising and controlling the operations also to ensure that there is no abuse.  There are many other areas I would like to cover, such as animal waste, silage effluent and damage to the environment in that area which is far greater than the damage caused by chemicals today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OlgaBennett" hpid="Mrs. Bennett Mrs. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to second the motion.  In seeking safeguards from the Minister for Agriculture and Food in relation to the control and use of pesticides and poison there are three main points which should be borne in mind: (1) human safety must be ensured; (2) the protection of preserved wildlife maintained; and (3) the safety of protected mammals, birds and farm animals must also be ensured.  However, is it necessary to use poisonous substances to control wild animals and birds such as foxes, mink and crows?</P>
      <P>The main users of poisonous substances and chemicals in this country are farmers, gun clubs and game keepers to control species and ground nesting game birds.  The existing regulations are covered by the Poisonous Regulations Act, 1982, where a licence is needed from the Garda and must be produced to obtain poisonous substances.  There are various other Acts controlling the use of poison on the land and poison for the control of wildlife.  However, while we welcome the scheme of grants to assist farmers in carrying out pollution control work, the figures regarding the importation of poisonous chemicals indicate to us that the amount of poisonous substances imported into this country would appear to far exceed the amount used in Northern Ireland, which is our nearest and most identifiable comparative user.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past number of years the positive and beneficial aspects of chemicals used has been emphasised on a daily basis <Col N="1024" /> but, as with any new technology, over use and misuse has occurred.  The effects of the poisonous chemicals on fish, birds and other non-target species has indicated that little serious thought is given to the potential long term consequences of pesticides on human health and the environment.  There is no doubt that properly monitored and targeted use of posionous substances can be effective in cases such as, for example, the elimination of known dogs who worry ewes, particularly in the lambing season. However, with the lapse of time it has been proved that the laying of poison is not totally effective and other up-to-date controls &mdash; for example, electric fencing, herding lambing ewes into small paddocks, shooting target species and trapping wild animals &mdash; can be just as effective.  They say the best way to trap mink is with mink traps baited with fish and local wildlife rangers can advise on the best ones to use.  In other countries improved block management has been shown to be more effective than the use of poison in keeping lamb losses down. The removal of carcases is important since it removes one of the major sources of food for hooded crows and foxes.  This keeps the numbers high.</P>
    <P>In calling on the Minister for Agriculture and Food to update and ensure more stringent regulations for the control and use of pesticides and strychnine, let us remind ourselves that Ireland is one of the last European countries to allow the almost unrestricted use of strychnine against wildlife.  The ban on the use of lethal poisons in other countries has not resulted in hardship for farmers.  It has been well demonstrated that threatened species which are put at risk by poisoning can flourish once a ban has been imposed. We have allowed a large part of irreplaceable wildlife heritage to become extinct in Ireland.  It is our duty to protect and manage our environment from these poisonous substances so that they do not have any lasting effect on the environment, which we now wish to keep and enhance for our children.</P>
    <Col N="1025" />
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, noting with concern the increasing threats to the natural environment posed by chemicals and poisonous compounds used in agriculture, and while welcoming the scheme of grants to assist farmers in carrying out pollution control work, calls on the Minister for Agriculture and Food to introduce more stringent regulations to control the use of pesticides and to ban the use of strychnine to ensure human safety and the protection of wildlife.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that at this time in this country anybody would oppose that motion.</P>
      <P>I agree with almost all that has been said from both sides of the House.  I would certainly go along with almost all of what Senator Raftery had to say.</P>
      <P>I am one of those people who is looked on with suspicion when we discuss motions such as this because I am a farmer.  The more progressive and intensive the farmer is, the more he is looked on with suspicion.  I would like to think &mdash; although I am sure my bank manager does not &mdash; that I am one of the more progressive farmers.  I would like to say a word for the farmer.  I am very conscious of the environment and I would say that 99.9 per cent of farmers, be they big or small, intensive or otherwise, are in the same category.  They are very concerned about the environment, even from an economic point of view alone. It is in our interests to ensure that we maintain something which is special to this country, that is, a clean environment and clean food.  I do not believe any of us would intentionally &mdash; I am speaking about farmers &mdash; do anything that would damage that reputation.  As time goes on that reputation is more and more important. Shortly we will be the only island nation in the European Community.  As such, we are removed from the mainland and that has to be advantageous.  Therefore, it is vitally important that we protect the assets we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I agree that with <Col N="1026" /> sprays, pesticides and fungicides or whatever, we have to watch how we handle the situation.  Indeed, economics would prevent us from spraying <i>ad lib.</i>  Up to now there was a certain degree of ignorance among farmers regarding the use of pesticides and fungicides, particularly strychnine.  More education is required in this field.  Regarding strychnine, I would have no trouble whatsoever in supporting a total ban on it.  However, in saying that, I think we should look, as Senator Bennett has done at the reasons farmers in the past felt they had a need to use poisonous substances, because the sheep farmer, for instance, had to prevent the savaging of his flock by foxes, stray dogs, etc.</P>
    <P>Here I would like to home in on the herding of sheep.  It is suggested here that a five strand electric fence can protect lambing ewes and that is true but, unfortunately, the erection of a five-strand electric fence costs a lot of money, or indeed to provide housing for lambing ewes will cost a lot of money &mdash; money that is not available to farmers at this time.  Therefore, we must look at other areas, because those in the lower economic category in agriculture could not afford that type of investment.</P>
    <P>This brings us back to a very thorny question among farmers, that is, the stray dogs.  How many times have we seen on television the savagery committed by marauding dogs.  Even though we had legislation to deal with this problem a few years ago, very little progress has been made in this area.  Here, again, it is a question of education.  There are too many people in this country who have a dog for the sake of having a dog and if one was to ask them tonight where the dog is they would not have a clue.  Until such time as dogs are kept strictly under control we are going to have that difficulty. It would be true to say that marauding dogs are the biggest problem for sheep farmers.  The fox is innocent enough, because there are not enough of them around but the total disregard and total ignorance among people who own dogs and who do not know, or apparently do not care, where the dog is will have <Col N="1027" /> to be taken into account.  It is difficult to know how to deal with this problem. Poison was one way of dealing with it in the past.  I am totally supportive of getting rid of poison because there are too many other dangers involved, but we must tackle this problem.  If we are to get the full support, particularly of small and medium sized farmers that aspect will have to be tackled immediately.</P>
    <P>I know my time is short, so I would like to pass on to pesticides and fungicides.  I heartily support the motion because of the growing concern about the indiscriminate use of chemicals in agriculture and the fear that these compounds may find their way into the food chain, particularly into drinking water.  The big drawback about pesticides is that they can be toxic at very low levels.  This is something that cannot be over-emphasised.  This is the reason the EC has set an extremely low maximum admissible concentration in drinking water at 0.1 parts per billion for each pesticide or a maximum total of 0.5 parts per billion.  The easiest pathway for pesticides to get into water is through careless handling at filling time with spraying equipment or through accidental spillages or indeed overflows.  In many countries operators have had to attend classes for a minimum number of hours and pass a test to qualify as licensed handlers.  I would say at this stage that it is important that our operators are trained in this field.  If you get a licence to drive a tractor it appears to give you a licence to do everything else willy-nilly. All of us know &mdash; all of us have seen it drawing across the countryside &mdash; of farmers washing out their sprayers into rivers probably oblivious of the fact that it is causing untold damage.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there are two lines of education we must follow here.  First, we must educate the farmer as to the dangers of washing out a sprayer.  The concentration under EC limits is so very small that the tiniest drop of the spray getting into the water can contaminate an enormous volume.  Secondly, we need to train farmers on how to handle spraying equipment, how to handle spillages <Col N="1028" /> or overflows.  We would be doing a good day's work if we asked Teagasc to take a greater interest in that aspect.</P>
    <P>While the use of pesticides in accordance with manufacturers' recommendations usually ensures that there are no residues in the crops at the time of harvesting, there is always a certain amount of sprayed pesticide which gets into the soil.  In some soil it is possible for the pesticides to be leached by rainfall into the ground water and into drinking water.  The researchers at Johnstown Castle Research Centre, County Wexford, my own constituency, have been studying what happens to pesticides in Irish soils for a number of years.  They have discovered that they are easily leached through some of our soils.  In other soils they are absorbed and can remain there undegraded for years.  For example, Johnstown Castle researchers have shown that DDT is still found in soils undegraded for years.  For example, researchers at Johnstown Castle have shown that DDT is still found in soils in County Wexford, more than 12 years after its use was banned and it was taken off the market.  That gives us a fair idea of the difficulty we face.</P>
    <P>This is a good example of how important it is that these kinds of studies are continued so that we can understand all the processes involved in the movement of contaminants from earth to soil and from soil to water, from soil to plants and from soil to animals.  All these processes are important ways in which pesticides can get into the foodchain for people as well as for animals and wildlife.  There is a big move nowadays to find more natural ways to control plant diseases without using so many chemicals and we all hope that these studies will be successful.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that Johnstown Castle has been earmarked as the centre for the Environmental Protection Agency.  This motion is timely.  The Environmental Protection Agency is timely because in Johnstown Castle the work is ongoing.  An expertise has been built up there and it would be a great pity at this stage if for any reason that were lost.  We have a long way to go.  I believe, <Col N="1029" /> as do all speakers that there is the big question of education and also the need for more stringent control, not the elimination, of the use of pesticides and that strychnine should be totally banned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. We have to look at this in a very balanced and reasonable way.  One of the problems I find normally in environmental debates is that you get two sides with totally opposing views each looking for total victory for its view.  I have been involved in the agriculture scene in one way or another for over 17 years.  I was manager of a hill sheep farm and I also was manager of a co-op store which sells pesticides, fungicides and various types of animal drugs.</P>
      <P>The nonchalant, casual attitude that people have towards chemicals amazes me.  I have noticed a slight change in the last few years but traditionally people had no fear or worry about how they used chemicals.  They were not particularly worried about adhering strictly to dosage or recommended usage levels.  They tended to be very careless about their own protection regarding face masks, etc.  This always amazes me because if you mention the word &ldquo;radiation&rdquo;, no matter how low the dosage, people will break out in a cold sweat but the same people would eat their meals without washing their hands after using chemicals.</P>
      <P>I have always been aware of the inherent danger of and the care needed when using chemicals.  Chemicals are necessary for control.  I do not think anybody in his rational senses would propose that we cease to use chemicals in either farming or in any other facet of life.  It is very important that chemicals be used for maximum effect with minimum dosage and any hazards to man or to the environment be reduced as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few years ago, we purchased a new type of sheep dip that came on the market.  We had it on the shelf for five years until eventually one customer of ours who happened to be an agricultural graduate and perhaps had a more open mind towards these matters purchased <Col N="1030" /> the whole lot over a period of two years and used it.  It was subsequently proven in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> that that dip was the most effective dip on the market. One may question why farmers would not use it.  In my view, there was one very simple reason and that was that the dosage recommended in volume terms was very small.  It was ingrained in the minds of the ordinary farmer that low dosage meant little effect.  Of course we know that that is not true but here is an example of one of the misconceptions that we have to overcome.</P>
    <P>Sheep farming has been mentioned. Suggestions have been made about the uses of fences and bringing sheep in for lambing.  It has been found that the most efficient type of hill sheep farming is the one where weak ewes are brought in to be fed and the rest are left out on the hill. That poses certain problems, for example, at lambing time.  I am talking about areas where there is low land pasture that could carry a large amount of sheep.  Therefore, we have to address ourselves to the problem of how we control predators.  We have to accept, as I think any good, self-respecting hill farmer will accept, that he will have losses if he wants to maxmise his profit.  That is inevitable.  What we are talking about is the control of these losses, not their elimination.  One has to look at methods of controlling foxes and, at times, pine martens, although I see that they are a protected species, and particularly the grey crow.  This can be done without the use of poisons such as strychnine if one accepts that the other alternative is to use such methods as hunting and paying bounties to people who kill foxs.  It is impossible to have it both ways; to say on one hand that you will not allow hunting or control of that type and on the other hand, you do not want the use of chemicals.  Nature is cruel and to those who say that fox hunting by sheep farmers should be banned I ask do they accept that it is also cruel that lambs are killed?</P>
    <P>I have no problem in supporting the banning of strychnine because it is a very dangerous substance and it is environmentally hostile, as long as it is accepted <Col N="1031" /> that other methods of control must be exercised.  Similarly with the grey crow. There are methods of trapping grey crows which are effective.  We used different systems of baiting them and as long as this is acceptable I would have no problem with banning the use of strychnine.</P>
    <P>As regards control, most people talk about control at the point of sale but that is not where the problem arises.  Farmers must have access to various pesticides, drugs, etc.  We must talk about control at the point of sale for certain dangerous substances, packaging and so on.  We must also talk about educating the farmer to ensure that he uses these substances according to the recommended levels.</P>
    <P>The scandal of deaths from the careless use of paraquat or gramoxone also has to be addressed.  There must be very stringent control to ensure that these types of substances are not be left around unsecured.  We would have to put control not on the seller but on the end user. There should be obligation on farmers to dispose of dangerous substances and not leave them in unsecure places.</P>
    <P>Packaging is very important.  The relative dangers of different products must be clearly outlined and easily understood usage levels must be used.  Some substances are relatively harmless.  Some substances used in excess of the dosage would not cause too much harm but there are other substances which are potentially very dangerous and similarly with the use of various fungicides and sprays. Where there is danger it should be mandatory to state quite clearly that face protection should be used to protect the operator from these substances.</P>
    <P>Molaim an rún seo mar creidim gur ábhar tábhachtach é.  Tá an comhshaol, an nadúr agus tuath na hÉireann i gceist.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion before the House.  It is timely.  Our wildlife could be badly destroyed if we do not take protective action.  Our good clean environment is the envy of Europe and we want to keep it that way.</P>
      <P>Strychnine should be withdrawn.  I had the experience of seeing a dog poisoned and I can say it gives a very cruel death. For that alone it should be banned.  It is very dangerous and its chain reaction makes it doubly dangerous.</P>
      <P>I was a grown boy before I saw a fox and I did not see grey crows very much until the last 20 years.  Landlords employed gamekeepers full-time and they controlled vermin.  They shot the surplus magpies and grey crows and they were controlled in that way.  They were experts.  It is a pity that their knowledge was not recorded because they had a wealth of natural experience on how to handle such affairs.  If a fox raided a henhouse in my young days it would be the talk of the parish for a week.  We see foxes now in gardens in urban areas.  We have got rid of a lot of our fauna which provided food for some of our wildlife.  I will leave that for another day but that is where the trouble started.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Irish Wildlife Service for doing a very good job on a shoestring budget.  If we are really serious about control we should bring back the gamekeeper.  That would solve a lot of problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers are not the only people who use a lot of poison.  I understand gun clubs also use it.  Many gun clubs are to be congratulated for having organised shoots but a massive shoot for one day is not the answer.  We should say a special thanks to our county councils because <Col N="1033" /> there should be less need now for poisoning since every council has a dog control unit.  They collect stray dogs and ensure that dogs are licensed.  It is not only stray dogs that do damage.  I have known very good sheepdogs to get loose and kill.  They are very clever.  They wash themselves in the river on the way back and they arrive home spotlessly clean after killing.  Very often men who own dogs will not admit, unless it is proved to them, that their dogs did the killing.</P>
    <P>We do not know what damage we are doing by the use of poisons because it was 20 years before we realised the damage DDT caused.  Scientists and professionals cause more trouble than they cure.  Many chemicals and poisons would not be in existence only for those people.  When something happens they blame the farmers but who gives the substances to them?  They invent them.  If these were not on the market we would still have good crops and a clean and better environment. As well as strychnine, there is alphachloralose, nevinphos and endorin. They are also very dangerous poisons which we should be concerned about and which should be controlled.  Great havoc is caused to game birds, such as pheasants. One magpie will destroy a whole nest of eggs, maybe eight or ten birds will be gone in a flash.  The same thing applies to the fox.  He will kill a bird on the nest. We are losing a lot of our wildlife, game birds and insects, etc., which are part of our environment.  The corncrake was always heard singing in the fall.  As we do not hear the corncrake now I presume it is extinct.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many more species of birds are extinct.  I miss many birds that I used to see.  The yellowhammer is becoming very scarce now.  I have not seen the grey thrush around.  I have been watching out for those birds but I do not see them.  Chemicals like all drugs can kill and cure.  As they say about an auctioneer, he will rob from you and for you. It is the same with chemicals; they will kill you and kill for you.</P>
    <P>Chemicals should be controlled.  Too much spray is used at present.  We put far too many chemicals on the land and they <Col N="1034" /> are getting into water sources.  The farmer is not the only culprit, although you would think nobody was using chemicals but the farmer.  Chemicals are sprayed on weeds along roadsides, in gardens and on country walks.  We should put this into perspective.  We hear people talking about pollution and the first person to be attacked is the farmer.  He is not the biggest culprit at all.  There is pollution from septic tanks.  There was a time when, if you had a septic tank, you only let in the effluent from the toilet but some smart boy in the Department said, &ldquo;Not at all, let everything into it&rdquo;.  Some other smart boys advertised on television, &ldquo;Kill every known germ&rdquo;.  We expect a tank to be septic and we put in every antispetic we can into it.  What do you expect to get out the other end but pollution? We are killing the septic ingredient which would gobble up and purify the waste.  I have had a septic tank for over 35 years and I have never had to touch it because nothing went into it but waste from the toilet.  All septic tanks pose a threat.  Do not think for one minute that the farmer is the only one who is causing the problem.</P>
    <P>I thank the Irish Wildbird Conservancy for their very informative leaflet.  People will find it enlightening.  I am pleased to support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. I realise that it has fairly wide terms of reference in so far as it calls on the Minister for Agriculure and Food to introduce more stringent regulations to control the use of pesticides and ban the use of strychnine to ensure human safety and protect wildlife.  Most people who live in rural Ireland realise that there must be a balance that it is becoming much more difficult to keep the balance. Certainly I have practical, hands-on-farm knowledge.  I see the value of improving the environment.  Our clean environment will be a very valuable asset in the future. We must educate farmers and others who are in danger of causing pollution about the problem and about modern facilities to deal with it.  One section of the community are totally engrossed in how to <Col N="1035" /> protect our wildlife but could be blind to the fact that a young lamb is lying on the side of the road half dead.  There must be a balance, I come from a farming family and we have always had the problem of watching lambs in the lambing season because the fox is a very clever little animal.</P>
      <P>I would like to know how successful anybody has ever been in poisoning foxes.  It is not that easy.  I would like to talk to somebody who has experience of this.  I would like to see the poisoning of a fox in operation.  It is nearly impossible. The fox follows scent.  Grey crows and foxes are two of the most dangerous predators and there must be a way of controlling them.</P>
      <P>Farmers have a problem.  The sheep industry is a very valuable one.  People look on it as a sideline but, it is far from it.  It is much more valuable than the fishing industry.  That might come as a surprise to many people but that is the reality.  Is balance important or have people adopted an approach that only sees the protection of all species of birds and wildlife?  Does the belief prevail that nature will balance itself?  This is what we are encouraged to accept.  I have seen areas where chemicals have been used. It is well known that tendering salt is used on meat and if, in the course of using it, it fell on your shoes, it would bum out the toe of your shoe.  Millions of pounds have been spent on research.  I hope that continues and that it produces results, advice and guidelines.  It is so vast an area that we have to be continually working at it.  We have to take into consideration the two aspects of the problem those who have to survive in industry and those who have to provide food for the whole population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it difficult to try to make a contribution in a very short time.  This is a worthwhile motion to bring forward.  We would like the Minister to take the motion aboard so that we will have an opportunity to discuss the matter further. It is so important for the whole area that <Col N="1036" /> I ask the Minister to take a very balanced view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that the Minister has come into the House to respond to the motion.  That in itself is an encouragement to me in so far as I believe that she is aware of the problem and I am most grateful to her.</P>
      <P>I am one of the people who was very proud of our EC Presidency from January to June last year.  I look at the aspirations and hopes that we have in the account that we published of the Presidency of the European Community.  The Educational Council met during the Presidency on 31 May and the following was agreed:</P>
      <P>A Resolution regarding the integration of children and young people with disabilities into ordinary systems of education; conclusions on the preparation of a new Convention concerning the European Schools; Conclusions on the enhanced treatment of Equality of Education Opportunity for girls and boys in the internal in-service training of teachers; Conclusions on regular meetings of senior officials in the education sector aimed at improving mutual understanding of the various educational systems in the Community as well as discussion of policy issues and problems which are of common concern to member states with a view to improving the quality of educational systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That in itself is quite an important proclamation to make.  In my Border county we have a particular problem which the Minister is aware of.  My motion is to ask her to expedite the harmonisation of all <Col N="1037" /> the difficulties and all the problems that prevail.  I will quote from the Minister's letter dated 30 November last:</P>
    <P>One of the main problems here is that a candidate must have obtained a prescribed success in a Leaving Certificate examination of the Department. Successes in equivalent examinations do not meet the requirement.</P>
    <P>That is merely the bottom line in that no matter how high an achiever you are in an A or O level you cannot get a scholarship. We have many highly qualified students who are being educated in the North of Ireland and if their parents reside in the South they cannot get a scholarship.  That is a major problem now.</P>
    <P>On the other side, the Northern authorities apply a residential clause in determining the award of grants.  Students resident in County Donegal, or in any other county in the South, cannot avail of maintenance grants from the appropriate authorities in the North of Ireland.  We have this anomaly.  I find it difficult to understand how we will achieve a common policy for education if we cannot solve what appears to many of us to be a very small problem on the ground.</P>
    <P>One of the aspirations we have expressed is that we will have a mutual recognition of diploma courses in Europe.  This has been applauded and accepted by everybody.  It is one of the achievements that we are very hopeful we can implement in the very near future. If we have any hope of making progress and have common recognition of diploma courses, it is not too much to expect that we will have harmonisation between the North and South on the island.  That is merely the bottom line in my motion.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for her response to my personal letters.  I also wrote to Commissioner Bruce Millan.  The Minister has those, so I will not delay in reading them.  My vocational committee in Donegal met the Minister as far back as 16 December 1987 and put the case to her.  I also made a further submission on 20 October 1989.  I believe that anything <Col N="1038" /> that I can say here in furtherance of what has already been said and submitted to the Minister would be duplication.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that I have had an opportunity to say this in the House.  I accept that the Minister is aware of the prevailing difficulties.  I hope that she will, in the very near future, implement the necessary legislation to remove what is a very difficult situation for many parents who are living in the South whose children are students at a second level school in the North of Ireland and who if they get a scholarship, are deprived of support.</P>
    <P>It works both ways.  Already in the Border counties we have an indication that there is a readiness in the Department of Education in the North to resolve the difficulties.  This is so necessary because in a Border area we have to complement our services, whether it is education, health or whatever other services are there.  We are now centralising the services and improving them.  It is not too much to expect that we have recognition and we resolve this problem which is very important to a number of people.  This comes about because families have to change if they are in an area where it is dangerous or for some other reason.  If they decide to live on the southern side of the Border and their children stay at schools in the North this presents a serious problem.  It works both ways.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take this on board and to expedite, if she possibly can, a solution to this perhaps minor problem which affects hundreds of children from Dundalk down to Moville right along the Border counties.  I appeal to her strongly to implement the necessary legislation to resolve this problem.  I believe I am pushing an open door.  The Minister is aware of the problem.  She will have difficulties in introducing the legislation and implementing the necessary steps but I hope the motion here will encourage her. I thank the Minister for being kind enough to come to the Seanad to respond to my motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator McGowan <Col N="1039" /> for affording me the opportunity to come to talk to the Seanad about this matter. Of course, it is of importance.  The fine aspirations which the Senator read out, which were the objectives of our Presidency, dwell on that cohesion which is needed.  Briefly, there is a problem and it is a two-way problem, for the authorities in the Republic and in Northern Ireland.  Today the Northern Ireland Minister for Education was down here and we discussed matters of mutual interest in education.</P>
      <P>There was a particular case of Senator McGowan's but he is taking it on the general priniciple, not on one case, which is the correct procedure.  It was where a young person had a very good final examination and the results were not acceptable here for the grant purposes because our 1968 higher education grant legislation specifies Leaving Certificate of the Department of Education.  When Senator McGowan raised the query with me by letter and by vocal representation, I had my office check out with the Attorney General's Office if, in fact, the interpretation of Leaving Certificate could be leaving examination which would be the A levels or the equivalent in other countries.  The advice we got is that, no, it could not be taken as that because of the words of the Department of Education because that is our relevant Department &mdash; it is Education and Science in the UK &mdash; and that it would require an amendment of the 1968 Act. That is, in effect, what Senator McGowan has asked me here to set about doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which has just been issued there are various recommendations with regard to third level requirements, <Col N="1040" /> namely, mature people wishing to come back into third level education and the income eligibility of such persons.  It is quite obvious that it is slightly ridiculous now to take into account the income of their parents when many of the applicants would be in their late twenties or thirties. That also would require an amendment of the Act, as perhaps another provision in that section would do.  I propose to look at that section of the programme to see what amendments are necessary to the 1968 Act and then to proceed about putting it to Government and getting the legislation drafted and implemented. Senators will be aware that that does not happen overnight, much as we might think it would.</P>
    <P>The case of this young person, the specific catalyst for the case to be looked at in a general fashion, has been instrumental in getting the Senator to highlight the matter and it will proceed from here. In fact, it is a clear example of democracy in action.  I suppose they were constitutents who came to the Senator and he came to me, I am here in the Seanad discussing the matter and at some stage there will be legislation to amend it.  The process may be long and long-winded but it has a very real purpose and it works.  I cannot say when because you fight your way to advance legislation.  I have Bills dealing with the colleges coming in this term or next and they will be the first priority in education.  Then there is the Education Act but it will form part of my legislative programme.  I would like to thank the Senator for bringing the matter to my attention.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 7 February 1991.</P>
